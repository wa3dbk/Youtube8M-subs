 hello friends of intermediate t friends of 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.559
 intermediate point mx as they are I am 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.389
 luis gg and we are here testing and 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.240
 doing a little demonstration of 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.150
 how is it that the store of 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.100
 windows phones applications and about 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.560
 all the ideas sections and also 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.240
 the sections of nokia we are going to do 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.660
 this tour or base so that you can 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.519
 know we are seeing the nokia lumia 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.430
 920 which already has the windows version 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.140
 phone 8 you can see here the menu 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.060
 that I have configured with the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.710
 applications that I use the most 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.690
 can see how I have configured the 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.399
 different mosaics there are some mosaics 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.010
 active here for example the mosaic of 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.949
 facebook is to expand you can 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.390
 you can notice it and see some of the 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.510
 notifications that are reaching me 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.399
 but we can here keep going see 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.340
 the theme of xbox with the games part there 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:01.059
 you see for example my avatar on xbox the 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.309
 part of let's say xbox music and how is 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.720
 conformed some characteristics or 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.970
 some applications that have to do 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.549
 with photography and so on but let's go 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.800
 to the part that interests us in this case 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.500
 which is the one that has to do with the 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.500
 applications we go directly to this 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.960
 icon where you can see how it is 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.630
 conformed the store in this case we see 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.920
 ideas store that is let's say the 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.660
 applications that have to do with 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.950
 telcel in this case 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.650
 of the sel has launched some applications 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.330
 which is recommending and some 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.790
 applications that we can see in the case 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.070
 of telcel is the messenger of ideas 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.840
 music and the consumer that is a 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.180
 application that several of you have 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.220
 order in which we have spoken in these 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.770
 intermediate spaces but that also 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.960
 now available in the windows version 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.700
 phone 8 we can see others the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.560
 applications there are some games plants 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.220
 vs zombies some games 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.540
 of football in the end are some 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.700
 recommendations the truth is that the 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.680
 catalog is small but I think that in 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.570
 this case there are two applications that are 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.939
 important for telcel and that are being 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.740
 turning as in a let's say as in 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.860
 a must and in this case if it is the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.380
 consumption and the music ideas let's go now 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.230
 to the theme of nokia collection you 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.120
 can see here some applications that 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.400
 number one are applications that are 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.720
 recommended by nokia or who have tried 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.209
 the specialists of nokia or 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.010
 applications that they themselves have 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.510
 developed or have paid for the 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.010
 development of them here by 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.190
 example we can games like go for 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.650
 What is the publisher realized? 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.360
 corporation here we also see asphalt 7 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.489
 what is there is gameloft is a title of 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.920
 gameloft there are some applications 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.450
 angry birds here for example the amazing 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.280
 spider-man that is also from gameloft 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.739
 some other applications nokia music 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.989
 that is also the music system of 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.459
 nokia here the whole chain of 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.989
 applications that are applications that 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.450
 they have to do with location with 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.850
 maps with recommendation of sites in 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.560
 Real time finally for the vaquita with 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.920
 a very important application in inverse 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.720
 it's way 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.030
 is an Indian that in this case the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.890
 Publisher is also Nokia so you 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.500
 you can see all this series of 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.660
 applications that are supported very 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.090
 close by nokia and a half for example a 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.910
 great blockbuster road something is a 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.520
 of the applications that nokia support for 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.739
 that is also within this 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.360
 platform if we go for example here to 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.540
 the menus you can see I do not know 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.120
 opinions can see images in this 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.420
 there is only one image and good 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.920
 we apply related to the with this 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.959
 title in such a way that you remove it 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.670
 like the rosón team you can find 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.459
 some applications that also you 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.470
 can beat for the way in which 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.720
 are plants can see something that is very 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.610
 important to see besides ideas torino 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.130
 collections see how that is 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.230
 conformed in a general way the store and 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.239
 you can see here three menus here 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.220
 start first run with a 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.480
 main recommendation in this case in 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.760
 the store is recommending the 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.530
 cinépolis application after we can 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.600
 see the applications and all 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.670
 applications here three recommendations 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.140
 main that they are us the group 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.730
 editorial is making available 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.500
 of the user 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.909
 the same thing happens in games three games and 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.459
 after the menu of all the games 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.470
 music three recommendations and all the 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.599
 music and good we return to the menu 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.180
 main but good let's go to the part of 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:20.419
 applications where the first thing we see 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.460
 it's the same as a main application and 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.380
 after different menus the most 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.270
 popular free the most popular with 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.610
 payment the most recent with better 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.110
 qualification and collections in 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.110
 collections for example we can 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.050
 find different movie themes here 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.300
 for example finalists of next up to be 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.010
 which is a platform in which they put 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.960
 disposition or contest envelopes 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.850
 applications and here are the best 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.160
 applications that have to do with 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.229
 Motorsports with money and budget 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.630
 applications that have active tiles 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.729
 but what do they have to eventually 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.710
 different subjects of which you can 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.840
 make use and take here but it itches 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.880
 photography venues finally we return 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.620
 here to the menu we see the different 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.970
 music performance categories 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.490
 children's productivity tool 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:08.600
 family et cetera there are different options 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.300
 there are some the most important ones we are going to 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.040
 so you can also see this 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.190
 another menu setting where you 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.780
 can see let's say another submenu 2 are 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.420
 all the applications we see the most 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.330
 popular the most recent the most 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:26.780
 Popular payment and good with better 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.090
 qualification something that is very useful inside 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.810
 Windows platform is that you 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.270
 you can say that they tried the 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.550
 application before buying it something that 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.540
 let's check here for example is 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.190
 amazing alex let's see if it is not there 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.750
 it's already been downloaded we're going with 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.140
 another application so that you can 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.140
 watch 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.590
 in this case for example we are the 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.080
 road this application has a price of 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.780
 15 pesos but for a limited time I 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.080
 I can try it before buying it 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.850
 I can press this button and without 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.190
 put my card data still 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.389
 credit I can download the person 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.479
 for example it tells me that it is already 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:11.880
 downloading so I can evaluate it 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:14.940
 in this case we are seeing that maybe 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.040
 this one is going to download 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.990
 but that is one of the great advantages 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.720
 that has the windows platform that 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:26.270
 we can test the applications 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:28.890
 just moments before we can 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.930
 invest something in them while the 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.420
 platform in that sense is very noble 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.940
 they still do not ask me good how good 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.160
 the work that I see so effective in this 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.900
 moment and what I can tell you here 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.580
 because we see how it is waiting for a 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.410
 Wi-Fi connection to download but 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.640
 Well now it's ready for you to 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.400
 unloaded at the moment when I 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.710
 want it the interesting part is that 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.140
 maybe some applications are missing because 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.140
 because they have to conform to the format 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.870
 who has microsoft for his platform 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.250
 mobile the theme of the mosaics the way 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.430
 in which the menus are structured 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:04.290
 is very peculiar to windows and let's say that 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.880
 There have been pickets cost them some 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.160
 work to be able to adapt but well this 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.680
 it was a simple journey within the 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.150
 windows phone apps store 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.590
 let's hope you liked it and good 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:17.000
 leave us your comments I am Luis 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.000
 higher we continue
