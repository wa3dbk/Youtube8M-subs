00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
not to this scale and this amount of

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.740 
not to this scale and this amount of
detail<00:00:20.340> basically<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.420> guy<00:00:21.570> wanted<00:00:23.750> the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
detail basically the guy wanted the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.380 
detail basically the guy wanted the
branch<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.590> extend<00:00:25.980> from<00:00:26.070> his<00:00:26.220> bicep<00:00:26.789> all<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
branch to extend from his bicep all the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.419 
branch to extend from his bicep all the
way<00:00:27.539> over<00:00:28.140> his<00:00:28.230> shoulder<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> back

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.519 
way over his shoulder and to the back
where<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.880> Raven<00:00:30.359> will<00:00:30.480> be<00:00:30.599> placed<00:00:30.840> but

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
where the Raven will be placed but

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.139 
where the Raven will be placed but
because<00:00:31.830> I'm<00:00:32.009> somewhat<00:00:32.579> limited<00:00:32.940> by<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
because I'm somewhat limited by the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.880 
because I'm somewhat limited by the
amount<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.719> space<00:00:33.870> i<00:00:33.930> have<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> page<00:00:34.500> i'm

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
amount of space i have on the page i'm

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.650 
amount of space i have on the page i'm
gonna<00:00:35.130> leave<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> branch<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> tattoo<00:00:36.239> guy

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
gonna leave the branch to the tattoo guy

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.810 
gonna leave the branch to the tattoo guy
because<00:00:37.079> technically<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.920> his<00:00:38.040> job<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.550> do

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
because technically it's his job to do

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.330 
because technically it's his job to do
it<00:00:39.000> mostly<00:00:39.690> these<00:00:39.870> tattoos<00:00:40.440> Sal<00:00:40.739> drawings<00:00:41.190> you

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
it mostly these tattoos Sal drawings you

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.549 
it mostly these tattoos Sal drawings you
can't<00:00:41.579> really<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:41.969> paper<00:00:42.840> efficiently

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
can't really do on paper efficiently

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.490 
can't really do on paper efficiently
because<00:00:43.730> you<00:00:44.730> know<00:00:44.820> most<00:00:45.480> artists<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.320> do

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
because you know most artists that do

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.619 
because you know most artists that do
tattoos<00:00:46.950> draw<00:00:47.579> directly<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> skin<00:00:48.390> when

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
tattoos draw directly on the skin when

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.729 
tattoos draw directly on the skin when
they're<00:00:48.780> about<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.140> something<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.469> wraps

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
they're about to do something that wraps

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.920 
they're about to do something that wraps
around<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.520> can't<00:00:51.030> know<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.480> thickness

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
around so I can't know what thickness

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.040 
around so I can't know what thickness
this<00:00:52.289> guy's<00:00:52.559> hands<00:00:53.039> would<00:00:53.489> have<00:00:53.699> or<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.960> know

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
this guy's hands would have or you know

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.720 
this guy's hands would have or you know
how<00:00:55.230> wide<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.649> back<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.160> or<00:00:56.340> anything<00:00:56.489> like

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
how wide is back is or anything like

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.970 
how wide is back is or anything like
that<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.149> I'm<00:00:57.870> gonna<00:00:58.050> deal<00:00:58.320> strictly<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that so I'm gonna deal strictly with the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.209 
that so I'm gonna deal strictly with the
Raven<00:00:59.399> now<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.719> type<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.469> pose<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
Raven now this is a type of pose or a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.880 
Raven now this is a type of pose or a
motif<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.850> appears<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.680> google<00:01:04.680> images

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
motif that appears on google images

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
motif that appears on google images
quite<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> lot<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.180> was<00:01:06.390> kind<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.630> surprised

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
quite a lot so I was kind of surprised

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.480 
quite a lot so I was kind of surprised
that<00:01:07.140> someone<00:01:07.320> would<00:01:07.560> come<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.950> me<00:01:08.100> wanting<00:01:08.430> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
that someone would come to me wanting to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.060 
that someone would come to me wanting to
have<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.630> idea<00:01:09.930> drawn<00:01:10.260> because<00:01:10.650> basically

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
have that idea drawn because basically

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.330 
have that idea drawn because basically
you<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.610> grab<00:01:11.900> an<00:01:12.900> image<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.350> Google<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.100> have

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
you can grab an image of Google and have

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.240 
you can grab an image of Google and have
the<00:01:14.460> same<00:01:14.640> thing<00:01:14.960> this<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.140> why<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.380> decided<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the same thing this is why I decided to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.780 
the same thing this is why I decided to
go<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:18.170> non<00:01:19.170> general<00:01:20.009> pose<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.610> guess

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
go with a non general pose I guess

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.469 
go with a non general pose I guess
something<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.240> bit<00:01:21.390> more<00:01:22.070> dynamic<00:01:23.070> or<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
something a bit more dynamic or just a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.359 
something a bit more dynamic or just a
little<00:01:24.509> bit<00:01:24.869> different<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:25.860> most<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
little bit different because most of the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.390 
little bit different because most of the
Ravens<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.090> are<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.890> internet<00:01:29.250> are

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
Ravens that are on on the internet are

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.460 
Ravens that are on on the internet are
kind<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:30.689> sitting<00:01:31.020> there<00:01:31.049> not<00:01:31.409> doing

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
kind of just sitting there not doing

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.350 
kind of just sitting there not doing
much<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.920> anything<00:01:32.100> they're<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.180> very

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
much of anything they're not very

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.679 
much of anything they're not very
dynamic<00:01:33.900> not<00:01:34.049> very<00:01:34.290> scary<00:01:34.890> or<00:01:35.360> creepy<00:01:36.360> looking

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
dynamic not very scary or creepy looking

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.969 
dynamic not very scary or creepy looking
as<00:01:36.840> Ravens<00:01:37.259> usually<00:01:37.650> are<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:39.680> yeah<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.920> mean

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
as Ravens usually are so yeah I mean

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.710 
as Ravens usually are so yeah I mean
there's<00:01:41.220> not<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:41.759> much<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> talk<00:01:42.329> about<00:01:42.479> i

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
there's not really much to talk about i

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.609 
there's not really much to talk about i
can<00:01:42.899> tell<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.079> guys<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.320> I've<00:01:43.409> been<00:01:43.470> doing
