00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
I always think about like what Jesus

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.640 
I always think about like what Jesus
would<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.720> everybody's<00:01:13.409> relationship

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
would do and everybody's relationship

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.039 
would do and everybody's relationship
with<00:01:14.100> God<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.760> personal<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.450> know<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.840> so

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
with God is so personal you know it's so

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.399 
with God is so personal you know it's so
one<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.799> one-on-one<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.939> direct<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:19.110> I

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
one and one-on-one so direct that I

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.390 
one and one-on-one so direct that I
think<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.799> that's<00:01:19.950> really<00:01:20.130> what<00:01:20.340> people

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
think that that's really what people

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.730 
think that that's really what people
should<00:01:20.790> focus<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> child

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
should focus on so if you have a child

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.280 
should focus on so if you have a child
who<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.970> gay<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.810> makes<00:01:24.990> you
