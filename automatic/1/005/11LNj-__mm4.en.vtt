00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.620
 and above need 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.980
 hello everyone my name is bone 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.900
 name is max brandt we just 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.460
 watched nid fo speed speed 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.189
 cinema center rush for what he 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.670
 bake thank you very much yes oil oil 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.850
 need for speed thirst here thirst for speed 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.250
 let's say the movie is really very 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.489
 predictably very bad in terms of 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.800
 intrigue in terms of decoupling but another 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.480
 country if you don't look at all if 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.790
 you can film about half a year 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.159
 year then you rate it ok there 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.309
 good movie quality action 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:52.040
 good but in terms of you are so cultural 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.350
 values â€‹â€‹are values â€‹â€‹art is not a reason 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.690
 not really up to the unity that I 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.699
 really enjoyed it to the races themselves 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.070
 made awesome by started right here 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.440
 very captivated i feel like 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.650
 as if i play on these wheelbarrows so 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.590
 awesome but in terms of plot but banal 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.549
 full utterly predictable film from 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.830
 start to finish 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.479
 again in the heroes of the problem for what 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.970
 starts racing 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.920
 naturally he has all sorts of 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.770
 obstacles there is an antagonist of some kind 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.560
 who is also a good racer and so on 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.040
 Jesse Pinkman his girlfriend iphone 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.630
 call it gram in principle quite good 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.310
 Here are all the ladies themselves more special and 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.840
 I have nothing to say 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.810
 also such a movie was that if you 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.070
 looked at the body in shelling all 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.350
 known all similar films to watch 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.020
 the film is the same but if with 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.720
 Mars squeezing with the forecast he's afterburner 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.180
 new then for that is punch aeg 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.750
 turned out to be captivity worth it was new 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.670
 branch so let's say the movie because after all 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.710
 hinges price from to 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.150
 but this one is already this repetition of all-all-all 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.400
 racing I think with the movie save fees 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.260
 only the names of the systems were not down you 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.000
 spots for some kind of just super race but 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.220
 no one went at all 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.090
 battle sleeps my favorite game even even 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.650
 Jesse pinkman wouldn't get out why 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.510
 mediocre movie but what to do 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:21.349
 although we are engaged from us right now for sure 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.799
 no, we are right now so ordinary 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.599
 definitely not thank you big movie center killed 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.150
 thanks, his blogging is great 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:34.459
 pastime though the movie could be 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.849
 and better but I am not dependent on them all 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.849
 bye everyone 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.099
 he
