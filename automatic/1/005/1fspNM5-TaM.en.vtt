I<00:00:06.540> haven't<00:00:06.839> talked<00:00:07.080> about<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.470> my<00:00:07.589> knowledge

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
I haven't talked about to my knowledge

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.870 
I haven't talked about to my knowledge

and that is chain rattles now granted to

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.980

begin with in the beginning of a match

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.110 
begin with in the beginning of a match
when<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.500> do<00:00:13.710> an<00:00:14.070> initial<00:00:14.370> grapple<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:14.969> go

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
when you do an initial grapple you go

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.029 
when you do an initial grapple you go
into<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.660> rock-paper-scissors<00:00:16.049> sort<00:00:16.949> on

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.310 
into the rock-paper-scissors sort on
mode<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.490> then<00:00:17.640> feel<00:00:18.359> your<00:00:18.570> way<00:00:18.660> out<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.170> we

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
mode and then feel your way out of it we

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.840 
mode and then feel your way out of it we
damage<00:00:19.710> stuff<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.300> which<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.480> good<00:00:21.740> but

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
damage stuff like that which is good but

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.880 
damage stuff like that which is good but
when<00:00:23.850> they<00:00:24.029> become<00:00:24.180> gloppy<00:00:24.660> or<00:00:25.529> when<00:00:25.769> that

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
when they become gloppy or when that

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.240 
when they become gloppy or when that
phase<00:00:26.580> goes<00:00:26.880> out<00:00:27.320> they<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.590> changed<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
phase goes out they have changed the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.900 
phase goes out they have changed the
mechanism<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.910> game<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.199> instance

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
mechanism in the game so for instance

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.400 
mechanism in the game so for instance
far<00:00:32.910> as<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.210> tell<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.690> could<00:00:33.780> be<00:00:33.840> wrong<00:00:34.020> it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
far as I can tell it could be wrong it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
far as I can tell it could be wrong it
could<00:00:34.559> just<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.890> build<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.340> game

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
could just be the build of the game

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.040 
could just be the build of the game
because<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:35.940> wants<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.239> SummerSlam<00:00:36.690> build

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
because it wants the SummerSlam build

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.540 
because it wants the SummerSlam build
and<00:00:37.230> what<00:00:37.350> has<00:00:37.469> changed<00:00:37.860> since<00:00:38.010> then

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and what has changed since then

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.420 
and what has changed since then
but<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.420> build<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:39.960> played<00:00:40.430> there

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
but in this build that we played there

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.160 
but in this build that we played there
was<00:00:41.520> no<00:00:41.640> way<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.879> transition<00:00:42.450> from<00:00:42.660> one

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
was no way to transition from one

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.160 
was no way to transition from one
grapple<00:00:43.860> position<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.370> another<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.360> think

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
grapple position to another so we think

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.389 
grapple position to another so we think
that<00:00:46.890> there<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.219> less<00:00:47.700> moves<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.539> play<00:00:49.399> in

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
that there is less moves to play in

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.160 
that there is less moves to play in
terms<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> front<00:00:51.030> grapple<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.989> game

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
terms of the front grapple in the game

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.869 
terms of the front grapple in the game
compared<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.710> last<00:00:52.890> year<00:00:53.160> he<00:00:53.670> had<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
compared to last year he had the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.139 
compared to last year he had the
headlock<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:54.660> front<00:00:55.050> facelock<00:00:55.289> armbar<00:00:56.059> so<00:00:57.059> you

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
headlock if front facelock armbar so you

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.549 
headlock if front facelock armbar so you
had<00:00:57.300> more<00:00:57.510> positionings<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.320> he<00:00:58.410> had

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
had more positionings and then he had

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.680 
had more positionings and then he had
the<00:00:58.649> back<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.070> had<00:00:59.250> 12<00:00:59.579> we<00:01:00.000> only<00:01:00.180> think<00:01:00.480> you

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the back so you had 12 we only think you

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.509 
the back so you had 12 we only think you
have<00:01:00.899> four<00:01:01.590> positionings<00:01:02.250> plus<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> submission

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
have four positionings plus a submission

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.480 
have four positionings plus a submission
like<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.090> that's<00:01:06.240> not<00:01:06.479> great<00:01:06.920> that<00:01:07.920> grapples

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
like so that's not great that grapples

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.789 
like so that's not great that grapples
distill<00:01:08.909> standard<00:01:09.689> back<00:01:09.840> rattle<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.350> godly

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
distill standard back rattle and godly

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.679 
distill standard back rattle and godly
level<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:11.909> far<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.299> could<00:01:12.420> tell<00:01:12.479> there

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
level but as far as we could tell there

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.390 
level but as far as we could tell there
was<00:01:12.720> no<00:01:12.960> transitional<00:01:13.830> way<00:01:13.950> which<00:01:14.130> doesn't

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
was no transitional way which doesn't

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.550 
was no transitional way which doesn't
make<00:01:14.610> sense<00:01:14.670> again<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.810> could<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:15.990> they've

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
make sense again it could be they've

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.289 
make sense again it could be they've
changed<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.979> button<00:01:17.280> mechanism<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.180> we

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
changed the button mechanism on it so we

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.700 
changed the button mechanism on it so we
didn't<00:01:18.570> know<00:01:18.659> which<00:01:19.369> place<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:21.710> or

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
didn't know which place it was that or

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.350 
didn't know which place it was that or
it<00:01:22.830> could<00:01:22.979> easily<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:24.000> were<00:01:24.150> just

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
it could easily be that we were just

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.410 
it could easily be that we were just
clueless<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.680> they<00:01:26.549> didn't<00:01:26.820> add<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.180> this

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
clueless or they didn't add it in this

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.999 
clueless or they didn't add it in this
field<00:01:27.840> or<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
field or was just not in it

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.149

Oh<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.909> came<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.180> groggy<00:01:30.390> grapples<00:01:31.009> they<00:01:32.009> win

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
Oh we came to groggy grapples they win

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.060 
Oh we came to groggy grapples they win
though<00:01:32.310> again<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.509> 2k<00:01:34.020> 14<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.619> press<00:01:34.829> a
