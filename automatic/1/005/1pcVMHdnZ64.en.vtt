00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.799
 with today's video response 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.660
 let's go back to talking about sirens through 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.340
 an amateur shoot of a 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.590
 sighting that I was asked to 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.500
 realize to verify you could 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.000
 be a real video or not 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.310
 actually the videos that I have been to 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.039
 proposed by marco to iezzo to whom i 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.740
 I address through my video I am 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.630
 two, however, for the moment I have decided to 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.320
 to propose only what I have succeeded 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.570
 to find from the analysis of one of s 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.880
 then marco comments I said in the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.640
 message I sent you a reply 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.500
 in video it seemed real and in first sight 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.960
 but somehow it was there 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.090
 something that unsuspected me and with 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.219
 the analysis in detail as follows 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.879
 they managed to find out what it was 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.370
 He was 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.160
 I will obviously now show what I am 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.949
 managed to get by analyzing these 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.140
 week and then you will decide for yourself if 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.660
 to agree or disagree as to what I am 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.520
 to say the video in question is that 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.039
 shot near the cliff in 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.960
 croatia where you can see distance 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.580
 a human figure with a fish tail that 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.590
 make a quick jump for later 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.900
 fall back into the water 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.820
 magnifying is slowing down the movie 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.159
 you can see some details that 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.080
 would make the movie real like ad 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.700
 example the water raised from the tail in the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.159
 the moment he takes the leap 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.840
 the shadow cast on the water during the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.360
 his descent and finally the rippling 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.490
 of the sea surface produced by 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.350
 his return to the water though if 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.000
 we pay more attention we can see 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.579
 that actually even though the figure that 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.009
 comes out of the water and the film is not real 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.840
 other than a fake what makes it so 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.640
 the appearance in the initial phase of the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.650
 jump of what appears to be one 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.270
 sort reminds that it allows the figure 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.310
 to be raised over the mirror 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.500
 of water and from which it is free for 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.030
 conclude his return to the sea 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.430
 to reinforce this hypothesis of mine is the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.439
 presence on the scene of a small king 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.270
 opaque that seems to hide the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.579
 silhouette of what could be a 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.229
 helicopter to which one has been set 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.229
 of the ends of the horns 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.210
 obviously it doesn't have to be 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.260
 be a helicopter 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.900
 it could in fact also be 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.270
 one of those parachutes used for 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.600
 to do that is certain anyway 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.460
 other thing able to fly and to 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.960
 support pulling the strange figure le 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.500
 above the water surface 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.450
 I know it may seem like a technique anyway 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.640
 a bit too elaborate for a video from 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.660
 publish on youtube but I would say that 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.650
 given the substantial number of 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.200
 views that got from 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.410
 date of its loading I would say it is 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.210
 it was also worth the pain, this is not me 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.100
 remains as always that to thank you for 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.660
 having viewed this video and I'm waiting for you 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.850
 in the next where as always 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.920
 we will therefore face a new mystery 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.220
 thanks again and I'll wait for you in the next one 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.220
 video
