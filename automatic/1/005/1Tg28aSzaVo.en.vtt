look at the hard time status anyway 5050
I'm<00:03:27.400> still<00:03:27.639> trying<00:03:27.669> to<00:03:28.060> get<00:03:28.120> used<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.599> game

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
I'm still trying to get used to the game

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.289 
I'm still trying to get used to the game
but<00:03:28.959> like<00:03:29.379> I<00:03:29.500> said<00:03:29.560> this<00:03:29.799> is<00:03:29.859> done<00:03:30.099> xbox<00:03:30.669> 360

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
but like I said this is done xbox 360

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.849 
but like I said this is done xbox 360
still<00:03:31.359> so<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.870> gameplay<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.409> just<00:03:32.590> slightly

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
still so the gameplay is just slightly

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.500 
still so the gameplay is just slightly
different<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.669> think<00:03:33.970> it's<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.120> little<00:03:34.180> bit<00:03:34.329> more

different I think it's a little bit more

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.180 
different I think it's a little bit more
faster<00:03:34.989> pace<00:03:35.169> on<00:03:35.409> the<00:03:35.560> 360<00:03:36.159> s<00:03:37.500> lovely<00:03:38.500> going
