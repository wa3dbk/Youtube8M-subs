 Therefore a very nice team to pack and transport as well 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.480

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.490
 The head will be delivered with this beautiful that they are here too 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.130

 we are packing up Irma's head here indeed

 so he looks out of it now Carla made in his shape as you do 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.350
 working together can be so very small with Natascha fit 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.200
 transport better and Chaplin wrapped the Carlton 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 that makes him off 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.980
 and then he has headphones here so a jack 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.280
 you can do that too 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.900
 and then 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.920
 you have the headphones 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.479
 even in its full splendor there are usually headphones 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.400
 here several classification so you can adjust the headset to his head 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.399
 with this headphone however another technique applied around the 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.140
 Wearing comfort Location Listening 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.909
 as we see here pm 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.230
 this is going to be this snare and the special thing is the headphones are stuck 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.670
 and you can just pull it over your head like that without any others 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.710
 Classification 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.869
 that means you just pull the headphones just like you want it and 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.330
 This position will be synonymous, the whole he goes well supple 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.510
 called 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.510
 here on one side of the headphone and on the other side you can 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.020
 him 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.460
 Komforth dpa a place in the comfort zone can be seen here 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.369
 once thumm and once suffering 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.820
 I tell them, too, company still leaves easy 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.449
 she was very comfortable to wear 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.889
 From the designer for me you can not complain now synonymous with several 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:16.240
 Project written with the blue and with the black seed 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.570
 and I think because you have the nice so together a Klopp has the whole thing 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.929
 a certain part 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:24.659
 here the two hearing impairments always adapt well to the ear 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.260
 no matter how you set the headphone, they always move with it 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.080
 Goal with her means she can see 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.680
 and that's why they always love very good morals and they have to 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.849
 upholstery from the back and the comfort of wearing 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.090
 She raised up a full house will make me very happy with the headphones 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.220
 it is not so good but if you enjoyable 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.299
 just gonna 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.380
 worked very well, the volume is completely okay 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.189
 like a normal 3com 8 5 mm plug the chambers 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.390
 Mac Book iPod and everything on land flow 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.390
 and then just listen to it in his music 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.540
 as cable copper Asus long enough to have the iPod in your pocket 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.609
 and pleasantly so defeated and it's not too long so it 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.299
 could be 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.000
 my opinion on the cost Rotter per head listener is the following he knew a lot 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:24.840
 Well last to other headphones with the show a very good sound 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:28.319
 What I have but the special on headphones, for example, find different 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.239
 as with these headphones the comfort is very high and to the one 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.399
 have him on the ears for a very long time 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:38.059
 can do without samples like a first. For example 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:41.329
 If you have a headphone on, it can get pretty uncomfortable 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.039
 on board and they solved that very well with the headphones 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:47.599
 here again the file summarized 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.840
 the recommended retail price of the headphones it 9 50 euros, however 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.009
 you know him already in other online shops in cheaper 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.799
 the body has a very good wearing comfort Tonus Falter the 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.689
 Sensitivity is 101 b 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.099
 and the delivery includes a bag and the adapter 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:16.979
 The schools 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.979
 because 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:25.729
 and 2 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:26.029
