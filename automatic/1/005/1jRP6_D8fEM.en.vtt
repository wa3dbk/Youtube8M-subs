right yeah so I will I'm gonna cut this
what<00:01:21.920> I<00:01:21.950> do<00:01:22.070> is<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.399> divide<00:01:22.610> it<00:01:22.759> into<00:01:23.000> fourths

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
what I do is I divide it into fourths

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.279 
what I do is I divide it into fourths
and<00:01:23.740> I<00:01:24.740> eat<00:01:24.920> that<00:01:25.340> 1/4<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.210> it<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:26.960> it's<00:01:27.200> a

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
and I eat that 1/4 of it so it's a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.499 
and I eat that 1/4 of it so it's a
little<00:01:27.380> less<00:01:27.680> than<00:01:28.009> two<00:01:28.190> servings<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:29.119> that's

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
little less than two servings and that's

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.179 
little less than two servings and that's
how<00:01:29.659> I<00:01:29.689> divide<00:01:30.049> my<00:01:30.080> calories<00:01:30.649> out<00:01:30.799> do<00:01:31.100> you
