00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
for me I really like to really like to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.410 
for me I really like to really like to
have<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.070> sense<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.210> pad<00:01:33.390> is

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
have the sense that that that pad is

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.920 
have the sense that that that pad is
part<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.869> my<00:01:33.990> body<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.430> that

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
part of my body I just like that

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.120 
part of my body I just like that
generally<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> traditional<00:01:37.650> look<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
generally the traditional look of the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.319 
generally the traditional look of the
pad<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.570> see<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> has<00:01:40.049> knee<00:01:40.350> rolls<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:41.329> lot

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
pad you can see it has knee rolls a lot

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.999 
pad you can see it has knee rolls a lot
of<00:01:42.479> pads<00:01:42.689> are<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:43.020> away<00:01:43.290> from<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:43.979> I

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
of pads are going away from that but I

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.710 
of pads are going away from that but I
feel<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.119> traditional

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
feel like it's just like a traditional

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.240 
feel like it's just like a traditional
part<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.020> goaltending<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.680> really<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
part of goaltending so I really like the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.510 
part of goaltending so I really like the
look<00:01:47.430> at<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.930> definitely<00:01:48.930> feel<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.369> if<00:01:50.369> I

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
look at that I definitely feel like if I

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.630 
look at that I definitely feel like if I
receive<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> shot<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> knee<00:01:52.320> rolls<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.799> find

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
receive a shot in the knee rolls I find

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.539 
receive a shot in the knee rolls I find
that<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.290> that<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.470> might<00:01:55.619> not<00:01:55.799> bounce<00:01:56.100> off<00:01:56.340> as

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
that it that it might not bounce off as

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.039 
that it that it might not bounce off as
hard<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.939> rebounds<00:01:57.420> stay<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> little<00:01:57.930> bit

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
hard the rebounds stay a little bit

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.490 
hard the rebounds stay a little bit
closer<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.590> me

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
closer to me

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.130 
closer to me
I've<00:01:59.710> had<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.130> most<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.520> my<00:02:00.550> career<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.270> it's

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
I've had that most of my career and it's

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.380 
I've had that most of my career and it's
just<00:02:02.320> something<00:02:02.620> I've<00:02:02.740> got<00:02:02.920> used<00:02:03.190> to<00:02:03.390> this

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
just something I've got used to this

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.810 
just something I've got used to this
this<00:02:05.200> flat<00:02:05.500> design<00:02:05.860> on<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.190> inside<00:02:06.220> it

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
this flat design on the inside it

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.719 
this flat design on the inside it
definitely<00:02:07.210> makes<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.950> makes<00:02:08.950> all<00:02:09.190> my<00:02:09.310> pushes

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
definitely makes it makes all my pushes

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.270 
definitely makes it makes all my pushes
a<00:02:09.759> lot<00:02:09.940> more<00:02:10.149> controlled<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.890> gives<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:12.250> a

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
a lot more controlled it gives you a

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.300 
a lot more controlled it gives you a
nice<00:02:12.550> solid<00:02:12.790> landing<00:02:13.360> surface<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.960> land<00:02:14.170> on<00:02:14.440> so

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
nice solid landing surface to land on so

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.500 
nice solid landing surface to land on so
whenever<00:02:15.490> you<00:02:15.730> go<00:02:15.850> on<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.030> butterfly

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
whenever you go on a butterfly

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.210 
whenever you go on a butterfly
everything<00:02:16.990> is<00:02:17.140> nice<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.320> solid<00:02:17.740> you're<00:02:18.070> not

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
everything is nice and solid you're not

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.820 
everything is nice and solid you're not
gonna<00:02:18.340> have<00:02:18.550> any<00:02:18.760> kind<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.090> rotating<00:02:19.830> so

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
gonna have any kind of rotating so

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.680 
gonna have any kind of rotating so
there's<00:02:21.220> not<00:02:21.400> gonna<00:02:21.550> be<00:02:21.610> any<00:02:21.910> hopefully<00:02:22.540> not

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
there's not gonna be any hopefully not

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.480 
there's not gonna be any hopefully not
be<00:02:22.810> any<00:02:22.930> squeakers<00:02:23.470> that<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:24.040> go<00:02:24.160> underneath

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
be any squeakers that that go underneath

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.180 
be any squeakers that that go underneath
your<00:02:24.580> pad<00:02:25.110> yeah<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.140> find<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.680> these<00:02:26.860> pads

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
your pad yeah I find that these pads

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.760 
your pad yeah I find that these pads
they<00:02:27.580> all<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.450> rebound<00:02:28.810> stay<00:02:29.050> closer<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.530> me

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
they all the rebound stay closer to me

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.850 
they all the rebound stay closer to me
and<00:02:30.430> with<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.850> with<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.810> more<00:02:32.080> flexible<00:02:32.260> boot

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
and with the with a more flexible boot

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.310 
and with the with a more flexible boot
I'm<00:02:33.100> allowed<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:34.030> point<00:02:34.240> my<00:02:34.450> toe<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.990> little

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
I'm allowed to to point my toe a little

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.230 
I'm allowed to to point my toe a little
bit<00:02:35.440> better<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:36.040> all<00:02:36.310> those<00:02:36.520> shots<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:37.000> you

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
bit better so all those shots that you

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.230 
bit better so all those shots that you
get<00:02:37.510> yet<00:02:38.260> generally<00:02:38.920> here<00:02:39.250> instead<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.120> them

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
get yet generally here instead of them

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.150 
get yet generally here instead of them
bouncing<00:02:40.930> back<00:02:41.110> out<00:02:41.380> into<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.740> middle<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.070> the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
bouncing back out into the middle of the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.420 
bouncing back out into the middle of the
ice<00:02:42.280> they'll<00:02:42.580> go<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.910> corner<00:02:43.260> there's<00:02:44.260> a

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
ice they'll go to the corner there's a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.530 
ice they'll go to the corner there's a
there's<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.490> good<00:02:45.700> combination<00:02:46.060> of

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
there's a good combination of

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.590 
there's a good combination of
flexibility<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.709> sturdiness<00:02:48.330> they're<00:02:49.330> built

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
flexibility and sturdiness they're built

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.480 
flexibility and sturdiness they're built
very<00:02:49.930> well<00:02:50.020> all<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.680> materials<00:02:51.220> are

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
very well all the materials are

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.910 
very well all the materials are
top-notch<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.930> they<00:02:53.050> don't<00:02:53.230> break<00:02:53.470> down<00:02:53.650> as

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
top-notch so they don't break down as

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.250 
top-notch so they don't break down as
fast<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.970> that's<00:02:55.270> that's<00:02:55.450> pretty<00:02:55.720> important

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
fast and that's that's pretty important

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.930 
fast and that's that's pretty important
when<00:02:56.380> you're<00:02:56.590> gonna<00:02:57.130> had<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.340> retail<00:02:57.700> level

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
when you're gonna had to retail level

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.730 
when you're gonna had to retail level
like<00:02:58.270> you<00:02:58.420> don't<00:02:58.600> want<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.840> have<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.140> go<00:02:59.260> and

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
like you don't want to have to go and

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.270 
like you don't want to have to go and
buy<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.970> know<00:03:01.620> seven<00:03:02.620> or<00:03:02.740> eight<00:03:02.800> pairs<00:03:03.220> of

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
buy you know seven or eight pairs of

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.729 
buy you know seven or eight pairs of
pads<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.760> season<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.360> these<00:03:05.140> are<00:03:05.320> pads<00:03:05.560> that

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
pads a season so these are pads that

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.130 
pads a season so these are pads that
will<00:03:05.890> last<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.340> while<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.730> use<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:07.600> strapping

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
will last a while I use this strapping

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.030 
will last a while I use this strapping
because<00:03:09.150> generally<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.269> allows<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.890> just

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
because generally it allows it just

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
because generally it allows it just
creates<00:03:12.700> more<00:03:12.820> room<00:03:13.239> for<00:03:13.630> my<00:03:14.440> knees<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:15.060> wear

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
creates more room for my knees I wear

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.550 
creates more room for my knees I wear
fairly<00:03:16.870> large<00:03:17.110> knee<00:03:17.350> pads<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:20.050> more<00:03:20.260> space

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
fairly large knee pads so the more space

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.430 
fairly large knee pads so the more space
I<00:03:20.769> have<00:03:20.950> around<00:03:21.910> my<00:03:22.120> knees<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.570> more<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.260> more

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
I have around my knees the more the more

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.759 
I have around my knees the more the more
mobility<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:24.010> have<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:25.170> that's<00:03:26.170> why<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.440> runs

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
mobility I have and that's why it runs

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.820 
mobility I have and that's why it runs
from<00:03:27.269> from<00:03:28.269> here<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.720> knee<00:03:28.870> stack<00:03:29.200> down<00:03:29.500> to

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
from from here the knee stack down to

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.190 
from from here the knee stack down to
the<00:03:30.519> calf<00:03:30.730> protection<00:03:31.420> so<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:31.780> just<00:03:31.959> kind<00:03:32.170> of

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
the calf protection so it just kind of

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.760 
the calf protection so it just kind of
opens<00:03:32.320> everything<00:03:32.920> up<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.220> little<00:03:33.250> bit<00:03:33.580> more
