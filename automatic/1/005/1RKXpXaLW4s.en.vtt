down Marines can take this town really
really<00:00:52.680> quick<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.610> not<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.850> problem<00:00:54.090> in

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
really quick so that is not a problem in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.510 
really quick so that is not a problem in
the<00:00:54.360> slightest<00:00:54.930> there<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.800> that's<00:00:56.129> really

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the slightest there so that's really

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.760 
the slightest there so that's really
essentially<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> mid<00:00:58.050> game<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.590> didn't

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
essentially to the mid game we didn't

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.279 
essentially to the mid game we didn't
have<00:00:58.890> lucky<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.579> for<00:00:59.969> an<00:01:00.059> 11<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.690> 10<00:01:01.020> bill

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
have lucky going for an 11 of 10 bill

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.599 
have lucky going for an 11 of 10 bill
but<00:01:01.440> he<00:01:01.500> does<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> Overlord<00:01:02.190> there<00:01:02.370> so

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
but he does have the Overlord there so

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.160 
but he does have the Overlord there so
that<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.239> basically<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.660> because<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:03.989> went

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that is basically just because you went

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.679 
that is basically just because you went
to<00:01:04.229> 10<00:01:04.500> drones<00:01:04.820> then<00:01:05.820> build<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> Overlord<00:01:06.540> and

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
to 10 drones then build the Overlord and

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.870 
to 10 drones then build the Overlord and
then<00:01:07.080> obviously<00:01:07.200> when<00:01:07.740> extractor<00:01:08.340> got<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
then obviously when extractor got the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.250 
then obviously when extractor got the
11th<00:01:09.180> drawing<00:01:09.479> counselor<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
11th drawing counselor to get the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.080 
11th drawing counselor to get the
drawing<00:01:10.470> back<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.880> drone

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
drawing back so we do have this drone

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.969 
drawing back so we do have this drone
coming<00:01:12.720> oh<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:13.049> got<00:01:13.200> fairly<00:01:13.500> standard<00:01:13.860> opening

as a Terran you just got to sit there
and<00:01:31.799> think<00:01:31.890> well<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.310> they're<00:01:32.790> expanding

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
and think well if they're expanding

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.149 
and think well if they're expanding
anyway<00:01:33.630> why<00:01:33.990> don't<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.409> expand<00:01:34.920> as<00:01:35.040> well

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
anyway why don't I just expand as well

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.620 
anyway why don't I just expand as well

comes<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.800> SCV<00:02:14.160> already<00:02:14.760> there<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.750> that's

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
comes the SCV already there and that's

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.660 
comes the SCV already there and that's
basically<00:02:16.440> get<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.860> world<00:02:17.010> max<00:02:17.190> commands<00:02:17.459> and

basically get the world max commands and

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.220 
basically get the world max commands and
as<00:02:17.880> expected<00:02:18.090> we<00:02:18.510> do<00:02:18.599> have<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.780> pull<00:02:18.930> down<00:02:18.959> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
as expected we do have the pull down and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.620 
as expected we do have the pull down and

gas as well coming off and lucky here

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.699 
gas as well coming off and lucky here
basically<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:21.750> gas<00:02:22.050> depending<00:02:22.470> on<00:02:22.530> how<00:02:22.650> many

can be a bathing bus timing or something
like<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.260> but<00:02:28.620> essentially<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.610> do<00:02:29.670> believe

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
like that but essentially I do believe

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.280 
like that but essentially I do believe
that<00:02:31.280> let<00:02:32.280> me<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:32.459> check<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:32.970> before<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.959> i

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
that let me just check this before I i

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.870 
that let me just check this before I i
get<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.709> possibly<00:02:35.040> wrong<00:02:35.160> no<00:02:35.610> it's<00:02:35.819> not

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
get this possibly wrong no it's not

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.070 
get this possibly wrong no it's not
knowing<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.450> it's<00:02:36.569> coming<00:02:36.720> out<00:02:36.900> but

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
knowing that it's coming out but

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.740 
knowing that it's coming out but
basically<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.800> extractor<00:02:38.550> by<00:02:38.819> canceling

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
basically this extractor by canceling

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.880 
basically this extractor by canceling
and<00:02:39.900> rebuilding<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.349> takes<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.590> couple<00:02:40.739> of

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
and rebuilding it takes a couple of

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.589 
and rebuilding it takes a couple of
Marines<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.459> attribute<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:41.910> knock<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.269> out<00:02:42.390> I

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
Marines to attribute to knock it out I

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.479 
Marines to attribute to knock it out I
know<00:02:43.050> what<00:02:43.260> you've<00:02:43.440> got<00:02:43.680> Marines<00:02:43.980> attacking

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
know what you've got Marines attacking

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.340 
know what you've got Marines attacking
it<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.760> means<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.569> isn't<00:02:45.930> gonna<00:02:46.140> be<00:02:46.230> a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
it it means that this isn't gonna be a

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.130 
it it means that this isn't gonna be a

is really interesting is gonna be from
medevac<00:06:13.680> to<00:06:13.860> the<00:06:13.919> third<00:06:14.130> command<00:06:14.400> center

coming<00:06:14.820> up<00:06:14.910> and<00:06:15.090> basically<00:06:15.630> MVP<00:06:16.110> is<00:06:16.260> favoring

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
coming up and basically MVP is favoring

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.290 
coming up and basically MVP is favoring
that<00:06:16.680> marine<00:06:17.070> ruin<00:06:17.340> a<00:06:17.430> medevac<00:06:17.849> type<00:06:18.060> build

one surgeon goes down there and

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.129 
one surgeon goes down there and
essentially<00:06:21.180> what<00:06:21.210> lucky<00:06:21.479> needs<00:06:21.780> is<00:06:21.990> an

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 
essentially what lucky needs is an

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.350 
essentially what lucky needs is an
absolutely<00:06:22.860> optimum<00:06:23.460> point<00:06:23.610> of<00:06:23.760> attack<00:06:24.030> he

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
absolutely optimum point of attack he

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.089 
absolutely optimum point of attack he
needs<00:06:24.570> to<00:06:24.630> go<00:06:24.720> great<00:06:25.050> around<00:06:25.320> he<00:06:25.470> doesn't<00:06:25.860> want

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
needs to go great around he doesn't want

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.159 
needs to go great around he doesn't want
this<00:06:26.280> force<00:06:26.580> getting<00:06:27.150> into<00:06:27.479> any<00:06:27.630> jokes<00:06:27.930> such

this force getting into any jokes such
as<00:06:28.289> by<00:06:28.440> these<00:06:28.650> rocks<00:06:28.919> I'd<00:06:29.099> be<00:06:29.220> a<00:06:29.250> huge<00:06:29.580> huge

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
as by these rocks I'd be a huge huge

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.550 
as by these rocks I'd be a huge huge
problem<00:06:30.240> because<00:06:30.270> then<00:06:30.660> they'd<00:06:31.020> even<00:06:31.139> be<00:06:31.260> less

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
problem because then they'd even be less

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
surface area for the zones exactly but

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.120 
surface area for the zones exactly but
the<00:06:33.780> baneling<00:06:34.260> nest<00:06:34.440> is<00:06:34.560> nearly<00:06:34.770> done<00:06:34.919> that's

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
the baneling nest is nearly done that's

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.770 
the baneling nest is nearly done that's
what's<00:06:35.340> really<00:06:35.669> really<00:06:35.849> key<00:06:35.940> every<00:06:36.390> PK<00:06:36.630> want

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
what's really really key every PK want

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.450 
what's really really key every PK want
to<00:06:36.840> check<00:06:37.050> for<00:06:37.080> the<00:06:37.260> third<00:06:37.530> after<00:06:38.010> base<00:06:38.340> would

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
to check for the third after base would

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.040 
to check for the third after base would
be<00:06:38.490> incredible<00:06:38.909> income<00:06:39.270> the<00:06:39.419> zerglings<00:06:39.719> now

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
be incredible income the zerglings now

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.550 
be incredible income the zerglings now
combat

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
combat

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.990 
combat
is<00:06:40.620> done<00:06:40.860> and<00:06:41.130> they<00:06:41.340> have<00:06:41.370> actually<00:06:41.760> got<00:06:41.850> quite

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
is done and they have actually got quite

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.400 
is done and they have actually got quite
a<00:06:42.120> good<00:06:42.330> surface<00:06:42.660> area<00:06:42.930> that<00:06:43.080> the<00:06:43.139> Marines

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
a good surface area that the Marines

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.900 
a good surface area that the Marines
aren't<00:06:43.620> quite<00:06:43.860> in<00:06:43.889> a<00:06:44.010> perfect<00:06:44.370> ball<00:06:44.490> and<00:06:44.730> that

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
aren't quite in a perfect ball and that

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.780 
aren't quite in a perfect ball and that
will<00:06:45.060> get<00:06:45.180> cleaned<00:06:45.419> up<00:06:45.510> very<00:06:45.870> very<00:06:46.139> easily<00:06:46.410> now

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
will get cleaned up very very easily now

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.460 
will get cleaned up very very easily now
obviously<00:06:47.790> the<00:06:47.940> key<00:06:48.150> thing<00:06:48.510> why<00:06:49.050> that<00:06:49.290> worked

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
obviously the key thing why that worked

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.170 
obviously the key thing why that worked
or<00:06:49.590> is<00:06:49.770> the<00:06:49.860> Marines<00:06:50.130> were<00:06:50.250> spread<00:06:50.580> out<00:06:50.610> and

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
or is the Marines were spread out and

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.850 
or is the Marines were spread out and
it's<00:06:51.300> all<00:06:51.360> about<00:06:51.510> surface<00:06:52.080> area<00:06:52.410> if<00:06:52.560> you<00:06:52.650> keep

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
it's all about surface area if you keep

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.129 
it's all about surface area if you keep
them<00:06:53.010> bored<00:06:53.340> then<00:06:54.120> the<00:06:54.419> zerglings<00:06:54.630> can't

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 
them bored then the zerglings can't

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.320 
them bored then the zerglings can't
attack<00:06:55.380> many<00:06:55.650> Marines<00:06:56.010> at<00:06:56.160> once<00:06:56.370> but<00:06:56.970> all<00:06:57.210> the

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
attack many Marines at once but all the

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.120 
attack many Marines at once but all the
Marines<00:06:57.600> can<00:06:57.840> attack<00:06:58.080> at<00:06:58.230> once<00:06:58.350> so<00:06:58.710> that's

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.130 
Marines can attack at once so that's

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.180 
Marines can attack at once so that's
really<00:06:59.250> ain't<00:06:59.520> but<00:06:59.669> now<00:06:59.820> Wow<00:07:00.470> holy<00:07:01.470> baneling

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190 
really ain't but now Wow holy baneling

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.340 
really ain't but now Wow holy baneling
that<00:07:02.460> is<00:07:02.639> a<00:07:02.669> lot<00:07:03.060> of<00:07:03.270> banelings<00:07:03.930> right<00:07:04.139> there

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
that is a lot of banelings right there

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.940 
that is a lot of banelings right there
46<00:07:05.310> where<00:07:05.520> anyone<00:07:05.700> who<00:07:05.760> can't<00:07:05.970> breed<00:07:06.230> but<00:07:07.230> 46

bindings<00:07:08.370> are<00:07:08.520> going<00:07:08.820> to<00:07:08.880> just<00:07:09.090> plow<00:07:09.450> through

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480 
bindings are going to just plow through

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.730 
bindings are going to just plow through
this<00:07:09.900> now<00:07:11.630> frankly<00:07:12.630> I<00:07:12.840> don't<00:07:13.290> think<00:07:13.590> there's

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 
this now frankly I don't think there's

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.780 
this now frankly I don't think there's
anything<00:07:14.100> MVP<00:07:14.580> can<00:07:14.729> do<00:07:16.250> he's<00:07:17.250> trying<00:07:17.490> to<00:07:17.610> bring

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:17.790 
anything MVP can do he's trying to bring

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.190 
anything MVP can do he's trying to bring
those<00:07:17.940> SUVs<00:07:18.150> into<00:07:18.570> a<00:07:18.600> pair<00:07:18.810> but<00:07:18.960> they're<00:07:19.050> just

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.200 
those SUVs into a pair but they're just

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.659 
those SUVs into a pair but they're just
gonna<00:07:19.290> be<00:07:19.380> too<00:07:19.560> much<00:07:19.770> damage<00:07:20.010> just<00:07:20.280> look<00:07:20.520> at

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:20.669 
gonna be too much damage just look at

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:22.850 
gonna be too much damage just look at
those<00:07:20.760> racks<00:07:21.090> mode<00:07:21.300> so<00:07:21.930> many<00:07:22.169> SUVs<00:07:22.560> could<00:07:22.710> take

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 
those racks mode so many SUVs could take

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.860 
those racks mode so many SUVs could take
now<00:07:23.010> those<00:07:23.190> that<00:07:23.370> GG<00:07:23.669> and<00:07:23.850> those<00:07:24.690> are<00:07:24.780> nice
