this<00:00:37.989> is<00:00:38.140> our<00:00:38.290> Noel<00:00:38.589> and<00:00:38.949> baby<00:00:39.220> hell<00:00:39.489> and<00:00:39.910> so

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
this is our Noel and baby hell and so

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.509 
this is our Noel and baby hell and so
this<00:00:40.329> is<00:00:40.540> a<00:00:40.799> one<00:00:41.799> of<00:00:41.890> our<00:00:42.010> higher-end

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
this is a one of our higher-end

this is a one of our higher-end
mannequins<00:00:43.059> it<00:00:43.360> has<00:00:43.479> a<00:00:43.510> lot<00:00:43.720> of<00:00:44.159> technical

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
mannequins it has a lot of technical

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.009 
mannequins it has a lot of technical
components<00:00:45.820> to<00:00:45.970> her<00:00:46.150> this<00:00:46.540> is<00:00:46.629> an<00:00:46.750> area<00:00:46.930> that

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
components to her this is an area that

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.229 
components to her this is an area that
we<00:00:47.140> ran<00:00:47.290> today<00:00:47.500> we<00:00:47.739> have<00:00:47.979> a<00:00:48.309> patient<00:00:48.790> who<00:00:49.089> was

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
we ran today we have a patient who was

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.020 
we ran today we have a patient who was
coming<00:00:49.420> in<00:00:49.750> who<00:00:50.250> had<00:00:51.250> an<00:00:51.369> abruption<00:00:51.699> so

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
coming in who had an abruption so

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.399 
coming in who had an abruption so
basically<00:00:52.390> she<00:00:52.659> had<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:52.869> pull<00:00:53.019> center<00:00:53.290> that

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
basically she had to pull center that

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.640 
basically she had to pull center that
was<00:00:53.530> tearing<00:00:53.830> away<00:00:54.299> from<00:00:55.299> any<00:00:56.049> abdomen<00:00:56.500> where

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
was tearing away from any abdomen where

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.920 
was tearing away from any abdomen where
where<00:00:56.979> normally<00:00:57.400> would<00:00:57.519> be<00:00:57.640> secured<00:00:58.119> and<00:00:58.689> so

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
where normally would be secured and so

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.600 
where normally would be secured and so
our<00:00:59.080> risk<00:00:59.320> there<00:00:59.619> is<00:00:59.650> if<00:01:00.040> that<00:01:00.220> completely

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
our risk there is if that completely

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.609 
our risk there is if that completely
turns<00:01:00.909> away<00:01:01.089> we<00:01:01.420> have<00:01:01.570> an<00:01:01.659> infant<00:01:02.019> that<00:01:02.080> is<00:01:02.409> not

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:02.619 
turns away we have an infant that is not

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:04.380 
turns away we have an infant that is not
getting<00:01:02.860> any<00:01:02.949> blood<00:01:03.129> supply<00:01:03.549> and<00:01:03.820> that<00:01:04.239> was

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
getting any blood supply and that was

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.240 
getting any blood supply and that was
the<00:01:04.510> reason<00:01:04.839> for<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.470> infant<00:01:05.830> meeting

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
the reason for the infant meeting

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:17.500 
the reason for the infant meeting
resuscitation

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.280 

this<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.280> one<00:01:25.460> of<00:01:25.490> our<00:01:25.700> in-situ<00:01:26.450> simulations

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
this is one of our in-situ simulations

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.010 
this is one of our in-situ simulations
meaning<00:01:28.070> we<00:01:28.340> actually<00:01:28.700> bring<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.360> mannequin

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
meaning we actually bring the mannequin

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.170 
meaning we actually bring the mannequin
to<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.530> environment<00:01:30.950> of<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.130> staff<00:01:31.430> and

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
to the environment of the staff and

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.160 
to the environment of the staff and
that's<00:01:32.270> one<00:01:32.570> thing<00:01:32.750> that<00:01:32.780> we're<00:01:33.020> really

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
that's one thing that we're really

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.440 
that's one thing that we're really
hoping<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.650> do<00:01:33.770> more<00:01:34.010> of<00:01:34.040> this<00:01:34.400> year<00:01:34.729> our<00:01:35.390> goal

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
hoping to do more of this year our goal

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.510 
hoping to do more of this year our goal
with<00:01:35.870> this<00:01:35.990> scenario<00:01:36.440> is<00:01:36.650> largely<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.220> improve

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
with this scenario is largely to improve

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.740 
with this scenario is largely to improve

emergency room in the newborn ICU which

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.340 
emergency room in the newborn ICU which
are<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:43.970> three<00:01:44.180> departments<00:01:44.450> that<00:01:44.810> respond

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
are the three departments that respond

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:57.550 
are the three departments that respond
to<00:01:45.650> this<00:01:45.800> type<00:01:45.860> of<00:01:46.130> an<00:01:46.610> event<00:01:56.380> one<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.470> the

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
to this type of an event one of the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.080 
to this type of an event one of the
biggest<00:01:57.800> challenges<00:01:58.250> with<00:01:58.430> any<00:01:58.640> type<00:01:58.880> of

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
biggest challenges with any type of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.900 
biggest challenges with any type of
simulation<00:01:59.330> is<00:02:00.280> getting<00:02:01.280> past<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.640> fact<00:02:01.790> that

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
simulation is getting past the fact that

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.090 
simulation is getting past the fact that
this<00:02:02.060> isn't<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.390> real<00:02:02.570> patient<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.890> lot

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
this isn't a real patient and so a lot

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.130 
this isn't a real patient and so a lot
of<00:02:04.130> times<00:02:04.490> we<00:02:04.729> will<00:02:04.910> add<00:02:05.119> as<00:02:05.540> you<00:02:05.930> might<00:02:06.080> have

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
of times we will add as you might have

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.570 
of times we will add as you might have
noticed<00:02:06.200> we<00:02:07.040> had<00:02:07.130> what<00:02:07.540> we<00:02:08.540> try<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.810> add<00:02:09.580> just

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
noticed we had what we try to add just

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.340 
noticed we had what we try to add just
engaging<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.300> senses<00:02:11.660> we<00:02:11.780> try<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.020> add<00:02:12.170> any

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
engaging of the senses we try to add any

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.410 
engaging of the senses we try to add any
sound<00:02:12.739> that<00:02:13.010> we<00:02:13.100> can<00:02:13.310> we<00:02:13.520> have<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> realistic

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
sound that we can we have a realistic

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.199 
sound that we can we have a realistic
noise<00:02:14.810> that's<00:02:15.020> talking<00:02:15.260> for<00:02:15.650> her<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.850> any<00:02:17.060> of

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
noise that's talking for her so any of

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.060 
noise that's talking for her so any of
the<00:02:17.330> senses<00:02:18.020> medicine<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.470> such<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.650> sensory

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
the senses medicine is such a sensory

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.710 
the senses medicine is such a sensory
profession<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.700> we<00:02:19.760> rely<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:20.030> heavily<00:02:20.269> on

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
profession and we rely so heavily on

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.310 
profession and we rely so heavily on
what<00:02:21.410> we<00:02:21.560> see<00:02:21.800> touch<00:02:22.190> smell<00:02:22.670> hear<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:24.170> the

what we see touch smell hear that the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.140 
what we see touch smell hear that the
more<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.769> those<00:02:24.890> pieces<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:25.430> we<00:02:25.700> can<00:02:25.940> pull

more of those pieces that we can pull

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.640 
more of those pieces that we can pull
into<00:02:26.300> a<00:02:26.420> scenario<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.959> more<00:02:27.080> realistic<00:02:27.230> it

into a scenario the more realistic it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.610 
into a scenario the more realistic it
becomes<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.760> it's<00:02:29.720> very<00:02:29.959> easy<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.350> forget
