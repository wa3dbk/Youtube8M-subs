00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.740 

now<00:00:20.550> I'm<00:00:20.610> going<00:00:20.790> to<00:00:20.850> take<00:00:21.030> the<00:00:21.180> paper<00:00:21.390> off<00:00:21.630> and

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
now I'm going to take the paper off and

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.680 
now I'm going to take the paper off and
the<00:00:21.990> challenge<00:00:22.500> here<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:24.090> can't<00:00:24.480> touch

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
the challenge here is that I can't touch

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.330 
the challenge here is that I can't touch
it<00:00:24.900> now<00:00:25.050> because<00:00:25.260> it's<00:00:25.410> sticky<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.040> now<00:00:26.280> you

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
it now because it's sticky so now you

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:45.340 
it now because it's sticky so now you
push<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.060> blue<00:00:27.480> button<00:00:27.510> okay<00:00:28.500> ready<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.279 

there<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.499> just<00:00:46.649> made<00:00:46.859> a<00:00:46.890> pickup<00:00:47.780> by<00:00:48.780> DN<00:00:49.140> s

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
there you just made a pickup by DN s

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.500 
there you just made a pickup by DN s
being<00:00:49.499> moved<00:00:49.739> forward<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.219> backward<00:00:50.670> so

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
being moved forward and backward so

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.569 
being moved forward and backward so
we've<00:00:51.749> got<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.929> wire<00:00:52.229> soldered<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:52.979> it<00:00:53.159> and<00:00:53.429> then

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
we've got a wire soldered on it and then

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.520 
we've got a wire soldered on it and then
there's<00:00:53.819> that<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.749> is<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> container

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
there's that and this is a container

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.700 
there's that and this is a container
we're<00:00:56.219> mounting<00:00:56.909> that<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:58.100> what<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.129> do<00:01:00.710> I'm

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
we're mounting that in what we do I'm

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.189 
we're mounting that in what we do I'm
gonna<00:01:02.339> use<00:01:02.519> that<00:01:02.760> one

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.730 

yes

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.219 

and<00:01:09.180> again<00:01:10.180> I<00:01:10.390> will<00:01:10.690> push<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.080> green<00:01:11.260> button

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and again I will push the green button

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.730 
and again I will push the green button
and<00:01:14.229> it<00:01:14.409> put<00:01:15.310> it<00:01:15.460> puts<00:01:15.850> a<00:01:16.000> substance<00:01:16.570> it's<00:01:16.810> our

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
and it put it puts a substance it's our

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.090 
and it put it puts a substance it's our
TV<00:01:18.300> which<00:01:19.300> is<00:01:19.330> it's<00:01:19.810> like<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.020> gasket<00:01:20.619> material

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
TV which is it's like a gasket material

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.070 
TV which is it's like a gasket material
it's<00:01:21.280> really<00:01:21.610> replacing<00:01:22.600> someone<00:01:22.960> else

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
it's really replacing someone else

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.430 
it's really replacing someone else
electric<00:01:23.530> gasket<00:01:24.040> material<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:26.140> what<00:01:26.290> that

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
electric gasket material and what that

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.070 
electric gasket material and what that
does<00:01:26.619> is<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:27.040> dampen<00:01:27.580> is<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:27.729> movement<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.479> also

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
does is it dampen is a movement and also

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.710 
does is it dampen is a movement and also
when<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.890> loosen<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.790> spring<00:01:31.090> it's<00:01:31.300> stuck<00:01:31.540> to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
when you loosen the spring it's stuck to

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.180 
when you loosen the spring it's stuck to
it<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:31.990> pulls<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.470> BET<00:01:32.619> higher<00:01:32.800> loosen<00:01:33.130> the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
it so pulls the BET higher loosen the

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.100 
it so pulls the BET higher loosen the
screw<00:01:33.399> pulls<00:01:33.729> it<00:01:33.880> back<00:01:33.909> so<00:01:34.479> it<00:01:34.630> kind<00:01:34.869> of<00:01:34.930> acts

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
screw pulls it back so it kind of acts

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.249 
screw pulls it back so it kind of acts
like<00:01:35.200> our<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:36.369> dampener<00:01:37.300> in<00:01:37.540> like<00:01:37.780> our<00:01:37.990> rubber

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
like our a dampener in like our rubber

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.810 
like our a dampener in like our rubber
band<00:01:38.560> at<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.040> same<00:01:39.250> time<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:41.470> we<00:01:43.500> put<00:01:44.500> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
band at the same time then we put a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:02:02.070 
band at the same time then we put a
polycarbonate<00:01:45.820> glue

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.080 

can't<00:02:02.380> imagine<00:02:02.980> how<00:02:03.190> long<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:03.490> takes<00:02:03.970> to

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
can't imagine how long it takes to

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.900 
can't imagine how long it takes to
develop<00:02:04.660> this<00:02:04.840> stuff<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.950> then<00:02:06.130> make<00:02:06.670> them

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
develop this stuff and then make them

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:16.030 
develop this stuff and then make them
changing<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.660> do<00:02:07.870> it

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.119 

take<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.219> over<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.760> our<00:02:18.379> little<00:02:19.379> clamping

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
take it over to our little clamping

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.979 
take it over to our little clamping
station<00:02:20.819> very<00:02:21.599> quick<00:02:21.930> on<00:02:23.150> one<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.480> wanna

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
station very quick on one of the wanna

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:32.890 
station very quick on one of the wanna
lose<00:02:25.349> guys<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:30.120> just<00:02:30.150> kind<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.569> holds<00:02:30.930> it

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
lose guys it just kind of holds it

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.720 
lose guys it just kind of holds it
and<00:02:33.349> all<00:02:33.620> we're<00:02:33.769> doing<00:02:33.980> is<00:02:34.069> just<00:02:34.250> keeping<00:02:34.610> it

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
and all we're doing is just keeping it

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.360 
and all we're doing is just keeping it
clamped<00:02:35.299> for<00:02:35.750> about<00:02:35.900> 24<00:02:36.379> hours<00:02:36.440> this<00:02:36.890> station

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
clamped for about 24 hours this station

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.809 
clamped for about 24 hours this station
we<00:02:37.489> just<00:02:37.730> finished<00:02:38.060> making<00:02:38.239> this<00:02:38.629> we<00:02:39.260> used<00:02:39.440> a

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
we just finished making this we used a

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.550 
we just finished making this we used a
bicycle<00:02:40.819> break<00:02:41.090> that's<00:02:41.390> released<00:02:42.110> by<00:02:42.349> air

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
bicycle break that's released by air

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.860 
bicycle break that's released by air
pressure<00:02:42.890> so<00:02:43.340> weak

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.449 

it's<00:02:46.200> fun<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.440> spin<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.980> when<00:02:47.130> there's<00:02:47.310> nothing

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
it's fun to spin it when there's nothing

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.000 
it's fun to spin it when there's nothing
on<00:02:47.790> there<00:02:49.640> but<00:02:50.640> that's<00:02:50.790> it
