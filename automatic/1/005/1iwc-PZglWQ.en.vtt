00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:23.480
 Good day to all today 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.909
 such a miracle 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:35.120
 let's see what is here complaints that 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:35.120
 turns off after five minutes these turn on 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:53.340
 or times were spinning 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:53.340
 I do not like this light and add 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.690
 see that 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.729
 will card 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.070
 cooler spinning barely 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.740
 respectively and 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:20.539
 heats up strongly 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.890
 and protection heat protection turns off so that 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:36.520
 let's wait for something it will sound no 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.780
 I like this bullet work 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.860
 enough 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.540
 free and 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.540
 process cold 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.870
 it's cold 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.360
 it stops even cooler 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.420
 that's all heard 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.459
 Well that 's get off and 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.760
 continue after removal here we removed 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:36.830
 video card 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:41.879
 what we see for him is that there is dust 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:46.920
 kind of devious probably no lubrication and costs 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:49.310
 he is respecting the radiator that 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:03:00.720
 all will look can change the post 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:03:06.799
 let's clean it and earn it 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:11.459
 us on the table and removed the plastic skin 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:18.030
 a carpet that does not want to spin for a long time 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:26.280
 often feel pretty tight now 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:29.400
 let's go it's all vacuumed to anyone that she 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.470
 will overheat with such a popular and 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:38.549
 downtrodden 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:46.019
 dust we go vacuuming until we all 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:52.139
 led the order video card radiator 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:57.859
 clogged and not as well as the whole corner 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:57.859
 was hammered or we will disassemble it 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:07.150
 here such should have a radiator 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:13.090
 clean kill and good 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:17.739
 cooling here i opened the calves so he and 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:21.280
 it's dry there so he can barely walk and 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:28.150
 stops right now will serve and 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:31.000
 I lubricate the skin with silicone grease she 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.700
 less subject to you hovering under 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.310
 the effect of temperature well and longer 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.140
 enough 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:43.870
 come back we'll see when we are already 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:44.770
 here I gathered to test the video card from 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.590
 her card 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:52.890
 put in place Kolya now he sits down 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:57.960
 before the water flow of air from it 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:05:00.880
 neat yes lively set everything set 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.479
 computers are seeing temperature 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.600
 temperature and in general 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:11.160
 the number of turns and so to speak the total 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:16.510
 computer uptime now 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:19.560
 put back and look here in place 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:23.460
 set off power 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.610
 additional set connector 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.729
 screwed 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.729
 housing inclusion look 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:48.260
 turnover and were 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:51.850
 so what could you stop easy downtime 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:57.410
 by touch now there is no going to fingers 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:58.990
 gives well we take a look now for 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:04.160
 temperature 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:07.730
 let's test it cold minutes through 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:14.090
 5-10 I turn on here 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:20.140
 enough time noise no noise from 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.140
 cooler temperature cold cold 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:28.880
 fancy a good job 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:31.760
 performed normally serviced 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.490
 video card well this is one of the most 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.020
 common causes 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.250
 which active cooling i.e. 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.720
 cooler and you have to watch 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:45.100
 constantly maintain lubricate clean 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.150
 and data problems to disable or 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.940
 incorrect operation of the computer can 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:57.280
 will avoid everyone everyone thanks 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:57.280
 I finish it bye bye
