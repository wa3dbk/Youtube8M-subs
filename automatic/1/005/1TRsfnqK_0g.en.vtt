00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 It was Wednesday 10 am given 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.140
 I came here is my colleague and then I came 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.840
 here to visit the lake and then I 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.400
 I saw on the other side out of the water 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.250
 she was more or less 5 to 6 meters 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.269
 more or less in size that gave time 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.279
 more or less, right 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.500
 She shifted her goal but called my 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.750
 Colleague was in the guardhouse, it 's for me to see. 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.420
 she moved naturally there 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.090
 so, and I ran here and there 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.060
 always observing it was there when I 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.710
 I called my colleague there the line sank 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.070
 work of the dacon she climbed in 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.070
 next to the ruler there she went up so much 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.350
 above the water level and followed that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.719
 direction thereafter she lowered again and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.899
 more confident she lifted and followed 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.270
 tomorrow night on the screen rising from 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.489
 view on the lake is not the first time 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.070
 saw the first time I saw I already heard 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.420
 there also reports that there are 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.890
 seen a snake more or less of this 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.379
 portion that is believed to actually 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.960
 there is a large work and sale 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.840
 of the golden lake is actually what we 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.240
 found were traces of 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.810
 passage to an animal that has passed through 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.689
 places is not got legs is a snake 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.490
 in fact and how he serpent there was no 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.689
 footprints 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.390
 beyond the track zig zag pattern in 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.740
 indicating crawling condition 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.610
 of great proportion 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.380
 at first said in that with that size 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.640
 should be succinct with talking 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.939
 even with people who have already made the sighting 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.570
 there is the description of the external collaboration 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.250
 all it indicates to rise even as 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.900
 I believe it was superimposed rate 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.430
 arrived here on the Great Southern River in 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.140
 santa cruz on a golden lake 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.689
 there are many records of people who 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.670
 have already had the opportunity to find 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.149
 some animal although we do not know the 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.250
 verity of such records in rivers as 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.350
 brown river jack 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.240
 but up here in the river we have 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.259
 a record is quite recent in the year 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.210
 past 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.270
 people never have this notion that 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.950
 in fact it is a native animal or 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.300
 possibly has been released there 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.150
 chase mainly says ne 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.010
 because of the legislation that 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.620
 people can not really have at home 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.319
 animals in captivity that do not 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.270
 has come from a breeder legally 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.730
 may have caused these 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.019
 people have got rid of these animals and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.060
 until very recently we had 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.739
 many people who actually had sucuri 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.220
 At home we had buses circling 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.470
 consultants inside a snake being 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.120
 shown their population is no longer 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.410
 largely it was disabled and 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.110
 that was made from animals we did not 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.430
 have this certainty and most of the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.530
 probably these animals were 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.480
 loose in some suitable environment a 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.280
 super proper environment is precisely 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.470
 this download here that reproduces a 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.160
 bathed where we have a gigantic lake 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.910
 with little public attendance at 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.060
 fisherman then we have birds and mammals 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.760
 which are the preferred food of the sucuris 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.650
 or 70 of large size that in this case 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.000
 I find a suitable environment for them to 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.970
 possibility of eating here 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.640
 and if they exist, 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.959
 cold cold is not an ally of the snakes 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.180
 but unfortunately she can not do anything 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.430
 were released here survived the cold 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.840
 for a while you can not have avenged them 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.820
 from the time they were released by 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.690
 someone in the general population who had 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.820
 in captivity 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.920
 then this presence of these sucuri or 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.480
 another large work here she can 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.430
 present any danger to humans 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.290
 for water quality and concern for 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.480
 local ecosystem 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.579
 the presence of animals with these 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.500
 proportions means that eventually 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.810
 She can be here a long time, right? 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.880
 that she has or has her food 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.890
 of this environment 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.590
 this means that good food 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.780
 quality means that it is 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.310
 sophisticated in being so sensitive to 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.440
 toxic substances we do not know 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.720
 and reptiles and amphibians are very 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.579
 sensitive to toxic substances 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.739
 she urged living here she is 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.630
 literally a super clean environment is 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.569
 indicator of environmental condition 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.700
 the excellent from our golden side to 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.200
 humans have some danger this snake 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.609
 so in terms of contact with humans we 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.970
 humans are not in the habit of eating 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:17.970
 of snakes sucuris for more stories 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.639
 that you try if you've already heard a lot of 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.389
 mouth sucuri on land is what is the shark 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.180
 from the sea 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.400
 eventually they may be threatened 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.249
 have to defend themselves and in these cases a 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.330
 record of some misfortune for human 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:33.719
 but very fast 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.249
 the fact that we have shoulders in the 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:37.020
 difference from all other animals and 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:39.990
 sucuri knows this and she will not be able to 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.569
 a year on the shoulders result 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.830
 we are not in her food habit 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.800
 You will not want to swallow us because 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.379
 You know that and you're really going to try a lot. 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.009
 more run away from us or did not want to be 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:55.050
 ignored to leave outside being in fact 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.659
 harmless to us do not need 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.400
 fear of being included in this environment here 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.810
 much less try to eliminate this 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.699
 environment where appropriate 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.169
 after noting that there is indeed a 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.229
 large work here 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.509
 What's the next step with you? 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.219
 will do so it can be done in 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.719
 relation to this is in fact a 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.039
 unpublished record for the central region 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:15.960
 the Rio Grande do Sul despite having 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.310
 very recent registrations have not been 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.479
 there was such a record 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.310
 so this scientific work is clear 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.110
 also the possibility of we do 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.039
 more detailed survey to try to 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:30.210
 find the animal actually register the 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:32.789
 size and indeed the species that right 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.430
 with great certainty won this anaconda 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.620
 possibility exists for the scientist and is 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.360
 This is the headless thing. 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.969
 survey now to try to see the 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.339
 extra bug the bug know its size 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:46.409
 In Ibama's authorization we have a 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:48.270
 good work but the plan does not handle the 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.909
 animal leave it in the environment is the only 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.800
 thing today is to climb represents am as 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:54.330
 the large repellents a point 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.589
 in this golden lake 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.589
 fantastic in the center of santa cruz
