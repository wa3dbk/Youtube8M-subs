don't<00:01:58.329> reach<00:01:58.630> further<00:01:58.869> than<00:01:59.110> 3/4<00:01:59.680> famille

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.800 

then<00:02:18.730> using<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.120> thin<00:02:19.360> brush<00:02:21.420> apply<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.450> over

then using a thin brush apply it over
the<00:02:22.990> white<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.590> would<00:02:24.280> advise<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.820> wait

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
till the white is completely dry well I

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.260 
till the white is completely dry well I
didn't<00:02:30.040> really<00:02:30.160> wait<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.700> long

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
didn't really wait that long

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.630 
didn't really wait that long
that<00:02:32.080> way<00:02:32.230> that's<00:02:32.740> why<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:32.890> was<00:02:33.070> doing<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.430> very

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
that way that's why I was doing it very

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:46.740 
that way that's why I was doing it very
very<00:02:33.910> light<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:38.350> just<00:02:39.250> play<00:02:39.460> with<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:43.800> make

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:58.110 
very light and just play with it make
long<00:02:48.480> thin<00:02:49.480> lanes<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.880> designs

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.110 

it's<00:02:59.120> easier<00:02:59.510> if<00:02:59.630> you<00:02:59.810> see<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> picture<00:03:00.830> of

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
it's easier if you see a picture of

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:27.000 
it's easier if you see a picture of
zebra<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.970> try<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.180> copy<00:03:05.450> it

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
now just with the white but I didn't

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.839 
now just with the white but I didn't
want<00:03:54.159> it<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.430> be<00:03:54.519> just<00:03:54.640> black<00:03:54.909> and<00:03:55.090> white<00:03:55.239> so

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
want it to be just black and white so

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:03.059 
want it to be just black and white so
I'm<00:03:58.079> going<00:03:59.079> over<00:03:59.260> with<00:04:01.319> this<00:04:02.319> shimmery<00:04:02.799> color

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
I'm going over with this shimmery color

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.490 
I'm going over with this shimmery color
over<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.760> white<00:04:03.940> area<00:04:04.390> it's<00:04:05.079> not<00:04:05.200> about

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
over the white area it's not about

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.360 
over the white area it's not about
hiding<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:06.129> white<00:04:06.280> it's<00:04:06.489> rather<00:04:07.049> about

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
hiding the white it's rather about

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.280 
hiding the white it's rather about
adding<00:04:09.370> a<00:04:09.489> bit<00:04:09.609> of<00:04:09.730> shimmer

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.129 

doesn't<00:04:15.129> really<00:04:15.879> show<00:04:16.180> on<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.570> picture<00:04:16.930> but

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
doesn't really show on the picture but

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.499 
doesn't really show on the picture but
in<00:04:17.380> real<00:04:17.769> life<00:04:18.009> it's<00:04:18.940> really<00:04:19.180> cute<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:21.360> if<00:04:22.360> you

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:22.509 
in real life it's really cute and if you

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:25.650 
in real life it's really cute and if you
like<00:04:22.750> rhinestones<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:24.910> can<00:04:25.090> add<00:04:25.210> some<00:04:25.479> as

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
like rhinestones you can add some as

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.779 
like rhinestones you can add some as
well<00:04:25.840> but<00:04:26.470> I<00:04:26.530> think<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:27.039> this<00:04:27.280> design<00:04:27.669> is

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
well but I think that this design is

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.800 
well but I think that this design is
it's<00:04:30.789> great<00:04:31.030> without<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:33.419> so<00:04:34.419> I<00:04:34.479> have<00:04:34.630> other

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
it's great without it so I have other

00:04:34.810 --> 00:05:01.610 
it's great without it so I have other
just<00:04:35.169> tree<00:04:35.620> rhinestones<00:04:36.280> on<00:04:36.789> my<00:04:37.449> ring<00:04:37.600> finger

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.000 

and<00:05:02.070> yet<00:05:02.780> of<00:05:03.780> course<00:05:03.840> still<00:05:04.410> everything<00:05:04.890> with

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
and yet of course still everything with

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.800 
and yet of course still everything with
the<00:05:05.130> top<00:05:05.340> coat<00:05:05.580> but<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.180> would<00:05:06.300> advise<00:05:06.570> you<00:05:06.780> to

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
the top coat but I would advise you to

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.500
