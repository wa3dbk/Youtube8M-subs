the other one of our Malley range ladies

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.380 
the other one of our Malley range ladies
against<00:00:55.559> an<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.770> rally<00:00:56.010> ax<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.460> moored<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
against an I rally ax a moored and a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.349 
against an I rally ax a moored and a
collie<00:00:57.750> twisted<00:00:58.530> fate<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> team<00:00:59.160> oh<00:00:59.359> it's

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
collie twisted fate and a team oh it's

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.380 
collie twisted fate and a team oh it's
either<00:01:00.539> more<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.260> mid<00:01:01.590> or<00:01:02.449> TF<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.899> would<00:01:04.080> think

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
either more to mid or TF I would think

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.240 
either more to mid or TF I would think
um<00:01:06.390> well<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> guess<00:01:07.380> we'll<00:01:07.500> see<00:01:07.710> when<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.950> when

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
um well I guess we'll see when this when

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.670 
um well I guess we'll see when this when
the<00:01:08.340> game<00:01:08.460> actually<00:01:08.640> starts

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.200 

so<00:01:13.400> let's<00:01:13.550> see<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:13.700> pretty<00:01:14.060> much<00:01:14.270> standard

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
so let's see a pretty much standard

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.680 
so let's see a pretty much standard
start<00:01:17.210> order<00:01:17.510> for<00:01:17.750> me<00:01:18.700> pointing<00:01:19.700> my<00:01:19.820> cue<00:01:20.470> and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
start order for me pointing my cue and

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.170 
start order for me pointing my cue and
let's<00:01:23.690> see<00:01:26.380> item<00:01:27.380> wise<00:01:27.590> we<00:01:28.550> have<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:28.700> physical

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
let's see item wise we have a physical

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.620 
let's see item wise we have a physical
caster<00:01:29.720> caster<00:01:30.320> caster<00:01:31.190> sort<00:01:32.000> of<00:01:32.090> caster<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:32.570> I

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
caster caster caster sort of caster so I

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.510 
caster caster caster sort of caster so I
think<00:01:32.720> I<00:01:32.900> take<00:01:33.080> a<00:01:33.110> magic<00:01:33.470> as<00:01:33.560> a<00:01:33.590> close<00:01:33.800> resist

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
think I take a magic as a close resist

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.200 
think I take a magic as a close resist
cloak<00:01:34.760> at<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:35.000> start<00:01:35.330> arm<00:01:36.729> would<00:01:37.729> be<00:01:37.910> my<00:01:38.030> best

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
cloak at the start arm would be my best

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.940 
cloak at the start arm would be my best
guess<00:01:38.360> at<00:01:38.690> my<00:01:38.840> start<00:01:41.590> but<00:01:42.590> I<00:01:42.619> guess<00:01:42.800> I'll<00:01:42.920> find

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
guess at my start but I guess I'll find

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.469 
guess at my start but I guess I'll find
out<00:01:43.250> I'm<00:01:43.369> sorry<00:01:43.550> nope<00:01:43.729> apparently<00:01:44.300> i<00:01:44.330> take

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.580 
cloth armor not really sure why it could
be<00:01:48.560> because<00:01:48.680> i<00:01:48.890> don't<00:01:49.100> know<00:01:49.160> whether<00:01:49.490> or<00:01:49.610> not<00:01:49.790> a

be because i don't know whether or not a

ideas<00:01:59.570> that<00:01:59.840> make<00:02:00.020> sense<00:02:00.380> when<00:02:00.619> I<00:02:00.649> did<00:02:00.890> when<00:02:01.130> I

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
ideas that make sense when I did when I

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.840 
ideas that make sense when I did when I
when<00:02:02.869> I'm<00:02:02.960> playing<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.979> make<00:02:04.190> a<00:02:04.220> lot<00:02:04.430> lessons

when I'm playing that make a lot lessons

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.479 
when I'm playing that make a lot lessons
watching<00:02:05.330> now<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:08.410> guess<00:02:09.410> we'll<00:02:09.619> see<00:02:09.860> minions

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049

pretty handy this is an old game older
game<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:33.530> uh<00:02:34.000> chemo<00:02:35.000> mushrooms<00:02:35.480> we<00:02:35.570> can

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
game so uh chemo mushrooms we can

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.140 
game so uh chemo mushrooms we can
technically<00:02:36.530> block<00:02:37.060> q<00:02:38.060> shots<00:02:38.299> by<00:02:38.450> Kenan<00:02:38.780> so<00:02:39.080> I

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
technically block q shots by Kenan so I

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.070 
technically block q shots by Kenan so I
doubt<00:02:41.150> that<00:02:41.180> will<00:02:41.420> play<00:02:41.540> like<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.720> really<00:02:41.900> huge

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
doubt that will play like a really huge

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.490 
doubt that will play like a really huge
role<00:02:42.350> but<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.620> might<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:44.600> it's<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:45.049> really<00:02:45.470> a

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
role but it might so it's I really a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.060

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:35.659 
Sirocco we're doing okay up here we're

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:36.999 
Sirocco we're doing okay up here we're
getting<00:04:35.839> a<00:04:35.899> little<00:04:36.050> bit<00:04:36.259> pressed<00:04:36.439> out<00:04:36.649> but<00:04:36.979> uh

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
getting a little bit pressed out but uh

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.339 
getting a little bit pressed out but uh
as<00:04:37.639> long<00:04:37.939> as<00:04:38.239> they'll<00:04:38.449> as<00:04:38.839> long<00:04:38.989> as<00:04:39.139> are<00:04:39.229> many

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
as long as they'll as long as are many

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.219 
as long as they'll as long as are many
their<00:04:39.800> minions<00:04:40.009> are<00:04:40.249> hitting<00:04:40.489> our<00:04:40.580> tower<00:04:41.229> or

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
their minions are hitting our tower or

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.179 
their minions are hitting our tower or
are<00:04:43.219> are<00:04:43.610> avoiding<00:04:44.599> turret<00:04:45.439> range<00:04:45.679> basically

00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:46.189 
are are avoiding turret range basically

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:48.929 
are are avoiding turret range basically
we're<00:04:46.339> okay<00:04:46.899> you<00:04:47.899> know<00:04:48.019> we<00:04:48.169> can<00:04:48.319> easily<00:04:48.499> just

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:48.939 
we're okay you know we can easily just

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.540 
we're okay you know we can easily just
pick<00:04:49.939> up<00:04:50.089> a<00:04:50.649> last<00:04:51.649> hits<00:04:51.889> without<00:04:52.129> much<00:04:52.309> effort

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
pick up a last hits without much effort

00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:03.249 
pick up a last hits without much effort
you<00:05:01.119> see<00:05:02.119> which<00:05:02.209> is<00:05:02.330> kind<00:05:02.539> of<00:05:02.599> picking<00:05:02.899> up<00:05:03.050> last

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
you see which is kind of picking up last

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:11.100 
you see which is kind of picking up last
hits<00:05:03.469> as<00:05:03.589> best<00:05:03.769> we<00:05:03.829> can

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.869 

you<00:05:12.110> see<00:05:12.319> some<00:05:12.710> pretty<00:05:12.830> fast<00:05:13.159> last<00:05:13.430> sitting<00:05:13.699> we

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:13.879 
you see some pretty fast last sitting we

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.790 
you see some pretty fast last sitting we
only<00:05:13.999> missed<00:05:14.240> like<00:05:14.509> I<00:05:14.719> think<00:05:15.199> three<00:05:15.499> things<00:05:15.710> in

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
only missed like I think three things in

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.080 
only missed like I think three things in
that<00:05:15.889> way<00:05:16.009> of<00:05:16.069> not<00:05:16.280> not<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.610> greatest<00:05:16.849> but

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
that way of not not the greatest but

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.939 
that way of not not the greatest but
considering<00:05:18.050> it's<00:05:18.139> against<00:05:18.349> our<00:05:18.439> tower<00:05:18.620> not

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
considering it's against our tower not

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:24.159 
considering it's against our tower not
too<00:05:19.159> bad<00:05:22.479> pcs<00:05:23.479> just<00:05:23.629> kind<00:05:23.779> of<00:05:23.810> picking<00:05:24.050> the

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
too bad pcs just kind of picking the

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.890 
too bad pcs just kind of picking the
morgue<00:05:24.469> a<00:05:24.560> little<00:05:24.770> more<00:05:25.009> to<00:05:25.039> a<00:05:25.129> little<00:05:25.310> bit<00:05:25.460> um

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
morgue a little more to a little bit um

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.269 
morgue a little more to a little bit um
obviously<00:05:26.900> not<00:05:27.229> the<00:05:27.379> best<00:05:27.620> focused<00:05:28.009> target

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:28.279 
obviously not the best focused target

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:30.730 
obviously not the best focused target
for<00:05:28.490> us<00:05:28.610> he's<00:05:29.389> got<00:05:29.539> a<00:05:29.569> nice<00:05:29.990> amount<00:05:30.259> of<00:05:30.409> magic

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
for us he's got a nice amount of magic

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.640 
for us he's got a nice amount of magic
resistant<00:05:31.189> armor<00:05:31.639> um<00:05:34.180> though<00:05:35.180> the<00:05:35.509> Akalis<00:05:36.439> got

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
resistant armor um though the Akalis got

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.589 
resistant armor um though the Akalis got
a<00:05:36.680> really<00:05:37.610> really<00:05:37.729> high<00:05:37.999> amount<00:05:38.270> of<00:05:38.300> magic

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
a really really high amount of magic

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.279 
a really really high amount of magic
resist<00:05:38.900> um<00:05:39.409> I<00:05:40.689> assume<00:05:41.689> she's<00:05:41.930> just<00:05:42.110> probably

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
resist um I assume she's just probably

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.019 
resist um I assume she's just probably
running<00:05:42.650> defense<00:05:42.860> mastery<00:05:43.460> and<00:05:43.490> probably<00:05:43.879> has

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
running defense mastery and probably has

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:48.580 
running defense mastery and probably has
magic<00:05:44.419> resist<00:05:44.689> blues<00:05:45.139> um<00:05:45.949> I<00:05:47.169> my<00:05:48.169> opinion<00:05:48.500> on

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
magic resist blues um I my opinion on

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.830 
magic resist blues um I my opinion on
that<00:05:48.740> I<00:05:48.979> think<00:05:49.819> it's<00:05:49.939> probably<00:05:50.389> better<00:05:50.719> for

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
that I think it's probably better for

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.200 
that I think it's probably better for
her<00:05:51.080> to<00:05:51.110> have<00:05:51.319> cool<00:05:51.680> down<00:05:51.860> maybe<00:05:52.099> um<00:05:55.210> or

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
her to have cool down maybe um or

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.529 
her to have cool down maybe um or
possibly<00:05:57.279> ap<00:05:58.279> so<00:05:58.490> that<00:05:58.639> she<00:05:58.759> can<00:05:58.909> trigger<00:05:59.270> that

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
possibly ap so that she can trigger that

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.240 
possibly ap so that she can trigger that
uh<00:05:59.599> that<00:05:59.900> secondary<00:06:00.379> passive<00:06:00.800> in<00:06:00.889> the<00:06:00.919> early

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
uh that secondary passive in the early

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.670 
uh that secondary passive in the early
game<00:06:01.370> might<00:06:02.360> be<00:06:02.389> a<00:06:02.689> really<00:06:02.930> good<00:06:03.139> idea<00:06:03.199> to<00:06:03.500> have

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
game might be a really good idea to have

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.769 
game might be a really good idea to have
that<00:06:04.120> because<00:06:05.120> I'm<00:06:05.210> not<00:06:05.300> sure<00:06:05.479> how<00:06:05.599> many

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:05.779 
that because I'm not sure how many

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:07.209 
that because I'm not sure how many
points<00:06:05.900> away<00:06:06.199> from<00:06:06.229> clearing<00:06:06.650> her<00:06:06.830> secondary

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
points away from clearing her secondary

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:09.189 
points away from clearing her secondary
passive<00:06:07.610> she<00:06:07.699> actually<00:06:07.819> is<00:06:08.180> but<00:06:08.479> considering

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
passive she actually is but considering

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.749 
passive she actually is but considering
that<00:06:09.259> she's<00:06:09.439> level<00:06:09.740> three<00:06:10.129> and<00:06:10.159> probably

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 
that she's level three and probably

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:15.339 
that she's level three and probably
doesn't<00:06:11.060> have<00:06:11.210> the<00:06:11.800> that<00:06:12.800> attack
