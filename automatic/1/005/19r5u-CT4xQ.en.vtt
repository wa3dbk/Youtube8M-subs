00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
xbox 360 here that I modified with the

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.200 
xbox 360 here that I modified with the
jtag<00:00:09.330> SMC<00:00:10.139> exploit<00:00:10.530> so<00:00:11.340> when<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.759> starts<00:00:12.059> up

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
jtag SMC exploit so when it starts up

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.839 
jtag SMC exploit so when it starts up
instead<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.719> loading<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.549> dashboard<00:00:14.549> for<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
instead of loading the dashboard for the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.570 
instead of loading the dashboard for the
360<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.929> will<00:00:16.230> load<00:00:16.410> into<00:00:16.770> zel<00:00:17.100> which<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
360 it will load into zel which is a

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.630 
360 it will load into zel which is a
linux<00:00:18.359> boot<00:00:18.539> loader<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:20.250> flash<00:00:20.609> drive

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
linux boot loader on the flash drive

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.670 
linux boot loader on the flash drive
I've<00:00:21.300> got<00:00:21.859> gin<00:00:22.859> too<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:24.289> that<00:00:25.289> should

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
I've got gin too and that should

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.660 
I've got gin too and that should
hopefully<00:00:26.099> boot<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:27.769> some<00:00:28.769> let's<00:00:29.519> go<00:00:29.640> ahead

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
hopefully boot up some let's go ahead

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:45.750 
hopefully boot up some let's go ahead
and<00:00:29.789> start<00:00:30.150> it

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.689 

alright<00:00:46.570> and<00:00:46.870> there<00:00:47.079> we<00:00:47.199> go<00:00:47.379> that<00:00:48.160> blue<00:00:48.399> screen

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
alright and there we go that blue screen

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.959 
alright and there we go that blue screen
is<00:00:48.820> l<00:00:49.089> and<00:00:49.480> there's<00:00:49.750> a<00:00:50.309> cpu<00:00:51.309> key<00:00:51.519> there<00:00:51.730> that<00:00:51.879> i

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
is l and there's a cpu key there that i

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:59.080 
is l and there's a cpu key there that i
want<00:00:52.180> anyone<00:00:52.510> see

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:09.380 

and<00:00:59.860> looks<00:01:00.860> like<00:01:01.040> it's<00:01:01.250> loading<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:02.500> file

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.560 

yeah<00:01:09.990> there<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.440> go

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.410 

and<00:01:14.409> we're<00:01:14.920> now<00:01:15.070> in<00:01:15.310> Linux

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:28.850 

it's<00:01:20.930> my<00:01:21.080> grandma<00:01:21.500> wild's<00:01:22.130> keyboard

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.040 

it's<00:01:29.910> searching<00:01:30.910> for<00:01:31.120> devices<00:01:31.570> now<00:01:31.750> and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
it's searching for devices now and

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.300 
it's searching for devices now and
because<00:01:32.620> I<00:01:32.680> don't<00:01:32.830> have<00:01:32.860> a<00:01:32.980> hard<00:01:33.160> drive

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
because I don't have a hard drive

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.870 
because I don't have a hard drive
connected<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.240> can't<00:01:34.480> find<00:01:34.750> anything<00:01:35.110> to<00:01:35.320> boot

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
connected it can't find anything to boot

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.440 
connected it can't find anything to boot
so<00:01:37.620> what<00:01:38.620> I'm<00:01:38.680> going<00:01:38.770> to<00:01:38.830> do<00:01:38.979> here<00:01:39.010> is<00:01:39.280> just<00:01:39.450> get

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
so what I'm going to do here is just get

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:47.100 
so what I'm going to do here is just get
it<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:40.810> terminal<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:44.460> there<00:01:45.460> we<00:01:45.580> go<00:01:45.760> so<00:01:46.720> now

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
it to a terminal and there we go so now

00:01:47.110 --> 00:02:05.410 
it to a terminal and there we go so now
we<00:01:47.170> have<00:01:47.440> a<00:01:48.930> live<00:01:49.930> CD<00:01:50.610> terminal

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.210 

so<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.780> see<00:02:06.960> you've<00:02:07.140> got<00:02:07.170> all<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.680> good

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.740 
so you can see you've got all the good
old-fashioned<00:02:08.850> linux<00:02:09.770> commands<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.750> stuff

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
old-fashioned linux commands and stuff

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.650 
old-fashioned linux commands and stuff
like<00:02:12.990> that<00:02:13.430> it's<00:02:14.430> nothing<00:02:14.670> really<00:02:15.060> fancy<00:02:15.210> but

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
like that it's nothing really fancy but

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.400 
like that it's nothing really fancy but
people<00:02:15.930> have<00:02:16.020> gotten<00:02:17.390> debian<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.690> ubuntu

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
people have gotten debian and ubuntu

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.230 
people have gotten debian and ubuntu
running<00:02:20.070> on<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.460> people<00:02:20.580> are<00:02:20.790> working<00:02:21.090> on

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
running on it and people are working on

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.480 
running on it and people are working on
getting<00:02:21.930> more<00:02:23.210> you<00:02:24.210> can<00:02:24.360> actually<00:02:24.510> see<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
getting more you can actually see the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.000 
getting more you can actually see the
the<00:02:26.490> Rings<00:02:26.960> you<00:02:27.960> can<00:02:28.110> set<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.440> color<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.890> them

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
the Rings you can set the color on them

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.310 
the Rings you can set the color on them

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
can combine them to make orange and you

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.480 
can combine them to make orange and you
can<00:02:37.050> set<00:02:37.230> each<00:02:37.260> quadrant<00:02:37.650> cool<00:02:38.220> stuff<00:02:38.430> like

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
can set each quadrant cool stuff like

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.699 
can set each quadrant cool stuff like
that<00:02:38.610> if<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:40.020> want<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.230> know<00:02:40.290> more<00:02:40.440> about<00:02:40.500> it
