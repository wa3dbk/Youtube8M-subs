00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
you I tix iron mask in operation okay so

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.480 
you I tix iron mask in operation okay so
here<00:02:01.030> are<00:02:01.900> so<00:02:02.110> absorbent<00:02:02.530> materials<00:02:03.040> okay<00:02:03.430> so

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
here are so absorbent materials okay so

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.660 
here are so absorbent materials okay so
this<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:04.330> an<00:02:04.450> untreated<00:02:05.170> piece<00:02:05.470> cut<00:02:06.040> right

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
this is an untreated piece cut right

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.999 
this is an untreated piece cut right
suck<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.780> blue<00:02:07.960> peter<00:02:08.229> are<00:02:08.500> you<00:02:08.590> but<00:02:08.740> it<00:02:08.830> really
