00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.220 
least I think so I probably bail
although<00:02:10.000> for<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.330> while<00:02:10.479> she<00:02:10.660> called<00:02:10.869> me<00:02:10.989> a<00:02:11.020> mil

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
although for a while she called me a mil

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.020 
although for a while she called me a mil
chauvinist<00:02:11.770> piglet<00:02:12.099> when<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.489> was<00:02:12.610> growing<00:02:12.880> up

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
chauvinist piglet when I was growing up

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.750 
chauvinist piglet when I was growing up
and<00:02:13.239> then<00:02:13.840> she<00:02:14.080> kind<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:15.310> know<00:02:15.340> got<00:02:15.610> me<00:02:15.730> on

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
and then she kind of you know got me on

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.890 
and then she kind of you know got me on
the<00:02:15.880> right<00:02:16.030> track<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:17.110> think<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.940> could<00:02:19.450> be<00:02:19.690> I

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
the right track I think I could be I

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.240 
the right track I think I could be I
wanted<00:02:20.349> to<00:02:20.410> be<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.530> no<00:02:20.860> in<00:02:21.130> there<00:02:21.730> still<00:02:21.910> as<00:02:22.030> bad

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
wanted to be a no in there still as bad

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.650 
wanted to be a no in there still as bad
so<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.280> think<00:02:24.400> that's<00:02:24.700> what<00:02:25.300> I<00:02:25.330> got<00:02:25.510> from<00:02:25.569> that

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
so I think that's what I got from that

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.720 
so I think that's what I got from that
angry<00:02:26.500> go<00:02:26.709> with<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:26.920> oaks<00:02:27.040> marrying<00:02:27.519> into<00:02:27.640> the
