to<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.409> does<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.710> work<00:01:28.979> 60<00:01:29.610> ish

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
to it I think it does like work 60 ish

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.700 
to it I think it does like work 60 ish
percent<00:01:30.869> when<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.079> say<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.350> real<00:01:31.500> quick

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.080 
percent when you say it's real quick
it's<00:01:32.340> gonna<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.610> sixty<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.939> seventy

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
it's gonna be like sixty to seventy

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.270 
it's gonna be like sixty to seventy
percent<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:33.869> um<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.680> guess<00:01:34.860> he<00:01:35.009> might<00:01:35.159> be

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
percent but um I guess he might be

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.440 
percent but um I guess he might be
slower<00:01:35.460> something<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.000> he's<00:01:36.090> gonna<00:01:36.210> switch

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
slower something so he's gonna switch

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.060 
slower something so he's gonna switch
out<00:01:36.570> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.960> his<00:01:37.079> la<00:01:37.259> di<00:01:37.409> scares<00:01:37.770> I'm<00:01:37.920> just

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
out and latias goes down which is huge

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.550 
out and latias goes down which is huge
because<00:01:48.600> i<00:01:48.750> think<00:01:48.810> was<00:01:49.049> one<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> most

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
because i think was one of the most

because i think was one of the most
annoying<00:01:49.860> pokemon<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.549> my<00:01:50.640> team<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.850> face<00:01:51.119> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
annoying pokemon for my team to face and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.359 
annoying pokemon for my team to face and
it<00:01:51.780> out<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.079> way<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.470> nice<00:01:52.590> but<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
it out of the way is really nice but the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.710 
it out of the way is really nice but the

way he brings in charger tells me that

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.300 
way he brings in charger tells me that
he's<00:01:54.840> probably<00:01:55.049> timid<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.829> he<00:01:55.979> knows<00:01:56.100> he's

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
he's probably timid so he knows he's

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.690 
he's probably timid so he knows he's
