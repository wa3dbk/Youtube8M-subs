achieve thickness and you know also get

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.140 
achieve thickness and you know also get
the<00:03:07.560> length<00:03:07.799> without<00:03:08.160> my<00:03:08.519> hands<00:03:08.790> being

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
the length without my hands being

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.850 
the length without my hands being
see-through<00:03:09.840> or<00:03:10.049> very<00:03:10.260> thing<00:03:10.530> because<00:03:10.769> I

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
see-through or very thing because I

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.729 
see-through or very thing because I
would<00:03:11.010> rather<00:03:11.129> have<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.840> shorter<00:03:12.840> length<00:03:13.470> up

here<00:03:14.069> I'm<00:03:14.250> not<00:03:14.370> going<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.610> say<00:03:14.730> short<00:03:15.060> sure

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
here I'm not going to say short sure

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.460 
here I'm not going to say short sure
because<00:03:15.330> armpit<00:03:15.840> means<00:03:16.049> is<00:03:16.560> long<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.810> I'm

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470
