00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:16.100
 are three letters and r &amp; r means in the 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.480
 case of the public company tracsa that 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.249
 depends on the Spanish society of 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.369
 industrial holdings of the sep and 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:24.349
 possible dismissal of 1,639 people 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.689
 however in this interview the 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.999
 president of tracks to the sweet that is 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.220
 possible to reduce that figure and even 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.710
 reach a negotiated solution with the 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.989
 unions the issue is on the table 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.989
 and yesterday was a strike day 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.850
 and you two years in front of tracks there 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.429
 I believe that today is a complicated day 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.870
 because there is a strike there is no way out 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:51.579
 that was the only solution is to unite and 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.250
 throw out 1,600 people 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.400
 well, if there is, if there is, 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.470
 what it raises is that 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.280
 Hispanic setter as they say 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.680
 There are over 639 thousand lawyers left in 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.930
 rates but act disparate and bush is to say yes 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.780
 we do not modify anything and the legislation 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.240
 labor is sufficiently flexible to 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.940
 launch a series of measures that 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.640
 significantly reduce that figure 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.470
 it is true that the moments are very 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.630
 complicated but have converged two 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.060
 things in the first place has concluded a 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.300
 dramatic fall of ours 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.460
 parcels tracsa can not participate 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.260
 in tracsa tenders only 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.229
 personally I work for a 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.850
 direct commission and consequently 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.229
 Because the encomiendas have gone down a lot 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.880
 as a result of the reduction of 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.680
 drones budgets of the ministries 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.979
 the autonomous communities to give a 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.290
 figure our activity has been 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.930
 reduced to 40 percent in three years 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.340
 that is our turnover in the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.359
 2013 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.890
 is a 40 to create the 2009 of 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.619
 dolphinarium children later 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.259
 2012 that has happened meanwhile that 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.469
 our permanent staff has grown as 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.439
 consequence of cord impacts with 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.420
 my direct predecessors must have thought 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.340
 that circumstances did not allow 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.099
 tend to allow although not really 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.720
 has been so they allowed a series 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.629
 of casual workers converting them 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.310
 in landlines and I joined to get into 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:26.160
 January 2012 and month by month I see that my 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.560
 order book goes down and my 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.750
 fixed template goes up as 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.630
 consequence if that had not been done 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.060
 well let's say the ere would be minimal or 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.340
 even even non-existent but 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.470
 unfortunately we have met with 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.810
 that the policy that was carried in the 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.670
 enormously optimistic policy that 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.310
 this was going to keep going all over 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.870
 years and what he did was to go down and that 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.370
 You have to see that they do not pay 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.620
 municipalities the payments to 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.159
 institutions and that is a problem 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.190
 not so important is not to say a 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.530
 certain cost the cost of financing 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.599
 we have to resort to credits of 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.790
 circulating to pay is but let's say 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.409
 it's a different problem that is to say for 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.799
 us the problem that really 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:13.709
 we have is the fall of the parcels 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.510
 not the fact that they pay us right 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.579
 the encomiendas that we have of course 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.379
 it's not a taste dish but let's say 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.200
 that do not have a direct relationship with 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.420
 the staff do not assume certain costs 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.090
 financial economic results 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.640
 they are worse if they did not exist but 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.129
 not in any way of the magnitude 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.349
 enough to determine that it is 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.489
 necessary or necessary exercise by 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.159
 so that you maybe that 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.840
 1,600 euros reduced figure I trust 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.599
 that if I trust that yes because there 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.220
 there are many there are many formulas in the 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.990
 legislation for what well then there 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.300
 geographical mobility formulas 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.740
 displace workers from the zones 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.100
 where it is missing through where it is left 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:57.159
 work where it is missing 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:01.519
 functional mobility that is 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:03.109
 and give workers a position 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.299
 different from the one they occupied in 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.459
 reductions of working hours reductions 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.349
 salary is to say we can all do 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.900
 some sacrifice and take out the company 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.310
 forward in fact in the aspect of the 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.400
 functional morbidity is not where else 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.769
 hope I have because in a very study 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.030
 serious that we have ordered out to 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.850
 always capture the image of 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.340
 impartiality what is detected is that 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.900
 tracsa has certain in 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.349
 certain specific responses 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.180
 We need to hire hiring areas 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.370
 staff in those areas and for those 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.860
 posts that is what I want it to be 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.509
 people behind other provinces of your 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.810
 occupations who occupies it but of course 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.610
 with the current agreement which penalizes 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.990
 terribly the displacements 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.750
 geographical and skills 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.880
 functional scheme numbers come out 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.700
 it is fire fire against the things that 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.700
 were adopted in periods in which 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.690
 an excessive bonanza in which it was thought 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.620
 that bonanza and will continue 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.690
 eternally and an agreement was signed in 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.180
 circumstances in now 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.400
 has seen that it is too unbalanced 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:12.530
 then we do bring the agreement to 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.210
 more reasonable terms because they can be 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.610
 start up all these partners things 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.650
 and I have what I have founded 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.350
 hopes that the final figure will be 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.000
 noticeably lower not only 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.090
 noticeably lower but that 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.800
 we get and donate an agreement with the 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.810
 union regeneration that is a part 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.060
 fundamental thank you very much friends 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.060
 I would miss some more pleasure
