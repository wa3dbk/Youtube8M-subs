there's really no reason for me to have

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.109 
there's really no reason for me to have
that<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:46.380> got<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.829> orbital<00:01:47.460> care<00:01:47.610> package<00:01:47.939> four

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
that we got a orbital care package four

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.609 
that we got a orbital care package four
minutes<00:01:48.360> into<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.659> next<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.200> then<00:01:49.350> we

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
minutes into the next one and then we

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.289 
minutes into the next one and then we
got<00:01:49.770> 25<00:01:50.130> minutes<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.460> double<00:01:50.700> XP<00:01:51.030> which<00:01:51.180> I

guess is pretty cool and these are
pretty<00:03:18.920> nice<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.370> like<00:03:19.579> the<00:03:19.730> color<00:03:20.180> of<00:03:20.269> the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420
