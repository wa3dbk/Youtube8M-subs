out<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:55.530> thought<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:57.210> would<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.510> floating

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
out I thought that we would do floating

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.840 
out I thought that we would do floating
cloud<00:00:58.230> nails<00:00:58.680> since<00:00:59.070> we're<00:00:59.250> doing<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.550> float

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
cloud nails since we're doing a float

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.869 
cloud nails since we're doing a float
okay<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.690> these<00:01:01.140> are<00:01:01.620> like<00:01:02.129> some<00:01:02.399> galloped

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
okay so these are like some galloped

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.789 
okay so these are like some galloped
nail<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.110> whatever<00:01:04.530> three

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
nail so you like it whatever three

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.109 
nail so you like it whatever three
colors<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.220> want<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.880> use<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
colors you want and then you use a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300 
colors you want and then you use a
dotting<00:01:06.510> tool<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:07.320> make<00:01:07.409> little<00:01:07.710> dots<00:01:07.890> and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
dotting tool to make little dots and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.980 
dotting tool to make little dots and
then<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.820> make<00:01:08.970> another<00:01:09.000> row<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.450> little<00:01:09.840> dots

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
then you make another row of little dots

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.660 
then you make another row of little dots
and<00:01:10.439> then<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.619> fill<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.130> always<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.640> that

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
and then you fill it in always in that

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.700 
and then you fill it in always in that
