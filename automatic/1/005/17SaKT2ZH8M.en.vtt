00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 Hello everyone, today I will ask you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.269
 see how to connect your tax PC 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.559
 involving an external monitor 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.559
 of one thing however to procure you 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.949
 obviously an external monitor a pc and the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.779
 cable that connects the monitor to the PC if 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.310
 go to an electronics store and 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.650
 ask for a cable to connect yours 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.779
 Portable computer operators will do 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.460
 see all possible cables and 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:36.230
 any taken however connected 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.410
 selected on the monitor the output of 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.280
 computer 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.410
 the services will appear doubly so 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.690
 screen that is the things you will do on one 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:53.879
 screen on the other will be the same as in 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.070
 a horrible double thing and to have two 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.690
 then use the two schemes then 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.219
 eg move folders from one 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.680
 screen to another of his story of 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.500
 second on two screens to take to 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.420
 folders from one screen to another or 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.030
 I don't know for example the panel of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.900
 check any other window 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.670
 athletes dragged by a screen 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:18.520
 to the other to do this thing 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.710
 you will have to go on aldo hardware and sounds 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.020
 on connect to an external screen 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.540
 here's what the two will display 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.310
 screens selecting on the screen will be 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.680
 the main screen that is the one of the 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.909
 your computer the main one if 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.729
 you have a porter obviously will be 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.799
 the one attached to the at the keyboard 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.509
 center agreed and will be a fixed will 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.250
 practically indifferent why 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.950
 however in two monitors they will be symbols 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.340
 or almost still regards having a 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.530
 gup portable fixed the screen 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.960
 main as a could not have 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.960
 like sky, not only two main screens 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.869
 because for example the games those there a 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.240
 full screen the screen will open 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.270
 only on one screen is it only on the 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.399
 first screen 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.929
 because the main screen that 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.459
 could we can choose precisely if 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:12.000
 know the laptop screen so the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.129
 generic plug'n'play alone monitor 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.080
 there is a violent taste of Calabria and what it will be 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:21.549
 any resolution there is my 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:25.060
 recommended choice in 1366 x 768 that 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:28.269
 usually for a laptop computer 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.490
 from 15 inches to 17 and more or less is 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.620
 this 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.510
 so it will be more on the screens we can 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.060
 do duplicate these screens ie 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.710
 duplicate what I will do in my writes 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.080
 main on the best even 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.680
 on the external screen not only desktop 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.180
 stress which are only one plus two 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.370
 according to you do and stand of these 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.910
 screens so that your desktop 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.430
 will be wider 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.810
 then now according to schemes to set up 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.720
 the various settings 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.400
 obviously if you choose the second one 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.350
 you can set a resolution myself 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.190
 I keep that of the external screen 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.700
 equal to the one in the mystery 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.570
 main because the icons will be of the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.040
 his greatness 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.110
 standing one on the ground by a screen 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.300
 to the other the size of the chapel 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.280
 will remain unchanged in my opinion is more 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.400
 convenient to use it 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.750
 resolution both the first and the second 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.970
 these obviously used 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.850
 and ends by 15 inches you have 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.470
 connected to your TV from 40 maybe 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.150
 you can also select a resolution 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.040
 greater because you pour better ones 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.100
 rather low solutions will be seen 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.700
 image quality will be worse though 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.930
 I have a 17 inch screen 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.140
 auxiliary I will use the same 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.140
 resolution 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.330
 do what you can do you can apply 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.500
 to close 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.900
 so now your screens will be 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.480
 two though punished because I want to 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.670
 move a file to a folder one 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.220
 window with anything from one 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.459
 screen to the other this thing a lot 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.099
 convenient just to edit videos 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:14.190
 in fact you will be able to keep on a diagram the 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:17.340
 program where mount mountain network the video 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.250
 on the other, maybe all the files open 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.220
 of folders containing various files 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.710
 audio and video and you can mount on one 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.810
 screen and then it is comfortable in general 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.510
 I think it's very comfortable I come in 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.639
 screens obviously need to have the 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.180
 second screen because if a second 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.340
 screen 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.040
 you will have to get it 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:43.320
 ok guys for builders and that's it 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.320
 hello everyone and the next video
