good old fine and dandy for me it was a

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.429 
good old fine and dandy for me it was a
very<00:01:59.549> tough<00:01:59.880> game<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.329> was<00:02:00.390> new<00:02:00.600> clothes<00:02:01.140> it

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
very tough game it was new clothes it

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.940
