00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
looks like a sick map probably not the

looks like a sick map probably not the
snowy<00:00:51.449> map<00:00:51.750> because<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.050> more<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
snowy map because it's more like a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.479 
snowy map because it's more like a

through all the guns I I did this

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.410 
through all the guns I I did this
because<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.590> wanted<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:50.860> try<00:02:51.130> out<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.490> all<00:02:51.760> the

because I wanted to try out the all the
updated<00:02:52.870> guns<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.350> see<00:02:53.560> how<00:02:53.920> they<00:02:54.250> were<00:02:55.170> but

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
updated guns to see how they were but

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.560 
updated guns to see how they were but
yeah<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.530> did<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.190> kind<00:02:57.910> of<00:02:58.000> failed<00:02:58.300> with<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
yeah I did that kind of failed with the

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.390 
yeah I did that kind of failed with the
shotgun<00:02:59.340> but<00:03:00.340> still<00:03:00.760> pick<00:03:00.940> them<00:03:01.060> both<00:03:01.180> up<00:03:02.400> so

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
shotgun but still pick them both up so

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.480 
shotgun but still pick them both up so
now<00:03:03.520> I'm<00:03:03.640> basically<00:03:04.000> just<00:03:04.090> Manning<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:05.080> back

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
now I'm basically just Manning the back

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.730 
now I'm basically just Manning the back
because<00:03:06.490> they<00:03:06.790> spawn<00:03:07.209> up<00:03:07.390> there<00:03:07.780> even<00:03:08.650> though

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
because they spawn up there even though

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.170 
because they spawn up there even though
wasn't<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.190> one<00:03:09.580> of<00:03:09.670> my<00:03:09.730> brighter<00:03:10.030> ideas

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
wasn't a one of my brighter ideas

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.440 
wasn't a one of my brighter ideas
because<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:11.110> shuck<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.620> has<00:03:11.709> no<00:03:11.890> range<00:03:12.450> so

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
because the shuck and has no range so
