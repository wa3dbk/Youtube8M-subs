00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
the scrum a box actually doesn't so I

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.000

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
received a message from one of my

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.810 
received a message from one of my
subscribers<00:00:27.470> about<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> week<00:00:28.710> ago<00:00:28.859> just<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.580> say

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
subscribers about a week ago just to say

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.510 
subscribers about a week ago just to say
there's<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.390> new<00:00:30.660> box<00:00:30.929> or<00:00:31.320> sort<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.250> another

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
there's a new box or sort of another

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.819 
there's a new box or sort of another
subscription<00:00:32.940> box<00:00:33.329> called<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> Savior<00:00:34.649> box

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
subscription box called the Savior box

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.200 
subscription box called the Savior box
and<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:36.320> think<00:00:37.320> first<00:00:37.559> box<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.640> don't

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
and I think first box is like I don't

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.549 
and I think first box is like I don't
know<00:00:39.329> think<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.629> 10<00:00:39.840> pounds<00:00:40.170> off<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> first

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
know think it 10 pounds off the first

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.830 
know think it 10 pounds off the first
box<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.399> pay<00:00:41.579> four<00:00:41.940> pounds<00:00:42.300> 95

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
box so you just pay four pounds 95

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.080 
box so you just pay four pounds 95
that's<00:00:43.170> including<00:00:43.590> delivery<00:00:43.940> generally<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
that's including delivery generally the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.080 
that's including delivery generally the
box<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.510> 14<00:00:46.230> pounds<00:00:46.620> 95<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.610> little<00:00:47.789> bit<00:00:47.940> more

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
box is 14 pounds 95 so a little bit more

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.270 
box is 14 pounds 95 so a little bit more
expensive<00:00:48.329> than<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.780> average<00:00:49.200> boxes<00:00:49.680> but

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
expensive than the average boxes but

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.250 
expensive than the average boxes but
they<00:00:50.430> have<00:00:50.610> quite<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.969> huge<00:00:51.329> range<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.930> choice

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
they have quite a huge range of choice

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.389 
they have quite a huge range of choice
also<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:54.469> receive<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> BOK<00:00:55.800> weekly

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
also you can receive the BOK weekly

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.849 
also you can receive the BOK weekly
fortnightly<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.750> monthly<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.649> bit

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
fortnightly and monthly so it's a bit

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.170 
fortnightly and monthly so it's a bit
more<00:00:59.510> convenient<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.600> you're<00:01:00.989> looking<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.500> a

it<00:04:50.900> was<00:04:51.129> but<00:04:52.129> I<00:04:52.490> didn't<00:04:52.849> really<00:04:52.879> like<00:04:53.150> it<00:04:53.180> it

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
it was but I didn't really like it it

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.339

I'm<00:04:57.349> hoping<00:04:57.680> this<00:04:57.800> leg<00:04:58.039> is<00:04:58.069> gonna<00:04:58.340> be<00:04:58.430> better<00:04:58.580> I

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
I'm hoping this leg is gonna be better I

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.010 
I'm hoping this leg is gonna be better I
think<00:04:58.819> the<00:04:59.029> one<00:04:59.180> I<00:04:59.240> had<00:04:59.539> before<00:04:59.569> was<00:04:59.870> either

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020

strawberry<00:05:00.650> or<00:05:00.740> berry<00:05:00.979> or<00:05:01.189> something<00:05:01.520> this

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
strawberry or berry or something this

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.760 
strawberry or berry or something this
one<00:05:02.210> is<00:05:02.300> apple<00:05:02.659> and<00:05:02.810> pear<00:05:02.990> just<00:05:03.409> sounds

generally a lot nicer and but I don't
know<00:05:07.009> it<00:05:07.340> might<00:05:07.610> just<00:05:07.789> be<00:05:07.969> the<00:05:08.000> same<00:05:08.330> but<00:05:08.659> it

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
know it might just be the same but it

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.369
