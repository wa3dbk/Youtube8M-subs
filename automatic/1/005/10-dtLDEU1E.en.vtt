00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:19.930
 good evening they arrived but today we will do 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:23.830
 a test of a low lamp type 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:31.420
 consumption called magnetic mission lamps 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:33.970
 we will use as you can see in 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.830
 this image the vate m is in the 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.010
 position time then is measuring the 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:43.870
 network voltage as we do not have 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:48.850
 a connected load that marks 219.6 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:54.090
 sometimes the profit at the moment with the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:59.379
 cap the third instrument is set to 0 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.730
 a multimeter last three line then from 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.190
 a part is connected to the socket of 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.119
 power supply on the other side measures the 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.869
 various quantities relating to the load ed 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:14.050
 here is the layout of the test at 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:19.090
 magnetic production this is a model 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.880
 from 120 watts of plate and without entering 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.750
 too much in the details 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.340
 project of a subsequent video you can 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.619
 say that there is no raiders who is 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.060
 basically a discharge lamp 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.979
 of gas that excites antigas 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.140
 no it is not with two electrodes which yes 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.039
 they consume each time they are turned on 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.929
 switching off but using two magnets 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.240
 this reduction lamps as its 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.280
 protected at low frequency year on 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.429
 ballast located below 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.580
 the minutes refer to the power supply 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.080
 external ballast and pass almost certain 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:01.950
 of the sas means a frequency of 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:03.780
 230 kg operation is the center of 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.390
 search for his sensitive destination in the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.220
 point the central cd and we note that alla 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.569
 end of lamp heating that 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.569
 takes about 30 seconds and the measurement is if 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.599
 they hear at 269 lux 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.720
 now let's read the brick with the 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:26.519
 power we are absorbing from the network 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:29.459
 the selection I love but we are at 120 then 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.250
 the data corresponds exactly to the data 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.920
 of plate 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:39.389
 and here is our results table 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.060
 in rectangular that mounts inside 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.650
 a logic of 500 the art we believe to 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.450
 turn on our lamp a 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.100
 incandescence 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.200
 as you can see the actual consumption 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.880
 is slightly lower than that of 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.180
 license plate at 500 watts 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:03:03.090
 the effects settled around 410 a 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:06.000
 this time we have 165 so 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.549
 repeating the measurements you get i 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.780
 values ​​of both columns yes 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.090
 which a lamp is mounted 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.459
 we connect the input socket to the 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.510
 net the outlet of ours 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.760
 bridging tool to the fact let's go to 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.250
 turn on the lamp we read the costs 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:31.670
 which in this case for a light bulb e 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:34.970
 neon and 0.68 due to use 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.340
 inside the neon of the reactors e 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.819
 detached we go to unscrew the lamp 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.770
 traditional neon 27 was in the 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.930
 replace an induction lamp 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:53.750
 magnetic with attack I knew this 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:57.019
 lamp with a single excited magnetic re 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.239
 the circuit is formed by this one from here 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:04.569
 from this ring the integrated bale st 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.569
 in the lamp 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.199
 as we can see in this case the 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:21.829
 kospi stops at 0.93 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:26.150
 we have costs of 0.70 for one 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.550
 compact fluorescent and a cost of 0.93 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.130
 for our induction lamp 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.880
 magnetic here which the inclusion for 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.370
 this test 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.389
 we can say that run 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.449
 comparable lighting the lamp 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.100
 magnetic induction allows a 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.490
 savings compared to the floor lamp 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.060
 about 3.3 times on power 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.680
 absorbed by the law 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.370
 thank you all for your attention to 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.370
