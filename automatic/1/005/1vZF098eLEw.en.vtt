00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
like that so try both those and figure

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.960 
like that so try both those and figure
out<00:01:02.390> which<00:01:02.570> one<00:01:02.690> works<00:01:02.899> for<00:01:03.050> you<00:01:03.670> now<00:01:04.670> the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
out which one works for you now the

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.640 
out which one works for you now the
trick<00:01:05.150> itself<00:01:06.040> it<00:01:07.040> works<00:01:07.400> by<00:01:08.260> you<00:01:09.260> pop<00:01:09.500> the

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
trick itself it works by you pop the

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.060 
trick itself it works by you pop the
tail<00:01:09.860> way<00:01:10.280> out<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.900> flick<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.650> part

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
tail way out and the flick the part

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.760 
tail way out and the flick the part
where<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:13.340> flick<00:01:13.610> is<00:01:13.820> very<00:01:14.090> important<00:01:14.630> if<00:01:15.590> you

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
where you flick is very important if you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.190 
where you flick is very important if you
flick<00:01:16.010> too<00:01:16.190> far<00:01:16.400> forward<00:01:17.020> kind<00:01:18.020> of<00:01:18.050> like

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
flick too far forward kind of like

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.990 
flick too far forward kind of like
you're<00:01:18.290> doing<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.650> straight<00:01:18.860> heel<00:01:19.070> flip<00:01:19.400> the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
you're doing a straight heel flip the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.970 
you're doing a straight heel flip the
board<00:01:20.210> probably<00:01:20.450> won't<00:01:20.750> flip<00:01:21.080> enough<00:01:21.590> if<00:01:21.860> you

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
board probably won't flip enough if you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.550 
board probably won't flip enough if you
flip<00:01:22.280> too<00:01:22.460> far<00:01:22.730> out<00:01:23.030> like<00:01:23.810> you're<00:01:23.960> doing<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.230> tre

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
flip too far out like you're doing a tre

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.810 
flip too far out like you're doing a tre
flip<00:01:24.800> and<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:25.010> go<00:01:25.160> straight<00:01:25.220> out<00:01:25.490> ahead<00:01:25.700> of

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
flip and you go straight out ahead of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.420 
flip and you go straight out ahead of
you<00:01:26.380> what<00:01:27.380> will<00:01:27.470> happen<00:01:27.830> is<00:01:27.980> the<00:01:28.160> board<00:01:28.340> will

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
you what will happen is the board will

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.520 
you what will happen is the board will
start<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.790> spin<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.360> then<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:30.140> flip<00:01:30.410> like

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
start to spin and then you flip like

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.920 
start to spin and then you flip like
that<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:31.070> it<00:01:31.250> stops<00:01:31.490> spinning<00:01:31.760> it'll<00:01:32.510> flip<00:01:32.780> it

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
that and it stops spinning it'll flip it

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.170 
that and it stops spinning it'll flip it
up<00:01:33.080> plan<00:01:33.410> like<00:01:33.590> this<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.820> might<00:01:35.000> think

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
up plan like this and you might think

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.060 
up plan like this and you might think
that<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:35.660> need<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.930> scoop<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.290> more<00:01:36.530> but<00:01:36.920> it's

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
that you need to scoop it more but it's

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.410 
that you need to scoop it more but it's
actually<00:01:37.250> your<00:01:37.520> front<00:01:37.730> foot<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:38.240> that's

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
actually your front foot so that's

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.050 
actually your front foot so that's
something<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:38.750> keep<00:01:38.960> your<00:01:39.440> eye<00:01:39.470> out<00:01:39.560> for<00:01:40.060> you

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
something to keep your eye out for you

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.300 
something to keep your eye out for you
need<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.450> find<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.990> right<00:01:42.020> angle<00:01:42.380> for<00:01:42.740> me<00:01:42.860> it's

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
need to find the right angle for me it's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.240 
need to find the right angle for me it's
about<00:01:43.430> right<00:01:43.880> here<00:01:44.390> not<00:01:45.350> too<00:01:45.530> far<00:01:45.560> forward<00:01:46.040> not

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
about right here not too far forward not

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.870 
about right here not too far forward not
too<00:01:46.370> far<00:01:46.520> out<00:01:46.550> put<00:01:46.880> like<00:01:47.120> right<00:01:47.300> there<00:01:47.510> and<00:01:48.880> if

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
too far out put like right there and if

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.190 
too far out put like right there and if
you<00:01:50.270> have<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.630> foot<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.950> right<00:01:52.340> place

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
you have the foot in the right place

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.180 
you have the foot in the right place
which<00:01:54.200> is<00:01:54.230> something<00:01:54.500> you<00:01:54.620> need<00:01:55.160> to

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
which is something you need to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.820 
which is something you need to
experiment<00:01:55.610> with<00:01:56.260> when<00:01:57.260> i<00:01:57.290> first<00:01:57.590> started

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
experiment with when i first started

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.040 
experiment with when i first started
trying<00:01:58.130> them<00:01:58.370> i<00:01:58.610> would<00:01:59.060> have<00:01:59.270> my<00:01:59.300> foot<00:01:59.660> tilted

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
trying them i would have my foot tilted

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.830 
trying them i would have my foot tilted
in<00:02:00.230> something<00:02:00.710> that<00:02:00.830> helped<00:02:01.420> now<00:02:02.420> it's<00:02:02.660> not

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
in something that helped now it's not

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.980 
in something that helped now it's not
like<00:02:02.990> that<00:02:03.200> but<00:02:04.210> you<00:02:05.210> need<00:02:05.480> to<00:02:05.540> be<00:02:05.660> able<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.870> do

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
like that but you need to be able to do

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.139 
like that but you need to be able to do
the<00:02:06.320> Flip<00:02:06.590> without<00:02:07.310> really<00:02:07.670> thinking<00:02:07.760> about

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
the Flip without really thinking about

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.779 
the Flip without really thinking about
it<00:02:08.450> because<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.590> hardest<00:02:09.890> part<00:02:10.069> for<00:02:10.219> about

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
it because the hardest part for about

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.800 
it because the hardest part for about
the<00:02:10.909> trick<00:02:11.090> for<00:02:11.120> me<00:02:11.329> at<00:02:11.510> least<00:02:11.540> is<00:02:12.049> in<00:02:12.079> the<00:02:12.319> back

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
the trick for me at least is in the back

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.320 
the trick for me at least is in the back
you<00:02:14.810> scoop<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> tail<00:02:15.470> out<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.680> lot<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.330> you

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
you scoop the tail out a lot and you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.240 
you scoop the tail out a lot and you
scoop<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:18.140> hard<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.560> your<00:02:18.650> foots<00:02:18.920> way<00:02:19.100> out

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
scoop it so hard that your foots way out

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.370 
scoop it so hard that your foots way out
here<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:20.510> main<00:02:20.660> problem<00:02:21.020> that<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.230> have

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
here and the main problem that I have

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.890 
here and the main problem that I have
had<00:02:21.620> with<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:22.220> trick<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.760> I<00:02:23.300> would<00:02:23.510> scoop<00:02:23.810> the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
had with this trick is I would scoop the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.470 
had with this trick is I would scoop the
tail<00:02:24.080> out<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.590> then<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.460> didn't<00:02:26.000> have<00:02:26.090> time<00:02:26.360> to

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
tail out and then I didn't have time to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.820 
tail out and then I didn't have time to
bring<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:26.750> back<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.110> board<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.560> land

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
bring it back to the board and I land

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.210 
bring it back to the board and I land
right<00:02:28.070> here<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.780> there<00:02:30.740> are<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.860> couple<00:02:31.010> of

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
right here and there are a couple of

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.850 
right here and there are a couple of
different<00:02:31.670> things<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.240> could<00:02:32.360> try<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:33.650> first

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
different things you could try the first

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.380 
different things you could try the first
thing<00:02:34.130> i<00:02:34.400> tried<00:02:34.430> was<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.390> try<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:36.550> just<00:02:37.550> go<00:02:37.940> not

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
thing i tried was to try to just go not

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.260 
thing i tried was to try to just go not
quite<00:02:38.780> as<00:02:38.900> far<00:02:39.110> i'd<00:02:39.320> pop<00:02:39.850> faster<00:02:40.850> then<00:02:41.060> pull<00:02:41.240> it

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
quite as far i'd pop faster then pull it

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.330 
quite as far i'd pop faster then pull it
back<00:02:41.570> like<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.290> wouldn't<00:02:42.530> really<00:02:42.620> follow

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
back like I wouldn't really follow

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.850 
back like I wouldn't really follow
through<00:02:43.700> on<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.540> scoop<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.020> that<00:02:45.620> wouldn't

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
through on the scoop and that wouldn't

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.890 
through on the scoop and that wouldn't
work<00:02:46.040> because<00:02:46.310> all<00:02:47.150> they<00:02:47.450> like<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.720> get<00:02:47.810> my

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
work because all they like to get my

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.600 
work because all they like to get my
foot<00:02:48.080> back<00:02:48.350> in<00:02:48.530> time<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:48.980> board<00:02:49.160> won't<00:02:49.280> spill

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
foot back in time the board won't spill

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.210 
foot back in time the board won't spill
enough<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:53.630> main<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.290> solution<00:02:55.100> that

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
enough so the main the solution that

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.340 
enough so the main the solution that
works<00:02:55.400> for<00:02:55.580> me<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:55.940> pretty<00:02:56.660> tough<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.020> get<00:02:57.110> used

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
works for me is pretty tough to get used

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.190 
works for me is pretty tough to get used
to<00:02:57.530> but<00:02:57.890> you<00:02:58.850> have<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.210> scoop<00:02:59.540> out<00:02:59.750> and<00:03:00.080> then

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
to but you have to scoop out and then

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.220 
to but you have to scoop out and then
pull<00:03:00.470> your<00:03:00.620> foot<00:03:00.830> way<00:03:01.070> up<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.450> bring<00:03:03.110> it

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
pull your foot way up and and bring it

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.200 
pull your foot way up and and bring it
back<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.620> that's<00:03:04.220> not<00:03:04.400> really<00:03:04.460> difficult

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
back and that's not really difficult

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.500 
back and that's not really difficult
with<00:03:05.330> some<00:03:05.510> tricks<00:03:05.780> like<00:03:06.050> with<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:07.240> tre<00:03:08.240> flip

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
with some tricks like with a tre flip

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.300 
with some tricks like with a tre flip
you<00:03:09.020> know<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:09.140> scoop<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.650> tail<00:03:09.860> out<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.250> you

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
you know you scoop the tail out and you

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.160 
you know you scoop the tail out and you
have<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.520> pull<00:03:10.700> your<00:03:10.790> foot<00:03:10.940> up<00:03:11.120> but<00:03:11.780> with<00:03:12.020> this

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
have to pull your foot up but with this

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.510 
have to pull your foot up but with this
one<00:03:12.580> you<00:03:13.580> pop<00:03:13.820> your<00:03:14.300> foot<00:03:15.200> forward<00:03:15.890> so<00:03:16.340> your

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
one you pop your foot forward so your

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.940 
one you pop your foot forward so your
leg<00:03:16.880> is<00:03:17.090> straight<00:03:17.420> and<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:18.080> feels<00:03:18.320> weird<00:03:18.739> to

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
leg is straight and it feels weird to

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.000 
leg is straight and it feels weird to
pull<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.370> up<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.610> bend<00:03:19.880> it<00:03:20.000> again<00:03:20.300> so<00:03:20.959> it<00:03:21.830> takes

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
pull it up and bend it again so it takes

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.880 
pull it up and bend it again so it takes
some<00:03:22.130> it<00:03:22.940> takes<00:03:23.150> some<00:03:23.300> practice<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:23.989> that's

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
some it takes some practice and that's

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.100 
some it takes some practice and that's
why<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.820> really<00:03:26.030> need<00:03:26.270> to<00:03:26.390> be<00:03:26.600> able<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:26.840> do<00:03:26.959> the

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
why you really need to be able to do the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.240 
why you really need to be able to do the
flick<00:03:27.380> pretty<00:03:27.800> easily<00:03:28.270> because<00:03:29.270> I<00:03:29.959> had<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:31.040> put

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
flick pretty easily because I had to put

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
flick pretty easily because I had to put
most<00:03:32.000> of<00:03:32.180> my<00:03:32.300> focus<00:03:32.720> on<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:33.410> foot<00:03:33.709> now<00:03:34.700> one

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
most of my focus on that foot now one

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.380 
most of my focus on that foot now one
thing<00:03:35.300> that<00:03:35.480> some<00:03:35.810> people<00:03:36.140> do<00:03:36.640> which<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:38.000> I

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
thing that some people do which I I

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.330 
thing that some people do which I I
can't<00:03:38.720> but<00:03:38.989> I'm<00:03:39.170> gonna<00:03:39.320> explain<00:03:39.860> it<00:03:40.010> any<00:03:40.130> way

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
can't but I'm gonna explain it any way

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.050 
can't but I'm gonna explain it any way
is<00:03:40.580> to<00:03:41.330> use<00:03:41.410> your<00:03:42.410> front<00:03:42.709> foot<00:03:42.770> to<00:03:43.160> help<00:03:43.340> help

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
is to use your front foot to help help

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.199 
is to use your front foot to help help
spin<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.420> board<00:03:44.630> so<00:03:45.560> you'd<00:03:45.830> pop<00:03:46.100> it<00:03:46.340> with<00:03:46.970> this

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
spin the board so you'd pop it with this

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.000 
spin the board so you'd pop it with this
foot<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.780> board<00:03:47.989> would<00:03:48.110> only<00:03:48.440> land<00:03:48.709> about

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
foot and the board would only land about

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.210 
foot and the board would only land about
there<00:03:49.310> but<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.959> flick<00:03:51.320> you<00:03:51.590> start<00:03:51.890> to<00:03:51.950> flick

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
there but you flick you start to flick

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.570 
there but you flick you start to flick
out<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.730> you<00:03:52.850> pull<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.300> with<00:03:53.420> you<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:54.580> if

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
out and you pull it with you and if

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.180 
out and you pull it with you and if
that's<00:03:56.000> definitely<00:03:56.810> worth<00:03:56.930> a<00:03:57.140> try<00:03:57.350> if<00:03:57.650> you<00:03:58.160> can

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
that's definitely worth a try if you can

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.860 
that's definitely worth a try if you can
get<00:03:58.400> that<00:03:58.520> to<00:03:58.700> work<00:03:58.730> you'll<00:03:59.150> be<00:03:59.270> you'll<00:03:59.750> be

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
get that to work you'll be you'll be

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.110 
get that to work you'll be you'll be
able<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.080> do<00:04:00.200> this<00:04:00.350> trick<00:04:00.790> with<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:01.820> lot<00:04:02.090> less

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
able to do this trick with a lot less

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.000 
able to do this trick with a lot less
effort<00:04:03.010> and<00:04:04.010> that's<00:04:04.880> why<00:04:05.150> there<00:04:05.959> are<00:04:05.989> a<00:04:06.530> lot<00:04:06.980> of

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
effort and that's why there are a lot of

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.500 
effort and that's why there are a lot of
people<00:04:07.160> who<00:04:07.430> try<00:04:07.700> learn<00:04:07.850> this<00:04:08.030> trick<00:04:08.209> for<00:04:08.450> a

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
people who try learn this trick for a

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.430 
people who try learn this trick for a
switch<00:04:09.310> because<00:04:10.330> my<00:04:11.330> theory<00:04:11.720> I<00:04:12.019> don't<00:04:12.230> know<00:04:12.350> if

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
switch because my theory I don't know if

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.440 
switch because my theory I don't know if
this<00:04:12.530> is<00:04:12.590> completely<00:04:12.980> right<00:04:13.280> but<00:04:13.910> if<00:04:14.120> you're

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
this is completely right but if you're

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.710 
this is completely right but if you're
if<00:04:14.870> you<00:04:15.170> skate<00:04:16.070> with<00:04:16.280> your<00:04:16.549> your<00:04:17.060> dominant

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
if you skate with your your dominant

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.470 
if you skate with your your dominant
foot<00:04:17.750> in<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.530> back<00:04:18.560> if<00:04:19.040> you<00:04:19.489> skates<00:04:19.790> which<00:04:20.150> it

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
foot in the back if you skates which it

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.680 
foot in the back if you skates which it
sits<00:04:20.780> in<00:04:21.020> front<00:04:21.049> so<00:04:21.799> you<00:04:22.190> know<00:04:22.400> I'm<00:04:22.690> right

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
sits in front so you know I'm right

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.320 
sits in front so you know I'm right
footed<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:24.680> if<00:04:24.860> I'm<00:04:25.070> skating<00:04:25.370> switch<00:04:25.820> it

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
footed so if I'm skating switch it

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.570 
footed so if I'm skating switch it
more<00:04:26.810> natural<00:04:27.439> to<00:04:27.470> keep<00:04:27.770> weight<00:04:28.009> over<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.430> and

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
more natural to keep weight over it and

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.119 
more natural to keep weight over it and
pull<00:04:28.729> it<00:04:28.759> around<00:04:29.409> so<00:04:30.409> it's<00:04:30.830> worth<00:04:31.039> a<00:04:31.099> try

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 
pull it around so it's worth a try

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:36.189 
pull it around so it's worth a try
switch<00:04:31.639> definitely<00:04:33.400> but<00:04:34.900> for<00:04:35.900> me<00:04:36.020> when<00:04:36.169> I

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
switch definitely but for me when I

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.929 
switch definitely but for me when I
tried<00:04:36.469> to<00:04:36.710> learn<00:04:36.889> them<00:04:37.099> I<00:04:37.280> could<00:04:37.610> do<00:04:37.729> them

00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:37.939 
tried to learn them I could do them

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:41.020 
tried to learn them I could do them
pretty<00:04:38.810> equally<00:04:39.379> both<00:04:39.710> ways<00:04:39.979> so<00:04:40.009> I<00:04:40.310> decided<00:04:40.969> to

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
pretty equally both ways so I decided to

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.450 
pretty equally both ways so I decided to
stick<00:04:41.240> with<00:04:41.270> them<00:04:42.939> regular<00:04:44.650> so<00:04:45.650> this<00:04:46.219> trick

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
stick with them regular so this trick

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.149 
stick with them regular so this trick
takes<00:04:46.729> some<00:04:47.240> practice<00:04:47.889> depending<00:04:48.889> on<00:04:48.889> the

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 
takes some practice depending on the

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:51.459 
takes some practice depending on the
surface<00:04:49.580> you<00:04:49.729> have<00:04:49.759> it<00:04:50.240> might<00:04:50.479> change<00:04:50.780> some<00:04:51.199> I

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:51.469 
surface you have it might change some I

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:54.700 
surface you have it might change some I
know<00:04:51.919> I<00:04:52.039> skated<00:04:52.460> like<00:04:52.580> a<00:04:52.759> slick<00:04:53.629> parking<00:04:54.560> lot

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
know I skated like a slick parking lot

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.369 
know I skated like a slick parking lot
one<00:04:54.949> time<00:04:55.159> and<00:04:55.490> I<00:04:56.120> just<00:04:56.150> sort<00:04:56.509> of<00:04:56.569> popped<00:04:57.169> it

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:57.379 
one time and I just sort of popped it

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:59.879 
one time and I just sort of popped it
out<00:04:57.469> some<00:04:57.770> but<00:04:58.370> here<00:04:58.669> on<00:04:58.969> this<00:04:59.120> rough<00:04:59.419> stuff

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
out some but here on this rough stuff

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.409 
out some but here on this rough stuff
you<00:05:00.889> really<00:05:01.069> need<00:05:01.280> to<00:05:01.310> throw<00:05:01.699> it<00:05:01.729> out<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.210> pull

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
you really need to throw it out and pull

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.709 
you really need to throw it out and pull
it<00:05:02.449> up<00:05:02.629> around<00:05:02.900> like<00:05:03.110> that<00:05:03.940> so<00:05:04.940> keep

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:05.719 
it up around like that so keep

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.159 
it up around like that so keep
practicing<00:05:06.169> this<00:05:06.590> one<00:05:06.740> can<00:05:06.919> take<00:05:07.039> a<00:05:07.099> while<00:05:07.370> and

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
practicing this one can take a while and

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.560 
practicing this one can take a while and
good<00:05:09.169> luck<00:05:09.259> with<00:05:09.319> them
