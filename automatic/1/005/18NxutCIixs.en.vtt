so<00:01:21.540> whatever<00:01:21.900> they<00:01:22.110> were<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.409> prevent<00:01:22.770> these

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
so whatever they were to prevent these

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.500 
so whatever they were to prevent these

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.970 
muscles can't do anymore so it'll pull
right<00:02:26.460> back<00:02:26.520> down<00:02:26.880> if<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.990> can't<00:02:28.290> make<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.800> a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
right back down if you can't make it a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.620 
right back down if you can't make it a
lift<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.370> they<00:02:29.459> can<00:02:29.640> do<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.970> jerk<00:02:30.240> start

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
lift and they can do this jerk start

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.230 
lift and they can do this jerk start
like<00:02:30.780> we<00:02:30.810> did<00:02:31.110> before<00:02:31.459> that's<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.790> greatest

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
like we did before that's the greatest

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.790 
like we did before that's the greatest
gift<00:02:33.390> if<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.690> go<00:02:33.959> in<00:02:34.080> your<00:02:34.200> background<00:02:34.650> so

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
gift if you go in your background so

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.250 
gift if you go in your background so
that's<00:02:34.980> one<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.370> major<00:02:35.990> things<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.110> I

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
that's one of the major things that I

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.780 
that's one of the major things that I
see<00:02:37.470> people<00:02:37.770> doing<00:02:37.920> with<00:02:38.160> your<00:02:38.310> doing<00:02:38.430> lips

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
see people doing with your doing lips

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.490

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
especially if they're doing them just

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.010 
especially if they're doing them just
for<00:02:40.680> time<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.610> runs<00:02:41.790> fast<00:02:42.330> as<00:02:42.510> possible

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
for time and it runs fast as possible

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
risk is so high your knees way down your

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:34.089 
but people will do the live those robbed
it<00:03:20.390> put<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.450> back<00:03:21.480> down<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.110> they'll<00:03:22.319> try<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.530> go

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.430 

now<00:03:35.099> you<00:03:35.160> got<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.579> quick<00:03:35.959> entry<00:03:36.959> when<00:03:37.319> you're

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
now you got a quick entry when you're

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.050 
now you got a quick entry when you're
dropping<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:38.010> weight<00:03:38.129> with<00:03:38.370> bouncing<00:03:38.849> back

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
dropping the weight with bouncing back

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.869 
dropping the weight with bouncing back
up<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.540> how<00:03:39.739> gravity<00:03:40.739> plus<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.340> weights<00:03:43.879> he

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
up and how gravity plus the weights he

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.020 
up and how gravity plus the weights he
put<00:03:45.450> all<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.900> force<00:03:46.140> right<00:03:46.319> as<00:03:46.440> we<00:03:46.590> roll<00:03:46.769> back

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
put all the force right as we roll back

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.599 
put all the force right as we roll back
now<00:03:48.030> because<00:03:48.629> you've<00:03:49.349> increased<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.250> moment

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
now because you've increased the moment

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.130 
now because you've increased the moment
arm<00:03:50.819> because<00:03:51.150> you're<00:03:51.299> catching<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:51.720> away<00:03:51.959> from

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
arm because you're catching it away from

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.830 
arm because you're catching it away from
your<00:03:52.290> body<00:03:52.349> in<00:03:52.799> a<00:03:52.920> whole<00:03:53.030> bible-based<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.629> you

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
your body in a whole bible-based and you

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.300 
your body in a whole bible-based and you
have<00:03:54.930> added<00:03:55.349> the<00:03:55.379> factor<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.799> gravity

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
have added the factor of gravity

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.280 
have added the factor of gravity
plussing<00:03:57.060> up<00:03:57.180> added<00:03:57.569> the<00:03:57.690> moment<00:03:58.019> sir<00:03:58.879> that

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
plussing up added the moment sir that

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.940 
plussing up added the moment sir that
altogether<00:04:01.290> alia<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.209> fingering<00:04:03.780> you

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
altogether alia and the fingering you

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.370 
altogether alia and the fingering you
started<00:04:04.950> using<00:04:05.250> six<00:04:05.880> weeks<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.169> better

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
started using six weeks so the better

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.870 
started using six weeks so the better
things<00:04:07.650> through<00:04:07.919> the<00:04:08.069> situation<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.849> just

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
things through the situation you just

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.210 
things through the situation you just
want<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.299> control<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.840> bass<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.889> do<00:04:10.980> try<00:04:11.160> to

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
want to control the bass and do try to

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.969 
want to control the bass and do try to
drop<00:04:11.519> it<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:11.910> then<00:04:12.030> choose<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.480> bar<00:04:12.660> back

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.279 

so<00:04:19.979> by<00:04:20.160> pushing<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:20.700> back<00:04:20.880> down<00:04:20.910> you<00:04:21.479> can<00:04:21.810> speed

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
so by pushing it back down you can speed

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.779 
so by pushing it back down you can speed
up<00:04:22.320> yourself<00:04:23.039> you<00:04:23.099> can<00:04:23.280> speak<00:04:23.430> your<00:04:23.520> self<00:04:23.700> up

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
up yourself you can speak your self up

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.180 
up yourself you can speak your self up
for<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:23.970> next
