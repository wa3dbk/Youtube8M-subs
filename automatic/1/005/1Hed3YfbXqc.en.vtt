00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.420 

hello<00:00:03.480> I'm<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.350> keepers<00:00:04.830> of<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.069> Blue<00:00:05.220> Ridge

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
hello I'm the keepers of the Blue Ridge

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.660 
hello I'm the keepers of the Blue Ridge
I'm<00:00:06.330> here<00:00:06.690> document<00:00:07.910> the<00:00:08.910> turbine<00:00:09.330> noise<00:00:10.670> on

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
I'm here document the turbine noise on

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.669 
I'm here document the turbine noise on
the<00:00:11.910> campus<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.570> Appalachian<00:00:13.170> State

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
the campus of Appalachian State

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.580 
the campus of Appalachian State
University<00:00:14.750> they<00:00:15.750> would<00:00:15.900> like<00:00:16.080> free<00:00:16.440> to

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
University they would like free to

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.349 
University they would like free to
believe<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.250> turbine<00:00:17.640> makes<00:00:17.910> no<00:00:18.180> noise

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
believe that this turbine makes no noise

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.390 
believe that this turbine makes no noise
and<00:00:18.960> they<00:00:19.230> invite<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.800> come<00:00:19.920> see<00:00:20.300> but<00:00:22.400> this

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
and they invite you to come see but this

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.050 
and they invite you to come see but this
is<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.609> very<00:00:23.910> small<00:00:24.269> turbine<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.880> blades<00:00:26.880> are

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
is a very small turbine the blades are

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.609 
is a very small turbine the blades are
only<00:00:27.180> 34<00:00:27.689> feet<00:00:27.930> long

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
only 34 feet long

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.750 
only 34 feet long
so<00:00:29.660> imagine<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:32.270> turbine<00:00:33.270> with<00:00:34.160> four<00:00:35.160> times<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
so imagine a turbine with four times the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.270 
so imagine a turbine with four times the
link<00:00:36.120> length<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.440> how<00:00:37.559> much<00:00:37.680> noise<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.160> was

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
link length and how much noise it was

00:00:38.280 --> 00:01:06.100 
link length and how much noise it was
made

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.290 

this<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:09.110> turbine<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.580> again<00:01:11.880> very

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
this is just one turbine and again very

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.800 
this is just one turbine and again very
small<00:01:12.500> really<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.740> community<00:01:14.160> size<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:15.450> 100

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
small really not community size it's 100

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.650 
small really not community size it's 100
kilowatts<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.520> community<00:01:17.880> size<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.360> has<00:01:18.510> to

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
kilowatts to be community size it has to

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.719 
kilowatts to be community size it has to
be<00:01:18.750> greater<00:01:18.990> than<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.410> it<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.070> obviously<00:01:20.580> not

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
be greater than that it is obviously not

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.690 
be greater than that it is obviously not
a<00:01:21.800> commercial<00:01:22.800> size<00:01:23.010> turbine<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:26.220> commercial

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
a commercial size turbine the commercial

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.250 
a commercial size turbine the commercial
size<00:01:26.880> would<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.210> about<00:01:27.420> three<00:01:27.690> times<00:01:27.900> this

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
size would be about three times this

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.260 
size would be about three times this
size<00:01:29.960> but<00:01:30.960> imagine<00:01:31.440> 40<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.490> these<00:01:32.640> strong<00:01:33.030> long

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
size but imagine 40 of these strong long

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.020 
size but imagine 40 of these strong long
Ridgeline<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.290> how<00:01:35.220> much<00:01:35.369> noise<00:01:35.550> that<00:01:35.910> would

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
Ridgeline and how much noise that would

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.710 
Ridgeline and how much noise that would
make<00:01:36.950> think<00:01:37.950> about<00:01:38.160> the<00:01:38.399> people<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.600> to

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
make think about the people that have to

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:56.480 
make think about the people that have to
live<00:01:39.840> around<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.320> noise<00:01:55.009> they<00:01:56.009> tell<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.399> to

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
live around the noise they tell you to

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.350 
live around the noise they tell you to
come<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.759> visit<00:01:56.910> but<00:01:57.149> it's<00:01:57.450> quiet

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
come and visit but it's quiet

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.760 
come and visit but it's quiet
well<00:02:01.700> Appalachian<00:02:02.700> State<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.240> not<00:02:03.509> quiet

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.789 

to<00:02:08.770> stop<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.190> deception
