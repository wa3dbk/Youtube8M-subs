so<00:00:05.910> what<00:00:06.150> are<00:00:06.270> lumens<00:00:06.750> now<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.649> there's<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.820> lot

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
so what are lumens now I there's a lot

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.720 
so what are lumens now I there's a lot
of<00:00:09.059> people<00:00:09.300> that<00:00:09.480> are<00:00:09.750> scientists<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:11.250> are

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
of people that are scientists that are

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.940 
of people that are scientists that are
in<00:00:11.969> those<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.019> fields<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.349> physics<00:00:13.380> that

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
in those in the fields of physics that

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.730 
in those in the fields of physics that
can<00:00:14.130> give<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.790> very<00:00:15.619> scientific<00:00:16.619> and

everyday Joe Blow kind of definition so
I<00:00:27.769> do<00:00:28.769> photography<00:00:28.920> iswas<00:00:29.699> have<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> couple<00:00:30.539> of

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
I do photography iswas have a couple of

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.340 
I do photography iswas have a couple of
side<00:00:31.140> projects<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:32.610> require<00:00:33.350> industrial

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
side projects that require industrial

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.160 
side projects that require industrial
arm<00:00:35.000> hardware<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.420> specialized

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
arm hardware and and specialized

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.660 
arm hardware and and specialized
lighting<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.829> did<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> lot<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.160> research<00:00:38.309> on

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
lighting so I did a lot of research on

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.270 
lighting so I did a lot of research on
lighting<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.290> I<00:00:40.290> want<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.920> share<00:00:41.129> that

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
lighting so I want to share that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.430 
lighting so I want to share that
experience<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.420> also<00:00:42.540> my<00:00:42.930> knowledge<00:00:43.260> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
experience and also my knowledge and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
experience and also my knowledge and
from<00:00:43.739> my<00:00:43.860> research<00:00:44.160> with<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.760> guys<00:00:44.940> so

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
from my research with you guys so

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.529 
from my research with you guys so
basically<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.960> lumen<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.300> it's<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
basically a lumen is a it's a

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.060 
basically a lumen is a it's a
measurement<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.140> light<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:50.780> the

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
measurement of light and the

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.410 
measurement of light and the
and<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.280> average<00:00:53.550> light<00:00:53.910> bulb<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.360> you

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
and the average light bulb that you

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.840 
and the average light bulb that you
would<00:00:54.780> purchase<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.800> your<00:00:56.010> living<00:00:56.489> room<00:00:56.730> or

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
would purchase for your living room or

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.090 
would purchase for your living room or
room<00:00:57.120> range<00:00:57.480> anywhere<00:00:57.989> usually<00:00:58.680> from<00:00:58.859> four

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
room range anywhere usually from four

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.000 
room range anywhere usually from four
hundred<00:00:59.190> lumens<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.420> around<00:01:01.350> fifteen<00:01:01.980> hundred

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
hundred lumens to around fifteen hundred

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.679 
hundred lumens to around fifteen hundred
lumens<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:03.600> would<00:01:04.559> say<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:05.400> well<00:01:06.180> lit<00:01:06.420> up

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
lumens I would say a a well lit up

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.830 
lumens I would say a a well lit up
living<00:01:06.990> room<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.409> around<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:08.570> thousand<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> two

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
living room is around a thousand to two

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.140 
living room is around a thousand to two
thousand<00:01:10.260> lumens<00:01:10.979> with<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> combination<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:12.000> me

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
thousand lumens with a combination of me

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.280 
thousand lumens with a combination of me
one<00:01:12.450> or<00:01:12.600> two<00:01:12.799> or<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.860> couple<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.430> light<00:01:14.610> bulbs

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
one or two or a couple of light bulbs

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.990 
one or two or a couple of light bulbs
there's<00:01:16.290> different<00:01:16.650> kinds<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.250> light<00:01:17.700> bulbs

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
there's different kinds of light bulbs

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.710 
there's different kinds of light bulbs
and<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.570> my<00:01:18.720> research<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:20.280> four<00:01:20.720> major

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
and so do my research the four major

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.890 
and so do my research the four major
types<00:01:22.049> are<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.650> standard<00:01:23.520> one<00:01:24.180> switch<00:01:24.630> off

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
types are the standard one switch off

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.140 
types are the standard one switch off
the<00:01:25.640> energy-efficient<00:01:26.640> ones<00:01:26.729> usually

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the energy-efficient ones usually

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.240 
the energy-efficient ones usually
reference<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:28.020> far<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.590> wattage

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
reference as far as the wattage

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.520 
reference as far as the wattage
equivalent<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.479> standard<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.049> that's

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
equivalent and the standard one that's

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.770 
equivalent and the standard one that's
also<00:01:31.890> called<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.640> incandescent<00:01:33.210> light<00:01:33.540> bulb

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
also called the incandescent light bulb

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.999 
also called the incandescent light bulb
and<00:01:33.990> that's<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.240> Thomas<00:01:36.240> Edison

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
and that's the one that Thomas Edison

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.190 
and that's the one that Thomas Edison
popularized<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:39.180> debate<00:01:39.630> whether<00:01:39.810> he

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
popularized and this debate whether he

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.950 
popularized and this debate whether he
was<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.759> original<00:01:41.759> inventor<00:01:42.090> or<00:01:42.360> not<00:01:42.540> but

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
was the original inventor or not but

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.630 
was the original inventor or not but
he's<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.229> one<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.530> originally<00:01:43.950> brought<00:01:44.070> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
he's the one that originally brought it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.219 
he's the one that originally brought it
to<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.479> mainstream<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> mainstream<00:01:47.670> world

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
to to mainstream to the mainstream world

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.399 
to to mainstream to the mainstream world
as<00:01:49.229> far<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.530> light

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
as far as light

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.370 
as far as light
so<00:01:51.159> that's<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.610> standard<00:01:51.880> light<00:01:52.210> bulb<00:01:52.479> I

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
so that's the standard light bulb I

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.719 
so that's the standard light bulb I
should<00:01:53.890> have<00:01:53.979> an<00:01:54.100> example<00:01:54.490> of<00:01:54.550> one<00:01:54.790> right<00:01:55.180> here

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
should have an example of one right here

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.240 
should have an example of one right here
so<00:01:57.729> basically<00:01:57.850> these<00:01:58.660> look<00:01:59.290> like<00:01:59.650> this<00:02:00.010> so

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
so basically these look like this so

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.250 
so basically these look like this so
this<00:02:00.400> is<00:02:00.460> a<00:02:00.940> standard<00:02:01.690> light<00:02:01.960> bulbs

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
this is a standard light bulbs

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.240 
this is a standard light bulbs
incandescent<00:02:03.090> light<00:02:04.090> bulb<00:02:04.860> now<00:02:05.860> this

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
incandescent light bulb now this

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.279 
incandescent light bulb now this
specific<00:02:06.760> one<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:07.180> purchased<00:02:07.540> is<00:02:07.900> not<00:02:08.110> that

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
specific one I purchased is not that

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.169 
specific one I purchased is not that
standard<00:02:08.649> I'll<00:02:08.830> tell<00:02:09.039> you<00:02:09.160> why<00:02:09.310> in<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.759> second

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
standard I'll tell you why in a second

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.190 
standard I'll tell you why in a second
the<00:02:10.600> other<00:02:10.840> type<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:12.570> these<00:02:13.570> this<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:14.170> a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
the other type is these this is a

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.010 
the other type is these this is a
specialized<00:02:14.770> one<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.850> a<00:02:15.880> only<00:02:16.540> emits

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
specialized one this is a only emits

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.310 
specialized one this is a only emits
yellow<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.760> you've<00:02:19.240> probably<00:02:19.480> seen<00:02:19.780> be<00:02:20.080> ones

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
yellow but you've probably seen be ones

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.850 
yellow but you've probably seen be ones
that<00:02:20.470> are<00:02:20.680> white<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.280> these<00:02:21.490> are<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:22.060> CFL

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
that are white and these are the CFL

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.949 
that are white and these are the CFL
people<00:02:23.860> also<00:02:23.980> call<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.280> fluorescent<00:02:24.970> light

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
people also call it fluorescent light

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.949 
people also call it fluorescent light
bulbs<00:02:26.350> um<00:02:27.150> fluorescent<00:02:28.150> bulbs<00:02:28.780> are

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
bulbs um fluorescent bulbs are

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.110 
bulbs um fluorescent bulbs are
originally<00:02:29.680> there<00:02:29.800> with<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:29.950> long<00:02:30.190> tube<00:02:30.820> ones

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
originally there with a long tube ones

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.440 
originally there with a long tube ones
and<00:02:31.360> then<00:02:31.480> they<00:02:31.840> condensed<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.160> these<00:02:33.670> are

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.640 

CFL<00:02:37.450> stands<00:02:37.720> for<00:02:38.020> compact<00:02:38.770> fluorescent<00:02:39.760> lamp

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
CFL stands for compact fluorescent lamp

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.500 
CFL stands for compact fluorescent lamp
so<00:02:41.650> these<00:02:42.100> are<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.459> really<00:02:42.670> energy-efficient

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
so these are the really energy-efficient

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.840 
so these are the really energy-efficient
ones<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.840> these<00:02:44.050> are<00:02:44.290> very<00:02:44.560> popular<00:02:44.850> among

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
ones and these are very popular among

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.979 
ones and these are very popular among
homes<00:02:46.750> especially<00:02:47.350> as<00:02:47.739> some<00:02:48.250> of<00:02:48.340> that's<00:02:48.400> a

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
homes especially as some of that's a

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.380 
homes especially as some of that's a
very<00:02:49.989> low<00:02:50.709> heat<00:02:51.130> as<00:02:51.370> far<00:02:51.610> as<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.820> heat<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.239> he

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
very low heat as far as the heat that he

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.160 
very low heat as far as the heat that he
admits<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:54.239> but<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.269> thought<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.660> drawback<00:02:56.140> is

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
admits and but I thought the drawback is

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.080 
admits and but I thought the drawback is
it<00:02:56.500> does<00:02:56.650> not<00:02:56.830> light<00:02:57.040> up<00:02:57.070> instantly<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:57.940> we

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
it does not light up instantly so we

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.420 
it does not light up instantly so we
need<00:02:58.269> instant<00:02:58.870> light<00:02:59.080> it's<00:02:59.830> not<00:02:59.980> very<00:03:00.190> good

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
need instant light it's not very good

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.789 
need instant light it's not very good
for<00:03:00.610> for<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.269> that's<00:03:01.510> why<00:03:01.690> with<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.620> lot

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
for for that that's why with a lot

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.740 
for for that that's why with a lot
industrial<00:03:03.489> usage<00:03:03.880> they<00:03:04.090> use<00:03:04.209> different<00:03:04.480> type

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
industrial usage they use different type

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.850 
industrial usage they use different type
of<00:03:04.780> light<00:03:04.989> bulb<00:03:05.519> with<00:03:06.519> that<00:03:06.850> there<00:03:07.269> is<00:03:07.510> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
of light bulb with that there is the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.620 
of light bulb with that there is the
there's<00:03:08.860> these<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.489> know<00:03:09.579> this<00:03:09.850> looks<00:03:10.150> kind<00:03:10.510> of

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
there's these I know this looks kind of

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.600 
there's these I know this looks kind of
like<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:11.049> regular<00:03:11.350> standard<00:03:11.980> light<00:03:12.160> but<00:03:12.519> it's

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
like a regular standard light but it's

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.050 
like a regular standard light but it's
not<00:03:12.790> this<00:03:13.180> is<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.390> halogen<00:03:13.959> light<00:03:14.320> bulb<00:03:15.060> which

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
not this is a halogen light bulb which

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.360 
not this is a halogen light bulb which
also<00:03:16.750> this<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> halogen<00:03:17.799> light<00:03:18.070> ball<00:03:18.250> as

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
also this is a halogen light ball as

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.270 
also this is a halogen light ball as
well<00:03:18.610> so<00:03:19.090> basically<00:03:19.450> inside<00:03:20.170> this<00:03:20.620> there's<00:03:21.070> a

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
well so basically inside this there's a

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.729 
well so basically inside this there's a
little<00:03:21.810> enclosed<00:03:22.810> area<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.320> guess<00:03:23.530> that's

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
little enclosed area I guess that's

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.350 
little enclosed area I guess that's
where<00:03:25.019> the

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
where the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.650 
where the
the<00:03:27.750> halogen<00:03:28.580> resides<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:30.209> cool<00:03:30.390> thing<00:03:30.569> about

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
the halogen resides the cool thing about

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.559 
the halogen resides the cool thing about
these<00:03:30.900> is<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:31.260> they<00:03:31.950> tend<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.700> be<00:03:32.849> really

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
these is that they tend to be really

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.250 
these is that they tend to be really
bright<00:03:33.870> some<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.739> ones<00:03:35.900> floodlights<00:03:36.900> the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
bright some of the ones floodlights the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.670 
bright some of the ones floodlights the
ones<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.769> are<00:03:38.069> used<00:03:38.610> outdoors<00:03:39.239> for

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
ones that are used outdoors for

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.160 
ones that are used outdoors for
construction<00:03:40.680> some<00:03:41.550> of<00:03:41.640> those<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:42.269> ranges

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
construction some of those the ranges

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.640 
construction some of those the ranges
anywhere<00:03:43.319> from<00:03:44.840> fifteen<00:03:45.840> hundred<00:03:46.140> lumens<00:03:46.470> -

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
anywhere from fifteen hundred lumens -

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.500 
anywhere from fifteen hundred lumens -
I've<00:03:46.769> seen<00:03:46.950> some<00:03:47.010> up<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.550> three<00:03:48.090> thousand

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
I've seen some up to a three thousand

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.080 
I've seen some up to a three thousand
lumens<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:49.019> they<00:03:49.590> get<00:03:49.800> bright<00:03:50.040> instantly<00:03:50.819> so

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
lumens and they get bright instantly so

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.140 
lumens and they get bright instantly so
that's<00:03:51.330> very<00:03:51.599> good<00:03:51.750> for<00:03:52.050> that<00:03:52.670> for<00:03:53.670> industrial

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
that's very good for that for industrial

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.960 
that's very good for that for industrial
kind<00:03:54.269> of<00:03:54.420> use<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.890> only<00:03:56.099> drawback<00:03:56.670> with<00:03:56.879> the

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
kind of use the only drawback with the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.080 
kind of use the only drawback with the
halogen<00:03:57.360> light<00:03:57.510> bulbs<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:58.049> that<00:03:58.580> they<00:03:59.580> get

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
halogen light bulbs is that they get

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.720 
halogen light bulbs is that they get
really<00:04:00.450> hot<00:04:00.780> really<00:04:01.019> fast<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:02.099> if<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.489> have

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
really hot really fast so if you have

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.800 
really hot really fast so if you have
let's<00:04:03.150> say<00:04:03.299> one<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.510> those<00:04:05.060> recessed<00:04:06.060> lights

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
let's say one of those recessed lights

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.400 
let's say one of those recessed lights
or<00:04:07.019> maybe<00:04:07.470> something<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.160> is<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.670> little<00:04:09.090> bit

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
or maybe something that is a little bit

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.440 
or maybe something that is a little bit
it<00:04:10.410> has<00:04:10.590> an<00:04:10.769> enclosure<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:11.970> it

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
it has an enclosure to it

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.259 
it has an enclosure to it
it's<00:04:13.049> not<00:04:13.380> safe<00:04:13.739> to<00:04:14.069> use<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.579> halogen<00:04:15.060> light

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
it's not safe to use a halogen light

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.210 
it's not safe to use a halogen light
bulb<00:04:15.480> because<00:04:15.709> not<00:04:16.709> because<00:04:17.040> of<00:04:17.070> the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
bulb because not because of the

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.340 
bulb because not because of the
brightness<00:04:17.579> but<00:04:17.760> because<00:04:18.030> of<00:04:18.060> or<00:04:18.570> even<00:04:18.630> the

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
brightness but because of or even the

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.979 
brightness but because of or even the
watch<00:04:19.560> but<00:04:19.950> because<00:04:20.220> of<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:21.090> how<00:04:21.479> much<00:04:21.660> heat

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
watch but because of the how much heat

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.800 
watch but because of the how much heat
that<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.590> light<00:04:22.770> bulbs<00:04:23.070> emit<00:04:23.450> you<00:04:24.450> can<00:04:24.600> it

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
that the light bulbs emit you can it

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.409 
that the light bulbs emit you can it
basically<00:04:25.290> it's<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.530> risk<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.950> fire<00:04:26.760> hazard<00:04:27.030> and

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
basically it's a risk a fire hazard and

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.909 
basically it's a risk a fire hazard and
the<00:04:28.400> last<00:04:29.400> type<00:04:29.669> of<00:04:29.790> light<00:04:29.970> is<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.900> LED<00:04:31.680> lights

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
the last type of light is the LED lights

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.350 
the last type of light is the LED lights
which<00:04:32.130> I<00:04:32.250> don't<00:04:32.310> have<00:04:32.520> an<00:04:32.639> example<00:04:32.850> with<00:04:33.120> me

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
which I don't have an example with me

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.300 
which I don't have an example with me
actually<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:34.050> one<00:04:34.229> right<00:04:34.410> above<00:04:34.440> this<00:04:34.889> camera

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
actually the one right above this camera

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.350 
actually the one right above this camera
is<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.729> SF<00:04:36.600> LEDs<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.889> LEDs<00:04:38.280> are<00:04:39.830> they

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
is a SF LEDs and the LEDs are they

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.600 
is a SF LEDs and the LEDs are they
they're<00:04:42.360> they<00:04:42.630> stay<00:04:42.840> very<00:04:42.870> cool<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:43.830> they're

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
they're they stay very cool and they're

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.879 
they're they stay very cool and they're
they're<00:04:45.270> bright<00:04:45.479> the<00:04:45.690> only<00:04:45.840> thing<00:04:46.020> is<00:04:46.169> that<00:04:46.440> to

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
they're bright the only thing is that to

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.090 
they're bright the only thing is that to
line<00:04:47.100> up<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.400> big<00:04:47.580> space<00:04:47.910> you<00:04:48.120> need<00:04:48.240> i<00:04:48.919> of<00:04:49.919> them

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
line up a big space you need i of them

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.640 
line up a big space you need i of them
basically<00:04:50.389> so<00:04:51.389> I<00:04:51.419> think<00:04:51.539> the<00:04:51.930> one<00:04:52.080> right<00:04:52.440> above

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
basically so I think the one right above

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.790 
basically so I think the one right above
my<00:04:52.800> camera<00:04:53.220> I<00:04:53.250> think<00:04:53.430> there's<00:04:53.669> around<00:04:54.650> my<00:04:55.650> me

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
my camera I think there's around my me

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.890 
my camera I think there's around my me
quick<00:04:56.130> gasp<00:04:56.370> all<00:04:56.700> about<00:04:57.030> hundred<00:04:57.240> fifty<00:04:57.479> LEDs

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
quick gasp all about hundred fifty LEDs

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.820 
quick gasp all about hundred fifty LEDs
all<00:04:58.770> together<00:05:00.139> so<00:05:01.139> those<00:05:01.350> are<00:05:01.590> basically<00:05:01.740> the

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
all together so those are basically the

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.260 
all together so those are basically the
four<00:05:04.830> major<00:05:04.980> types<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:05.400> light<00:05:05.580> bulbs<00:05:05.760> as<00:05:06.030> far

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
four major types of light bulbs as far

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.450 
four major types of light bulbs as far
as<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:06.510> lumens<00:05:06.960> if<00:05:07.230> you're<00:05:07.890> doing<00:05:08.070> life

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
as the lumens if you're doing life

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.420 
as the lumens if you're doing life
photography<00:05:09.120> which<00:05:09.300> is<00:05:09.450> why<00:05:09.930> I'm<00:05:10.080> doing<00:05:10.440> they

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
photography which is why I'm doing they

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.490 
photography which is why I'm doing they
actually<00:05:11.760> have<00:05:11.970> a<00:05:12.270> specific<00:05:13.110> time<00:05:13.230> I<00:05:13.260> think

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
actually have a specific time I think

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.330 
actually have a specific time I think
this<00:05:13.890> company<00:05:14.220> eco<00:05:14.940> makes<00:05:15.150> them<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:16.680> one<00:05:16.920> that

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
this company eco makes them the one that

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.680 
this company eco makes them the one that
I'm<00:05:17.550> actually<00:05:17.670> using<00:05:17.970> right<00:05:18.210> now<00:05:18.390> they're

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
I'm actually using right now they're

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.970 
I'm actually using right now they're
both<00:05:19.070> five<00:05:20.070> hundred<00:05:20.430> watts<00:05:20.840> and<00:05:21.860> but<00:05:22.860> the

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
both five hundred watts and but the

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.430 
both five hundred watts and but the
crazy<00:05:23.250> thing<00:05:23.640> is<00:05:23.670> that<00:05:23.850> each<00:05:24.630> of<00:05:24.690> these<00:05:25.080> lamps

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
crazy thing is that each of these lamps

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.460 
crazy thing is that each of these lamps
then<00:05:26.160> made<00:05:26.520> thirteen<00:05:27.030> thousand<00:05:27.660> thirteen

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
then made thirteen thousand thirteen

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.090 
then made thirteen thousand thirteen
thousand<00:05:29.310> lumens<00:05:29.760> each<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:31.440> only<00:05:31.650> drawback

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
thousand lumens each the only drawback

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.530 
thousand lumens each the only drawback
is<00:05:32.250> they<00:05:32.460> don't<00:05:32.580> last<00:05:32.820> that<00:05:33.000> long

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
is they don't last that long

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.420 
is they don't last that long
this<00:05:33.990> one<00:05:34.170> that<00:05:34.290> I'm<00:05:34.470> holding<00:05:34.710> specifically

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
this one that I'm holding specifically

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.900 
this one that I'm holding specifically
is<00:05:35.610> half<00:05:36.210> that<00:05:36.540> so<00:05:36.810> 6,500<00:05:37.800> lumens

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
is half that so 6,500 lumens

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.380 
is half that so 6,500 lumens
it's<00:05:39.150> 250<00:05:39.750> watts<00:05:39.960> and<00:05:40.200> it<00:05:40.350> lasts<00:05:40.680> only<00:05:41.390> it

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
it's 250 watts and it lasts only it

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.570 
it's 250 watts and it lasts only it
boxes<00:05:42.840> 20<00:05:43.170> hours<00:05:43.500> sometimes<00:05:44.190> it<00:05:44.310> lasts<00:05:44.490> a

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
boxes 20 hours sometimes it lasts a

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.140 
boxes 20 hours sometimes it lasts a
little<00:05:44.640> more<00:05:45.920> sometimes<00:05:46.920> less<00:05:47.130> but<00:05:47.610> usually

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
little more sometimes less but usually

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.790 
little more sometimes less but usually
it's<00:05:48.510> a<00:05:48.600> little<00:05:48.780> bit<00:05:48.990> more<00:05:49.110> but<00:05:49.350> not<00:05:49.470> that<00:05:49.620> much

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
it's a little bit more but not that much

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.200 
it's a little bit more but not that much
more<00:05:50.040> than<00:05:50.100> what<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.550> advertising<00:05:51.060> these

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
more than what the advertising these

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.560 
more than what the advertising these
boxes<00:05:51.630> for<00:05:51.810> photography<00:05:53.270> so<00:05:54.270> basically

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
boxes for photography so basically

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.380 
boxes for photography so basically
that's<00:05:54.810> just<00:05:54.990> a<00:05:55.200> general<00:05:55.940> very<00:05:56.940> general

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
that's just a general very general

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.300 
that's just a general very general
explanation<00:05:57.660> of<00:05:58.050> what<00:05:58.230> lumens<00:05:58.710> are<00:05:58.890> is<00:05:59.100> just

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
explanation of what lumens are is just

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.130 
explanation of what lumens are is just
basically<00:05:59.670> the<00:05:59.850> unit<00:06:00.120> of<00:06:00.300> how<00:06:00.480> bright<00:06:00.840> things

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
basically the unit of how bright things

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.130 
basically the unit of how bright things
are<00:06:01.350> so<00:06:01.530> fully<00:06:01.770> my<00:06:01.890> comparisons<00:06:02.840> help<00:06:03.840> give

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
are so fully my comparisons help give

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:10.100 
are so fully my comparisons help give
perspective<00:06:04.470> of<00:06:05.040> how<00:06:05.190> of<00:06:06.060> what<00:06:07.790> the<00:06:08.840> range<00:06:09.840> in

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
perspective of how of what the range in

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.320 
perspective of how of what the range in
lumens<00:06:10.530> are<00:06:10.740> mean<00:06:11.190> as<00:06:11.460> well<00:06:11.730> as<00:06:12.230> just<00:06:13.230> given<00:06:13.560> a

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
lumens are mean as well as just given a

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.880 
lumens are mean as well as just given a
fairly<00:06:15.330> general<00:06:15.780> overview<00:06:16.560> of<00:06:16.620> the<00:06:16.710> different

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
fairly general overview of the different

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.590 
fairly general overview of the different
types<00:06:17.070> of<00:06:17.250> light<00:06:17.400> bulbs<00:06:17.520> so<00:06:17.790> found<00:06:18.480> this

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
types of light bulbs so found this

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.810 
types of light bulbs so found this
helpful<00:06:18.840> and<00:06:19.200> if<00:06:19.590> you<00:06:19.620> have<00:06:19.710> a<00:06:20.130> please
