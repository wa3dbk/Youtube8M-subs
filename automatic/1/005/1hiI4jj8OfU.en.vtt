00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:42.679 
don't blend in per se what I was
thinking<00:02:37.769> about<00:02:37.829> doing<00:02:38.159> is<00:02:38.719> taking<00:02:39.719> a<00:02:41.689> little

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
thinking about doing is taking a little

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.619 
thinking about doing is taking a little
clay<00:02:42.989> pots<00:02:43.019> that<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.680> saw<00:02:43.950> at<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.879> store<00:02:45.359> or<00:02:45.389> local

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
clay pots that I saw at a store or local

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.199 
clay pots that I saw at a store or local
store<00:02:46.019> around<00:02:46.230> here<00:02:46.349> and<00:02:46.819> they're<00:02:47.819> about<00:02:47.939> the

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
store around here and they're about the

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.659 
store around here and they're about the
same<00:02:48.359> size<00:02:48.419> as<00:02:48.840> these<00:02:49.069> which<00:02:50.069> is<00:02:50.250> perfect

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:50.669 
same size as these which is perfect

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.479 
same size as these which is perfect
because<00:02:50.760> that's<00:02:51.120> about<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.870> size<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.199> want<00:02:52.489> but

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
because that's about the size I want but

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.830 
because that's about the size I want but
they're<00:02:53.609> like<00:02:53.760> little<00:02:53.969> clay<00:02:54.180> pots<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:54.719> know

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
they're like little clay pots you know

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.159 
they're like little clay pots you know
like<00:02:55.109> what<00:02:55.319> you'd<00:02:55.469> have<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.769> your<00:02:55.859> garden<00:02:56.069> and

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
like what you'd have in your garden and

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.979 
like what you'd have in your garden and
I<00:02:58.819> think<00:02:59.819> that<00:02:59.939> would<00:03:00.090> blend<00:03:00.329> in<00:03:00.569> a<00:03:00.599> bit<00:03:00.810> better

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
I think that would blend in a bit better

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.539 
I think that would blend in a bit better
and<00:03:01.169> it'd<00:03:01.290> be<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.439> bit<00:03:01.650> easier<00:03:01.980> for<00:03:02.159> me<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.280> hide

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
and it'd be a bit easier for me to hide

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.970 
and it'd be a bit easier for me to hide
them<00:03:02.730> with<00:03:02.760> rocks<00:03:03.379> because<00:03:04.379> I<00:03:04.560> want<00:03:04.769> it<00:03:04.889> to

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
them with rocks because I want it to

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.530 
them with rocks because I want it to
look<00:03:05.129> as<00:03:05.280> natural<00:03:05.489> as<00:03:05.879> possible<00:03:08.000> also<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:11.540> don't

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
look as natural as possible also I don't

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.240 
look as natural as possible also I don't
know<00:03:12.719> what<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.019> want<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.379> do<00:03:13.500> yet<00:03:13.859> with<00:03:14.069> this

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
know what I want to do yet with this

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.159 
know what I want to do yet with this
little<00:03:14.639> section<00:03:14.849> I<00:03:15.239> haven't<00:03:15.629> quite<00:03:15.930> picked

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
little section I haven't quite picked

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.839 
little section I haven't quite picked
out<00:03:16.379> some<00:03:16.590> plants<00:03:16.979> that<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.159> actually<00:03:17.400> want<00:03:17.819> to
