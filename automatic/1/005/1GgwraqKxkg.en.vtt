let's<00:00:45.010> just<00:00:45.100> make<00:00:45.340> a<00:00:45.370> mess<00:00:47.550> okay<00:00:48.550> when<00:00:48.700> you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
let's just make a mess okay when you

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.450 
let's just make a mess okay when you
pour<00:00:49.059> you<00:00:49.690> want<00:00:49.870> to<00:00:49.930> pour<00:00:50.200> the<00:00:51.010> hotter<00:00:51.220> the

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
pour you want to pour the hotter the

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.610 
pour you want to pour the hotter the
plastic<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.059> easier<00:00:52.330> it<00:00:52.450> is<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.570> pour<00:00:52.900> so<00:00:53.530> you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
plastic the easier it is to pour so you

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.510 
plastic the easier it is to pour so you
want<00:00:53.770> to<00:00:53.860> be<00:00:53.950> really<00:00:54.250> careful<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:56.370> pour<00:00:57.370> the

want to be really careful and pour the
tail<00:00:57.760> first<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:04.239> you<00:01:04.330> can<00:01:04.390> get<00:01:04.660> the<00:01:04.780> detail<00:01:05.170> and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
tail first so you can get the detail and

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.200 
tail first so you can get the detail and
then<00:01:06.100> when<00:01:06.220> it<00:01:06.340> comes<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.760> body<00:01:06.940> you<00:01:07.090> can

when<00:03:35.130> you<00:03:35.250> couldn't<00:03:35.550> see<00:03:35.760> I'm<00:03:36.360> gonna<00:03:36.480> try<00:03:36.840> to

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
when you couldn't see I'm gonna try to

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:47.150 
when you couldn't see I'm gonna try to
finish<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.430> off

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.230 

okay<00:03:48.160> so<00:03:48.780> with<00:03:49.780> that<00:03:49.810> little<00:03:50.050> bit<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:51.090> was<00:03:52.090> able

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
okay so with that little bit I was able

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.640 
okay so with that little bit I was able
to<00:03:52.390> pour<00:03:55.260> all<00:03:56.260> those<00:03:56.530> fish<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:58.410> now<00:03:59.410> I'm<00:03:59.530> gonna

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
to pour all those fish and now I'm gonna

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.640 
to pour all those fish and now I'm gonna
zoom<00:03:59.950> out<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.840> see<00:04:01.900> if<00:04:02.110> we<00:04:02.230> can<00:04:02.380> do<00:04:02.530> a<00:04:03.930> Cinco<00:04:04.930> if

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
zoom out and see if we can do a Cinco if

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.400 
zoom out and see if we can do a Cinco if
my<00:04:05.860> plastic<00:04:06.310> isn't<00:04:06.460> cooled<00:04:06.790> off<00:04:06.940> too<00:04:07.150> much

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.610 

maybe<00:04:11.410> I<00:04:11.560> can<00:04:11.740> do<00:04:11.860> one<00:04:12.690> this<00:04:13.690> does<00:04:13.930> this<00:04:14.200> even

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
maybe I can do one this does this even

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.080 
maybe I can do one this does this even
this<00:04:14.710> takes<00:04:14.950> a<00:04:15.040> little<00:04:15.220> practice<00:04:15.640> because<00:04:15.940> the

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
this takes a little practice because the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.479 
this takes a little practice because the
feeder<00:04:16.299> hole<00:04:16.540> is<00:04:16.750> small<00:04:17.049> and<00:04:17.980> you<00:04:18.130> want<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.400> get

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
feeder hole is small and you want to get

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.010 
feeder hole is small and you want to get
it<00:04:18.610> right<00:04:18.790> in<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.180> middle<00:04:20.910> or<00:04:21.910> it'll<00:04:22.630> plug<00:04:22.810> up

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
it right in the middle or it'll plug up

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.240 
it right in the middle or it'll plug up
and<00:04:23.290> that<00:04:23.560> one<00:04:23.740> just<00:04:23.770> plugged<00:04:24.160> up<00:04:26.010> let's<00:04:27.010> try

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
and that one just plugged up let's try

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.950 
and that one just plugged up let's try
one<00:04:27.460> more

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.370 

and<00:04:31.960> my<00:04:32.140> plastics<00:04:32.650> cooling<00:04:36.270> nope<00:04:37.270> not<00:04:38.230> going

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
and my plastics cooling nope not going

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:52.670 
and my plastics cooling nope not going
to<00:04:38.470> happen

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.280 

nope

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.390 

see<00:04:57.290> when<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.530> plastic<00:04:57.889> cools<00:04:58.160> off<00:04:58.370> it

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
see when the plastic cools off it

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.240 
see when the plastic cools off it
changes<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.060> flow<00:04:59.240> rate<00:04:59.509> you<00:05:02.770> can<00:05:03.770> you<00:05:04.070> see

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
changes the flow rate you can you see

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.249 
changes the flow rate you can you see
how<00:05:04.370> wide<00:05:04.580> it<00:05:04.789> is<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:05.270> it<00:05:05.720> bounces<00:05:06.590> around

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
how wide it is and it bounces around

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:15.999 
how wide it is and it bounces around
it's<00:05:09.259> slow<00:05:09.740> to<00:05:09.800> smooth<00:05:10.370> out<00:05:14.470> you<00:05:15.470> can't<00:05:15.740> you

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
it's slow to smooth out you can't you

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.320 
it's slow to smooth out you can't you
don't<00:05:16.039> have<00:05:16.250> any<00:05:16.400> control<00:05:16.669> when<00:05:17.000> it's<00:05:17.150> like

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
don't have any control when it's like

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.610 
don't have any control when it's like
that<00:05:17.539> it<00:05:17.810> seems<00:05:17.990> like<00:05:18.050> you<00:05:18.199> would<00:05:18.289> have<00:05:18.440> more

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
that it seems like you would have more

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.800 
that it seems like you would have more
control<00:05:18.889> but<00:05:19.130> you<00:05:19.250> don't<00:05:19.460> see<00:05:20.150> the<00:05:20.479> plastic

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
control but you don't see the plastic

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:30.210 
control but you don't see the plastic
didn't<00:05:21.259> even<00:05:21.380> didn't<00:05:22.310> even<00:05:22.490> smooth<00:05:22.699> out<00:05:28.960> and

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
didn't even didn't even smooth out and

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.189 
didn't even didn't even smooth out and
actually<00:05:31.220> because<00:05:31.940> that<00:05:31.970> aluminum<00:05:32.600> is<00:05:32.690> cold<00:05:32.930> I

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
actually because that aluminum is cold I

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:48.610 
actually because that aluminum is cold I
can<00:05:33.380> already<00:05:33.590> feel<00:05:33.889> that<00:05:33.949> off<00:05:45.820> see<00:05:47.620> the

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
can already feel that off see the

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.920 
can already feel that off see the
plastic<00:05:49.099> was<00:05:49.250> cold<00:05:49.520> and<00:05:49.910> so<00:05:50.330> it<00:05:50.479> plugged<00:05:50.750> up

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
plastic was cold and so it plugged up

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:59.010 
plastic was cold and so it plugged up
the<00:05:51.620> feeder<00:05:51.889> and<00:05:52.570> the<00:05:54.160> baits<00:05:55.160> wouldn't<00:05:55.490> pour

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.900 

but<00:06:00.020> if<00:06:00.110> I<00:06:00.199> wanted<00:06:00.530> to<00:06:00.590> I<00:06:00.919> could<00:06:01.430> put<00:06:01.460> that<00:06:01.610> back

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
but if I wanted to I could put that back

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.029 
but if I wanted to I could put that back
in<00:06:02.060> the<00:06:02.120> microwave<00:06:02.539> for<00:06:02.870> another<00:06:03.229> two<00:06:03.590> minutes

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
in the microwave for another two minutes

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:08.920 
in the microwave for another two minutes
and<00:06:04.610> it'd<00:06:04.789> be<00:06:04.820> ready<00:06:05.150> to<00:06:05.210> pour<00:06:05.419> again<00:06:07.449> in<00:06:08.449> this

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
and it'd be ready to pour again in this

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.969 
and it'd be ready to pour again in this
case<00:06:09.169> here<00:06:09.760> our<00:06:10.760> video<00:06:10.970> songs<00:06:11.300> off<00:06:12.610> so<00:06:13.610> I

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
case here our video songs off so I

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:19.320 
case here our video songs off so I
pulled<00:06:15.979> this<00:06:16.159> bait<00:06:16.370> out<00:06:17.080> it's<00:06:18.080> a<00:06:18.169> little<00:06:18.409> dark

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
pulled this bait out it's a little dark

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:25.570 
pulled this bait out it's a little dark
for<00:06:20.330> watermelon<00:06:20.979> but<00:06:21.979> it's<00:06:22.099> not<00:06:22.250> too<00:06:22.430> bad<00:06:24.580> so

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
for watermelon but it's not too bad so

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.600 
for watermelon but it's not too bad so
this<00:06:25.729> is<00:06:25.789> a<00:06:25.940> hand<00:06:26.270> poured<00:06:27.099> what's<00:06:28.099> supposed<00:06:28.400> to

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
this is a hand poured what's supposed to

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.300 
this is a hand poured what's supposed to
be<00:06:28.760> the<00:06:29.270> same

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.560 

as<00:06:34.990> this<00:06:35.990> one<00:06:36.200> out<00:06:36.320> of<00:06:36.350> a<00:06:36.500> mold<00:06:36.740> and<00:06:37.570> obviously

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
as this one out of a mold and obviously

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.070 
as this one out of a mold and obviously
the<00:06:38.840> mold<00:06:39.080> one<00:06:39.850> looks<00:06:40.850> considerably<00:06:41.270> better

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
the mold one looks considerably better

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.260 
the mold one looks considerably better
it<00:06:42.980> really<00:06:43.190> looks<00:06:43.490> professional

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
it really looks professional

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.040 
it really looks professional
store-bought<00:06:46.240> the<00:06:47.240> dimensions<00:06:47.720> are<00:06:47.870> a<00:06:47.900> little

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
store-bought the dimensions are a little

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:55.570 
store-bought the dimensions are a little
different<00:06:48.320> but<00:06:52.720> and<00:06:53.830> that's<00:06:54.830> it<00:06:55.040> that's<00:06:55.250> hand

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
different but and that's it that's hand

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.870 
different but and that's it that's hand
pouring<00:06:57.070> maybe<00:06:58.070> in<00:06:58.220> a<00:06:58.310> minute<00:06:58.520> we'll<00:06:58.670> do

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 
pouring maybe in a minute we'll do

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.810 
pouring maybe in a minute we'll do
injection<00:06:59.630> mold
