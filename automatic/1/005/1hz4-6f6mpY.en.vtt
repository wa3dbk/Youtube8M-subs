to<00:01:59.750> customize<00:02:00.320> what<00:02:00.470> every<00:02:00.710> button<00:02:00.890> does<00:02:01.130> so

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
to customize what every button does so

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.440 
to customize what every button does so
even<00:02:01.549> if<00:02:01.640> I<00:02:01.700> want<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:01.909> use<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.090> gamecube

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
even if I want to use the gamecube

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.969 
even if I want to use the gamecube
controller<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:02.930> changeup<00:02:03.260> which<00:02:03.470> buttons<00:02:03.799> do

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
controller and changeup which buttons do

specials<00:02:04.430> which<00:02:04.610> buttons<00:02:04.909> do<00:02:05.030> smashes<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:05.600> can

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
specials which buttons do smashes I can

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.480 
specials which buttons do smashes I can
do<00:02:06.080> that<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:06.470> amongst<00:02:06.830> all<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.220> different

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
do that so amongst all the different

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.859 
do that so amongst all the different
options<00:02:07.790> there's<00:02:08.000> definitely<00:02:08.509> way<00:02:08.659> for

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
options there's definitely way for

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.020 
options there's definitely way for
everyone<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.379> control<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:09.979> game<00:02:10.159> if<00:02:10.970> you

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
immediately going to notice with brawl

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.680 
immediately going to notice with brawl
is<00:02:13.549> that<00:02:13.700> while<00:02:13.819> there's<00:02:13.970> much<00:02:14.150> more<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.390> it

really more of a story mode mixed with
the<00:02:44.470> actual<00:02:44.710> combat<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.430> find<00:02:45.640> the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
the actual combat that you find the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.400 
the actual combat that you find the
wrong<00:02:45.910> with<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.630> said<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.960> did<00:02:47.080> take<00:02:47.230> just

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
wrong with that said it did take just

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.690 
wrong with that said it did take just
about<00:02:47.530> at<00:02:47.800> eight<00:02:47.980> hours<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.370> get<00:02:48.460> through<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
about at eight hours to get through the

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.220 
about at eight hours to get through the
entire<00:02:48.910> Subspace<00:02:49.330> Emissary<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:49.930> isn't<00:02:50.140> the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
entire Subspace Emissary so it isn't the

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.560 
entire Subspace Emissary so it isn't the
longest<00:02:50.650> mode<00:02:51.190> but<00:02:51.550> as<00:02:51.790> an<00:02:51.880> extension<00:02:52.330> to<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
longest mode but as an extension to the

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.180 
longest mode but as an extension to the
core<00:02:52.780> gameplay<00:02:52.990> still<00:02:53.560> pretty<00:02:53.740> good<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:54.070> have

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
core gameplay still pretty good I have

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
core gameplay still pretty good I have
to<00:02:54.310> tell<00:02:54.490> you<00:02:54.550> though<00:02:54.670> man<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.850> really<00:02:55.090> found

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
to tell you though man I really found

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.250 
to tell you though man I really found
this<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.480> be<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.630> weakest<00:02:55.900> point<00:02:56.110> of<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.230> game

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
this to be the weakest point of the game

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.440 
this to be the weakest point of the game
just<00:02:56.530> felt<00:02:56.740> repetitive<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.370> me<00:02:57.490> and<00:02:57.730> force<00:02:58.120> is

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
just felt repetitive to me and force is

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.400 
just felt repetitive to me and force is
not<00:02:58.600> nearly<00:02:58.780> as<00:02:58.900> polished<00:02:59.290> as<00:02:59.290> the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
not nearly as polished as the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.350 
not nearly as polished as the
multiplayer<00:02:59.860> stuff<00:03:00.130> oh<00:03:00.340> absolutely<00:03:00.640> as<00:03:01.180> an

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
multiplayer stuff oh absolutely as an

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.760 
multiplayer stuff oh absolutely as an
extra<00:03:01.690> it's<00:03:01.810> really<00:03:02.050> cool<00:03:02.170> but<00:03:02.410> definitely

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
extra it's really cool but definitely

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.200 
extra it's really cool but definitely
don't<00:03:02.890> buy<00:03:03.040> this<00:03:03.100> game<00:03:03.400> for<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:03.850> package

don't buy this game for this package

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.120 
don't buy this game for this package
it's<00:03:04.330> not<00:03:04.510> like<00:03:04.840> as<00:03:04.990> deep<00:03:05.260> as<00:03:05.410> an<00:03:05.470> RPG<00:03:05.860> would<00:03:06.010> be

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
it's not like as deep as an RPG would be

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.250 
it's not like as deep as an RPG would be
so<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> very<00:03:06.880> shallow<00:03:07.180> but<00:03:07.420> fun<00:03:07.630> stage<00:03:07.930> editor

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
so a very shallow but fun stage editor

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.870 
so a very shallow but fun stage editor

play it's open game single player is

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.370 
play it's open game single player is
good<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:25.630> fine<00:03:25.840> but<00:03:26.020> I<00:03:26.050> think<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.260> majority

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
good and fine but I think the majority

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.900 
good and fine but I think the majority
of<00:03:26.650> us<00:03:26.770> would<00:03:26.950> be<00:03:26.980> playing<00:03:27.280> brawl<00:03:27.520> for<00:03:27.790> its

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
of us would be playing brawl for its

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.790 
of us would be playing brawl for its
multiplayer<00:03:28.240> mode<00:03:28.630> which<00:03:28.810> is<00:03:28.840> tighter<00:03:29.230> more

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
multiplayer mode which is tighter more

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.500 
multiplayer mode which is tighter more
balanced<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:30.400> faster<00:03:30.880> than<00:03:30.910> ever<00:03:31.120> has<00:03:31.360> been

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
balanced and faster than ever has been

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.030 
balanced and faster than ever has been
before<00:03:31.570> there's<00:03:32.350> also<00:03:32.470> slew<00:03:32.830> of<00:03:32.860> new

kind<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.340> add<00:03:39.489> like<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.820> little<00:03:39.910> bit<00:03:40.209> more

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
kind of add like a little bit more

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.060 
kind of add like a little bit more
harmony<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.780> all<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:40.959> characters<00:03:41.320> more

harmony to all the characters more
balanced<00:03:42.430> overall<00:03:42.790> then<00:03:43.239> there's<00:03:43.390> things

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
balanced overall then there's things

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.880 
balanced overall then there's things
like<00:03:43.630> mid<00:03:43.900> air<00:03:44.020> dodge<00:03:44.230> which<00:03:44.470> have<00:03:44.590> been<00:03:44.709> added

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
like mid air dodge which have been added

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.740 
like mid air dodge which have been added
as<00:03:45.190> well<00:03:45.370> as<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.520> wall<00:03:45.790> climbing<00:03:46.030> wall<00:03:46.390> grabbing

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
as well as a wall climbing wall grabbing

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.420 
as well as a wall climbing wall grabbing
and<00:03:46.900> they've<00:03:47.500> actually<00:03:47.590> removed<00:03:47.980> wavedashing

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
and they've actually removed wavedashing

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.530 
and they've actually removed wavedashing
which<00:03:48.640> is<00:03:48.760> probably<00:03:48.940> a<00:03:49.060> pretty<00:03:49.180> good<00:03:49.300> thing

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
which is probably a pretty good thing

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.760 
which is probably a pretty good thing
considering<00:03:49.870> you'd<00:03:50.020> be<00:03:50.140> playing<00:03:50.290> online<00:03:50.500> with

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
considering you'd be playing online with

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.080 
considering you'd be playing online with
a<00:03:50.830> lot<00:03:50.980> of<00:03:51.010> casual<00:03:51.340> players<00:03:51.580> but<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:51.970> really

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
a lot of casual players but it really

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.850 
a lot of casual players but it really
boils<00:03:52.420> down<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.780> is<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:52.959> yes<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:53.500> does<00:03:53.650> feel

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
boils down to is that yes it does feel

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.530 
boils down to is that yes it does feel
like<00:03:53.950> smash<00:03:54.190> brothers<00:03:54.370> before<00:03:54.640> it<00:03:54.970> but<00:03:55.420> it

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
like smash brothers before it but it

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.090 
like smash brothers before it but it
feels<00:03:55.630> like<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.870> great<00:03:56.290> version<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:56.920> and

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
feels like a great version of it and

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.310 
feels like a great version of it and

nice along those same lines the game
really<00:04:54.419> does<00:04:54.630> have<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:54.840> kind<00:04:55.110> of<00:04:55.230> polished<00:04:55.710> and

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
really does have a kind of polished and

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.379 
really does have a kind of polished and
unpolished<00:04:56.310> feel<00:04:56.669> to<00:04:56.850> it<00:04:56.880> and<00:04:57.060> what<00:04:57.180> we<00:04:57.240> mean

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
unpolished feel to it and what we mean

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:58.760 
unpolished feel to it and what we mean
by<00:04:57.419> that<00:04:57.570> is<00:04:57.810> that<00:04:57.840> certain<00:04:58.290> aspects<00:04:58.620> are

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
by that is that certain aspects are

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.140 
by that is that certain aspects are
really<00:04:59.010> well<00:04:59.130> done<00:04:59.160> while<00:04:59.520> others<00:04:59.760> seem<00:04:59.970> to<00:05:00.060> be

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
really well done while others seem to be

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.909 
really well done while others seem to be
lacking<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.870> inherent<00:05:01.229> issue<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.500> course<00:05:01.710> is

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
lacking the inherent issue of course is

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.560 
lacking the inherent issue of course is
that<00:05:01.979> its<00:05:02.280> sequel<00:05:02.700> and<00:05:02.910> therefore<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:03.360> feels

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
that its sequel and therefore it feels

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.940 
that its sequel and therefore it feels
very<00:05:03.780> much<00:05:03.900> like<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.200> other<00:05:04.320> games<00:05:04.590> you<00:05:04.740> can't

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
very much like the other games you can't

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.260 
very much like the other games you can't
really<00:05:05.100> get<00:05:05.190> past<00:05:05.430> that<00:05:05.639> and<00:05:05.820> that's<00:05:06.030> just<00:05:06.150> the

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
really get past that and that's just the

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.520 
really get past that and that's just the
way<00:05:06.389> it<00:05:06.479> is<00:05:06.570> on<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.169> other<00:05:07.229> hand<00:05:07.320> the
