come<00:03:02.660> with<00:03:02.930> keyless<00:03:03.380> entry<00:03:04.900> why

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.450 

there<00:03:16.870> are<00:03:17.020> three<00:03:17.290> variants<00:03:17.770> to<00:03:18.010> choose<00:03:18.190> from

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
there are three variants to choose from

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.760 
there are three variants to choose from
for<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.970> beetle<00:03:19.360> currently<00:03:20.260> they<00:03:20.380> have<00:03:20.530> the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
for the beetle currently they have the

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.280 
for the beetle currently they have the
1.2<00:03:21.490> TSI<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.810> 2.0<00:03:23.680> TSI<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.870> 1.4<00:03:25.870> twin

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
1.2 TSI the 2.0 TSI and this 1.4 twin

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.040 
1.2 TSI the 2.0 TSI and this 1.4 twin
charge<00:03:26.650> TSI<00:03:27.310> engine<00:03:27.760> which<00:03:28.240> means<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:28.780> is

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
charge TSI engine which means it is

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.710 
charge TSI engine which means it is
turbocharged<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:30.390> supercharged<00:03:31.390> at<00:03:31.630> the

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.520 
same time together with a 7-speed DSG
gearbox<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:36.490> car<00:03:36.760> produces<00:03:37.530> 158

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
gearbox so this car produces 158

horsepower and 240 Newton meters on top

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.220 
horsepower and 240 Newton meters on top
so<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.060> might<00:03:43.300> think<00:03:43.540> it<00:03:43.690> would<00:03:43.810> be<00:03:43.900> special

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
so you might think it would be special

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.330 
so you might think it would be special
to<00:03:44.560> drive<00:03:44.800> because<00:03:45.190> this<00:03:45.730> orbital<00:03:46.510> well<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.920> is

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
to drive because this orbital well it is

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.970 
to drive because this orbital well it is
special<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:48.940> be<00:03:49.150> in<00:03:49.300> one<00:03:49.660> because<00:03:50.350> people

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
special to be in one because people

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.680 
special to be in one because people
always<00:03:51.130> go<00:03:51.400> hey<00:03:51.610> look<00:03:51.880> it's<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.150> bit<00:03:52.300> old<00:03:52.510> but

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
always go hey look it's a bit old but

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.040 
always go hey look it's a bit old but

to<00:03:56.320> drive<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:57.310> right<00:03:57.520> can<00:03:57.700> be<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:57.850> bit<00:03:57.970> stiff

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
to drive the right can be a bit stiff

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.670 
to drive the right can be a bit stiff
especially<00:03:58.780> when<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:58.960> come<00:03:59.110> across<00:03:59.230> our

the<00:04:06.970> steering<00:04:07.270> wheel<00:04:07.420> design<00:04:07.750> is<00:04:07.840> a<00:04:07.870> bit<00:04:08.080> too

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
the steering wheel design is a bit too

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.130 
the steering wheel design is a bit too
big<00:04:08.470> but<00:04:09.220> it's<00:04:09.490> well<00:04:09.730> weighted<00:04:10.210> it<00:04:10.930> does

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
big but it's well weighted it does

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.590 
big but it's well weighted it does
fatten<00:04:11.500> up<00:04:11.620> quite<00:04:11.860> nicely<00:04:12.030> around<00:04:13.030> corners<00:04:13.390> oh

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
fatten up quite nicely around corners oh

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.390 
fatten up quite nicely around corners oh
it<00:04:14.140> does<00:04:14.290> come<00:04:14.470> with<00:04:14.500> paddle<00:04:14.950> shifters<00:04:14.980> as

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
it does come with paddle shifters as

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.780 
it does come with paddle shifters as
well<00:04:15.640> but<00:04:16.209> for<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:16.750> beetle<00:04:17.170> I<00:04:17.489> don't<00:04:18.489> think<00:04:18.670> it's

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
well but for a beetle I don't think it's

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.300 
well but for a beetle I don't think it's
required<00:04:19.450> because<00:04:20.170> a<00:04:20.380> little<00:04:20.560> is<00:04:20.830> usually

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
required because a little is usually

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.450 
required because a little is usually

two compartments at the side Oh we'll

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.720 
two compartments at the side Oh we'll
check<00:05:52.980> this<00:05:53.160> out

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
check this out

00:05:53.730 --> 00:06:04.240 
check this out
that<00:05:54.480> look<00:05:54.660> is<00:05:55.230> nice<00:05:55.680> now<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.760> boot

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.379 

the<00:06:05.250> boot<00:06:05.460> space<00:06:05.670> is<00:06:05.730> pretty<00:06:06.120> impressive

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
the boot space is pretty impressive

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.750 
the boot space is pretty impressive
actually<00:06:06.810> but<00:06:07.470> there<00:06:07.800> is<00:06:07.920> a<00:06:08.130> limit<00:06:08.610> to<00:06:08.730> a

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
actually but there is a limit to a

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.220 
actually but there is a limit to a
certain<00:06:09.060> kind<00:06:09.180> of<00:06:09.270> things<00:06:09.540> you<00:06:09.720> can<00:06:09.870> put<00:06:10.080> in

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
certain kind of things you can put in

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.470 
certain kind of things you can put in
here<00:06:10.260> because<00:06:11.130> of<00:06:11.280> how<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.520> type<00:06:11.850> is<00:06:12.120> designed

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
here because of how the type is designed

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.350 
here because of how the type is designed
but<00:06:12.990> if<00:06:13.230> you<00:06:13.410> do<00:06:13.620> it<00:06:13.860> more<00:06:14.040> space<00:06:14.400> there<00:06:14.970> is<00:06:15.000> the

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
but if you do it more space there is the

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.080 
but if you do it more space there is the
TGT<00:06:15.900> split<00:06:16.320> configuration<00:06:17.010> for<00:06:17.280> the<00:06:17.400> real

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
TGT split configuration for the real

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
practicality is somewhat sacrifice if a
