issues associated with welding there's a

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.279 
issues associated with welding there's a

uprights<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.520> offer<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.820> solution<00:00:57.149> that's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
uprights so we offer a solution that's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.529 
uprights so we offer a solution that's
both<00:00:57.690> safe<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.350> that's<00:00:58.859> more<00:00:59.760> cost<00:01:00.000> effective

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
both safe and that's more cost effective

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.720 
both safe and that's more cost effective
than<00:01:00.780> most<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.170> alternatives<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.670> you

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
than most of the alternatives so you

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.650 
than most of the alternatives so you
said<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.180> there's<00:01:03.329> two<00:01:03.539> different

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
said that there's two different

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.140 
said that there's two different
solutions<00:01:03.930> but<00:01:04.739> there<00:01:05.189> are<00:01:05.400> alternatives<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
solutions but there are alternatives to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.399 
solutions but there are alternatives to
what<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.390> guys<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.200> tell<00:01:07.380> me

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
what you guys do can you just tell me

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.380 
what you guys do can you just tell me
both<00:01:07.650> both<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.549> those<00:01:08.610> solutions<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.240> how<00:01:09.330> you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
both both of those solutions and how you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.020 
both both of those solutions and how you
compare<00:01:09.810> sure<00:01:10.350> yeah<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.340> two<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.850> on

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
compare sure yeah so the two of this on

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.440 
compare sure yeah so the two of this on
one<00:01:12.180> solution<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.720> welding<00:01:13.640> welding<00:01:14.640> has<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
one solution is welding welding has the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.780 
one solution is welding welding has the
potential<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.439> reduce<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.009> tensile<00:01:17.400> strength

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
potential to reduce the tensile strength

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.980 
potential to reduce the tensile strength
of<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> steel<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:19.530> also<00:01:19.710> has<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
of the steel it also has in the in the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.940 
of the steel it also has in the in the
contours<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.049> different<00:01:22.320> types<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.619> welders

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
contours of different types of welders

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.080 
contours of different types of welders
and<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.720> lot<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.900> cases<00:01:25.220> you<00:01:26.220> know<00:01:26.310> they<00:01:26.460> may

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and in a lot of cases you know they may

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.060 
and in a lot of cases you know they may
be<00:01:27.119> underinsured<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.680> have<00:01:28.799> fire

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
be underinsured you have to have fire

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.030 
be underinsured you have to have fire
watch<00:01:29.369> which<00:01:30.079> provides<00:01:31.079> an<00:01:31.290> extra<00:01:31.590> cost<00:01:31.829> for

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
watch which provides an extra cost for

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.340 
watch which provides an extra cost for
the<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> warehouse<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the for the warehouse to do it and in a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.020 
the for the warehouse to do it and in a
lot<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.500> cases<00:01:34.740> you'll<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.250> an<00:01:35.369> inconsistent

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
lot of cases you'll get an inconsistent

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.179 
lot of cases you'll get an inconsistent
solution<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.570> more<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.189> craftsman

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
solution it's more of a craftsman

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.399 
solution it's more of a craftsman
solution<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:39.570> opposed<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.020> scientific

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409

solution<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.040> most<00:01:41.159> cases<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.600> second

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
solution in most cases and the second

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.179 
solution in most cases and the second
solution<00:01:43.200> which<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.590> replacement<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
solution which is replacement of the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.639 
solution which is replacement of the
upright<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.540> they're<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.990> couple<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.439> main

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
upright so that they're a couple of main

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
upright so that they're a couple of main
issues<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.579> first<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.270> all

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
issues with that if you first of all

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.840 
issues with that if you first of all
it's<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:48.869> very<00:01:49.110> labor-intensive<00:01:49.460> to<00:01:50.460> unload

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
it's it's very labor-intensive to unload

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.420 
it's it's very labor-intensive to unload
all<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.210> pallets<00:01:51.600> off<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.020> rack<00:01:52.220> then<00:01:53.220> you

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
all the pallets off of the rack then you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.859 
all the pallets off of the rack then you
have<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.729> dismantle<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.360> rack<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.720> to

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
have to dismantle the rack you have to

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.139 
have to dismantle the rack you have to
take<00:01:55.049> off<00:01:55.229> all<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.619> beams<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.219> pull<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> down

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
take off all the beams and pull it down

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.649 
take off all the beams and pull it down
and<00:01:57.540> then<00:01:57.659> bring<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.960> new<00:01:58.110> upright<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
and then bring a new upright in and and

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.850 
and then bring a new upright in and and
then<00:02:00.840> once<00:02:01.079> you've<00:02:01.290> gone<00:02:01.500> through<00:02:01.710> all<00:02:01.829> that

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
then once you've gone through all that

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.889 
then once you've gone through all that
labor<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.340> expense<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.270> next<00:02:03.540> day<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.840> can

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
labor and expense the next day it can

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.080 
labor and expense the next day it can
hit<00:02:04.110> again<00:02:04.409> get<00:02:04.979> hit<00:02:05.159> again<00:02:05.189> by<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.579> forklift

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
hit again get hit again by a forklift

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.839 
hit again get hit again by a forklift
and<00:02:06.450> then<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.110> repair<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.500> again

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
and then you have to repair it again

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.219 
and then you have to repair it again
whereas<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> solution<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:09.450> provide<00:02:09.840> is

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
whereas the solution that we provide is

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.080 
whereas the solution that we provide is
something<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.800> takes<00:02:11.099> less<00:02:11.280> labor<00:02:11.610> you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
something that takes less labor you

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.440 
something that takes less labor you
don't

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
don't

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.930 
don't
to<00:02:12.660> unload<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.110> pallets<00:02:13.500> from<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.770> rack<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
to unload the pallets from the rack the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.910 
to unload the pallets from the rack the
installation<00:02:15.450> process<00:02:15.629> is<00:02:15.900> approximately<00:02:16.500> 45

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
installation process is approximately 45

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.520 
installation process is approximately 45
minutes<00:02:16.950> verses<00:02:17.730> 2<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.120> 4<00:02:18.420> hours<00:02:18.840> for<00:02:18.870> an

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
minutes verses 2 to 4 hours for an

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.699 
minutes verses 2 to 4 hours for an
upright<00:02:19.860> replacement<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:21.170> one<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.319> our<00:02:22.440> lines

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
upright replacement and one of our lines

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.350 
upright replacement and one of our lines
which<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.129> proline<00:02:23.670> which<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:24.030> which<00:02:24.330> you

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
which is the proline which is which you

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.020 
which is the proline which is which you
can<00:02:24.660> see<00:02:24.840> right<00:02:24.989> here<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:26.129> guaranteed<00:02:26.670> against

can see right here is guaranteed against
future<00:02:27.180> impacts<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:27.930> if<00:02:28.019> you<00:02:28.170> repair<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.530> once

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
future impacts so if you repair it once

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.610 
future impacts so if you repair it once
you<00:02:29.459> don't<00:02:29.580> have<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.910> repair<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.269> again<00:02:30.620> that

you don't have to repair it again that

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.589 
you don't have to repair it again that
sounds<00:02:31.800> great<00:02:32.160> any<00:02:32.340> other<00:02:32.550> key<00:02:32.880> benefits<00:02:33.420> or

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
sounds great any other key benefits or

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.059 
sounds great any other key benefits or
features<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.230> want<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.500> outline<00:02:34.830> I

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
features that you want to outline I

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.839 
features that you want to outline I
think<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:35.970> key<00:02:36.120> thing<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.510> all<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.810> our

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
think the key thing is that all of our

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.460 
think the key thing is that all of our
all<00:02:38.849> of<00:02:38.910> our<00:02:39.239> orders<00:02:39.450> come<00:02:39.900> with<00:02:40.049> engineered

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
security that a lot of the alternatives

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.009 
security that a lot of the alternatives
don't<00:02:53.280> provide<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:54.269> what<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.690> mandate

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
don't provide and what is the mandate

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.949 
don't provide and what is the mandate
that<00:02:55.200> they're<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.799> they<00:02:55.950> have<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.190> adhere<00:02:56.430> to

that they're that they have to adhere to

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.160 
that they're that they have to adhere to
so<00:02:57.959> we<00:02:58.410> we<00:02:58.799> we<00:02:59.730> go<00:03:00.150> by<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.329> number<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.870> different

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
over that are used in Europe that we use

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.309 
over that are used in Europe that we use
as<00:03:11.910> well<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.390> then<00:03:12.870> our<00:03:13.019> in-house
