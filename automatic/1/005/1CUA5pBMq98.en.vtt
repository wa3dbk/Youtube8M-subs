00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.180
 I'm very happy that I did not reply. 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.820

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:19.380
 so let's go the first doubt of the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.020
 Natalia was the table I have a question I 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.500
 I do swimming and every time I take it 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.939
 green tea with cinnamon during the day before 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.310
 to go swimming 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.009
 during class I have cramps have 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.960
 some obvious relationship does not seem to have 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.820
 no relation of this tea that you are 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.540
 taking cinnamon and ginger with the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.660
 cramps 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.160
 cramps they have several origins 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.579
 it may be since the lack of some 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.950
 minerals such as potassium calcium and other 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.860
 how can it be also hydration can 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.000
 also be the excess of use of that 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.399
 musculature 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.829
 What are you doing swimming? 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.050
 do not drink the water do not hydrate and can 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.699
 to be sure in the water environment there is 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.190
 a dehydration you do not realize 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.119

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.170
 Your camera is the generic term if 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.939

 can cause a certain amount of dehydration even 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.180
