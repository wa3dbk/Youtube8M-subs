00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:11.080
 It's a very brief video of how to clean your 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.480
 saxophone once they have finished 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.309
 touch it or practice 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.390
 it is very important to clean it so that it does not 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:23.180
 accumulate all that saliva or waste in 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.460
 the saxophone shoes that sometimes 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.570
 Well, it's usually very simple 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.289
 plus 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.390
 remove the nozzle and put it in the 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.170
 box as it is but then that 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.489
 Moisture becomes wet and damages 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.820
 begins to damage the nozzles 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:45.170
 especially if you were taking 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.019
 some soda or something with sugar is very 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.309
 very harmful harmful to the shoes 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.080
 especially but also because it gives you a 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.670
 bad smell to the saxophone after 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.680
 what is saved then what is there 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.980
 what to do is that once it has just 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.210
 play very important then first that 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.710
 nothing to take off in the tunnel shake it well 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.990
 to remove two that waste 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.360
 the mouthpiece do the same thing is very 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.180
 simple just remove it remove the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.330
 tunnel mouthpiece but 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.150
 and leave the cane a lot of the time then 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.510
 that also gives less life to the reeds 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.490
 and lower quality to the cane because it 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.810
 it dries too much 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.220
 once you are here it is very 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.080
 inconsistent 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.690
 the humidity that the cane is receiving 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.330
 so what I recommend is to remove it 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.510
 put it in a flat place the cane or 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.390
 even in its original container and to the 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.310
 most of the rods come like this with a 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.440
 plastic where you can save them 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.440
 that also clean the mouthpiece 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.720
 now if the most important thing is that with 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:01.930
 these little objects we can clean 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.840
 the saxophone instead of putting in 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.970
 that little piece which heavier for 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.990
 that runs through that also to put it 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.750
 It makes more sense to put the grim reaper 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.540
 for the bell because apart from what it is 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.540
 simpler then put it here all 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.120
 that residue or saliva that is accumulated 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.070
 in this part of the saxophone if I'm sorry it's 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.890
 up here because all this you're going to 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.500
 transport through the saxophone 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.390
 complete then what I recommend is 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.390
 pearl over here 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.680
 pull it 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.770
 towards this part of the saxophone do it 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.380
 two or three times 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.200
 so that you take it well all the 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.530
 saliva that was left there accumulated 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.319
 everything is that musical juice that fits 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.680
 to accumulate the instrument well a couple of 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.680
 times 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.410
 there we have it so it is clean and another 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.930
 thing that I like to do is to review 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.330
 in the some of these shoes that 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.790
 is where more moisture accumulates and 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.150
 also sometimes blowing him to be 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.400
 drop anyone 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.439
 the extra saliva residue that you have 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.290
 out there one of the keys that most 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:27.980
 they hit precisely because of that because they 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.489
 accumulate is this network key is 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.489
 sustained 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.310
 and the sun sustained and continue so 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.530
 you have to pay special attention to that 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.260
 but that's how you have to clean your 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.050
 saxophone after you touch it 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.769
 good luck and finally because 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.510
 it's good to leave it alone if you're 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.030
 practicing not so leave it out of the 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.030
 box so that it can be taken out of 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.739
 right way, good luck and I hope 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.830
 that the video is useful, thank you very much 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.629
 and also this one I bought it in 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.519
 any music store you find it 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:07.930
 if not very expensive should not exceed 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:11.920
 about 10 dollars or 100 pesos something like that or 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.709
 even if you are I do not know how 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.100
 good is for crafts but 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:20.519
 You can even create yours with some 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.680
 rag you have out there 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:28.430
 all they have is this so that 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.430
 I may as well scrape with luck
