00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.930
 in the Algarve is still a lot of 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.040
 people who go there but I do not know that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.390

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.620

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.829
 like this charge is not out 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.030
 a lot of videos when I pulled out 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.020
 much more develops things like 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.670
 that bullshit in the genre but 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.780
 I really love doing these blogs this 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.039
 is not charity case stuff like 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.660
 that's what I was busiest at 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.670
 to make the golden fool during the cup of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.109
 world and go out so it was not 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.340
 inevitably I really like playing 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.600
 I was a lot at the beach 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.190
 go out and count things like 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.239
 that and maybe that's why I do not 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.890
 released a lot of videos but I can 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.890
