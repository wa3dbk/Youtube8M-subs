that<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.900> what<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.170> call<00:01:19.530> tubes<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.880> makes<00:01:21.119> it

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
that is what I call tubes what makes it

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.749 
that is what I call tubes what makes it
even<00:01:21.420> better<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.320> neatly<00:01:22.680> separates<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> hard

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
even better it neatly separates the hard

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.359 
even better it neatly separates the hard
fibers<00:01:24.270> from<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.600> juice<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.799> means<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.220> can

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
fibers from the juice this means you can

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.010 
fibers from the juice this means you can
keep<00:01:26.549> juicing<00:01:26.880> continuously<00:01:27.780> without

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
keep juicing continuously without

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.950 
keep juicing continuously without
stopping<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.490> pulp<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.030> also<00:01:30.479> dry<00:01:30.780> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
stopping the pulp is also dry and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.030 
stopping the pulp is also dry and
compact<00:01:32.540> it<00:01:33.540> rotates<00:01:34.020> slowly<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> juice

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
compact it rotates slowly so the juice

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.310 
compact it rotates slowly so the juice
doesn't<00:01:35.250> oxidize<00:01:35.640> or<00:01:36.210> lose<00:01:36.659> its<00:01:36.840> nutrients

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.830 
doesn't oxidize or lose its nutrients
you<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.310> keep<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> juice<00:01:38.909> fresh<00:01:39.299> for<00:01:39.570> up<00:01:39.689> to
