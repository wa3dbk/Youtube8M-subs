Oh<00:01:49.170> what<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.130> Heather<00:01:50.369> by<00:01:50.549> V<00:01:50.729> ery<00:01:50.880> there<00:01:51.680> alright

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
Oh what I Heather by V ery there alright

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.179 
Oh what I Heather by V ery there alright
so<00:01:52.950> stats<00:01:53.369> wise<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:54.119> guess<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.259> kind<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.860> a

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
so stats wise I guess it's kind of a

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.910 
so stats wise I guess it's kind of a
close<00:01:56.549> game<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.149> be<00:01:57.390> me<00:01:57.570> by<00:01:57.750> possession<00:01:58.140> by<00:01:58.439> but

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
close game is be me by possession by but

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.609 
close game is be me by possession by but
not<00:01:59.399> by<00:01:59.579> much<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.180> let's<00:02:00.810> see<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.140> happens<00:02:01.530> in

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
not by much so let's see what happens in

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.929 
not by much so let's see what happens in
the<00:02:01.649> second<00:02:02.040> half<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.640> perform

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
the second half we have to perform

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.900 
the second half we have to perform
better<00:02:03.180> than<00:02:03.270> this

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.860 

theory

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.649 

we<00:02:14.409> got<00:02:14.560> another<00:02:14.799> corner<00:02:15.250> come<00:02:15.970> on<00:02:16.150> Zola<00:02:16.390> give

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
we got another corner come on Zola give

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.580 
we got another corner come on Zola give
us<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.900> nice<00:02:17.049> cross<00:02:17.379> for<00:02:17.620> once<00:02:17.799> nice<00:02:18.730> cross<00:02:19.590> no

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
us a nice cross for once nice cross no

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.250 
us a nice cross for once nice cross no
no<00:02:20.950> process<00:02:21.430> whoo<00:02:24.540> over-the-top<00:02:25.540> can<00:02:26.049> we<00:02:26.140> do

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
no process whoo over-the-top can we do

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.770 
no process whoo over-the-top can we do
something<00:02:26.470> here<00:02:26.799> oh<00:02:27.209> can<00:02:28.209> we<00:02:28.239> do<00:02:28.390> something
