sprinting

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.519 

we<00:05:37.590> don't<00:05:37.740> need<00:05:37.889> to<00:05:38.039> change<00:05:38.250> that

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:40.529 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:44.259 

we<00:05:41.099> need<00:05:41.249> to<00:05:41.399> use<00:05:41.549> get<00:05:42.149> another<00:05:42.629> Healy<00:05:43.619> writer

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:44.269 
we need to use get another Healy writer

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:47.149 
we need to use get another Healy writer
because<00:05:45.269> that<00:05:45.749> guy<00:05:45.989> was<00:05:46.289> not<00:05:46.529> good<00:05:46.769> enough<00:05:47.009> in

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159
