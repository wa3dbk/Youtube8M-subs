00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.250
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.190
 new video to its ii is news 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.400
 to another planet or at least the 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.560
 unofficial because with patch 1.1.2 gabis 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.840
 data within the four to six 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.970
 gigabyte packages which you do not know yet 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.170
 but it should be knowledgeable 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.269
 Bees already have them 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.769
 datenraum sniffed something completely 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.160
 interesting found 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.289
 if you have not yet, planetary mercury 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.910
 knew that is in the game yes yes 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.820
 he does not exist in orbit yet 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.719
 But it was actually for the game 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.820
 programmed so far if that knows 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.210
 even before destiny has been released it 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.800
 There were three more planets 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.329
 Saturn and Jupiter became 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.710
 apparently not packed in orbit 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.899
 But one can 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.129
 Grimme cards to find there you can 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.899
 just look in the description 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.390
 there we have the links so the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.070
 planets definitely exist and you have 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.430
 ask yourself where are the planets 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.010
 and now with patch 1.2 there was a whole 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.220
 hidden message within the code 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.140
 and it should be a third social 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.820
 so we knew from the tower 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.950
 normal tower and then from the second 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.189
 in the reef and now there are apparently 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.320
 also a third and that will become wood 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.810
 on amendedt has call that is so yes 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.570
 hallen of aminta that is one 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.180
 Egyptian dead goddess has been checked 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.369
 wikipedia and that is also relevant in 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.250
 exams of the osiris so the event 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.520
 which will be presented to us soon 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.610
 becomes 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 since involved and the description 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.670
 clearly only someone who says that 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.759
 Exams of the osiris is made this 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.159
 halls are allowed to enter and now comes 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.369
 the interesting one just mentioned 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:58.189
 Halls are supposed to be on the mercury like that 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:58.189
 at least the placement since 1.1.2010 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.610
 the thing is presented again in 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.680
 bring experience can check 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.780
 every case the video where we all data 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.090
 call to all events what bungie since 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.910
 more precisely, check this on everyone 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.030
 fall off people what do you say to these 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.650
 hidden 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.090
 info and definitely would 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.200
 As interesting as your thoughts 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.900
 We are definitely going to find it 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.660
 pretty blatant that there is a tower 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.400
 could be the first one freispiele must 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.530
 You only plan one then 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.360
 if you are in the fight 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.770
 proved that so a right 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.030
 Interesting things people are like yours 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.310
 thoughts into it in the comments 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.890
 and then I would say if so 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.890
 So something is interesting background info 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.900
 hidden data in patch 1.1.2 in it 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.860
 have a look today 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.180
 our new video to patch 1.1.2 what we 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.970
 should not know 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.320
 because there we will be the whole 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.280
 go through unofficial hidden list 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.650
 with things hidden by patch 1.1.2 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.870
 have been inserted into the system 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.910
 including exotic spaceships 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.600
 the new strikes where they are 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:08.110
 then will new vehicle upgrades 50 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.269
 new spaceship blueprints right 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.600
 interesting and much more too 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.120
 to arena mode everything in the new video 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.560
 okay people in case this video is informative 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.150
