00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
on our windscreen so it is not a

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.520

this system is again the open country
2-quart<00:01:43.719> pot<00:01:43.979> has<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.009> list<00:01:45.310> price<00:01:45.369> of<00:01:45.609> 999

2-quart pot has a list price of 999
again<00:01:47.409> I'm<00:01:47.560> not<00:01:47.740> carrying<00:01:47.950> in<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.279> store<00:01:48.520> you

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
again I'm not carrying in the store you

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.940 
again I'm not carrying in the store you
can<00:01:48.909> find<00:01:49.149> them<00:01:49.299> everywhere<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.590> what<00:01:50.770> are<00:01:50.859> the

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
can find them everywhere so what are the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.830 
can find them everywhere so what are the
advantages<00:01:51.069> of<00:01:51.549> using<00:01:51.759> this<00:01:52.240> open<00:01:52.539> country

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
advantages of using this open country

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.399 
advantages of using this open country
pot<00:01:53.049> the<00:01:53.770> first<00:01:54.009> advantage<00:01:54.340> is<00:01:54.579> capacity<00:01:55.409> this

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
pot the first advantage is capacity this

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.269 
pot the first advantage is capacity this
is<00:01:56.789> 2<00:01:57.789> quarts<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:59.229> know<00:01:59.289> this<00:01:59.499> will<00:01:59.740> fit<00:02:00.039> eight

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:00.279 
is 2 quarts you know this will fit eight

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:02.339 
is 2 quarts you know this will fit eight
cups<00:02:00.579> of<00:02:00.819> water<00:02:01.060> now<00:02:01.329> 8<00:02:01.630> cups<00:02:01.869> will<00:02:02.079> bring<00:02:02.259> it

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
cups of water now 8 cups will bring it

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:06.330 
cups of water now 8 cups will bring it
right<00:02:02.560> up<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.889> the<00:02:02.979> very<00:02:03.009> very<00:02:03.520> top<00:02:03.880> so<00:02:04.719> I<00:02:05.529> won't

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
right up to the very very top so I won't

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.630 
right up to the very very top so I won't
count<00:02:06.579> on<00:02:06.700> using<00:02:06.999> that<00:02:07.029> it<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:09.069> not<00:02:09.310> an

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
count on using that it is not an

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.300 
count on using that it is not an
anodized<00:02:10.210> pot<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.960> so<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.770> will<00:02:12.160> get

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
anodized pot and so you will get

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.940 
anodized pot and so you will get
discoloration<00:02:13.150> on<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.420> inside

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
discoloration on the inside

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.320 
discoloration on the inside
it's<00:02:16.950> going<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.490> come<00:02:17.580> down<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.880> personal

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
it's going to come down to a personal

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.360 
it's going to come down to a personal
choice<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.900> believe<00:02:19.380> if<00:02:19.620> i<00:02:19.740> had<00:02:19.920> an<00:02:20.040> uncoated

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
choice I believe if i had an uncoated

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.790 
choice I believe if i had an uncoated
pot<00:02:20.670> i<00:02:20.700> would<00:02:21.000> use<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.300> for<00:02:21.450> boiling<00:02:21.690> water<00:02:22.110> i

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
pot i would use it for boiling water i

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.740 
pot i would use it for boiling water i
don't<00:02:23.340> believe<00:02:23.790> i<00:02:23.850> would<00:02:24.090> use<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.420> for<00:02:24.600> cooking

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
don't believe i would use it for cooking

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.260 
don't believe i would use it for cooking
things<00:02:25.380> like<00:02:25.680> particularly<00:02:26.550> acidic<00:02:27.030> foods

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
things like particularly acidic foods

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.990 
things like particularly acidic foods
like<00:02:27.540> tomato<00:02:28.350> sauces<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:29.040> but<00:02:29.459> for<00:02:29.730> boiling

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
like tomato sauces in it but for boiling

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.970 
like tomato sauces in it but for boiling
water<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.600> rehydration<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.560> large-capacity

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
water and rehydration and large-capacity

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.840 
water and rehydration and large-capacity
this<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.820> great<00:02:33.120> pot<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:34.200> other<00:02:34.350> thing<00:02:34.590> is

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
this is a great pot the other thing is

bakes<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.280> little<00:02:47.459> faster<00:02:47.850> because<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
bakes a little faster because the

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.580 
bakes a little faster because the
aluminum<00:02:48.660> has<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.840> little<00:02:49.290> bit<00:02:49.410> higher

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
aluminum has a little bit higher

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.910 
aluminum has a little bit higher
conductivity<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:51.390> again<00:02:51.800> answer<00:02:52.800> the

conductivity so again answer the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.210 
conductivity so again answer the

kit for the open country pot because
even<00:03:04.410> though<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.709> these<00:03:05.700> will<00:03:06.030> fit<00:03:06.300> here<00:03:06.690> I'm

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
even though the these will fit here I'm

even though the these will fit here I'm
giving<00:03:07.590> people<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.890> option<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:08.400> put<00:03:08.610> the
