00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.189
 as it is known among the cars 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.349
 popular segment c 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.179
 also called golf class so we 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.990
 decided to see what it represents from 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.330
 yourself car 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.270
 whose name is named whole dimension 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.640
 class a resist volkswagen golf 4 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.150
 generation will be his classmate citroen 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.850
 ksara 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.529
 let's start with volkswagen golf fourth 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.750
 The generation of this model has completely 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.029
 galvanized body so if you where 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.759
 you'll find traces of rust is likely 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.290
 just the car was in a car accident is not high 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.270
 German ground clearance may not be the best 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.170
 impact on exploitation 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.850
 our roads 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.680
 volkswagen golf is pretty low 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.969
 engine location on one side 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.520
 it improves driving performance 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.280
 because the center of gravity gets lower 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.770
 the other side is very low 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.210
 engine crankcase and on our roads it 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.710
 so you can easily extend 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.320
 sure to have to install this 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.300
 protection of the engine raises no special 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.149
 they are happy frisky have a decent 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.190
 resource but gasoline engine of 1 4 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.110
 liter can be called frankly weak 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.659
 so it is better to choose a car with 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.820
 engine at least 1 and 6 besides 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.650
 special control requires timing belt 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.900
 despite the fact that it is recommended to change 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.240
 belt through 90 thousand kilometers 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.030
 due to not too successful construction 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.130
 timing belt he may not live to 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.229
 60,000 not the most reliable gasoline hub 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.320
 engines is the pump sometimes her 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.030
 have to change and not even once 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.159
 on the fact that in general the finishing materials on 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.320
 a good level still often salon 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.240
 begins to squeak and coasters 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.460
 ashtrays generally rarely live longer 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.070
 years were not very reliable 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.479
 window lifter mechanism and 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.369
 wiper extremely uncomfortable yes and 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.899
 unsafe rebuilds right 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.390
 count on too little 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.700
 side mirror is clearly the weak point of this 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.680
 car are door locks 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.360
 if before I heard about this problem 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.399
 from the owners here I ran into 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.350
 that when i was given the key 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.149
 I initially thought that the mixed and further 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.330
 another car because I could not open 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.280
 car with this key 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.590
 and only from that side I managed 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.930
 open the car resource suspension parts 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.760
 is the average for 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.790
 front wheel drive versions are simple 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.340
 Now mcpherson rear already shaped beam 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.140
 so there are no problems with spare parts, but 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.300
 all-wheel drive modifications found 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.730
 quite rarely therefore some details 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.810
 are expensive and delivered mostly 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.360
 under the order 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.680
 when choosing citroen ksara worth paying 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.290
 attention to engine temperature 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.550
 often the thermostat fails and 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.800
 then you have to be quite long 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.780
 warm up the car or the other way around 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.670
 engine may overheat due to 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.440
 cooling fan malfunctions 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.569
 can happen periodically different 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.610
 sort of whims of electronics but usually 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.340
 these concerns are not very serious 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.200
 salon ksor and like golf can 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.380
 time to pester your master with different 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.300
 squeaks in the joints of the trim panels 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.250
 honestly didn't quite like it in 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.500
 king in the back seat because the seats 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.269
 my legs are really not enough here 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.920
 rest against the back of the front seat 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.260
 although in front there is not the highest 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.970
 man will sit 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.540
 head and wipe the ceiling and distant 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.220
 trips 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.410
 because of this you will feel 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.330
 discomfort despite the fact that the machine 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.069
 a pretty handy thing this frenchman has 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.989
 the unit has proven itself far from 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.880
 in the best way except that 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.160
 owners have complaints of reverie 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.049
 some inadequacy in the work so 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.180
 also the reliability of this machine is far 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.830
 not up to par with all the french 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.230
 the cost of some parts may 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.200
 slightly spoil your mood now 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.590
 try to look for a spare tire 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:36.959
 the trunk here is not where she can 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:39.180
 be only below but here it is 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.799
 weather you understand get it from there 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.140
 and don't get dirty this is very big 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.640
 problem and now a couple of words about suspension 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.069
 front without frills 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.540
 and here is the back torsion because of consumables 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.730
 materials on the rear suspension 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.220
 needle bearings in the 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.079
 Beam such bearings need periodically 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.480
 inspect for lack of play 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.340
 otherwise the places where the fingers are broken 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.400
 enter the beam and then have to change 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.319
 the whole beam is the conclusion is volkswagen 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.000
 golf quality is no better than many of its 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.730
 classmates and are much more expensive 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.049
 on the other hand he is the least to lose in 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.510
 price in the secondary market 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.100
 citroen ksara is solid and unpretentious 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.060
 best value option 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.340
 and quality 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.940
 but when re- selling loses more 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.940
 than golf
