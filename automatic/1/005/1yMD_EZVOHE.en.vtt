00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:04.830
 good afternoon in loans directly if the university of puerto rico 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.630
 Aguadilla university campus 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.789
 November 10 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:12.909
 and the year 2000 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:15.659
 it's four that 16 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:16.880
 the afternoon 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.960
 the machine denying what it is 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.440
 in our forecast 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.390
 the wii esevez 5 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.189
 It is a model of 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.699
 a mechanical arm 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.749
 the company that most likely 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.070
 the efe mexico model 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.880
 as you can notice a law is missing 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.469
 because there because it is very bad 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.350
 I'm happy with this 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.290
 have to do with my little ridiculous story 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.610
 here you can see how our partner 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.440
 Until yesterday 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.860
 Hector Tito 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.280
 remember 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.830
 barber shop 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.830
 but neighbors among others for obvious reasons 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.660
 7 how can you see the planet's project 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.780
 the box machine 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.729
 here 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:06.020
 if they achieve a little you can kill and the chest in that state that is the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.519
 brain microcontroller of our ingenious stolen 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.350
 I am in that statement through this one 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.370
 a battle between others 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.359
 it should be noted 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:19.600
 for all the people who ask 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.600
 costs $ 4 due in part to a bronze 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.630
 presented existing deficiencies 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.740
 although there may be there 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.220
 the other four years 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.730
 last single a gentleman morocho 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.730
 see how he dies right now is a little bit 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.950
 coach eduardo mondino 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.830
 no name no 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.830
 when you press the button to return to its initial position 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.159
 pretty smart 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.660
 on the other hand 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.660
 here we have the interface program 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.850
 this program was done in dissolve 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.200
 very simple program 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.140
 teaches you what is the position that right now the goal 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.229
 there is still 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.069
 bekele everything is going up even though it is going to the front and so on 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.010
 successively transiting each movement 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.899
 efe I do not think 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.939
 only we of course 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.749
 I do a pretty simple programming 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:15.579
 efe 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.329
 by how it is controlled with the control of the vehicle 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.669
 63 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:20.699
 in one of them 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.269
 death of his father 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.949
 gimferrer 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:28.139
 the clopad program of the interface program between the condor and the 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.159
 computer that comes to us from the factory you have to understand 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:33.659
 in the semester 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.259
 if they tell me here I will pay 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.069
 percent 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.959
 This here 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.949
 all these acts of crime 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:44.929
 the program 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:46.169
 the same 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.029
 he is going to imitate a keyboard 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.109
 but that limits the keyboard 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.010
 simply a matter of deza bs 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.009
 create a program that when you come back to be treated 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:58.199
 generate 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.950
 a combination of an area that goes through this cable 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.160
 of the computer 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.449
 the respectable 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.029
 came quality 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:09.029
 without parallel cable the other one will be used for the fronts 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:13.899
 and then well as the well pointed out the country we are the taxi sector 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:16.899
 while his team and that statement 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:20.439
 or they can see the face of another fellow garben 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.929
 talking on cell phone clearly break but 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:26.449
 again laredo 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:28.249
 Congratulations 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:30.529
 pretty well-known university 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:32.599
 vice president of the eti 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.019
 association d 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.509
 students c 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:38.829
 electronic engineering and technology 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:39.890
 i 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.570
 this elect will be next on Friday in full 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:45.540
 thank you
