00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
to it which I really like obviously the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.360 
to it which I really like obviously the
passport<00:00:54.930> version<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.440> meant<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.770> resemble<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
passport version is meant to resemble a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.330 
passport version is meant to resemble a
passport<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:57.239> US<00:00:57.750> passport<00:00:58.500> across<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.039> front

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
passport a US passport across the front

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.790 
passport a US passport across the front
and<00:00:59.520> across<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.480> back<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.500> kind<00:01:01.739> of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and across the back and it's kind of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
and across the back and it's kind of
subtle<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.670> has<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> mentioned

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
subtle in that it has that I mentioned

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.200 
subtle in that it has that I mentioned
distress<00:01:04.379> look<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> case<00:01:05.939> looks

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
distress look to it so the case looks

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.870 
distress look to it so the case looks
well<00:01:06.450> worn<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.409> well<00:01:07.710> used<00:01:07.979> passport<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
well worn like a well used passport and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.330 
well worn like a well used passport and
I<00:01:08.939> really<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.990> look<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:11.010> thick

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
I really like the look it is thick

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.640 
I really like the look it is thick
because<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.030> wallet<00:01:12.240> style<00:01:12.600> case<00:01:12.869> but<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
because it's a wallet style case but it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.740 
because it's a wallet style case but it
holds<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.220> ton<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.460> stuff<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.180> it's

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
holds a ton of stuff and it's

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.929 
holds a ton of stuff and it's
surprisingly<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.619> as<00:01:16.799> bulky<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.460> would

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
surprisingly not as bulky as I would

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.850 
surprisingly not as bulky as I would
think<00:01:18.119> it'd<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.299> giving<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.439> holds<00:01:19.619> that

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
think it'd be giving that it holds that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.160 
think it'd be giving that it holds that
much<00:01:20.040> stuff<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.670> there's<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> outside<00:01:21.570> you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
much stuff so there's the outside you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.590 
much stuff so there's the outside you
undo<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.159> elastic<00:01:23.640> strap<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.150> open<00:01:24.360> up<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
undo that elastic strap to open up the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.870 
undo that elastic strap to open up the
inside<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.259> there<00:01:25.740> you'll<00:01:25.890> find<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.490> two

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
inside and there you'll find one two

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
sent this tool along I'm not quite sure

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.980 
sent this tool along I'm not quite sure
why<00:04:50.550> it's<00:04:50.760> not<00:04:51.000> included<00:04:51.210> in<00:04:51.480> the<00:04:51.570> case<00:04:51.720> in<00:04:51.900> the

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
why it's not included in the case in the

why it's not included in the case in the
first<00:04:52.140> place<00:04:52.320> but<00:04:52.740> basically<00:04:53.460> this<00:04:53.670> is<00:04:53.730> like<00:04:53.970> a

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
first place but basically this is like a

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.630 
first place but basically this is like a
mini<00:04:54.270> pry<00:04:54.750> bar<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.320> you're<00:04:55.440> meant<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.830> like

stick in here to get a purchase point to

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.980 
stick in here to get a purchase point to
pop<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.580> case<00:04:59.700> off<00:04:59.970> that's<00:05:00.450> how<00:05:00.600> I<00:05:00.630> kind<00:05:00.900> of

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
pop the case off that's how I kind of

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.930 
pop the case off that's how I kind of
destroyed<00:05:01.200> this<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:02.430> can<00:05:02.550> even<00:05:02.640> see<00:05:02.910> I

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
destroyed this you can even see I

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.070 
destroyed this you can even see I
shouldn't<00:05:03.360> even<00:05:03.450> notice<00:05:03.780> it

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
shouldn't even notice it

shouldn't even notice it
I<00:05:04.110> did<00:05:04.440> some<00:05:04.620> damage<00:05:04.800> to<00:05:04.980> the<00:05:05.250> case<00:05:05.430> itself<00:05:05.850> the

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
I did some damage to the case itself the

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.360 
I did some damage to the case itself the
only<00:05:06.510> way<00:05:06.780> I<00:05:06.810> figured<00:05:07.470> out<00:05:07.590> how<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:07.830> do<00:05:08.040> it<00:05:08.190> is

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
only way I figured out how to do it is

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.280 
only way I figured out how to do it is
to<00:05:08.670> I<00:05:09.000> don't<00:05:09.300> know<00:05:09.450> if<00:05:09.540> I<00:05:09.570> can<00:05:09.720> even<00:05:09.810> do<00:05:09.990> this<00:05:10.140> on

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
to I don't know if I can even do this on

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.370 
to I don't know if I can even do this on
camera<00:05:10.620> is<00:05:11.250> to<00:05:11.460> get<00:05:11.610> down<00:05:11.850> in<00:05:12.060> here<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.870> kind

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
camera is to get down in here and kind

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.500 
camera is to get down in here and kind
of<00:05:13.440> prop<00:05:13.770> it<00:05:13.980> and<00:05:14.130> pry<00:05:14.490> it<00:05:14.550> off<00:05:14.730> that<00:05:15.030> way

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
of prop it and pry it off that way

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.420 
of prop it and pry it off that way
so<00:05:15.930> I<00:05:15.960> could<00:05:16.200> get<00:05:16.350> like<00:05:16.530> a<00:05:16.590> purchase<00:05:17.130> point

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
so I could get like a purchase point

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.480 
so I could get like a purchase point
