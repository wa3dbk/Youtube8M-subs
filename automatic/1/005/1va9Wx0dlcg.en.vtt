there<00:00:55.559> was<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> distinctive<00:00:56.280> click<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:58.190> it

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
there was a distinctive click on that it

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.870 
there was a distinctive click on that it
usually<00:00:59.550> comes<00:00:59.940> after<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> first<00:01:00.870> ring<00:01:03.860> but

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
usually comes after the first ring but

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.800 
usually comes after the first ring but
that<00:01:05.880> might<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.090> been<00:01:06.210> right<00:01:06.450> there<00:01:06.630> at<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
that might have been right there at the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.090 
that might have been right there at the
beginning<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.380> almost<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> switch

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
beginning it's almost like a switch

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.520 
beginning it's almost like a switch
piece<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.580> equipment<00:01:09.320> telephone<00:01:10.320> equipment

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
piece of equipment telephone equipment

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.980 
piece of equipment telephone equipment
switching<00:01:11.869> technology<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:14.509> think<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
switching technology I think this is a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.240 
switching technology I think this is a
soft<00:01:16.979> ring<00:01:17.310> which<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> fake<00:01:18.060> ring<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:23.130> we

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
soft ring which is a fake ring and we

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.859 
soft ring which is a fake ring and we
are<00:01:23.400> documenting<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.360> think<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.689> is

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
are documenting this but I think this is

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.640 
are documenting this but I think this is
a<00:01:24.900> busy<00:01:25.259> signal<00:01:25.470> -<00:01:27.740> yep<00:01:28.740> exactly

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
a busy signal - yep exactly

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.460 
a busy signal - yep exactly
so<00:01:31.650> no<00:01:32.460> clicking<00:01:33.890> during<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.040> first<00:01:35.340> ring

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
so no clicking during that first ring

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.149 
so no clicking during that first ring
means<00:01:37.470> there's<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.009> be<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.159> problem

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
means there's going to be a problem

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:49.190 
means there's going to be a problem
let's<00:01:41.159> try<00:01:41.430> my<00:01:41.579> friend<00:01:41.700> Paul<00:01:42.030> again<00:01:48.200> there's

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
let's try my friend Paul again there's

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.590 
let's try my friend Paul again there's
the<00:01:49.350> click<00:01:49.610> now<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.820> should<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.240> through

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the click now it should get through

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.890 
the click now it should get through
should<00:01:51.960> at<00:01:52.020> least<00:01:52.110> get<00:01:52.290> his<00:01:52.439> voicemail

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.920 

and<00:01:59.900> I<00:02:03.160> can<00:02:04.160> already<00:02:04.370> tell<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:05.120> this<00:02:05.570> will<00:02:05.780> go

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
and I can already tell that this will go

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.690 
and I can already tell that this will go
through<00:02:06.260> because<00:02:06.470> of<00:02:06.650> that<00:02:06.860> click<00:02:09.610> it's<00:02:10.610> a

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
through because of that click it's a

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:27.610 
through because of that click it's a
very<00:02:10.940> audible<00:02:11.540> click<00:02:22.510> yeah<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.950> there<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.460> go
