with<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.650> 2870<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.410> it's<00:02:35.590> pretty<00:02:35.890> cool<00:02:36.280> I

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
with the 2870 so it's pretty cool I

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.509 
with the 2870 so it's pretty cool I
really<00:02:36.430> enjoy<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.090> it's<00:02:37.150> not<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.360> lot<00:02:37.599> of

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
really enjoy it it's not a lot of

those settings there for that you'd have

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.400 
those settings there for that you'd have
to<00:02:44.230> change<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.769> a<00:02:44.799> different<00:02:46.379> piece<00:02:47.379> of

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
future post it's called NK remote it's

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.990 
future post it's called NK remote it's
from<00:02:52.030> breeze<00:02:52.360> systems<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:54.489> one<00:02:54.670> for<00:02:54.700> the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
from breeze systems and that one for the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.470 
from breeze systems and that one for the
most<00:02:55.120> part<00:02:55.329> is<00:02:55.480> applicable<00:02:56.079> to<00:02:56.349> Nikon's<00:02:57.480> in

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
most part is applicable to Nikon's in

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.240 
most part is applicable to Nikon's in
conjunction<00:02:58.840> with<00:02:59.049> windows-based<00:02:59.560> computers

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
conjunction with windows-based computers

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.979 
conjunction with windows-based computers
of<00:03:00.579> course<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:00.879> can<00:03:01.000> one<00:03:01.120> run<00:03:01.420> Windows<00:03:01.720> on<00:03:01.959> a

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
of course you can one run Windows on a

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.110 
of course you can one run Windows on a
Mac<00:03:02.940> using<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.150> proper<00:03:04.510> interface<00:03:05.319> software

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
Mac using the proper interface software

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.819 
Mac using the proper interface software
so<00:03:07.120> that's<00:03:07.239> probably<00:03:07.569> not<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:07.810> big<00:03:08.079> issue<00:03:08.139> so

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
so that's probably not a big issue so

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.140 
so that's probably not a big issue so
you<00:03:08.920> could<00:03:09.040> probably<00:03:09.160> still<00:03:09.459> use<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.910> carry

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
you could probably still use and carry

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.099 
you could probably still use and carry
remote<00:03:11.190> from<00:03:12.190> pre<00:03:12.370> systems<00:03:12.819> on<00:03:13.000> your<00:03:13.150> Mac<00:03:13.329> and

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
remote from pre systems on your Mac and

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.360 
remote from pre systems on your Mac and
I<00:03:14.260> think<00:03:14.440> I'm<00:03:14.530> going<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.709> talk<00:03:14.859> about<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.130> in

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
I think I'm going to talk about that in

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.240 
I think I'm going to talk about that in
a<00:03:15.519> future<00:03:16.120> post<00:03:17.079> so<00:03:17.590> there<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.769> go<00:03:17.889> so<00:03:18.130> this
