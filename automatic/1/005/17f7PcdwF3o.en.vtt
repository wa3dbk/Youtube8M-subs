00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.200

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.559
 a nice and funny way 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.449
 I try to look like certain things that 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.360

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:44.390

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.309
 It has a little more vision then 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.309
 I do it in a different way 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.210
 the first to be caricatured was the 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:04.400
 technical gustavo matosas when delivering him the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.899
 work was such his surprise that from 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.870
 immediate gave him the opportunity to 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:12.110
 start drawing the players 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.670
 matías britos is one of the favorites of 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.350

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.540

 uruguay the truth is very good and they are 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.170

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.290
 so we like it a lot 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.330
 in each of his caricatures he employs 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.760
 between an hour and an hour and a half of your 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.700
 time the first day that I arrived 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.820

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.040
 I want to think about your work that follows 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.720
 doing more I admire very much the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.330

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.160
 to represent what they see and that through 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.110
 of your imagination can translate it like this 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.270

 very complete 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.310
 the most important thing for her is the 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.150
 recognition of the people who observe 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.160

 ask me this and tell me that they 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.330
 like my job as it is to feel the support 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.340
 They are things that give you the most desire to 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.840
 keep doing it is for me an honor 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.610
