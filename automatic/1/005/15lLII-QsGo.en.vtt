right<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.390> compared<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.530> wooden<00:01:49.770> bars

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
right now compared to the wooden bars

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.350 
right now compared to the wooden bars
which<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.430> below<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:50.820> that's<00:01:50.940> a<00:01:51.060> vast

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
which is just below and that's a vast

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.289 
which is just below and that's a vast
difference<00:01:51.830> as<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.159> see<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:54.000> takes<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
difference as you can see and it takes a

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.889 
difference as you can see and it takes a
lot<00:01:54.570> longer<00:01:54.720> form<00:01:55.140> destroy<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.450> in<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.570> second

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
lot longer form destroy and in a second

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.510 
lot longer form destroy and in a second
