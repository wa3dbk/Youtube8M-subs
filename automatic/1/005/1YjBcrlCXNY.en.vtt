00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.500 

now<00:00:05.769> our<00:00:06.660> settings<00:00:07.660> that<00:00:07.870> I<00:00:07.990> use<00:00:08.019> for<00:00:08.590> FIFA<00:00:09.510> so

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.510 
now our settings that I use for FIFA so

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.020 
now our settings that I use for FIFA so
we<00:00:10.599> go<00:00:10.690> into<00:00:10.809> settings<00:00:11.250> into<00:00:12.250> game<00:00:12.459> settings

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
we go into settings into game settings

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.429 
we go into settings into game settings
then<00:00:13.930> you<00:00:13.959> use<00:00:14.350> the<00:00:14.619> r-1<00:00:15.309> button<00:00:15.340> to<00:00:16.240> skip<00:00:17.230> all

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
then you use the r-1 button to skip all

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.220 
then you use the r-1 button to skip all
the<00:00:17.529> way<00:00:17.560> across<00:00:17.830> to<00:00:18.699> use<00:00:19.090> a<00:00:19.119> gameplay<00:00:19.689> system

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
the way across to use a gameplay system

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.120 
the way across to use a gameplay system
ization<00:00:22.860> so<00:00:23.860> cpu<00:00:24.640> get<00:00:24.850> patronize<00:00:25.570> ation<00:00:25.930> and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
ization so cpu get patronize ation and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.250 
ization so cpu get patronize ation and
user<00:00:27.130> gameplay<00:00:27.910> customization<00:00:28.600> you'll

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
user gameplay customization you'll

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.950 
user gameplay customization you'll
notice<00:00:29.590> that<00:00:29.830> neither<00:00:30.520> are<00:00:31.000> on<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.420> defaults

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
notice that neither are on the defaults

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.529 
notice that neither are on the defaults
for<00:00:32.109> 50<00:00:32.529> and<00:00:32.789> some<00:00:33.789> of<00:00:33.879> them<00:00:34.000> are<00:00:34.120> slightly

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
for 50 and some of them are slightly

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:35.790 
for 50 and some of them are slightly
different<00:00:34.750> but<00:00:35.170> on<00:00:35.289> the<00:00:35.410> whole<00:00:35.590> they're

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
different but on the whole they're

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.399 
different but on the whole they're
pretty<00:00:36.100> much<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.309> same<00:00:36.520> so<00:00:37.510> sprint<00:00:38.050> speed

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:38.409 
pretty much the same so sprint speed

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.209 
pretty much the same so sprint speed
I've<00:00:38.949> increased<00:00:39.249> 52<00:00:40.140> acceleration<00:00:41.140> to<00:00:41.379> 48

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
I've increased 52 acceleration to 48

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.569 
I've increased 52 acceleration to 48
that's<00:00:42.729> gone<00:00:42.909> down<00:00:43.229> short<00:00:44.229> error<00:00:44.379> has<00:00:44.889> gone<00:00:45.429> up

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
that's gone down short error has gone up

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.419 
that's gone down short error has gone up
to<00:00:45.729> 52<00:00:46.170> pass<00:00:47.170> error<00:00:47.620> is<00:00:47.949> now<00:00:48.219> 40<00:00:49.949> shot<00:00:50.949> speed<00:00:51.249> is

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429 
to 52 pass error is now 40 shot speed is

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:53.219 
to 52 pass error is now 40 shot speed is
Ron<00:00:51.940> Sonya<00:00:52.299> a<00:00:52.329> little<00:00:52.510> bit<00:00:52.629> faster<00:00:53.049> than<00:00:53.170> the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
Ron Sonya a little bit faster than the

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.169 
Ron Sonya a little bit faster than the
default<00:00:53.499> pass<00:00:54.159> speed<00:00:54.609> is<00:00:54.819> a<00:00:54.850> little<00:00:55.089> bit

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
default pass speed is a little bit

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:55.590 
default pass speed is a little bit
slower

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
slower

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.039 
slower
so<00:00:55.809> it<00:00:55.960> brings<00:00:56.109> the<00:00:56.319> pace<00:00:56.499> down<00:00:56.739> a<00:00:56.799> little<00:00:57.039> bit

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
so it brings the pace down a little bit

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:00.689 
so it brings the pace down a little bit
injury<00:00:59.049> frequency<00:00:59.620> and<00:00:59.739> severity<00:00:59.859> you<00:01:00.370> can<00:01:00.549> go

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
injury frequency and severity you can go

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.869 
injury frequency and severity you can go
up<00:01:00.850> and<00:01:01.030> down<00:01:01.209> I<00:01:01.269> mean<00:01:01.569> some<00:01:01.749> people<00:01:01.780> like<00:01:02.409> to

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
up and down I mean some people like to

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.550 
up and down I mean some people like to
put<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:04.030> frequency<00:01:04.570> up<00:01:04.720> but<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.170> severity

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
put the frequency up but the severity

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.580 
put the frequency up but the severity
down<00:01:05.950> so<00:01:06.580> but<00:01:06.850> either<00:01:07.000> way<00:01:07.270> both<00:01:07.990> stuck<00:01:08.409> on

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
down so but either way both stuck on

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.510 
down so but either way both stuck on
their<00:01:08.830> goalkeeper<00:01:09.670> ability<00:01:10.410> okay<00:01:11.410> load<00:01:11.740> right

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
their goalkeeper ability okay load right

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.580 
their goalkeeper ability okay load right
down<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:12.910> one<00:01:13.150> because<00:01:13.870> a<00:01:13.900> lot<00:01:13.960> of<00:01:14.080> people<00:01:14.230> feel

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
down to one because a lot of people feel

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.990 
down to one because a lot of people feel
a<00:01:14.620> bit<00:01:15.130> too<00:01:15.510> difficult<00:01:17.160> and<00:01:18.160> they're<00:01:18.430> up<00:01:18.580> there

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
a bit too difficult and they're up there

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.120 
a bit too difficult and they're up there
to<00:01:19.870> make<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.050> few<00:01:20.260> mistakes<00:01:20.350> if<00:01:20.830> you<00:01:20.890> put<00:01:21.040> it

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
to make a few mistakes if you put it

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.480 
to make a few mistakes if you put it
down<00:01:21.220> this<00:01:21.430> low<00:01:22.020> okay<00:01:23.020> so<00:01:23.440> marking<00:01:23.980> is<00:01:24.130> left<00:01:24.340> at
