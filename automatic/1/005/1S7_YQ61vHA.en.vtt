00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.650
 hello friends welcome to another point 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.650
 Tuesday 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.980
 I am leonardo pÃ©rez grandson and I love 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.670
 see you here today we are going to draw a 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.920
 Chrome dial to help make the 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.030
 circle I will use this patent leather and 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.050
 it is round 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.610
 with a dark gray marker drawing the 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.539
 shadow reflection that will have 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.329
 around 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.510
 you can use a pencil to flip 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.840
 the shapes of the figures that are going to 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.970
 be reflecting in the sphere these are going 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.670
 to be distorted by the way 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.240
 we put some floor lines that go to 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.240
 horizon 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.360
 on the left side a building 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:07.810
 around here some trees and another building 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.330
 with a black marker we fill in the most 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.400
 Dark 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.660
 the list of materials is in the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.660
 information under the video 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.480
 to the building we give a light gray background 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.619
 also to the floor of this that is going to be a 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.619
 as a square or something 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.770
 We can make the trees with a 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:38.140
 green pencil could also have 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.899
 been with a marker but I do not have green 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.969
 so the pencil is fine the sky 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.880
 with a light blue and the other building goes 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.740
 to be a mixture of yellow and gray the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.190
 low building is going to reflect in the 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.190
 other 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.020
 with a white pencil type cake we can 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:59.740
 give the clearest reflection of the sky 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.229
 already starts to look good I love this 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.350
 a reflection in the building we give it with 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.780
 the light blue pizza 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.420
 the shadow inside the sphere we make it 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.870
 with a charcoal and that's because the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.810
 I want to blur with the spum and not like that and 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.330
 is that if it was a black pencil that does not 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.750
 blur 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.450
 we put a few more reflections 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.230
 I want some even more white accents 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.840
 so I use acrylic paint that's 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.680
 better fade it with moss with cake 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.780
 white and blue pencil 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.780
 we simulate some more sheets 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.330
 with a very finite marker we can do 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.640
 the building and cement lines 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.800
 but I do not want them to look so marked 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.610
 in the distance so the des banesco 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.120
 with a gray pencil we strengthen the shadow and 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.120
 we blur 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.210
 I will also reinforce the light and that is 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.900
 if scrum must be very extreme or with the 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.900
 black and white 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.750
 I think you have to give it some touches 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.420
 with acrylic paint to the building and a 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.410
 slight light reflected on the bottom 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.410
 of the sphere 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:32.150
 the last details and ready 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.150
 please tell me what you think 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.080
 if you liked it please give it a like and 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.000
 subscribe to the channel you know where 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.700
 you can follow me and where are the 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.700
 links and I'll see you on Tuesday
