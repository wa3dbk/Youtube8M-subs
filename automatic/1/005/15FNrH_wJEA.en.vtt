now<00:02:00.540> they<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> number<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.100> instructions

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
now they have a number of instructions

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.940 
now they have a number of instructions
you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.240> use<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.630> with<00:02:03.750> your<00:02:03.840> iOS<00:02:04.200> device<00:02:04.619> and

was<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.530> bit<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.920> struggle<00:02:42.280> at<00:02:42.370> times<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.239> make

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
was a bit of a struggle at times so make

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.180 
was a bit of a struggle at times so make
sure<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:43.660> is<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.080> once<00:02:44.470> it's<00:02:44.650> on<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.069> you're

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
sure that is on once it's on and you're

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.640 
sure that is on once it's on and you're
good<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:46.209> connect<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.690> app<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:47.410> hit<00:02:47.560> the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
good you connect the app you hit the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.979 
good you connect the app you hit the
connect<00:02:47.980> button<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.459> then<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.480> have<00:02:49.690> your

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
connect button and then you have your

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.250 
connect button and then you have your
EEG<00:02:50.700> headset<00:02:51.700> on<00:02:51.910> your<00:02:52.060> forehead<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.660> as<00:02:53.110> you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
EEG headset on your forehead and as you

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.380 
EEG headset on your forehead and as you
can<00:02:53.380> see<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:54.340> have<00:02:54.459> signal<00:02:54.790> strength<00:02:55.209> with

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
can see you have signal strength with

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.819 
can see you have signal strength with
what<00:02:55.599> how<00:02:55.900> well<00:02:56.110> it's<00:02:56.230> connected<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.680> your

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
what how well it's connected to your

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.309 
what how well it's connected to your
earlobe<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.430> then<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.420> start<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.870> see<00:02:58.900> these

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
earlobe and then you start to see these

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.229 
earlobe and then you start to see these
graphs<00:02:59.829> moving<00:03:00.250> up<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.579> down<00:03:00.730> in<00:03:00.910> terms<00:03:00.940> of

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
graphs moving up and down in terms of

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.990 
graphs moving up and down in terms of
attention<00:03:01.599> and<00:03:02.190> meditation<00:03:03.190> now<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.760> whole

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
attention and meditation now the whole

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.449 
attention and meditation now the whole
idea<00:03:04.360> here<00:03:04.690> is<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.230> get<00:03:05.500> enough<00:03:05.890> of<00:03:06.160> brain

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
idea here is to get enough of brain

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.880 
idea here is to get enough of brain
activity<00:03:06.819> to<00:03:07.450> cause<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.900> hover<00:03:08.140> just<00:03:08.769> like

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
activity to cause it to hover just like

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.680 
activity to cause it to hover just like
I<00:03:08.950> did<00:03:09.129> you<00:03:09.310> have<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.459> hover<00:03:09.730> bar<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.450> when<00:03:10.599> it

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
I did you have a hover bar and when it

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.830 
I did you have a hover bar and when it
fills<00:03:10.840> up<00:03:11.049> then<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.769> starts<00:03:12.099> to<00:03:12.280> fly<00:03:12.489> now<00:03:13.480> the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
fills up then it starts to fly now the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.509 
fills up then it starts to fly now the
jury<00:03:14.049> is<00:03:14.200> out<00:03:14.290> for<00:03:14.530> me<00:03:14.709> whether<00:03:15.129> or<00:03:15.250> not<00:03:15.310> this

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
jury is out for me whether or not this

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.860 
jury is out for me whether or not this
is<00:03:15.700> actually<00:03:15.849> effective<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.569> if<00:03:16.629> so<00:03:16.750> it's

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
is actually effective and if so it's

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.509 
is actually effective and if so it's
really<00:03:16.989> based<00:03:17.200> upon<00:03:17.500> brainwaves<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.220> can't

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
really based upon brainwaves you can't

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.400 
really based upon brainwaves you can't
control<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:18.970> helicopter<00:03:19.630> it's<00:03:20.109> a<00:03:20.170> great

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
control the helicopter it's a great

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.530 
control the helicopter it's a great
concept<00:03:20.680> but<00:03:21.280> it's<00:03:21.730> very<00:03:21.819> difficult<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.359> see

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
concept but it's very difficult to see

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.479 
concept but it's very difficult to see
if<00:03:22.810> anything<00:03:23.319> that<00:03:23.410> you're<00:03:23.620> doing<00:03:23.889> is

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
if anything that you're doing is

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.160 
if anything that you're doing is
actually<00:03:24.819> working<00:03:25.299> and<00:03:25.569> more<00:03:25.720> importantly

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
actually working and more importantly

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.530 
actually working and more importantly
it's<00:03:26.620> hard<00:03:26.889> to<00:03:26.980> determine<00:03:27.220> what<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.880> do<00:03:28.030> to

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540
