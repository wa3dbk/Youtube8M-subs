00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
pretty hard night last night and this is

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.999 
pretty hard night last night and this is
a<00:01:28.000> very<00:01:28.210> simple<00:01:28.570> argument<00:01:28.929> but<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.439> legitimate

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
a very simple argument but a legitimate

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.340 
a very simple argument but a legitimate
one<00:01:30.189> it's<00:01:30.789> the<00:01:31.030> Sharks<00:01:31.539> do<00:01:31.929> you<00:01:32.020> think<00:01:32.259> the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
one it's the Sharks do you think the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.230 
one it's the Sharks do you think the
Lightning<00:01:32.710> miss<00:01:32.950> Boyle<00:01:33.219> do<00:01:33.820> you<00:01:33.909> think<00:01:34.149> they

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
Lightning miss Boyle do you think they

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.029 
Lightning miss Boyle do you think they
missed<00:01:34.450> their<00:01:34.570> previous<00:01:34.990> owners<00:01:35.320> seriously

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
missed their previous owners seriously

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.649 
missed their previous owners seriously
though<00:01:36.219> the<00:01:36.490> only<00:01:36.759> good<00:01:37.030> part<00:01:37.060> about<00:01:37.390> this

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
though the only good part about this

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.359 
though the only good part about this
game<00:01:37.869> I<00:01:37.899> guess<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.499> they<00:01:38.649> kind<00:01:38.950> of<00:01:39.039> held<00:01:39.219> the

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
game I guess is they kind of held the

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.669 
game I guess is they kind of held the
sharks<00:01:39.700> at<00:01:39.880> bay<00:01:39.909> after<00:01:40.689> the<00:01:40.780> first<00:01:40.990> period<00:01:41.289> but

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
sharks at bay after the first period but

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.919 
sharks at bay after the first period but
I<00:01:41.710> mean<00:01:41.890> they<00:01:42.039> probably<00:01:42.310> are<00:01:43.060> pressing<00:01:43.689> as

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
I mean they probably are pressing as

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.020 
I mean they probably are pressing as
hard<00:01:44.289> as<00:01:44.409> they<00:01:44.560> could<00:01:44.619> because<00:01:45.159> I<00:01:45.429> mean<00:01:45.609> he<00:01:45.850> had

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
hard as they could because I mean he had

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.179 
hard as they could because I mean he had
a<00:01:46.060> four<00:01:46.390> nothing<00:01:46.539> lead<00:01:46.719> after<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.200> first<00:01:47.289> but

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
a four nothing lead after the first but

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.069 
a four nothing lead after the first but
at<00:01:48.640> least<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:49.030> was<00:01:49.119> good<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.420> see<00:01:49.450> Hagman<00:01:50.049> and

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
at least it was good to see Hagman and

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.319 
at least it was good to see Hagman and
Kulemin<00:01:51.009> score<00:01:51.310> some<00:01:51.520> goals<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:51.939> Ron

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
Kulemin score some goals and Ron
