00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
much within their lifetime today had

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.170 
much within their lifetime today had
very<00:02:18.030> little<00:02:19.400> work<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.580> lifetime<00:02:21.030> rewards

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
very little work of lifetime rewards

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.100 
very little work of lifetime rewards
they<00:02:21.780> didn't<00:02:22.320> have<00:02:23.010> many<00:02:23.310> skills<00:02:23.959> then<00:02:24.959> you

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
they didn't have many skills then you

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.729 
they didn't have many skills then you
have<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:26.269> larger<00:02:27.269> grave<00:02:28.310> these<00:02:29.310> ones<00:02:29.549> here

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
have the larger grave these ones here

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.039 
have the larger grave these ones here
people<00:02:31.739> who<00:02:31.920> seems<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.239> get<00:02:33.420> these<00:02:33.660> grades

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
people who seems that get these grades

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.190 
people who seems that get these grades
generally<00:02:35.040> have<00:02:35.940> generally<00:02:36.360> accomplished<00:02:37.049> a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
generally have generally accomplished a

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.289 
generally have generally accomplished a
little<00:02:37.440> bit<00:02:37.590> within<00:02:37.890> their<00:02:38.190> lifetime<00:02:38.730> and

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
little bit within their lifetime and

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.840 
little bit within their lifetime and
then<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.810> have<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.500> larger<00:02:41.250> gravestones

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
then you have the larger gravestones

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.930 
then you have the larger gravestones
like<00:02:42.209> these<00:02:42.420> ones<00:02:42.660> here<00:02:43.010> The<00:02:44.010> Sims<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.430> have

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
like these ones here The Sims you have

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.750 
like these ones here The Sims you have
these<00:02:45.180> ones<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.720> believe<00:02:45.810> are<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:47.310> ones<00:02:47.519> who

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
these ones I believe are the ones who

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.650 
these ones I believe are the ones who
accomplished<00:02:48.269> their<00:02:48.480> lifetime<00:02:49.049> goals<00:02:49.489> so<00:02:50.660> the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
accomplished their lifetime goals so the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.300 
accomplished their lifetime goals so the
more<00:02:51.870> your<00:02:52.049> sim<00:02:52.320> does<00:02:53.269> within<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.100> little

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
more your sim does within the the little

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.390 
more your sim does within the the little
sim<00:02:56.549> world<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:58.440> bigger<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:58.950> better<00:02:59.100> their

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
sim world the bigger and better their

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.000 
sim world the bigger and better their
grave<00:02:59.610> will<00:02:59.820> be<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.299> I<00:03:00.590> think<00:03:01.590> there's<00:03:01.890> also

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
grave will be and I think there's also

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.930 
grave will be and I think there's also
different<00:03:02.519> colors<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:04.260> sort<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.560> say<00:03:04.940> you

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
different colors to sort of say you

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.259 
different colors to sort of say you
almost<00:03:06.269> got<00:03:06.540> there<00:03:07.610> so<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.700> different<00:03:08.970> colors

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
almost got there so the different colors

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.009 
almost got there so the different colors
I<00:03:09.450> would<00:03:09.630> assume<00:03:10.940> mean<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.209> there<00:03:12.930> are

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
I would assume mean that there are

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.870 
I would assume mean that there are
different<00:03:13.290> levels<00:03:13.470> or<00:03:14.310> different<00:03:14.370> amount<00:03:14.820> of

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
different levels or different amount of

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.580 
different levels or different amount of
points<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.269> your<00:03:15.540> sim<00:03:15.840> has<00:03:16.079> accumulated

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
points that your sim has accumulated

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.610 
points that your sim has accumulated
over<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.340> time<00:03:17.660> since<00:03:18.660> they<00:03:18.870> can't<00:03:19.140> be

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
over the time since they can't be

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.330 
over the time since they can't be
designed<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.310> be<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.640> particular<00:03:21.030> color<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:22.650> if

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
designed to be a particular color so if

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.490 
designed to be a particular color so if
you<00:03:23.549> want<00:03:23.760> one<00:03:23.849> of<00:03:23.909> the<00:03:24.090> tall<00:03:24.390> graves<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:25.260> best

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
you want one of the tall graves you best

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.309 
you want one of the tall graves you best
get<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.430> then<00:03:26.730> if<00:03:27.629> you<00:03:27.780> have<00:03:27.959> any<00:03:28.140> other
