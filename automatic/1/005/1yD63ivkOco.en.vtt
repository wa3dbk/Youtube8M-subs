 Hello friends 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.600
 Well, as it says in the title, today I'm going to show you how to make it subject to 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.050
 San Andreas the city is three kilometers closer 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.440
 if they did not understand what I said they will understand when I show them in the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.109
 game so let's start at once 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.260
 first we go to the limit megaupload or leave in the description of the video 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.230
 and once there we put the four digits that ask us to enter and the 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.530
 we enter 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.530
 then we wait for the time 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.480
 when finished we give normal discharge 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.460
 we save the file I recommend that you save it on the desktop so that 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.460
 be in sight 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.510
 this is the file that we have downloaded and we will decompress it we click 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.300
 right and it is bring here the folder will be and a file will appear 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.240
 as next step we go to the directory of gt a san andreas 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.510
 we get into the folder that will be called 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.860
 this is the original file of the game 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.300
 let's make a backup of the file 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.930
 for that we copy it and we go to the directory now we create a folder 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.950
 Basque call or whatever you want 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.520
 here we are going to leave the original file of the game this is in case the model 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.960
 so they can put the file back when they want 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.660
 now we go to the folder that we unzipped if we copy the file 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.529
 what's wrong with it 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.529
 we go to the data folder and there we paste it 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:25.589
 we already have the modification list 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:28.589
 now I will explain what this modification is for 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:32.370
 when you play san andreas if we see the city 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.379
 they see it as something limited 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.469
 now with this post you can see three kilometers further and if you have not 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.479
 understood with this we go to the game 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.869
 hello hello, I'm going to show you how to improve 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.899
 when they see it they will understand what it is for 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:52.339
 miriam that's what it looks like in the city normally without replacing any 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.129
 archive 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.129
 note that on the horizon the city looks unlimited blurry but now it is 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.449
 what the city looks like after installing the module 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:07.309
 jooooo just look it looks amazing you can see it all the desert and all the 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:10.309
 city 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:12.989
 look how everything looks 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.989
 because everything is what you see 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:27.199

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.279
