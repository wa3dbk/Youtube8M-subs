00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
looks like microsoft office 2010 it's

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.870 
looks like microsoft office 2010 it's
not<00:02:15.720> good<00:02:17.150> but<00:02:18.150> apart<00:02:18.480> from<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:19.730> get<00:02:20.730> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
not good but apart from that I get the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.520 
not good but apart from that I get the
rough<00:02:21.120> idea<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.380> be

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
rough idea that this is going to be

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.750 
rough idea that this is going to be
designed<00:02:22.890> for<00:02:23.280> am<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:26.700> Microsoft<00:02:28.160> sorry<00:02:29.160> Dean

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.400 
designed for am the Microsoft sorry Dean
confuse<00:02:30.060> now<00:02:30.270> this<00:02:30.510> could<00:02:30.720> be<00:02:30.780> designed<00:02:31.170> for

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
confuse now this could be designed for

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.860 
confuse now this could be designed for
the<00:02:31.590> our<00:02:31.770> tablet<00:02:32.280> pc<00:02:32.730> market<00:02:33.590> for<00:02:34.590> tablets<00:02:35.870> now

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
cleverest thing Microsoft have done but

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.110 
cleverest thing Microsoft have done but
it<00:03:14.440> will<00:03:14.650> look<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:15.040> lot<00:03:15.310> better<00:03:15.519> once<00:03:15.819> you

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
it will look a lot better once you

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.780 
it will look a lot better once you
install<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:16.510> on<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:16.690> tablet<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:18.400> would<00:03:18.610> show

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
install it on a tablet and I would show

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.949 
install it on a tablet and I would show
you<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:19.000> app<00:03:19.150> store<00:03:19.319> but<00:03:20.319> that<00:03:20.830> doesn't<00:03:21.220> work

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
you the app store but that doesn't work

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.839 
you the app store but that doesn't work
because<00:03:22.959> it's<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.349> developer<00:03:23.890> preview<00:03:24.099> but<00:03:24.790> you

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
because it's a developer preview but you

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.970 
because it's a developer preview but you
do<00:03:25.000> get<00:03:25.150> internet<00:03:25.510> explorer<00:03:25.959> on<00:03:26.080> its<00:03:26.260> original

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
do get internet explorer on its original

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.460 
do get internet explorer on its original
its<00:03:27.790> original<00:03:28.209> view<00:03:28.510> which<00:03:28.840> does<00:03:29.170> look<00:03:29.349> a<00:03:29.380> bit

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
its original view which does look a bit

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.920 
its original view which does look a bit
back<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:30.130> obviously<00:03:31.090> it's<00:03:31.300> more<00:03:31.480> familiar

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
back and obviously it's more familiar

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.880 
back and obviously it's more familiar
with<00:03:31.959> people<00:03:32.410> who<00:03:32.470> know<00:03:32.590> what<00:03:32.620> they're<00:03:32.800> doing

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
with people who know what they're doing

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.860 
with people who know what they're doing
you<00:03:33.640> know<00:03:33.819> how<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.510> use<00:03:34.840> it<00:03:35.019> this<00:03:35.140> way<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.840> that

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
you know how to use it this way so that

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.039 
you know how to use it this way so that
just<00:03:38.349> about<00:03:38.500> wraps<00:03:39.220> everything<00:03:39.549> up<00:03:43.049> yeah

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
just about wraps everything up yeah

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.479 
just about wraps everything up yeah
