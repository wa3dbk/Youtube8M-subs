00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.349

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.439
 and in the center divided and always here 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.410
 a thing as rare and strange that 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.860
 you will probably see that it is a video of 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.890
 reaction because I hope it goes well 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.820
 everything is coordinated because if not 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.730
 occur because maybe the camera does 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.339
 something and something else the three that I 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.379
 happen to me but nothing I hope I'm 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:55.329
 watching the camera by the face the camera 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:57.579
 of the face because I do not know I do not have the 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.440
 screen to see me so good since 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.579

 go, go, go, ok, ok, you can 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.900
 stay with your Chinese anime whatever 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.539
 and 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:52.280
 and I found it very funny because of everything 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:54.729
 what happens in my character 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.999
 historical 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:00.969
 of the anime bacterial other anime 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:03.389
 very good but I think it would be what 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:03.389
 basic 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:12.090
 if you want equal to the identical life 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:14.760
 exactly like playing

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.760

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.310
 hope you like 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.280
 in something weird weird but you have to 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.610
 implement things in the channel in the 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.610
 description 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:40.720

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:43.990
 the video without seeing my face and without comment 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:48.580
 or nothing and the channel will also be 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:54.819
 obviously they will be able to see it so that 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:56.740
 subscribe there is very good animation in the 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.960
 miniature and it looks very interesting but 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.070

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.070
