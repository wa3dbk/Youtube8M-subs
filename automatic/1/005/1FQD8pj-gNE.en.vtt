they will never stop coming until you

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.960 
they will never stop coming until you
beat<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:38.690> boss<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:40.489> weird<00:00:40.699> thing<00:00:40.790> is

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
beat the boss and the weird thing is

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.329 
beat the boss and the weird thing is
that<00:00:41.150> the<00:00:41.330> boss<00:00:41.510> is<00:00:41.750> kind<00:00:41.870> of<00:00:42.019> hidden<00:00:42.140> so<00:00:43.070> the

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
that the boss is kind of hidden so the

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.549 
that the boss is kind of hidden so the
best<00:00:43.580> trick<00:00:43.879> that<00:00:44.059> I<00:00:44.089> found<00:00:44.390> is<00:00:44.629> to<00:00:44.690> kind<00:00:45.500> of

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
best trick that I found is to kind of

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.670 
best trick that I found is to kind of
run<00:00:45.860> and<00:00:46.190> stay<00:00:46.519> at<00:00:46.879> the<00:00:47.360> edges<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:48.199> rats<00:00:48.440> move

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
run and stay at the edges the rats move

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.160 
run and stay at the edges the rats move
very<00:00:48.860> slowly<00:00:49.280> and<00:00:49.580> they're<00:00:50.299> not<00:00:50.420> extremely

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
very slowly and they're not extremely

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.229 
very slowly and they're not extremely
aggressive<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.070> if<00:00:52.309> you<00:00:52.670> do<00:00:52.790> your<00:00:52.940> best<00:00:53.059> to

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
aggressive so if you do your best to

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.789 
aggressive so if you do your best to
just<00:00:53.330> kind<00:00:53.570> of<00:00:53.600> fight<00:00:53.780> one<00:00:54.049> at<00:00:54.199> a<00:00:54.260> time<00:00:54.530> and

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:54.799 
just kind of fight one at a time and

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:57.369 
just kind of fight one at a time and
stay<00:00:55.339> at<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.610> edges<00:00:55.790> you<00:00:56.210> do<00:00:57.019> not<00:00:57.199> let

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
stay at the edges you do not let

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.259 
stay at the edges you do not let
yourself<00:00:57.739> get<00:00:57.890> surrounded<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:58.879> should<00:00:59.119> be

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
things for this fight I've tried to use

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.530 
things for this fight I've tried to use
like<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:00.980> big<00:03:01.250> sword<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.910> does<00:03:02.120> sweeping

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
like a big sword that does sweeping

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.750 
like a big sword that does sweeping
attacks<00:03:02.840> for<00:03:03.560> AOE<00:03:03.830> but<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.280> just<00:03:04.400> doesn't<00:03:04.550> work

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
attacks for AOE but it just doesn't work

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.030 
attacks for AOE but it just doesn't work
because<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:05.150> these<00:03:05.240> little<00:03:05.390> statues<00:03:05.900> they

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
because of these little statues they

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.170 
because of these little statues they
they<00:03:07.040> will<00:03:07.160> always<00:03:07.430> interrupt<00:03:07.790> your<00:03:07.940> attack

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
they will always interrupt your attack

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.500 
they will always interrupt your attack
and<00:03:08.450> kind<00:03:09.020> of<00:03:09.080> mess<00:03:09.710> you<00:03:09.860> up<00:03:09.890> really<00:03:10.250> bad<00:03:10.510> so

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
and kind of mess you up really bad so

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.940 
and kind of mess you up really bad so
here<00:03:11.750> we<00:03:11.840> go<00:03:11.870> let's<00:03:12.320> just<00:03:12.440> get<00:03:12.530> into<00:03:12.650> a<00:03:12.770> good

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
here we go let's just get into a good

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.100 
here we go let's just get into a good
range<00:03:13.190> he's<00:03:14.090> really<00:03:14.300> weak<00:03:14.570> it<00:03:14.780> doesn't<00:03:15.020> take

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
range he's really weak it doesn't take

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.140 
range he's really weak it doesn't take
too<00:03:15.140> many<00:03:15.350> hits<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.680> kill<00:03:15.740> him<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.640> hardest

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
too many hits to kill him the hardest

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.700 
too many hits to kill him the hardest
part<00:03:17.270> is<00:03:17.390> just<00:03:17.480> logging<00:03:17.990> on<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.110> him<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.530> then

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
part is just logging on to him and then
