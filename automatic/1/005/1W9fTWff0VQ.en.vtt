00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:34.810 

you

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.430 

our<00:01:35.820> next<00:01:36.060> measurement<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.050> height

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
our next measurement is the height

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.190 
our next measurement is the height
measurement<00:01:38.240> we<00:01:39.240> measure<00:01:39.510> that<00:01:39.720> from<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
measurement we measure that from the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.710 
measurement we measure that from the
floor<00:01:40.440> finish<00:01:41.340> floor<00:01:41.640> level<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.160 
underside of the lintel to 165
millimeters<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.510> measure<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.930> both

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
millimeters and we measure this both

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:58.520 
millimeters and we measure this both
sides<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:49.710> well<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:55.320> 165<00:01:56.720> so<00:01:57.720> now<00:01:57.930> know<00:01:58.260> that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
sides as well to 165 so now know that

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.830 
sides as well to 165 so now know that
the<00:01:59.479> the<00:02:00.479> height<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.619> actual<00:02:01.920> opening<00:02:02.070> is

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
the the height of the actual opening is

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:13.780 
the the height of the actual opening is
nice<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.020> square

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.900 

you

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.570 

right<00:02:19.750> here<00:02:20.080> we<00:02:20.290> have<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.470> retractable<00:02:21.100> garage

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
right here we have a retractable garage

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.160 
right here we have a retractable garage
door<00:02:22.470> now<00:02:23.470> modern<00:02:24.130> garage<00:02:24.490> doors<00:02:24.790> can<00:02:25.570> now<00:02:25.810> be

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
door now modern garage doors can now be

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.640 
door now modern garage doors can now be
fitted<00:02:26.620> behind<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.670> brickwork<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:29.380> will

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
fitted behind the brickwork this will

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:38.580 
fitted behind the brickwork this will
gave<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.370> lot<00:02:30.760> more<00:02:31.120> drive<00:02:31.780> through<00:02:32.170> with

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.920 

so<00:02:38.769> if<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.190> want<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.550> maximize<00:02:40.480> your<00:02:40.690> dry

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
so if you want to maximize your dry

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.660 
so if you want to maximize your dry
prove<00:02:41.349> it<00:02:41.560> there's<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.129> couple<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.519> other

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
prove it there's a couple of other

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
prove it there's a couple of other
measurements<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.510> are<00:02:43.629> required<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:46.480> this

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
measurements that are required in this

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.160 
measurements that are required in this
case<00:02:47.250> we<00:02:48.250> need<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.580> see<00:02:48.819> this<00:02:49.599> measurement

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
case we need to see this measurement

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.360 
case we need to see this measurement
here<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:51.489> this<00:02:51.879> measurement<00:02:52.390> here<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:54.190> ensure

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
here and this measurement here to ensure

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.270 
here and this measurement here to ensure
