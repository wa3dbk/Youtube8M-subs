hear this

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.930 
hear this
these<00:02:20.910> guys<00:02:21.590> they're<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.830> analogy<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.760> I

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
these guys they're the analogy that I

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.150 
these guys they're the analogy that I
was<00:02:27.300> told<00:02:27.570> is<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.230> someone<00:02:28.770> took<00:02:28.920> this

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
was told is that someone took this

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.400 
was told is that someone took this
feather<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.790> dipped<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.570> white<00:02:30.810> paint<00:02:31.140> and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
feather and dipped it in white paint and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.040 
feather and dipped it in white paint and
then<00:02:32.130> tipped<00:02:32.460> it<00:02:32.610> up<00:02:32.700> like<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
then tipped it up like this so that the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.500 
then tipped it up like this so that the
white<00:02:34.230> paint<00:02:34.530> could<00:02:34.770> run<00:02:34.980> down<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.520> shaft<00:02:35.790> and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
white paint could run down the shaft and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.380 
white paint could run down the shaft and
that's<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.230> female<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.890> male<00:02:38.550> they<00:02:39.150> would<00:02:39.300> have

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
that's a female a male they would have

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.910 
that's a female a male they would have
dipped<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:39.840> paint<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.200> held<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:40.740> way

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
dipped it in paint and held it this way

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.120 
dipped it in paint and held it this way
so<00:02:41.490> that<00:02:41.520> only<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:42.090> tip<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.810> why<00:02:43.170> there's<00:02:43.950> no

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
so that only the tip is why there's no

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.620 
so that only the tip is why there's no
white<00:02:44.400> going<00:02:44.640> down<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.060> rest<00:02:45.240> of<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.390> feather

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
white going down the rest of the feather

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.890 
white going down the rest of the feather
on<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.500> male<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:47.580> she's<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> female<00:02:48.300> cuz<00:02:48.690> she<00:02:48.810> has

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
on a male so she's a female cuz she has

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.480 
on a male so she's a female cuz she has
the<00:02:49.020> light<00:02:49.200> going<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.710> what<00:02:50.190> we're<00:02:50.310> going<00:02:50.400> to

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
the light going so what we're going to

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.610 
the light going so what we're going to
do<00:02:50.700> here<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.210> we're<00:02:51.420> collecting<00:02:51.810> blood<00:02:52.170> a

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
do here is we're collecting blood a

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.340 
do here is we're collecting blood a
small<00:02:53.430> blood<00:02:53.700> sample<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.390> couple<00:02:54.600> drops<00:02:54.930> I

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
small blood sample just a couple drops I

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.920 
small blood sample just a couple drops I
think<00:02:55.800> it's<00:02:55.890> for<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.070> connectivity<00:02:56.520> study<00:02:57.000> i'm

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
think it's for a connectivity study i'm

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.240 
think it's for a connectivity study i'm
not<00:02:58.050> mistaken<00:02:58.140> just<00:02:58.710> kind<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:58.920> saintly

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
not mistaken just kind of saintly

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.910 
not mistaken just kind of saintly
relatedness<00:02:59.670> of<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.210> birds<00:03:00.570> so<00:03:01.290> basically

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
relatedness of the birds so basically

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.670 
relatedness of the birds so basically
i'm<00:03:01.980> going<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.160> give<00:03:02.250> her<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.400> little<00:03:02.520> pedicure

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
so that it just a little bit of

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.190 
so that it just a little bit of
what<00:03:09.680> comes<00:03:09.890> out<00:03:10.360> so<00:03:11.360> it<00:03:11.540> just<00:03:11.720> trim<00:03:11.959> it<00:03:11.989> a

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
what comes out so it just trim it a

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.080 
what comes out so it just trim it a
little<00:03:12.230> bit<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.800> time<00:03:12.950> so<00:03:13.250> this<00:03:13.400> is<00:03:13.610> for<00:03:13.849> a<00:03:13.880> DNA

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
little bit of time so this is for a DNA

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.870 
little bit of time so this is for a DNA
test<00:03:14.390> yes<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:17.709> try<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.739> just<00:03:18.890> take<00:03:19.190> as<00:03:19.340> little<00:03:19.640> as

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
test yes I try to just take as little as

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:29.540 
test yes I try to just take as little as
possible

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.800 

sometimes<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.210> take<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:30.480> lot<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.690> there

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
sometimes you take a lot of there

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.809 
sometimes you take a lot of there
we<00:03:32.560> go

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.560 

so<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.209> just<00:03:36.540> need<00:03:36.719> to<00:03:36.749> get<00:03:37.079> a<00:03:37.140> drop

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.790 

berto<00:03:47.390> and<00:03:47.570> styptic<00:03:47.900> powder<00:03:48.080> just<00:03:48.440> stopped<00:03:48.620> in

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
berto and styptic powder just stopped in

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.690
