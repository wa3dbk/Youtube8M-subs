when I say blended protein powder that

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.480 
when I say blended protein powder that

quality protein sources it's technically
-<00:00:34.720> because<00:00:35.110> it's<00:00:35.290> ray<00:00:35.500> and<00:00:35.800> casein<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:37.510> know

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
- because it's ray and casein you know

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.540 
- because it's ray and casein you know
when<00:00:37.810> you<00:00:37.870> see<00:00:38.050> milk<00:00:38.290> listed<00:00:38.739> you<00:00:39.130> know<00:00:39.220> bovine

ways in which the protein is derived you

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.770 
ways in which the protein is derived you
know<00:00:51.070> there's<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.310> hydrolyzed<00:00:52.120> whey<00:00:52.330> protein

and micellar casein again that pretty

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.590

much<00:01:06.040> means<00:01:06.250> it's<00:01:06.490> two<00:01:06.729> sources<00:01:07.119> of<00:01:07.210> protein

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
much means it's two sources of protein

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.899 
much means it's two sources of protein
in<00:01:07.689> terms<00:01:07.900> of<00:01:08.049> the<00:01:08.140> amino<00:01:08.380> acid<00:01:08.860> structure<00:01:09.159> but

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
in terms of the amino acid structure but

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.179 
in terms of the amino acid structure but
because<00:01:10.180> it's<00:01:10.299> either<00:01:10.450> way<00:01:10.689> or<00:01:10.990> casein

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
because it's either way or casein

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.039 
because it's either way or casein
you<00:01:12.520> know<00:01:12.610> how<00:01:12.759> it's<00:01:12.909> filtered<00:01:13.390> doesn't<00:01:13.780> make

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
you know how it's filtered doesn't make

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:15.359 
you know how it's filtered doesn't make
it<00:01:14.170> technically<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.710> different<00:01:15.040> protein

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
it technically a different protein

per<00:01:23.319> serving<00:01:23.499> so<00:01:23.859> what<00:01:24.249> that<00:01:24.340> means<00:01:24.549> to<00:01:24.700> you

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:24.819 
per serving so what that means to you

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:26.340 
per serving so what that means to you
and<00:01:24.969> you<00:01:25.030> see<00:01:25.179> a<00:01:25.210> little<00:01:25.359> bit<00:01:25.479> of<00:01:25.600> fat<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:26.079> like

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
and you see a little bit of fat and like

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.289 
and you see a little bit of fat and like
a<00:01:26.380> casein<00:01:26.859> based<00:01:27.069> protein<00:01:27.490> is<00:01:27.609> it's<00:01:27.729> probably

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
a casein based protein is it's probably

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:29.940 
a casein based protein is it's probably
gonna<00:01:28.420> be<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.810> little<00:01:29.170> bit<00:01:29.350> more<00:01:29.439> creamy<00:01:29.740> and

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
gonna be a little bit more creamy and

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.739 
gonna be a little bit more creamy and
rich<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.369> taste<00:01:30.639> so<00:01:30.969> if<00:01:31.060> you<00:01:31.149> mix<00:01:31.329> it<00:01:31.479> in<00:01:31.569> water

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
rich and taste so if you mix it in water

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:33.870 
rich and taste so if you mix it in water
in<00:01:32.259> that<00:01:32.439> case<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:32.920> can<00:01:33.069> mix<00:01:33.219> that<00:01:33.399> milk

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
in that case I can mix that milk

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.149 
in that case I can mix that milk
that<00:01:34.689> does<00:01:34.869> tend<00:01:35.139> to<00:01:35.200> improve<00:01:35.499> the<00:01:35.649> taste<00:01:35.829> so

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
that does tend to improve the taste so

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.559 
that does tend to improve the taste so
if<00:01:36.490> you're<00:01:36.579> somebody<00:01:36.850> who's<00:01:36.939> dying<00:01:37.299> in<00:01:37.420> a<00:01:37.479> you

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
in there you know

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.660 
in there you know
casein<00:01:53.139> tends<00:01:53.439> to<00:01:53.619> go<00:01:54.249> through<00:01:54.459> a<00:01:54.490> little<00:01:54.639> bit

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
casein tends to go through a little bit

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.429 
casein tends to go through a little bit
slower<00:01:54.999> in<00:01:55.240> terms<00:01:55.479> of<00:01:55.600> how<00:01:55.719> it<00:01:55.869> digests

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
slower in terms of how it digests

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.929 
slower in terms of how it digests
because<00:01:56.709> it<00:01:56.829> has<00:01:57.009> something<00:01:57.249> called<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.579> gluten

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
because it has something called a gluten

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.550 
because it has something called a gluten
and<00:01:58.029> in<00:01:58.149> there<00:01:58.329> not<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.990> be<00:01:59.109> confused<00:01:59.409> with

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
and in there not to be confused with

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.379 
and in there not to be confused with
gluten<00:01:59.979> this<00:02:00.399> is<00:02:00.549> called<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.819> gluten<00:02:01.209> and

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:01.389 
gluten this is called the gluten and

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:02.699 
gluten this is called the gluten and
what<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:01.569> does<00:02:01.689> is<00:02:01.869> it<00:02:01.990> causes<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.439> to<00:02:02.469> form

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
what it does is it causes it to form

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.469 
what it does is it causes it to form
micelles<00:02:02.889> in<00:02:03.340> your<00:02:03.459> GI<00:02:03.639> tract<00:02:03.999> kind<00:02:04.420> of

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
micelles in your GI tract kind of

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.609 
micelles in your GI tract kind of
coagulates<00:02:05.079> and<00:02:05.259> that's<00:02:05.380> kind<00:02:05.590> of

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
coagulates and that's kind of

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.319 
coagulates and that's kind of
responsible<00:02:06.130> for<00:02:06.279> the<00:02:06.340> slower<00:02:06.549> release<00:02:06.789> it's

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
responsible for the slower release it's

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.029 
responsible for the slower release it's
also<00:02:07.450> partially<00:02:07.959> responsible<00:02:08.259> for<00:02:08.679> making<00:02:08.830> it

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
also partially responsible for making it

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.370 
also partially responsible for making it
feel<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.250> little<00:02:09.429> bit<00:02:09.550> more<00:02:09.729> firm<00:02:10.290> when<00:02:11.290> you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
feel a little bit more firm when you

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.940 
feel a little bit more firm when you
drink<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:13.030> another<00:02:13.930> thing<00:02:14.020> too<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.680> we<00:02:14.830> do

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
drink it so another thing too is we do

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.740 
drink it so another thing too is we do
that<00:02:15.099> a<00:02:15.130> lot<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.310> questions<00:02:15.700> on<00:02:15.819> this<00:02:15.940> is<00:02:16.150> if

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
that a lot of questions on this is if

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.880 
that a lot of questions on this is if
you<00:02:16.840> do<00:02:16.959> go<00:02:17.110> through<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.440> ingredients

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
you do go through the ingredients

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.010 
you do go through the ingredients
so<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.100> well<00:02:18.310> they<00:02:18.880> do<00:02:18.940> add<00:02:19.300> freeform<00:02:19.810> amino

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
so that well they do add freeform amino

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.440 
so that well they do add freeform amino
acids<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.530> here<00:02:20.710> Torian<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.250> voicing<00:02:21.670> you

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
acids in here Torian and voicing you

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.670 
acids in here Torian and voicing you
know<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:22.690> is<00:02:22.810> something<00:02:22.990> we<00:02:23.140> addressed<00:02:23.560> a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
know this is something we addressed a

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.400 
know this is something we addressed a
couple<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.010> years<00:02:24.160> ago<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.550> another<00:02:24.640> video

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
couple of years ago in another video

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.480 
couple of years ago in another video
where<00:02:26.410> there's<00:02:26.800> something<00:02:26.920> called<00:02:27.070> Kajal

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
where there's something called Kajal

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.070 
where there's something called Kajal
method<00:02:27.820> which<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.090> used<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.450> calculate

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
method which is used to calculate

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.890 
method which is used to calculate
protein<00:02:29.740> content<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.310> let<00:02:31.150> us<00:02:31.240> looking<00:02:31.480> at<00:02:31.720> is

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
protein content and let us looking at is

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.800 
protein content and let us looking at is
total<00:02:32.200> nitrogen<00:02:32.380> content<00:02:32.830> not<00:02:33.640> necessarily

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
total nitrogen content not necessarily

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.750 
total nitrogen content not necessarily
protein<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.110> some<00:02:35.980> properties<00:02:36.370> will<00:02:36.490> do<00:02:36.580> that

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
protein so some properties will do that

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.460 
protein so some properties will do that
adding<00:02:37.210> some<00:02:37.390> freeform<00:02:37.780> amino<00:02:37.990> acid<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.440> can

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
adding some freeform amino acid you can

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.930 
adding some freeform amino acid you can
clean<00:02:38.740> this<00:02:38.860> protein<00:02:39.280> I'm<00:02:39.460> not<00:02:39.610> sure<00:02:39.820> if

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
clean this protein I'm not sure if

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.970 
clean this protein I'm not sure if
that's<00:02:40.120> what's<00:02:40.330> done<00:02:40.510> here<00:02:40.680> yet<00:02:41.680> we<00:02:41.710> don't

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
that's what's done here yet we don't

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.610 
that's what's done here yet we don't
know<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.520> do<00:02:43.090> see<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.510> listed<00:02:43.840> after<00:02:44.050> melted

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
know I do see it listed after melted

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.000 
know I do see it listed after melted
extra<00:02:45.270> so<00:02:46.270> a<00:02:46.300> motive<00:02:46.810> extra<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.350> most<00:02:47.709> would

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
extra so a motive extra and most would

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.520 
extra so a motive extra and most would
make<00:02:48.160> up<00:02:48.370> six<00:02:49.270> grams<00:02:49.570> of<00:02:49.780> carbohydrates<00:02:50.410> of

make up six grams of carbohydrates of

make up six grams of carbohydrates of
this<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.830> wrote<00:02:51.610> that<00:02:51.820> high<00:02:51.940> because<00:02:52.150> there's

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
this I wrote that high because there's

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.000 
this I wrote that high because there's
one<00:02:52.510> gram<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:52.810> fiber<00:02:52.990> that's<00:02:53.620> how<00:02:53.740> I<00:02:53.770> come<00:02:53.980> to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
one gram of fiber that's how I come to

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.640 
one gram of fiber that's how I come to
that<00:02:54.190> conclusion<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.989> not<00:02:55.989> owner<00:02:56.260> percent

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
that conclusion so not owner percent

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.990 
that conclusion so not owner percent
sure<00:02:56.920> on<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.190> but<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.610> know<00:02:57.700> that's<00:02:57.940> a

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
sure on that but I know that's a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
sure on that but I know that's a
question<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.300> comes<00:02:58.390> up<00:02:58.570> a<00:02:58.690> lot<00:02:58.840> in<00:02:58.959> the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
question that comes up a lot in the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.530 
question that comes up a lot in the
videos<00:02:59.290> so<00:02:59.620> and<00:03:00.520> that's<00:03:00.670> just<00:03:00.850> easily<00:03:01.090> seen

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
videos so and that's just easily seen

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
videos so and that's just easily seen
just<00:03:01.750> about<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:02.080> know<00:03:02.110> looking<00:03:02.380> at<00:03:02.470> the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
just about you know looking at the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.550 
just about you know looking at the
ingredients<00:03:02.680> label<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:05.020> know<00:03:05.260> that

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
ingredients label so you know that

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.949 
ingredients label so you know that
answers<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.520> for<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:06.820> guys<00:03:06.970> so<00:03:07.300> there's<00:03:07.870> a

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
answers that for you guys so there's a

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.520 
answers that for you guys so there's a
chance<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.320> that<00:03:08.520> as<00:03:09.520> far<00:03:10.209> as<00:03:10.239> other<00:03:11.140> crossings

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
chance of that as far as other crossings

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.040 
chance of that as far as other crossings
I<00:03:11.650> think<00:03:12.340> pretty<00:03:12.580> much<00:03:12.730> covered<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.209> if<00:03:13.930> you

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
I think pretty much covered it if you

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.570 
I think pretty much covered it if you
guys<00:03:14.170> have<00:03:14.440> any<00:03:14.590> others<00:03:14.860> please<00:03:14.950> feel<00:03:15.310> free<00:03:15.400> to
