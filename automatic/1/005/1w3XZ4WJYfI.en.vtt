00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.790
When you're shooting JPEG mode, the computer
inside your camera has to do a lot of things.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.720
It reads the raw data off of the image sensor,
it converts that into a color image, then

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.430
it applies your white balance settings, it
sharpens the image, and finally, it compresses

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.430
it into a JPEG file.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.080
Along the way, it also possibly performs some
image editing operations; changes to saturation

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.790
and contrast, for example.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.050
Picture styles are collections of image editing
operations that can be applied to JPEG images

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.620
when you shoot.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.989
Your camera comes with a selection of picture
styles that are tailored towards specific

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:53.989
subject matter.

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.490
For example, the portrait picture style will
apply color corrections and contrast adjustments

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.649
that will make skin tones look better.

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.140
If you're shooting RAW, picture styles have
no effect on your image, because no image

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.220
processing takes place on RAW files inside
the camera.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.880
However, if you select a picture style other
than standard, a tag is set in your RAW file.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.500
If you then open that RAW file with Canon's
Digital Photo Professional, it will identify

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.110
that tag, and automatically apply settings
in DPP to achieve the look of the picture

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.110
style.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.590
If you're processing your RAW images with
other RAW processors, then picture styles

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.150
will have no effect.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.770
If you regularly shoot in the same environment,
say, you're a wedding shooter, or an event

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.250
shooter, and you routinely shoot the same
types of subject matter in the same type of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.750
light, then it's worth trying to define a
picture style that gives you results you like.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.060
If one of the default picture styles works
for your common shooting locations, or if

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.289
you can craft a picture style that does, then
you can save yourself a tremendous amount

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.130
of post-production time.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.810
If you're shooting JPEG, then your camera
will automatically apply the corrections defined

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.010
in your picture style.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.950
If you're shooting RAW, and processing your
images with DPP, then it will automatically

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.509
apply your picture styles corrections.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.369
If your picture style is configured properly,
this might mean that you don't need to do

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.060
any further adjustment.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.300
As you'll see later, picture styles can contain
extremely refined adjustments that can create

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:25.530
very subtle changes in color 
and contrast.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.240
