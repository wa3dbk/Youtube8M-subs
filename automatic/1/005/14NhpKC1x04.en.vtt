00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello serpentjes i am rick van 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.330
 serpentgameplay and welcome to the 2000 them 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.389
 video i know was a fake compilation 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.730
 actually the 1999 video but this is 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.980
 the 2000 video and I am not just going 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.330
 a short site log you do i have 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.130
 actually all things recorded my 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.100
 camera had a bit 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.750
 broke down exactly 2010 you 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.300
 help stupid i go this video on one 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.830
 couple themselves neatly and had it right away 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.170
 continue the first segment that is 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.929
 count with rick 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.850
 welcome to the 2000 edition of 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.100
 count with rick today we go 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.290
 calculate how long it will take if you 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.550
 all my videos in one go 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.410
 go and look at each other for that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.600
 we need the youtube statistics there 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.309
 namely how long the average 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.180
 playback of one of my videos takes 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.190
 now you can request 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.180
 why is that important to his 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.280
 also with 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.230
 also what percent of the total video 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.309
 that is the better he is nicely in the picture 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.350
 for you 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.910
 the average viewer watches 7 minutes and 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.129
 was seven seconds of my videos 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.030
 quite a lot by the way and that is 41% of the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.500
 videos 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.840
 now you could, for example, the seven 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.309
 minutes can share 41 and anke 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.210
 100 mine can also share immediately 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.400
 by 0 point four a smart then from what 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.710
 your part 41 a little 1% and that 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.900
 do your times 100 and a little 100% 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.990
 and only the problem is that seventh 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.759
 second and they could be the 60 and that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.409
 dogs indeed quite awkward computing 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.520
 so that's why we take six seconds 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.600
 stand 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.590
 and that seemed a lot 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.950
 easier because it just gets there 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.150
 seven point 1 7 point one of the after 10 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.869
 seconds in a minute 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.869
 yes and we then divide it by zero 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.390
 41 and then we know the reported video 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.860
 about me is 17 and a half minutes 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.780
 Shoot play nice in-game sound 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.210
 namely that attached 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:51.899
 times 2000 and then we see how many minutes 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.119
 i was immediately google minutes and all my 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.250
 watch videos one after the other expensive and all 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.259
 in the sneak and feel it says yes 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.840
 look i wish its pretty much minutes 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.100
 that is quite a lot of sleep just well now 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.509
 you have to be able to do something concrete 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.969
 so I myself divide by 60 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.600
 and then you get the number of hours 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.000
 500 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.700
 and 70 hours though days that is that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.819
 they have quite on 24 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.950
 yes 24 hours a day 24 days and then find it 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.540
 viewers it crazy that I don't believe you 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.950
 if you say you already have my videos 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.500
 seen as you do when i look like all my 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.850
 she watches videos I challenge you 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.190
 and pin the world up, just watch them 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.020
 saw a nice fact audience close up 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.420
 next part then we go right now 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.250
 to the second segment namely the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.840

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.730

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.870

 huge thank and normal that 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.390
 like a video many mike's question 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.400

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.319
 one falls away 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.720

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.980
