than<00:00:18.570> normal<00:00:18.779> recipes<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:19.650> far<00:00:19.920> as<00:00:20.100> like

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
than normal recipes as far as like

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.070 
than normal recipes as far as like
getting<00:00:20.640> more<00:00:20.939> height<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.449> -<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
getting more height to it - it's a

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.509 
getting more height to it - it's a
thicker<00:00:22.350> batter<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:22.859> what<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.010> like<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.160> do<00:00:23.400> is

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
thicker batter so what I like to do is

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.310 
thicker batter so what I like to do is
we<00:00:23.609> kind<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.820> plop<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.210> down<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.660> then<00:00:25.050> kind<00:00:25.289> of

swirl<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.099> top<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.119> this

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
swirl it on top so you have like this

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.240

big<00:00:27.300> ball<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.810> slowly<00:00:28.080> sags<00:00:28.560> down<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
big ball and it slowly sags down but the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.890 
big ball and it slowly sags down but the
outsides<00:00:29.609> cook<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.119> then<00:00:30.240> at<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.449> point<00:00:30.689> it

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
outsides cook and then at that point it

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.460 
outsides cook and then at that point it
just<00:00:31.050> starts<00:00:31.260> rising<00:00:31.470> more

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470
