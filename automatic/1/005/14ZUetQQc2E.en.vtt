hello<00:00:00.599> internet<00:00:00.930> world<00:00:01.199> techno<00:00:01.530> guy<00:00:01.680> 3<00:00:02.340> today

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
hello internet world techno guy 3 today

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.760 
hello internet world techno guy 3 today
I'm<00:00:03.090> going<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.330> be<00:00:03.449> talking<00:00:03.659> about<00:00:03.810> SSDs<00:00:04.529> and

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
I'm going to be talking about SSDs and

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.730 
I'm going to be talking about SSDs and
the<00:00:05.009> trim<00:00:05.310> command<00:00:05.600> no<00:00:06.600> doubt<00:00:06.779> SSDs<00:00:07.440> are

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
the trim command no doubt SSDs are

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.560 
the trim command no doubt SSDs are
faster<00:00:08.370> than<00:00:08.490> hard<00:00:08.700> drives<00:00:08.970> but<00:00:09.150> they<00:00:09.269> require

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
faster than hard drives but they require

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.209 
faster than hard drives but they require
the<00:00:09.750> trim<00:00:10.019> command<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.530> keep<00:00:10.710> up<00:00:10.889> their<00:00:11.040> quick

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
the trim command to keep up their quick

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.660 
the trim command to keep up their quick
speed<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:12.210> why<00:00:12.719> do<00:00:12.780> SSDs<00:00:13.410> or<00:00:13.710> solid<00:00:14.639> state

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
speed so why do SSDs or solid state

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.609 
speed so why do SSDs or solid state
drives<00:00:15.240> need<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.690> trim<00:00:15.900> command<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.289> function

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
drives need the trim command to function

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.070 
drives need the trim command to function
properly<00:00:17.240> regular<00:00:18.240> hardest<00:00:18.600> drives<00:00:18.810> don't

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
properly regular hardest drives don't

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.439 
properly regular hardest drives don't
need<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.670> this<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.820> because<00:00:20.910> they<00:00:21.180> work<00:00:21.330> on

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
need it this is because they work on

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.750 
need it this is because they work on
entirely<00:00:21.810> different<00:00:22.320> fundamentals<00:00:22.980> when<00:00:23.640> you

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
entirely different fundamentals when you

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.400 
entirely different fundamentals when you
delete<00:00:24.119> something<00:00:24.150> from<00:00:24.539> your<00:00:24.779> computer<00:00:25.260> it

delete something from your computer it

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.070
