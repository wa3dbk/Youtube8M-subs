00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.149 
is my table and I've got one similar to
this<00:01:42.689> at<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> beach<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> white<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:44.130> a

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
really like this so these are just going

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.510 
really like this so these are just going
to<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.780> stick<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.500> amongst<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.219> you'll

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
to just stick in amongst and you'll

to just stick in amongst and you'll
notice<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.880> I'm<00:01:57.119> doing<00:01:57.270> what<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.509> do<00:01:57.630> whenever

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
notice that I'm doing what I do whenever

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.499 
notice that I'm doing what I do whenever
I<00:01:58.290> do<00:01:58.409> any<00:01:58.740> design<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.340> there's<00:01:59.850> my<00:02:00.090> middle

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
I do any design and there's my middle

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.660 
I do any design and there's my middle
point<00:02:00.840> there<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.350> what<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> do<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> Sun<00:02:02.520> I'm

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
point there and what I do in the Sun I'm

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
point there and what I do in the Sun I'm
gonna<00:02:02.820> do<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.299> other<00:02:03.420> side<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.170> just

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
gonna do on the other side so just

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.230 
gonna do on the other side so just
lifting<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.009> up<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.490> then<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.850> could<00:02:06.060> just

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
lifting that up and then that could just

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.639 
lifting that up and then that could just
go<00:02:06.390> into<00:02:06.630> there<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.049> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
go into there like that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.710 
go into there like that
and<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.099> great<00:02:08.340> thing<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.610> there<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:09.420> you

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
and the great thing is there if you

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.690 
and the great thing is there if you
don't<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:10.200> access<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.979> artificial<00:02:11.370> this

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
don't have access to the artificial this

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.870 
don't have access to the artificial this
stuff<00:02:11.910> sort<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.209> grows

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
stuff sort of grows

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.910 
stuff sort of grows
over<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.300> place<00:02:13.480> in<00:02:13.720> also<00:02:14.500> if<00:02:14.590> you're<00:02:14.740> using

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
over the place in also if you're using

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.950 
over the place in also if you're using
fresh<00:02:15.220> it's<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.640> really<00:02:16.150> great<00:02:16.390> lasting

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
fresh it's a really great lasting

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.410 
fresh it's a really great lasting
foliage<00:02:17.800> right<00:02:18.310> putting<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.910> into<00:02:19.120> there

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
foliage right putting that into there

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.060 
foliage right putting that into there
and<00:02:19.660> you're<00:02:20.050> probably<00:02:20.260> thinking<00:02:20.500> why<00:02:20.830> didn't

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
and you're probably thinking why didn't

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.160 
and you're probably thinking why didn't
you<00:02:21.130> put<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.400> moss<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.880> after<00:02:22.510> well<00:02:22.960> actually

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
you put the moss and after well actually

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.690 
you put the moss and after well actually
that<00:02:23.740> would<00:02:23.890> have<00:02:24.010> been<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.160> good<00:02:24.340> idea<00:02:24.580> but

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
that would have been a good idea but

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.340 
that would have been a good idea but
that's<00:02:24.880> okay<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.180> don't<00:02:25.210> mind<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:25.960> but<00:02:26.140> they're

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
that's okay I don't mind so but they're

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.650 
that's okay I don't mind so but they're
a<00:02:26.380> bit<00:02:26.620> there<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.220> need<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.700> have<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:27.850> bit<00:02:28.240> into

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
a bit there I need to have a bit into

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.570 
a bit there I need to have a bit into

down into there like that so that I've
got<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.480> transition<00:02:41.050> now<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.230> only<00:02:41.500> issue

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
got that transition now the only issue

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
tucked and so just bring that out just a

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.600 
tucked and so just bring that out just a
little<00:02:46.300> bit<00:02:46.750> right<00:02:46.930> with<00:02:47.680> my<00:02:47.860> starfish<00:02:48.370> what

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
little bit right with my starfish what

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.040 
little bit right with my starfish what
I've<00:02:48.730> done<00:02:48.880> with<00:02:49.030> these<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.330> I've<00:02:49.510> just<00:02:49.540> wired

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
I've done with these is I've just wired

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.410 
I've done with these is I've just wired
them<00:02:50.470> like<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.490> this<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:51.970> little<00:02:52.060> bit<00:02:52.330> of

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
them like so and this a little bit of

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.730 
them like so and this a little bit of
ropey<00:02:52.720> stuff<00:02:52.930> I'm<00:02:53.050> just<00:02:53.260> gonna<00:02:53.410> leave<00:02:53.710> that

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
ropey stuff I'm just gonna leave that

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.790 
ropey stuff I'm just gonna leave that
onto<00:02:54.340> there<00:02:54.520> so<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.240> you<00:02:55.810> just<00:02:55.870> go<00:02:56.260> be<00:02:56.560> pushed

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
onto there so that you just go be pushed

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.430 
onto there so that you just go be pushed
into<00:02:57.040> there<00:02:57.400> one<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.210> side<00:02:58.600> I'll<00:02:59.140> bring

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
into there one to that side I'll bring

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.170 
into there one to that side I'll bring
one<00:02:59.500> over<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.250> side<00:03:00.520> because<00:03:00.850> it<00:03:00.970> will<00:03:01.060> be

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
one over the side because it will be

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.150 
one over the side because it will be
viewed<00:03:01.480> from<00:03:01.750> both<00:03:02.020> side<00:03:02.350> one<00:03:02.770> there<00:03:02.980> one

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
viewed from both side one there one

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.100 
viewed from both side one there one
there<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.730> I'll<00:03:04.150> bring<00:03:04.390> another<00:03:04.660> one<00:03:05.050> into

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
there and I'll bring another one into

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.540 
there and I'll bring another one into
there<00:03:05.710> like<00:03:05.740> so

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
there like so

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.240 
there like so
and<00:03:06.640> with<00:03:07.270> these<00:03:07.660> now<00:03:08.200> we<00:03:08.260> haven't<00:03:08.800> looked<00:03:09.040> at

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
and with these now we haven't looked at

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.760 
and with these now we haven't looked at
this<00:03:09.430> theory<00:03:09.790> off<00:03:09.970> very<00:03:10.510> much<00:03:10.780> but<00:03:11.110> let's

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
this theory off very much but let's

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.950 
this theory off very much but let's
bring<00:03:12.010> them<00:03:12.220> into<00:03:12.430> there<00:03:12.760> now<00:03:12.970> these<00:03:13.540> could<00:03:13.900> be

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
bring them into there now these could be

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.860 
bring them into there now these could be
wired<00:03:14.440> or<00:03:15.040> you<00:03:15.760> could<00:03:16.030> perhaps<00:03:16.240> just<00:03:16.630> have

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
wired or you could perhaps just have

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.770 
wired or you could perhaps just have
those<00:03:17.140> scattered<00:03:18.070> along<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.760> table<00:03:19.450> you

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
those scattered along the table you

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.780 
those scattered along the table you
could<00:03:19.930> perhaps<00:03:20.110> put<00:03:20.470> some<00:03:20.650> more<00:03:20.830> shelves<00:03:21.580> and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
could perhaps put some more shelves and

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.630 
could perhaps put some more shelves and
through<00:03:22.180> here<00:03:22.570> or<00:03:22.960> with<00:03:23.890> these<00:03:24.190> because<00:03:24.610> of

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
through here or with these because of

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.640 
through here or with these because of
the<00:03:24.880> way<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:25.180> they<00:03:25.360> are<00:03:25.510> shaped<00:03:25.870> they<00:03:26.410> could

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
the way that they are shaped they could

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.580 
the way that they are shaped they could
just<00:03:26.890> be<00:03:27.100> pushed<00:03:27.910> in<00:03:28.240> like<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.350> if<00:03:29.440> it's

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
just be pushed in like so and if it's

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.650 
just be pushed in like so and if it's
not<00:03:29.740> going<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.100> be<00:03:30.220> moved<00:03:30.550> it<00:03:30.910> doesn't<00:03:31.510> really

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
not going to be moved it doesn't really

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.560 
not going to be moved it doesn't really
matter<00:03:32.050> he'll<00:03:32.470> just<00:03:33.310> resting<00:03:33.880> there<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:34.210> fine

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
matter he'll just resting there is fine

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.080 
matter he'll just resting there is fine
because<00:03:34.990> usually<00:03:35.560> what<00:03:35.860> I<00:03:35.890> do<00:03:36.010> is<00:03:36.160> just<00:03:36.640> use

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
because usually what I do is just use

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.880 
because usually what I do is just use
some<00:03:37.300> new<00:03:37.540> place<00:03:37.780> usually<00:03:38.290> what<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:38.500> do<00:03:38.560> is<00:03:38.710> I

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
some new place usually what I do is I

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.740 
some new place usually what I do is I
see<00:03:39.130> at<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.280> table<00:03:39.730> that's<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.000> first<00:03:40.480> thing

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
see at the table that's the first thing

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.240 
see at the table that's the first thing
I<00:03:40.840> do<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.200> know<00:03:41.350> where<00:03:41.800> I'm<00:03:41.920> going

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
I do so I know where I'm going

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.580 
I do so I know where I'm going
and<00:03:42.430> my<00:03:42.760> theme<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.030> see<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.420> end<00:03:43.690> if<00:03:43.990> anybody

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
and my theme is see it end if anybody

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.770 
and my theme is see it end if anybody
comes<00:03:44.860> at<00:03:44.980> least<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.430> table<00:03:45.880> some<00:03:46.060> okay<00:03:46.630> now

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
comes at least the table some okay now

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.520 
comes at least the table some okay now
with<00:03:47.140> these<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:48.430> can<00:03:48.910> just<00:03:49.330> get<00:03:49.900> little<00:03:50.200> bits

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
with these you can just get little bits

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.630 
with these you can just get little bits
of<00:03:50.650> wire<00:03:50.860> this<00:03:51.070> is<00:03:51.220> what<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.400> do

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
of wire this is what I do

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.270 
of wire this is what I do
just<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.120> little<00:03:52.240> bits<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.600> wire<00:03:52.810> like<00:03:53.080> that<00:03:53.280> turn

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
just a little bits a wire like that turn

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.640 
just a little bits a wire like that turn
that<00:03:54.310> over<00:03:54.700> there<00:03:55.090> like<00:03:55.240> that<00:03:55.540> oops<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:56.230> then

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
that over there like that oops and then

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.850 
that over there like that oops and then
just<00:03:56.950> cut<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:57.700> off<00:03:57.970> here<00:03:58.510> and<00:03:59.110> if<00:03:59.410> you<00:03:59.530> wanted

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
just cut that off here and if you wanted

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.770 
just cut that off here and if you wanted
to<00:04:00.010> make<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.220> little<00:04:00.550> bit<00:04:00.730> like<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.600> then

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
to make a little bit like so and then

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.990 
to make a little bit like so and then
there<00:04:02.050> could<00:04:02.650> just<00:04:02.680> be<00:04:02.890> pushed<00:04:03.250> into<00:04:03.490> the<00:04:03.640> up

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
there could just be pushed into the up

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.630 
there could just be pushed into the up
like<00:04:04.300> so<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:05.110> hang<00:04:05.350> down<00:04:05.680> but<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.400> me<00:04:06.490> that's

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
like so to hang down but to me that's

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.600 
like so to hang down but to me that's
hanging<00:04:07.030> down<00:04:07.180> too<00:04:07.420> low<00:04:07.840> so<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.950> other<00:04:09.130> thing

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
hanging down too low so the other thing

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.900 
hanging down too low so the other thing
that<00:04:09.640> I<00:04:09.850> do<00:04:09.970> is

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
that I do is

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.650 
that I do is
taking<00:04:11.300> that<00:04:11.570> out<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:12.110> there<00:04:12.520> yet<00:04:13.520> a<00:04:13.820> satay

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
taking that out of there yet a satay

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.009 
taking that out of there yet a satay
stick<00:04:15.200> and<00:04:15.530> get<00:04:15.680> your<00:04:15.950> wire<00:04:16.430> like<00:04:17.269> this<00:04:17.690> and

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
stick and get your wire like this and

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.330 
stick and get your wire like this and
then<00:04:18.230> what<00:04:18.410> I<00:04:18.440> do<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:18.880> I've<00:04:19.880> wire<00:04:20.510> that<00:04:21.340> onto

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
then what I do is I've wire that onto

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.780 
then what I do is I've wire that onto
the<00:04:23.120> satay<00:04:23.690> stick<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:24.860> I<00:04:24.920> might<00:04:25.160> take<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:25.610> a

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
the satay stick and I might take that a

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.940 
the satay stick and I might take that a
bit<00:04:25.940> longer<00:04:26.150> take<00:04:26.390> that<00:04:26.600> to<00:04:26.780> there<00:04:27.020> and<00:04:27.380> you'll

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
bit longer take that to there and you'll

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.600 
bit longer take that to there and you'll
find<00:04:28.400> that<00:04:28.820> it's<00:04:29.270> much<00:04:29.780> much<00:04:30.260> easier<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:32.210> first

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
find that it's much much easier to first

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.920 
find that it's much much easier to first
that<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.820> today<00:04:35.000> I<00:04:35.030> don't<00:04:35.300> want<00:04:35.450> that<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:35.720> hang

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
that and today I don't want that to hang

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.750 
that and today I don't want that to hang
down<00:04:36.140> too<00:04:36.380> low<00:04:36.590> so<00:04:36.620> I'll<00:04:36.890> just<00:04:37.100> take<00:04:37.340> that<00:04:37.370> into

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
down too low so I'll just take that into

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.180 
down too low so I'll just take that into
there<00:04:38.120> like<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.510> so<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:38.960> now<00:04:39.320> I've<00:04:39.950> got<00:04:40.160> a

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
there like that so that now I've got a

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.280 
there like that so that now I've got a
wee<00:04:40.370> bit<00:04:40.520> more<00:04:40.730> control<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.810> other<00:04:41.990> thing

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
wee bit more control the other thing

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.930 
wee bit more control the other thing
that<00:04:42.320> I<00:04:42.470> sometimes<00:04:42.770> do<00:04:43.130> is<00:04:43.250> take<00:04:43.520> that<00:04:43.550> off

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
that I sometimes do is take that off

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.810 
that I sometimes do is take that off
there<00:04:44.270> get<00:04:44.810> a<00:04:44.840> thorough<00:04:45.170> stick<00:04:45.770> push<00:04:46.400> that

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
there get a thorough stick push that

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.330 
there get a thorough stick push that
into<00:04:47.210> there<00:04:47.600> like<00:04:47.690> that<00:04:48.230> and<00:04:48.530> then<00:04:48.950> just<00:04:49.070> push

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
into there like that and then just push

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.340 
into there like that and then just push
them<00:04:49.520> down<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:49.970> amongst<00:04:50.390> the<00:04:50.540> foliage<00:04:50.720> so

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
them down and amongst the foliage so

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.570 
them down and amongst the foliage so
that<00:04:51.560> they<00:04:51.680> all<00:04:51.830> look<00:04:52.040> like<00:04:52.190> they're<00:04:52.340> meant<00:04:52.520> to

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
that they all look like they're meant to

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.330 
that they all look like they're meant to
be<00:04:52.640> so<00:04:53.180> now<00:04:53.330> I've<00:04:53.480> only<00:04:53.810> got<00:04:54.170> four<00:04:54.500> of<00:04:54.530> these<00:04:54.830> so

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
be so now I've only got four of these so

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.950 
be so now I've only got four of these so
what<00:04:55.580> I've<00:04:55.700> done<00:04:55.850> on<00:04:55.910> that<00:04:56.060> side<00:04:56.240> I'm<00:04:56.660> going<00:04:56.870> to

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
what I've done on that side I'm going to

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.450 
what I've done on that side I'm going to
repeat<00:04:57.290> on<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.650> other<00:04:57.680> and<00:04:57.950> I'll<00:04:58.010> just<00:04:58.220> show

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
repeat on the other and I'll just show
