willing to work for it now I'm using it

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.160 
willing to work for it now I'm using it
a<00:00:56.100> bit<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.610> PvE<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.510> test<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.050> out

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
a bit here in PvE just to test it out

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.069 
a bit here in PvE just to test it out
and<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.399> assumed<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.239> wouldn't<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.690> that

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and as I assumed it wouldn't be that

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.380 
and as I assumed it wouldn't be that
great<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:02.309> necessarily<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.210> say

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
great for it it's not necessarily to say

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.810 
great for it it's not necessarily to say
that<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.750> bad<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.379> PvE<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.670> one

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
that it's bad for PvE it's just not one

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.700 
that it's bad for PvE it's just not one
of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> best<00:01:06.270> PvE<00:01:06.689> guns<00:01:07.140> out<00:01:07.350> there<00:01:07.380> you're

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.109 
of the best PvE guns out there you're
gonna<00:01:07.799> find<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.130> lot<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.310> better<00:01:08.580> ones<00:01:08.850> but

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
gonna find a lot of better ones but

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.370 
gonna find a lot of better ones but
that's<00:01:09.270> not<00:01:09.420> really<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> big<00:01:10.020> deal<00:01:10.200> because

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that's not really a big deal because

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.109 
that's not really a big deal because

PvP gun is a bit tricky and destiny

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.350 
PvP gun is a bit tricky and destiny
especially<00:01:20.250> since<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.700> many<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.150> gun

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
especially since so many of the gun

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.570 
especially since so many of the gun
drops<00:01:21.659> are<00:01:22.049> RNG<00:01:22.770> based<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.220> one<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.549> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
drops are RNG based this one is a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.880 
drops are RNG based this one is a
guaranteed<00:01:24.150> thing<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.990> very<00:01:25.439> good

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
guaranteed thing and it's a very good

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.399 
guaranteed thing and it's a very good
PvP<00:01:26.490> gun<00:01:26.820> believe<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:27.479> not<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.810> optic<00:01:28.170> type

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
PvP gun believe it or not the optic type

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.260

that<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.799> pick<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.340> weapon<00:01:29.790> actually

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
that you pick for your weapon actually

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.569 
that you pick for your weapon actually
does<00:01:30.509> change<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.200> performance<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:32.280> gun

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
does change the performance of your gun

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.240 
does change the performance of your gun
so<00:01:32.909> here<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.840> three<00:01:34.259> choices<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:35.070> first

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
so here we have three choices the first

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.120 
so here we have three choices the first
scope<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.210> red<00:01:36.509> dot<00:01:36.720> oh<00:01:36.930> rs1<00:01:37.860> it's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
scope here is the red dot oh rs1 it's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.950 
scope here is the red dot oh rs1 it's
what<00:01:38.280> I'm<00:01:38.369> using<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.060> clip<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.630> it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
what I'm using in this clip and it

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.590 
what I'm using in this clip and it
magnifies<00:01:40.200> your<00:01:40.770> scope<00:01:41.009> by<00:01:41.220> point<00:01:41.670> four<00:01:42.210> so

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
magnifies your scope by point four so

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.810 
magnifies your scope by point four so
that's<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.020> 40%<00:01:43.920> zoom<00:01:44.250> when<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.579> aim<00:01:44.790> down

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
that's like a 40% zoom when you aim down

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.010 
that's like a 40% zoom when you aim down
sights<00:01:45.329> with<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.659> gun

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
sights with this gun

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.440 
sights with this gun
it<00:01:46.320> also<00:01:46.439> has<00:01:46.770> increased<00:01:47.399> range<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.240> your

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
it also has increased range so your

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.749 
it also has increased range so your
damage<00:01:48.840> drop-off<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.590> furthered<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.340> your

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
damage drop-off is furthered and your

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.270 
damage drop-off is furthered and your
stability<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.509> improved<00:01:51.930> by<00:01:52.140> 6<00:01:52.560> points<00:01:52.860> now

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
stability is improved by 6 points now

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.740 
stability is improved by 6 points now
we're<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.549> really<00:01:53.759> sure<00:01:53.970> how<00:01:54.270> much<00:01:54.540> your

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
we're not really sure how much your

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.139 
we're not really sure how much your
stability<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.259> improved<00:01:55.619> by<00:01:55.829> 6<00:01:56.430> points<00:01:56.670> or<00:01:56.969> 10

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
stability is improved by 6 points or 10

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.910 
stability is improved by 6 points or 10
points<00:01:57.360> or<00:01:57.600> twelve<00:01:57.810> points<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
points or twelve points it's just a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.440 
points or twelve points it's just a
number<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.579> still<00:01:59.880> got<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
number but it still got one of the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.660 
number but it still got one of the
better<00:02:00.630> stability<00:02:01.070> improvements<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.430> next

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
better stability improvements the next

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.999 
better stability improvements the next
scope<00:02:02.880> unlock<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.719> sure-shot<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.710> this

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
scope unlock is the sure-shot is this

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.709 
scope unlock is the sure-shot is this
only<00:02:05.159> gives<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.640> stability<00:02:06.149> improvement

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
only gives you a stability improvement

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.080 
only gives you a stability improvement
of<00:02:06.869> two<00:02:07.110> points<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.099> gives<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> reload

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
of two points but it gives you a reload

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.890 
of two points but it gives you a reload
bonus<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.690> 12<00:02:10.050> points<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.649> handling<00:02:11.250> bonus

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
bonus of 12 points and a handling bonus

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.679 
bonus of 12 points and a handling bonus
12<00:02:12.079> points<00:02:12.530> now<00:02:13.010> reload<00:02:13.670> obviously<00:02:14.239> increases

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:14.689 
12 points now reload obviously increases

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.600 
12 points now reload obviously increases
the<00:02:14.810> reload<00:02:15.110> speed<00:02:15.439> of<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.709> gun<00:02:15.860> handling

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
the reload speed of the gun handling

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.699 
the reload speed of the gun handling
increases<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.629> speed<00:02:17.900> at<00:02:18.110> which<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.560> can

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
increases the speed at which you can

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.009 
increases the speed at which you can
basically<00:02:19.010> aim<00:02:19.579> down<00:02:19.819> sights<00:02:20.269> so<00:02:20.659> it's<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.870> bit

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
basically aim down sights so it's a bit

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.199 
basically aim down sights so it's a bit
snappier<00:02:21.739> feeling<00:02:22.250> when<00:02:22.370> you're<00:02:22.489> a<00:02:22.519> de-essing

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
snappier feeling when you're a de-essing

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.149 
snappier feeling when you're a de-essing
which<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.689> great<00:02:23.930> for<00:02:24.200> basically<00:02:24.739> twitch

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
which is great for basically twitch

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.789 
which is great for basically twitch
reflexes<00:02:25.849> in<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.120> PvP<00:02:26.720> or<00:02:26.750> multiplayer<00:02:27.470> game

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
reflexes in a PvP or multiplayer game

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.190 
reflexes in a PvP or multiplayer game
and<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.250> also<00:02:28.579> slightly<00:02:28.879> decreases<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.989> time

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
and it also slightly decreases the time

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.170 
and it also slightly decreases the time
it<00:02:30.349> takes<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.769> draw<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.129> weapon<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.790> to

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
it takes to draw the weapon and to

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.520 
it takes to draw the weapon and to
holster<00:02:32.659> the<00:02:32.780> weapon<00:02:33.109> when<00:02:33.290> switching

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
holster the weapon when switching

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.890 
holster the weapon when switching
between<00:02:33.769> guns<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.670> last<00:02:34.909> of<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.269> three<00:02:35.299> scope

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.520 
between guns the last of the three scope
choices<00:02:36.470> is<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.859> ranged<00:02:37.340> lens<00:02:37.819> our<00:02:38.209> ls3<00:02:39.200> this

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
choices is the ranged lens our ls3 this

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.259 
choices is the ranged lens our ls3 this
gives<00:02:39.739> you<00:02:39.859> a<00:02:39.890> point<00:02:40.220> six<00:02:40.579> times<00:02:40.849> scope

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
gives you a point six times scope

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.179 
gives you a point six times scope
modifier<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.260> improves<00:02:42.590> your<00:02:42.680> range<00:02:42.980> by

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:43.189 
modifier that improves your range by

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.069 
modifier that improves your range by
eight<00:02:43.459> points<00:02:43.909> your<00:02:44.090> stability<00:02:44.599> by<00:02:44.780> three

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
eight points your stability by three

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.990 
eight points your stability by three
points<00:02:45.440> but<00:02:45.769> it<00:02:45.920> lowers<00:02:46.250> your<00:02:46.280> reload<00:02:46.730> speed

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
points but it lowers your reload speed

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.180 
points but it lowers your reload speed
by<00:02:47.180> two<00:02:47.239> points<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.079> handling<00:02:48.590> by<00:02:48.739> seven

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
by two points and handling by seven

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.860 
by two points and handling by seven
points<00:02:49.340> personally<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.030> think<00:02:50.209> this<00:02:50.629> scope

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
points personally I think this scope

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.300 
points personally I think this scope
doesn't<00:02:51.260> really<00:02:51.440> have<00:02:51.620> much<00:02:51.799> of<00:02:51.829> a<00:02:52.010> point

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
doesn't really have much of a point

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.280 
doesn't really have much of a point
being<00:02:52.519> on<00:02:52.670> this<00:02:52.819> gun<00:02:53.000> because<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.810> recoil<00:02:53.959> on

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
being on this gun because the recoil on

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.830 
being on this gun because the recoil on
the<00:02:54.409> gun<00:02:54.590> although<00:02:55.010> not<00:02:55.340> terrible<00:02:56.209> just<00:02:56.480> isn't

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
the gun although not terrible just isn't

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.899 
the gun although not terrible just isn't
going<00:02:57.049> to<00:02:57.139> hold<00:02:57.260> up<00:02:57.470> at<00:02:57.620> longer<00:02:57.889> ranges<00:02:58.400> anyway

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
going to hold up at longer ranges anyway

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.490 
going to hold up at longer ranges anyway
so<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.209> may<00:02:59.389> as<00:02:59.510> well<00:02:59.569> just<00:02:59.810> ignore<00:03:00.290> this

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
so you may as well just ignore this

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.649 
so you may as well just ignore this
optic<00:03:00.920> of<00:03:01.099> the<00:03:01.400> three<00:03:01.639> choices<00:03:01.849> I<00:03:02.269> like<00:03:02.480> the

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
optic of the three choices I like the

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.199 
optic of the three choices I like the
sure-shot<00:03:03.139> is<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.920> most<00:03:04.220> it's<00:03:04.459> snappy<00:03:05.000> for

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
sure-shot is the most it's snappy for

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.089 
sure-shot is the most it's snappy for
PvP<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:05.989> doesn't<00:03:06.290> really<00:03:06.409> obstruct<00:03:06.950> the

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
PvP and it doesn't really obstruct the

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.280 
PvP and it doesn't really obstruct the
screen<00:03:07.400> too<00:03:07.609> much<00:03:07.849> and<00:03:08.030> speaking<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.629> PvP<00:03:09.019> I've

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
screen too much and speaking of PvP I've

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.110 
screen too much and speaking of PvP I've
switched<00:03:09.530> over<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:09.889> system<00:03:10.189> gameplay<00:03:10.760> here

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
switched over to system gameplay here

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.179 
switched over to system gameplay here
this<00:03:11.299> is<00:03:11.450> actually<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:12.019> iron<00:03:12.349> banner<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:13.129> a

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
this is actually the iron banner and a

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.339 
this is actually the iron banner and a
lot<00:03:13.370> of<00:03:13.400> this<00:03:13.639> is<00:03:13.819> up<00:03:13.939> against<00:03:14.299> really<00:03:14.750> really

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
lot of this is up against really really

little we see that I can get up to 20
percent<00:04:29.890> more<00:04:30.400> accurate<00:04:31.060> however<00:04:31.270> I'm<00:04:31.540> not

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
percent more accurate however I'm not

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.690 
percent more accurate however I'm not
really<00:04:31.840> sure<00:04:32.170> what<00:04:32.470> more<00:04:32.680> accurate<00:04:33.190> means<00:04:33.460> I

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
really sure what more accurate means I

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.450 
really sure what more accurate means I
assume<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.480> means<00:04:34.660> slightly<00:04:35.470> less<00:04:35.710> recoil<00:04:35.980> so

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
assume it means slightly less recoil so

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.490 
assume it means slightly less recoil so
the<00:04:36.580> longer<00:04:36.940> you<00:04:36.970> shoot<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.660> less<00:04:37.900> recoil<00:04:38.170> you

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
the longer you shoot the less recoil you

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.560 
the longer you shoot the less recoil you
have<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.800> deal<00:04:38.980> with<00:04:39.010> overall<00:04:39.580> not<00:04:39.910> that<00:04:40.150> great

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
have to deal with overall not that great

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.030 
have to deal with overall not that great
of<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:40.780> modifier<00:04:41.260> but<00:04:41.530> better<00:04:41.770> than<00:04:41.860> nothing

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
of a modifier but better than nothing

it's useful but there are a ton of

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.300 
it's useful but there are a ton of
better<00:05:55.750> modifiers<00:05:56.350> out<00:05:56.710> there<00:05:56.920> which<00:05:57.100> leads

better modifiers out there which leads

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.920 
better modifiers out there which leads
me<00:05:57.520> to<00:05:57.550> believe<00:05:57.730> that<00:05:57.880> it<00:05:58.090> would<00:05:58.300> not<00:05:58.480> be<00:05:58.540> too

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
me to believe that it would not be too

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.380 
me to believe that it would not be too
hard<00:05:59.200> to<00:05:59.290> find<00:05:59.590> a<00:05:59.740> much<00:05:59.920> better<00:06:00.250> shadow<00:06:01.030> price

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
hard to find a much better shadow price

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.870 
hard to find a much better shadow price
out<00:06:01.630> there<00:06:01.660> just<00:06:02.080> as<00:06:02.200> a<00:06:02.320> random<00:06:02.830> drop<00:06:03.220> and<00:06:03.610> I'm

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
out there just as a random drop and I'm

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.790 
out there just as a random drop and I'm
kind<00:06:04.150> of<00:06:04.210> excited<00:06:04.390> to<00:06:04.780> see<00:06:05.020> what<00:06:05.320> potential

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
kind of excited to see what potential

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.220 
kind of excited to see what potential
shadow<00:06:06.280> price<00:06:06.610> drops<00:06:07.000> I<00:06:07.180> might<00:06:07.390> get<00:06:07.630> over<00:06:07.870> the

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230 
shadow price drops I might get over the

shadow price drops I might get over the
lifetime<00:06:08.500> of<00:06:08.770> playing<00:06:09.040> this<00:06:09.340> game<00:06:09.430> now<00:06:10.000> I

lifetime of playing this game now I

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.760 
lifetime of playing this game now I
really<00:06:10.540> like<00:06:10.810> the<00:06:10.990> idea<00:06:11.320> that<00:06:11.380> you<00:06:11.620> can

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
really like the idea that you can

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.230 
really like the idea that you can
actually<00:06:11.950> get<00:06:12.280> some<00:06:12.340> incredibly<00:06:13.120> good

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
actually get some incredibly good

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.240 
actually get some incredibly good
legendary<00:06:14.020> guns<00:06:14.260> based<00:06:14.560> on<00:06:14.740> the<00:06:14.860> drops<00:06:15.160> that

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
legendary guns based on the drops that

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.160 
legendary guns based on the drops that
you<00:06:15.400> might<00:06:15.700> find<00:06:16.060> the<00:06:16.270> only<00:06:16.480> problem<00:06:16.870> is<00:06:16.960> that

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.170 
you might find the only problem is that

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.160 
you might find the only problem is that
legendary<00:06:17.770> drops<00:06:18.130> are<00:06:18.400> just<00:06:18.820> so<00:06:19.170> infrequent

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
legendary drops are just so infrequent

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.140 
legendary drops are just so infrequent
in<00:06:20.380> this<00:06:20.590> game<00:06:20.830> so<00:06:21.370> getting<00:06:21.850> not<00:06:22.120> only

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
in this game so getting not only

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.570 
in this game so getting not only
