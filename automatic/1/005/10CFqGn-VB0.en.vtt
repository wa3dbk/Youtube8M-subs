actually<00:00:38.809> didn't<00:00:39.170> forget<00:00:39.410> about<00:00:39.470> this<00:00:39.860> guy

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
actually didn't forget about this guy

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.189 
actually didn't forget about this guy
but<00:00:40.309> I<00:00:40.550> guess<00:00:41.360> I<00:00:41.449> actually<00:00:41.600> did<00:00:41.870> forget<00:00:42.140> about

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
but I guess I actually did forget about

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.500 
but I guess I actually did forget about
this<00:00:42.470> guy<00:00:42.559> because<00:00:42.949> I<00:00:43.460> was<00:00:43.970> gonna<00:00:44.180> do<00:00:44.390> him

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
this guy because I was gonna do him

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.150 
this guy because I was gonna do him
right<00:00:44.750> after<00:00:44.989> I'd<00:00:45.290> done<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.620> other<00:00:45.739> figures

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
right after I'd done the other figures

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.799 
right after I'd done the other figures
but<00:00:46.370> then<00:00:46.520> I<00:00:46.610> ended<00:00:46.850> up<00:00:46.940> doing<00:00:47.180> something<00:00:47.510> else

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
but then I ended up doing something else

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.369 
but then I ended up doing something else
I<00:00:48.050> don't<00:00:48.110> know<00:00:48.260> what<00:00:48.470> it<00:00:48.590> was<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.480> I<00:00:50.480> basically

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
I don't know what it was and I basically

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.439 
I don't know what it was and I basically
somehow<00:00:52.220> this<00:00:52.370> guy<00:00:52.550> got<00:00:52.760> omitted<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:53.420> I

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
somehow this guy got omitted so I

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.210 
somehow this guy got omitted so I
figured<00:00:53.750> I'd<00:00:53.840> go<00:00:53.989> back<00:00:54.140> do<00:00:54.440> a<00:00:54.470> review<00:00:54.800> of<00:00:54.860> him

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
figured I'd go back do a review of him

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.759 
figured I'd go back do a review of him
and<00:00:56.089> I<00:00:56.269> also<00:00:56.390> would<00:00:56.659> do<00:00:56.780> a<00:00:56.809> comparison<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:57.589> you

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
and I also would do a comparison so you

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.079 
and I also would do a comparison so you
guys<00:00:57.890> can<00:00:58.070> see<00:00:58.220> the<00:00:58.339> difference<00:00:58.370> between<00:00:58.820> the

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
guys can see the difference between the

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.119 
guys can see the difference between the
two<00:00:59.330> before<00:01:00.050> I<00:01:00.229> do<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:00.500> comparison<00:01:01.040> and

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
two before I do the comparison and

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.920 
two before I do the comparison and
before<00:01:01.400> we<00:01:01.489> look<00:01:01.699> at<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:01.879> figure<00:01:02.210> let's<00:01:02.720> get<00:01:02.900> a

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.810 
said I mean it's the exact same mold
there's<00:04:08.100> nothing<00:04:08.400> different

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
there's nothing different

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.430 
there's nothing different
with<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.240> figures<00:04:09.570> at<00:04:09.720> all<00:04:10.490> exactly<00:04:11.490> the<00:04:11.730> same

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
with the figures at all exactly the same

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.650 
with the figures at all exactly the same
one<00:04:13.440> thing<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.710> did<00:04:13.860> actually<00:04:14.040> realize<00:04:14.850> after<00:04:15.630> I

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
one thing I did actually realize after I

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.760 
one thing I did actually realize after I
did<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.870> review<00:04:16.109> of<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.320> yellow<00:04:16.530> costume

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
did a review of the yellow costume

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.770 
did a review of the yellow costume
Wolverine<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.670> I<00:04:18.030> think<00:04:18.239> somebody<00:04:18.630> actually

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
Wolverine and I think somebody actually

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.620 
Wolverine and I think somebody actually
pointed<00:04:19.290> it<00:04:19.380> out<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.530> me<00:04:19.770> and<00:04:20.330> I'm<00:04:21.330> a<00:04:21.480> little

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
pointed it out to me and I'm a little

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.050 
pointed it out to me and I'm a little
slow<00:04:22.020> some<00:04:22.320> time<00:04:22.530> so<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:22.860> didn't<00:04:23.160> quite<00:04:23.400> see<00:04:24.030> it

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
slow some time so I didn't quite see it

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.950 
slow some time so I didn't quite see it
right<00:04:24.450> away

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
right away

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.580 
right away
but<00:04:26.360> kind<00:04:27.360> of<00:04:27.480> sucks<00:04:27.720> that<00:04:27.780> his<00:04:28.020> shoulder<00:04:28.380> pads

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
but kind of sucks that his shoulder pads

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.320 
but kind of sucks that his shoulder pads
aren't<00:04:28.860> further<00:04:29.220> out<00:04:29.460> on<00:04:29.670> this<00:04:29.790> Wolverine

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
aren't further out on this Wolverine

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.110 
aren't further out on this Wolverine
and<00:04:30.540> then<00:04:31.350> obviously<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:32.040> mean<00:04:32.430> if<00:04:32.550> you<00:04:32.640> read<00:04:32.790> if

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
and then obviously I mean if you read if

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.250 
and then obviously I mean if you read if
you<00:04:33.240> read<00:04:33.390> the<00:04:33.510> comics<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:33.960> know<00:04:34.110> the

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
you read the comics and you know the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.050 
you read the comics and you know the
other<00:04:34.320> Wolverine<00:04:34.800> figures<00:04:35.250> these<00:04:35.670> shoulder

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
other Wolverine figures these shoulder

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.640 
other Wolverine figures these shoulder
pads<00:04:36.090> should<00:04:36.600> be<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:36.780> little<00:04:36.960> further<00:04:37.050> out<00:04:37.470> they

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
pads should be a little further out they

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.470 
pads should be a little further out they
shouldn't<00:04:37.860> be<00:04:37.920> as<00:04:38.010> far<00:04:38.310> up<00:04:38.490> on<00:04:38.670> his<00:04:39.000> neck<00:04:39.300> as

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
shouldn't be as far up on his neck as

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.530 
shouldn't be as far up on his neck as
they<00:04:39.630> are<00:04:40.460> but<00:04:41.460> I<00:04:41.730> didn't<00:04:41.970> realize<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.300> until

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
they are but I didn't realize that until

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.430 
they are but I didn't realize that until
after<00:04:42.750> I'd<00:04:43.020> done<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.260> review<00:04:43.590> of<00:04:43.620> him<00:04:45.440> one

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
after I'd done the review of him one

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.100 
after I'd done the review of him one
that<00:04:46.590> one<00:04:46.830> funny<00:04:47.280> thing<00:04:47.370> is<00:04:47.820> with<00:04:48.270> I<00:04:48.419> find<00:04:48.960> the

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
that one funny thing is with I find the

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.340 
that one funny thing is with I find the
character

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
character

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.840 
character
obviously<00:04:50.740> they've<00:04:50.890> swapped<00:04:51.220> in<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.580> black

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
obviously they've swapped in the black

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.430 
obviously they've swapped in the black
to<00:04:52.120> like<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.390> yellow<00:04:52.600> and<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.870> black<00:04:53.050> on<00:04:53.260> this

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
to like the yellow and the black on this

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.290 
to like the yellow and the black on this
Wolverine<00:04:53.650> they've<00:04:54.370> also<00:04:54.580> put<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.940> red<00:04:55.090> eyes

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
Wolverine they've also put the red eyes

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.770 
Wolverine they've also put the red eyes
in<00:04:55.570> which<00:04:55.900> I<00:04:56.080> think<00:04:56.260> is<00:04:56.380> interesting<00:04:57.630> he's<00:04:58.630> not

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
in which I think is interesting he's not

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.330 
in which I think is interesting he's not
really<00:04:59.020> well<00:04:59.230> evil<00:04:59.620> Wolverines<00:05:00.130> I'm

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
really well evil Wolverines I'm

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.890 
really well evil Wolverines I'm
surprised<00:05:00.700> that<00:05:00.730> he<00:05:01.000> has<00:05:01.120> red<00:05:01.390> eyes<00:05:01.540> but

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
surprised that he has red eyes but

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.130 
surprised that he has red eyes but
anyways<00:05:03.090> one<00:05:04.090> thing<00:05:04.300> I<00:05:04.390> found<00:05:04.570> funny<00:05:04.900> though

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
anyways one thing I found funny though

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.610 
anyways one thing I found funny though
and<00:05:05.670> it's<00:05:06.670> it's<00:05:07.030> interesting<00:05:07.300> it<00:05:07.660> seems<00:05:07.870> the

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
and it's it's interesting it seems the

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.320 
and it's it's interesting it seems the
moment<00:05:09.100> Wolverine<00:05:09.550> goes<00:05:09.820> for<00:05:10.060> a<00:05:10.090> black

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
moment Wolverine goes for a black

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.740 
moment Wolverine goes for a black
costume<00:05:11.580> somehow<00:05:12.580> his<00:05:12.850> skin<00:05:13.210> changes<00:05:13.690> color

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
costume somehow his skin changes color

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.200 
costume somehow his skin changes color
too<00:05:14.140> because<00:05:14.380> as<00:05:14.500> you<00:05:14.620> can<00:05:14.740> see<00:05:14.980> there's<00:05:15.910> a<00:05:16.030> big

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
too because as you can see there's a big

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.830 
too because as you can see there's a big
difference<00:05:16.240> in<00:05:16.690> in<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:17.110> color<00:05:17.290> of<00:05:17.470> his<00:05:17.560> skin<00:05:17.620> I

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
difference in in the color of his skin I

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.960 
difference in in the color of his skin I
almost<00:05:19.840> actually<00:05:20.110> prefer<00:05:20.650> the<00:05:20.830> skin<00:05:21.280> tone<00:05:21.700> on

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
almost actually prefer the skin tone on

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.440 
almost actually prefer the skin tone on
the<00:05:22.000> black<00:05:22.510> Wolverine<00:05:23.080> versus<00:05:24.070> the<00:05:24.300> yellow<00:05:25.300> I

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
the black Wolverine versus the yellow I

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.830 
the black Wolverine versus the yellow I
find<00:05:25.900> the<00:05:26.020> yellows<00:05:26.380> just<00:05:26.650> a<00:05:26.740> little<00:05:26.980> too<00:05:27.160> pink

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
find the yellows just a little too pink

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.270 
find the yellows just a little too pink
skin<00:05:28.840> tones<00:05:29.050> a<00:05:29.140> little<00:05:29.170> too<00:05:29.440> pink<00:05:29.740> would<00:05:30.190> have

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
skin tones a little too pink would have

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.070 
skin tones a little too pink would have
been<00:05:30.370> nice<00:05:30.520> if<00:05:30.670> maybe<00:05:30.790> they<00:05:31.030> put<00:05:31.330> this<00:05:31.510> skin

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
been nice if maybe they put this skin

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.970 
been nice if maybe they put this skin
color<00:05:32.320> on<00:05:32.530> this<00:05:33.010> Wolverine<00:05:34.290> but<00:05:35.290> that's<00:05:35.800> not<00:05:35.950> a

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
color on this Wolverine but that's not a

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.880 
color on this Wolverine but that's not a
big<00:05:36.190> deal<00:05:36.870> but<00:05:37.870> so<00:05:38.080> I<00:05:38.110> mean<00:05:38.500> there<00:05:38.620> you<00:05:38.740> have<00:05:38.860> a

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
big deal but so I mean there you have a

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.010 
big deal but so I mean there you have a
comparison<00:05:39.640> on<00:05:39.790> the<00:05:39.880> two<00:05:40.090> just<00:05:40.390> so<00:05:40.540> in<00:05:40.810> case

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
comparison on the two just so in case

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.690 
comparison on the two just so in case
somebody<00:05:41.350> asked<00:05:41.710> you<00:05:41.920> know<00:05:42.040> can<00:05:42.400> you<00:05:42.490> show

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
somebody asked you know can you show

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.790 
somebody asked you know can you show
both<00:05:43.000> of<00:05:43.030> them<00:05:43.330> so<00:05:43.900> there<00:05:44.230> you<00:05:44.350> go

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
both of them so there you go

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.650 
both of them so there you go
I'll<00:05:45.070> move<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.580> yellow<00:05:45.730> costume<00:05:46.060> Wolverine

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
I'll move the yellow costume Wolverine

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.270 
I'll move the yellow costume Wolverine
out<00:05:46.870> of<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.110> way<00:05:47.470> because<00:05:47.800> you've<00:05:47.950> got<00:05:48.100> to<00:05:48.190> go

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
out of the way because you've got to go

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.100 
out of the way because you've got to go
fight<00:05:48.550> I<00:05:48.910> think<00:05:49.390> it's<00:05:49.600> got<00:05:49.720> to<00:05:49.750> go<00:05:49.840> fight<00:05:50.080> crime

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
fight I think it's got to go fight crime

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.130 
fight I think it's got to go fight crime
or<00:05:50.500> something<00:05:51.000> and<00:05:52.000> then<00:05:52.210> if<00:05:52.330> we<00:05:52.480> have<00:05:52.690> a<00:05:52.960> look

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
or something and then if we have a look

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.220

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
I mentioned with the Wolverine the

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.500 
I mentioned with the Wolverine the
yellow<00:06:21.040> caution<00:06:21.280> Wolverine<00:06:21.790> I'm<00:06:21.910> not<00:06:22.030> not

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
yellow caution Wolverine I'm not not

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.030 
yellow caution Wolverine I'm not not
sure<00:06:22.540> why<00:06:22.960> they<00:06:23.170> really<00:06:23.380> need<00:06:23.530> to<00:06:23.560> open<00:06:23.950> his

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
sure why they really need to open his

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.310 
sure why they really need to open his
hand<00:06:24.310> like<00:06:24.490> that<00:06:24.700> I<00:06:24.910> mean<00:06:25.540> unless<00:06:25.810> Wolverines

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
hand like that I mean unless Wolverines

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.440 
hand like that I mean unless Wolverines
holding<00:06:26.800> a<00:06:26.860> beverage<00:06:27.220> maybe<00:06:27.820> if<00:06:28.000> he's<00:06:28.180> thirsty

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
holding a beverage maybe if he's thirsty

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.810 
holding a beverage maybe if he's thirsty
just<00:06:28.900> doesn't<00:06:29.890> make<00:06:29.980> much<00:06:30.130> sense<00:06:30.160> to<00:06:30.490> me<00:06:30.670> that

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
just doesn't make much sense to me that

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.220 
just doesn't make much sense to me that
they<00:06:30.970> would<00:06:31.150> need<00:06:31.270> to<00:06:31.330> open<00:06:31.450> his<00:06:31.780> hand<00:06:32.020> like

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
they would need to open his hand like

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.030 
they would need to open his hand like
that

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
that

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.670 
that
he<00:06:33.340> has<00:06:33.430> articulation<00:06:34.120> in<00:06:34.240> the<00:06:34.330> torso<00:06:34.570> and<00:06:34.990> his

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
he has articulation in the torso and his

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.570 
he has articulation in the torso and his
waist<00:06:35.980> in<00:06:36.280> his<00:06:36.730> legs<00:06:37.260> by<00:06:38.260> two<00:06:39.070> points<00:06:39.400> in<00:06:39.490> the

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
waist in his legs by two points in the

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.780 
waist in his legs by two points in the
knee<00:06:39.760> his<00:06:40.540> foot<00:06:40.960> and<00:06:41.140> also<00:06:41.350> his<00:06:41.590> toe<00:06:41.890> so<00:06:42.550> the

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
knee his foot and also his toe so the

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.580 
knee his foot and also his toe so the
exact<00:06:43.120> same<00:06:43.390> as<00:06:43.630> the<00:06:43.780> other<00:06:43.810> Wolverine<00:06:44.410> there

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
exact same as the other Wolverine there

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.820 
exact same as the other Wolverine there
is<00:06:44.710> nothing<00:06:45.130> different<00:06:45.340> about<00:06:45.700> it<00:06:45.990> but<00:06:46.990> do<00:06:47.770> I

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
is nothing different about it but do I

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.120 
is nothing different about it but do I
like<00:06:48.130> this<00:06:48.370> character<00:06:48.700> yes<00:06:49.240> I<00:06:49.420> did<00:06:50.100> well<00:06:51.100> I

like this character yes I did well I

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.860 
like this character yes I did well I
have<00:06:51.340> him<00:06:51.490> probably<00:06:51.790> on<00:06:51.910> display<00:06:52.270> it's<00:06:52.660> very

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
have him probably on display it's very

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.380

repaint and had he not been in the
comics<00:06:58.900> I<00:06:59.020> probably<00:06:59.380> might<00:06:59.620> not<00:06:59.770> have<00:06:59.890> picked

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.130
