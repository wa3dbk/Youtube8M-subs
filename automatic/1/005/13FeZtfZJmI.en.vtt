expensive<00:00:39.260> for<00:00:40.039> money<00:00:40.309> for<00:00:41.149> a<00:00:41.179> pack<00:00:41.449> that<00:00:41.479> only

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
expensive for money for a pack that only

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.040 
expensive for money for a pack that only
contains<00:00:42.140> one<00:00:42.530> rare<00:00:43.129> card<00:00:43.519> the<00:00:44.359> whole<00:00:44.600> pack<00:00:44.870> is

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
contains one rare card the whole pack is

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.869 
contains one rare card the whole pack is
basically<00:00:45.649> a<00:00:45.679> player<00:00:46.039> pack<00:00:46.309> there<00:00:46.609> is<00:00:46.729> no

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
basically a player pack there is no

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.379 
basically a player pack there is no
contracts<00:00:47.539> no<00:00:48.159> kids<00:00:49.159> no<00:00:49.789> consumer<00:00:50.239> was

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:50.389 
contracts no kids no consumer was

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:55.119 
contracts no kids no consumer was
basically<00:00:50.780> only<00:00:51.499> plays<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:53.649> move<00:00:54.649> on<00:00:54.829> you<00:00:54.920> want

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
basically only plays so move on you want

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.979 
basically only plays so move on you want
a<00:00:55.190> red<00:00:55.339> card<00:00:55.609> so<00:00:55.909> the<00:00:56.149> chance<00:00:56.539> of<00:00:56.659> getting<00:00:56.719> a

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
a red card so the chance of getting a

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.949 
a red card so the chance of getting a
really<00:00:57.289> good<00:00:57.440> player<00:00:57.679> is<00:00:57.920> very<00:00:58.719> unlikely<00:00:59.719> and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:01.959 
really good player is very unlikely and

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:06.910 
really good player is very unlikely and
since<00:01:02.959> it's<00:01:03.170> really<00:01:03.499> expensive<00:01:04.089> even<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:06.770> can

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
since it's really expensive even you can

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.520 
since it's really expensive even you can
only<00:01:07.070> open<00:01:07.340> free<00:01:07.909> free<00:01:08.420> packs<00:01:09.070> so<00:01:11.289> hopefully<00:01:12.289> i

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
only open free free packs so hopefully i

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.039 
only open free free packs so hopefully i
