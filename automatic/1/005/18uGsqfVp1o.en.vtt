00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.980
 in the marble more or less on the veil 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.059
 tomorrow 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.639
 not bad 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.639
 after 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.679
 when I was 14 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:22.249
 this time it's done my daughter we try to examine them 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.640
 achieve it 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.640
 but when you arrive is what is 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.930
 if this trend a new 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.930
 it's difficult because it's 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.740
 and M 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.140
 he is uncertain 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.710
 it's not in reality 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.710
 that's it 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.440
 the first difficulty because she went to see p 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.990
 it is the focus after cancer the coach of the elephants a school year m 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.040
 according to his intervention 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.040
 everything remains a fruitful work 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.030
 contract access 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.710
 she even wrote a summer internship 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.210
 but it's still two sets everywhere 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.650
 m still a few weeks because it's done 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.740
 it's the same time 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.330
 in that case 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.729
 the selection is probably not the case in the past this season 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:35.939
 the biggest difficulty 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.170
 cCN 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.170
 I do not speak of rigor 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.030
 mba who had done most of the others 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.300
 therefore prices this season 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.420
 5 in ten years is rare 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.509
 in the audience we landed 7 67% away from the hand m but when I got to 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:00.480
 school 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.650
 no friends 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.770
 what it is 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.440
 almost nobody 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.430
 the war 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.990
 this year it's a necessity 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.300
 the surface and its output more than 10% of students arrived and precisely the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.010
 climb it pleads m 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.039
 this one 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.439
 he is excellent 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.799
 I felt it would be great m complicated because we are the best c 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.629
 claude monet transformed our country after 14 hours 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.500
 it is normal that it is not won 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.749
 here it's been three months to start how this year 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:34.309
 what could hope to have he is also some adherents to the country 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.439
 you need more diversity 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.749
 it really is 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.669
 many friends of different 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:42.589
 nationality 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.499
 that's what a lot with my latin friends 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.149
 but also 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:50.149
 a lot of Algerian French 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.369
 it's really nice tour 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:55.619
 it is done 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:57.159
 it's good 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.159
 it was the sum collected 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:01.939
 handball 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.979

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:06.359
 c belletti 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:07.779
 single line 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.089
 for his exit 105 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.149
 that's what worries me a lot he's settled in the country 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:14.829
 this is an essay 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.519
 here this case 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.059
 because yesterday women 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:22.059
 Pierre 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.099
 m 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.619

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.049
 we started terrorists 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.199
 parquet floor of paris 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:50.199
 likewise 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.949
 this period 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.949
 I recommend
