00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.200
 thermaltake play even easier 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.519
 charge our reviews 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.199
 spouting columns from perfeo in front 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.630
 it will bring energy at any job 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.939
 table hello everyone I am Arina and with you 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.390
 techno-kitchen consider the board for socket 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.029
 1150 and a few groups of models drone based 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.740
 on the top network type z87 but at the same time 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.240
 has some cuts yes you 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.130
 offer a low consumer 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.530
 cost in particular instead of support 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.600
 three video cards are supported 2 and instead 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.420
 six have no 30 ports on the back can 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.760
 only 4 and yet this board has its own 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.430
 nice chips and generally made it so 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.899
 according to the textbook first comes from the Oscar 150 x 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.510
 with a sport that is convenient to use 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.910
 under network or audio controllers 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.920
 further layer under the video card and under it 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.840
 nothing it's understandable anyway in 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.539
 ninety-nine percent of cases there 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.890
 there will be a video card cooling system 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.260
 notice a large distance between 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.080
 graphics cards 2 accelerator exactly warm 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.299
 each other will not be formula 88 and more 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.480
 do not need support as it sends and 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.870
 crossfire 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.540
 only 8 yusb ports of 4 versions 20 and 30 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.990
 i.e. equally but there are nice ones 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.240
 chips 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.980
 intel network card is very high quality 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.870
 you squeeze the maximum speed off the line 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.940
 also the ability to connect three 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.140
 monitor simultaneously true we are 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.590
 by obsolete widj 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.940
 from this port that you will rarely meet 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.480
 built-in sound card from realtek 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.300
 name you won't believe lc11 50 all in 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.920
 for the benefit of marketing socket 1150 means and 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.190
 sound let it be modern fashion 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.020
 1150 what I like is sata port 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.910
 made by kolkhoz connectors up 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.680
 and not aside 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.110
 user cross do of two then 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.020
 slots 7970 asus and break off 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.240
 access to the ports will be closed the same 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.450
 with kuli i arctic only 1 internal usb 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.060
 Port 30 is hardly a lesbian 20 but meager 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.490
 have a com and good old l5 someone up 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.080
 may be useful 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.090
 as many as six power connectors for 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.860
 fans and four of them 4 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.240
 pins are just a paradise for those who 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.100
 going to power hull 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.140
 fans and several fans from 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.940
 CPU cooler speed 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.250
 rotation parameters of Kamchatka are given 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.230
 through bios, we note that both are for 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.690
 the maiden by the cogs and in 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.500
 if necessary, remove them easily 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.390
 manufacturer indicates special 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.950
 commentators are not able to work 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.030
 less than twenty two years old at a temperature 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.760
 65 degrees 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.590
 as for bios the most important payment 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.470
 able to fully accelerate processors 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.420
 what embarrasses is of course the support on 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.280
 the developer site is only one new bios 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.560
 so as usual no fast 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.300
 updates do not have to wait in general 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.770
 what to say for 120 dollars quite 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.110
 good price for such a cost 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.450
 there were not so many competitors 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.920
 payment from elite groups is our reward bronze 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.920
 and with you was arina see you
