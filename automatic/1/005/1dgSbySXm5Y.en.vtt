00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
isn't really much of a difference like

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.950 
isn't really much of a difference like
10<00:01:57.689> 20<00:01:57.990> seconds<00:01:58.409> or<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> huge<00:01:59.430> run<00:01:59.700> you're

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
10 20 seconds or like a huge run you're

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.020 
10 20 seconds or like a huge run you're
like<00:02:00.960> oh<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.320> say<00:02:01.500> After<00:02:01.829> Effects<00:02:02.070> I'll

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
like oh so say After Effects I'll

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.959 
like oh so say After Effects I'll
probably<00:02:03.270> delete<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.960> like<00:02:04.460> 10<00:02:05.460> seconds

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
probably delete that in like 10 seconds

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.469 
probably delete that in like 10 seconds
I<00:02:06.119> don't<00:02:06.299> know<00:02:06.829> but<00:02:07.829> basically<00:02:08.670> that's<00:02:09.119> that

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
I don't know but basically that's that

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.990 
I don't know but basically that's that
now<00:02:10.379> onyx<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.370> reason<00:02:11.610> why<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.730> already

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
now onyx and the reason why I already

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.610 
now onyx and the reason why I already
have<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.480> one<00:02:12.870> open<00:02:13.260> is

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
have this one open is

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.050 
have this one open is
cuz<00:02:13.769> it<00:02:13.890> takes<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.099> little<00:02:14.310> while<00:02:14.549> for<00:02:14.610> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
cuz it takes a little while for the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.839 
cuz it takes a little while for the
startup<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.629> everything<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.730> what<00:02:17.730> its

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
startup and everything and what its

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.610 
startup and everything and what its
gonna<00:02:17.909> do<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.450> it's<00:02:18.480> gonna<00:02:18.720> lag<00:02:19.049> a<00:02:19.080> little<00:02:19.500> when

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
gonna do is it's gonna lag a little when

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.089 
gonna do is it's gonna lag a little when
you<00:02:19.680> open<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.129> and<00:02:20.420> then<00:02:21.420> I'll<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:21.750> come<00:02:21.930> back

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
you open it and then I'll just come back

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.619 
you open it and then I'll just come back
it<00:02:23.099> only<00:02:23.250> does<00:02:23.459> that<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.940> don't<00:02:24.330> know<00:02:24.420> if<00:02:24.540> it

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
it only does that I don't know if it

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:25.490 
it only does that I don't know if it
just<00:02:24.659> does<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.140> for<00:02:25.200> me

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
just does that for me

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.399 
just does that for me
I<00:02:25.860> think<00:02:26.099> anybody<00:02:26.580> else<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.299> just<00:02:28.290> thought

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
I think anybody else but I just thought

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.899 
I think anybody else but I just thought
I<00:02:28.470> let<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.830> out<00:02:28.890> there<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.400> don't<00:02:29.489> keep<00:02:29.730> like

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
I let that out there so don't keep like

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.850 
I let that out there so don't keep like
we're<00:02:30.060> starting<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.569> so<00:02:31.349> let's<00:02:31.950> start<00:02:32.280> um

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
we're starting it so let's start um

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.369 
we're starting it so let's start um
this<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:35.040> basically<00:02:35.489> executing<00:02:36.360> all<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.170> crap

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
this is basically executing all the crap

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.930 
this is basically executing all the crap
you<00:02:37.530> don't<00:02:37.739> need<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.310> don't<00:02:38.340> really<00:02:38.640> need<00:02:38.879> to

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
you don't need you don't really need to

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.089 
you don't need you don't really need to
change<00:02:39.480> anything<00:02:39.870> else<00:02:40.170> from<00:02:40.440> these<00:02:40.680> cleaning

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
change anything else from these cleaning

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.940 
change anything else from these cleaning
stuff<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:42.989> there's<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.230> bunch<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.530> other<00:02:43.739> stuff

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
stuff and there's a bunch of other stuff

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.650 
stuff and there's a bunch of other stuff
you<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.400> do<00:02:44.579> just<00:02:44.940> kind<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.180> play<00:02:45.329> around<00:02:45.390> with

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
you can do just kind of play around with

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.479 
you can do just kind of play around with
it<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.109> see<00:02:46.319> if<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.530> don't<00:02:46.709> want<00:02:46.950> some<00:02:47.190> stuff

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
it and see if you don't want some stuff

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.080 
it and see if you don't want some stuff
and<00:02:48.590> basically<00:02:49.590> that's<00:02:49.950> what<00:02:50.069> onyx<00:02:50.489> is<00:02:50.670> now<00:02:51.060> I

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
and basically that's what onyx is now I

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.240 
and basically that's what onyx is now I
free<00:02:51.510> now<00:02:51.690> actually<00:02:52.349> just<00:02:52.530> put<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:52.829> in<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.069> doc

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
free now actually just put this in a doc

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.309 
free now actually just put this in a doc
this<00:02:53.819> is<00:02:53.970> it's<00:02:54.299> actually<00:02:54.660> right<00:02:54.810> up<00:02:54.930> here<00:02:55.109> once

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
this is it's actually right up here once

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.860 
this is it's actually right up here once
you<00:02:55.410> gauntlet<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.859> goes<00:02:56.040> onto<00:02:56.250> your<00:02:56.690> bar<00:02:57.690> up

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
you gauntlet it goes onto your bar up

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.309 
you gauntlet it goes onto your bar up
here<00:02:58.549> so<00:02:59.549> basically<00:03:00.090> what<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.629> does<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.140> once

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
here so basically what it does is once

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.080 
here so basically what it does is once
you<00:03:01.440> click<00:03:01.620> optimize<00:03:01.829> memory<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.670> just<00:03:02.879> makes

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
you click optimize memory it just makes

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.039 
you click optimize memory it just makes
it<00:03:03.239> like<00:03:03.629> use<00:03:04.319> less<00:03:04.799> RAM<00:03:05.159> than<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.489> would<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.209> I

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
it like use less RAM than it would and I

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:07.970 
it like use less RAM than it would and I
think<00:03:07.079> that's<00:03:07.379> pretty<00:03:07.500> cool

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
think that's pretty cool

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.830 
think that's pretty cool
sometimes<00:03:08.489> when<00:03:08.790> I'm<00:03:08.909> using<00:03:09.060> like<00:03:09.420> After

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
sometimes when I'm using like After

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.509 
sometimes when I'm using like After
Effects<00:03:10.109> I<00:03:10.290> do<00:03:10.349> that<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:10.950> doesn't<00:03:11.129> like<00:03:11.370> my

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
Effects I do that so doesn't like my

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.369 
Effects I do that so doesn't like my
computer<00:03:11.819> out<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.329> I<00:03:12.420> open<00:03:12.690> other<00:03:12.810> programs

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
computer out and I open other programs

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.839 
computer out and I open other programs
you<00:03:13.560> know<00:03:14.299> and<00:03:15.829> monolingual<00:03:16.829> modeling<00:03:17.669> will

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
you know and monolingual modeling will

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.780 
you know and monolingual modeling will
come<00:03:18.150> on<00:03:18.269> open<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.630> up<00:03:19.579> basically<00:03:20.579> what<00:03:20.700> it

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
come on open this up basically what it

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.089 
come on open this up basically what it
does<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.480> deletes<00:03:21.870> other<00:03:22.260> languages<00:03:22.919> that

basically whatever the Czech ones are

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.729 
basically whatever the Czech ones are
that's<00:03:53.220> what<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.459> gonna<00:03:53.519> delete<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:55.049> uncheck

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
that's what it's gonna delete so uncheck

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.150 
that's what it's gonna delete so uncheck
whatever<00:03:56.069> you<00:03:56.489> would<00:03:56.790> prefer<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.720> keep<00:03:58.620> really

whatever you would prefer to keep really

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.960 
whatever you would prefer to keep really
and<00:03:59.629> this<00:04:00.629> is<00:04:01.079> basically<00:04:01.669> your<00:04:02.669> current

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
and this is basically your current

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.460 
and this is basically your current
architecture<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:03.599> can<00:04:03.780> check<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.260> right

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
architecture you can check that right

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.640 
architecture you can check that right
here<00:04:04.889> you<00:04:05.099> turn<00:04:05.940> our<00:04:06.060> architecture<00:04:06.660> mine<00:04:07.500> is

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
here you turn our architecture mine is

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.289 
here you turn our architecture mine is
an<00:04:07.769> intel<00:04:08.040> 64<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.639> it<00:04:08.760> so<00:04:08.940> i'll<00:04:09.060> leave<00:04:09.239> that

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
an intel 64 of it so i'll leave that

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.759 
an intel 64 of it so i'll leave that
unchecked<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.769> everything<00:04:11.190> else<00:04:11.549> checked

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
unchecked and everything else checked

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.680 
unchecked and everything else checked
now<00:04:13.769> once<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.459> click<00:04:14.489> remove<00:04:15.120> it'll<00:04:15.510> take<00:04:15.660> a

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
now once you click remove it'll take a

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.539 
now once you click remove it'll take a
little<00:04:15.900> while<00:04:16.229> because<00:04:16.560> it's<00:04:16.859> deleting<00:04:17.220> a<00:04:17.280> lot

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
little while because it's deleting a lot

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.680 
little while because it's deleting a lot
of<00:04:17.760> stuff<00:04:18.530> basically<00:04:19.530> everything<00:04:20.430> with<00:04:20.910> the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
of stuff basically everything with the

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.690 
of stuff basically everything with the
language<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.409> mean

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
language I mean

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.740 
language I mean
other<00:04:23.000> languages<00:04:23.420> and<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:25.120> let's<00:04:26.120> see<00:04:26.360> what

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
other languages and so let's see what

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.890 
other languages and so let's see what
else<00:04:26.900> is<00:04:27.080> there<00:04:27.290> that's<00:04:28.390> basically<00:04:29.390> it<00:04:29.600> now

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
else is there that's basically it now

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.760 
else is there that's basically it now
