today<00:00:11.030> it<00:00:12.030> doubles<00:00:12.780> up<00:00:12.990> as<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.650> case<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.400> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
today it doubles up as a case and the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.200 
today it doubles up as a case and the
stand<00:00:14.849> let's<00:00:15.780> take<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> closer<00:00:17.130> look<00:00:17.220> at<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.520> as

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
stand let's take a closer look at it as

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.779 
stand let's take a closer look at it as
you<00:00:18.390> can<00:00:18.510> see<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:19.020> quite<00:00:19.310> so<00:00:20.310> relatively

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
you can see it's quite so relatively

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.420 
you can see it's quite so relatively
thick<00:00:21.090> case<00:00:21.330> which<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.990> going<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.199> add<00:00:22.369> quite<00:00:23.369> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
thick case which is going to add quite a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.920 
thick case which is going to add quite a
bit<00:00:23.609> protection<00:00:24.260> to<00:00:25.260> your<00:00:25.289> iPad<00:00:26.750> which<00:00:27.750> is

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
bit protection to your iPad which is

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.359 
bit protection to your iPad which is
that<00:00:28.140> that's<00:00:28.380> most<00:00:28.619> likely<00:00:28.680> something<00:00:29.130> you'll

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
that that's most likely something you'll

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.529 
that that's most likely something you'll
be<00:00:29.400> looking<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.730> when<00:00:29.939> you're<00:00:30.090> buying<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.390> new

the iPads and suppose I could live with
it<00:01:22.189> you<00:01:23.189> didn't<00:01:23.460> see<00:01:23.580> there<00:01:25.009> 22<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.189> denser

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
it you didn't see there 22 in denser

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.469 
it you didn't see there 22 in denser
sure<00:01:28.320> therefore<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> viewing<00:01:30.150> angle

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
sure therefore just in the viewing angle

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.649 
sure therefore just in the viewing angle
of<00:01:30.570> your<00:01:30.630> ipod<00:01:30.930> once<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.439> there<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:33.390> if

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
of your ipod once it's in there so if

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.249 
of your ipod once it's in there so if
you<00:01:33.780> pull<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> tree<00:01:34.380> back<00:01:35.100> slightly<00:01:36.259> that's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you pull the tree back slightly that's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.069 
you pull the tree back slightly that's
how<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.530> convert<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.630> convert<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.780> into<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
how you convert a convert it into the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.440 
how you convert a convert it into the
stand<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> probably<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:44.180> most<00:01:45.180> well

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
stand so probably one of the most well

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.990 
stand so probably one of the most well
designed<00:01:45.869> cases<00:01:46.560> i've<00:01:46.710> seen<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.369> while<00:01:50.000> so

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
designed cases i've seen for a while so

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.109 
designed cases i've seen for a while so
once<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.570> put<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.750> ipad<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.009> case<00:01:56.119> now

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
once you put the ipad in in the case now

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.700 
once you put the ipad in in the case now
we<00:01:57.180> held<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.600> place<00:01:57.719> by<00:01:57.810> these<00:01:58.229> free<00:01:58.469> lever

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
we held in place by these free lever

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.910 
we held in place by these free lever
free<00:01:59.640> lever<00:01:59.850> sections<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:01.880> you<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.000> pull<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
free lever sections are you can pull the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.809 
free lever sections are you can pull the
pull<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> two<00:02:05.219> corner<00:02:06.200> corner<00:02:07.200> pieces<00:02:07.819> back

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
pull the two corner corner pieces back

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.889 
pull the two corner corner pieces back
to<00:02:09.149> allow

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
to allow

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.460 
to allow
access<00:02:11.650> for<00:02:11.829> the<00:02:11.890> ipad<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.840> take<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.170> look<00:02:14.349> at

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
access for the ipad so take a look at

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.710 
access for the ipad so take a look at
how<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.680> looks<00:02:14.829> in<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.069> case<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:16.420> saw<00:02:16.599> before

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
how it looks in the case you saw before

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.470 
how it looks in the case you saw before
to<00:02:17.709> do<00:02:18.280> in<00:02:18.430> tier<00:02:18.819> left<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.209> two<00:02:19.329> different

using<00:02:21.909> the<00:02:22.150> standard<00:02:22.329> feature<00:02:22.709> it's<00:02:23.709> fairly

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
using the standard feature it's fairly

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.599 
using the standard feature it's fairly
simple<00:02:24.189> process<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:25.829> pop<00:02:26.829> it<00:02:26.950> into<00:02:27.069> that<00:02:27.370> feet

ipad<00:02:30.430> tray<00:02:30.670> out<00:02:31.299> like<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.549> can<00:02:33.670> slot

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
ipad tray out like so and you can slot

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.170 
ipad tray out like so and you can slot
it<00:02:34.030> into<00:02:34.090> either<00:02:34.599> of<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.930> indenter<00:02:36.030> like<00:02:37.030> that

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
it into either of the indenter like that

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.740 
it into either of the indenter like that
i<00:02:37.799> did<00:02:38.799> find<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.099> neither<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.790> these<00:02:39.970> angles

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
i did find that neither of these angles

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.449 
i did find that neither of these angles
were<00:02:41.019> very<00:02:41.439> good<00:02:41.590> for<00:02:41.739> typing<00:02:42.040> emails<00:02:42.280> or

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
were very good for typing emails or

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.670 
were very good for typing emails or
browsing<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.790> web<00:02:42.849> so<00:02:43.810> i<00:02:43.870> look<00:02:44.019> she<00:02:44.170> just<00:02:44.379> took

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
browsing the web so i look she just took

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.000 
browsing the web so i look she just took
the<00:02:45.239> ipad<00:02:46.239> tray<00:02:46.510> out<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.019> indent<00:02:47.769> and

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
placed it down like that seems to

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.610 
placed it down like that seems to
provide<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:51.420> really<00:02:52.420> good<00:02:52.540> relatively<00:02:53.470> good
