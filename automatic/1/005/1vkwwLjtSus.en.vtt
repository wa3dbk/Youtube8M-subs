00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 but what is worse is that also the 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.029
 music he listened to was local la 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.240
 youth revolt required its own 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.370
 soundtrack is almost impossible 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.710
 describe the importance of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.390
 social revolution represented by 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:22.830
 this wooden box is a radio a 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.539
 crystal and this is the crystal thanks 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.460
 on the radio for the first time in the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.849
 history people at home could listen 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.600
 distant people talk about people who don't 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.550
 had ever met another firm that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.200
 the shadow a couple of generations ago i 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.670
 young people could save some 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.460
 small change from their pocket money e 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.040
 build your own radio in galena lo 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.660
 they did it for fun because 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.690
 alternatives were standing next to it 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.360
 on the floor to sing or sing was in 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.030
 there is no battery next to the floor 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.320
 I wasn't looking for power or even 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.109
 a speaker 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.660
 the only thing that is there is a long thread 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.449
 indeed very long it will measure thirty 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.240
 of meters is the antenna also acts as 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.409
 power supply because the radio waves 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.990
 electromagnetic captured by art but 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.110
 they are also sufficient to make it work 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.090
 the apparatus was almost a miracle 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.580
 being able to feel something needed 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.140
 use these small headphones or phones 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.720
 how strangely they were called 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.580
 then but the positive side of the thing e 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.560
 there was no danger that the neighbor will 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.740
 knocked on the wall to tell you to lower 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.740
 the volume 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.720
 it was a beginning and the music poured 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.580
 in homes it was no longer necessary 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.350
 learn to play the piano run into 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.450
 street to listen to widening but 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.020
 dancing was still impossible because yes 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.890
 was limited by headphones but then came up 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.160
 something else 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.080
 this small object the valve this 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.320
 is one of the most important innovations 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.150
 of the beginning of the twentieth century is 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.580
 an ingenious invention by uniting 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.350
 many go these act as 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.940
 amplifier for weak signal 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.979
 emitted by the crystal 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.820
 which means that it is now possible 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.369
 build a tube radio 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.959
 here are the valves and as they amplified 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.060
 much the signal this free i 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.070
 listeners from the tyranny of headphones 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.680
 music and speeches and everything else 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.420
 people came out of the speakers now 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.940
 he could sit and listen to the radio 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.190
 or get up and dance but this 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.110
 produces another problem 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.570
 this type of radio needed one 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.090
 power source and so resorted to 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:34.410
 to the heavy and potentially 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.680
 dangerous 120 volt battery and this 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.660
 meant that the radio like this 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.630
 became practically portable ed 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.820
 here is the handle at the top but it wasn't 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.350
 really portable you could move from 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.850
 stay at the kitchen but the radio 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.220
 continues to be a household appliance 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.760
 you listen to music you did it with the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.550
 your family 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.770
 not exactly a rebellious activity 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.110
 the problem was not so much listening 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.750
 music with your father how to put up the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.280
 his kind of music and that was equivalent 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.180
 to see him dance at the water party of 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.890
 birthday 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.530
 you can't make a revolution around 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.480
 at the dining room table he had to 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.630
 something else will happen to make it 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.630
 possible 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.840
 to be honest the teenagers were a 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.819
 young american product 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.310
 Americans had enough money 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.310
 optimism to pretend to have fun 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.750
 the echoes they had given us 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.180
 some of the best innovations of the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.000
 century like the cheese burger la 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.400
 ford model t and not least the stockings of 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.780
 nylon that they used to seduce ours 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.780
 girls during the war 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.470
 but this is nothing compared to what it is 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.470
 would have invested after the conflict 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.260
 here is the music created for 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.420
 teenagers music that parents do not 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.340
 they would understand 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.030
 or even better music they would have 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.030
 detested 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.290
 as we know in the middle of the years 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.819
 fifty from that rock and roll with the 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.160
 just intent on overthrowing the government 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.120
 of the united states and to corrupt the 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.860
 world 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.829
 nevertheless it would not have been easy 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.130
 if it had been engraved on one of these is 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.500
 a 78 rpm record and interesting thing 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.840
 in this case bill haley and commerce 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.150
 they can play thanks to an insect 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.669
 this is because the disc is made in 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.760
 a material called shellac secret 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.139
 from the oriental vitter curry halak 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.450
 present to a couple of problems the first 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:41.690
 is that it produces a horrendous level of 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.690
 superficial rustling as I will show you 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.590
 the second is that with the shellac i 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.660
 furrows could not be too close 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.610
 otherwise we would have merged one with 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.830
 the other and this would have ruined the 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.419
 sound and finally and in my opinion more 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.000
 important 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:04.950
 the disks were very fragile 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.650
 solution was to find more material 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.630
 eligible for the dr malacca again one 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.060
 man's creation would have ousted 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.550
 one insect was polyvinyl chloride 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.160
 I have chi min and it would go and unlike 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.810
 della con maranca was resistant 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.910
 here is the lord again in this one 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.250
 time on the vinyl is smaller more 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.800
 light and with a greater number of cpi ai 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.900
 or thumb grooves on the shellac 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.740
 it was difficult to reach 90 money for 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.590
 inch 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.780
 while on vinyl they were also there 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.620
 260 so I could record 30 minutes of 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.380
 music is a big record or a song 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:44.139
 there is only a small and essential thing 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:50.750
 for teenagers revelers they were objects 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:52.729
 the merit is practically unbreakable 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.470
 the widespread rock and roll was not 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:59.990
 solely from vinyl but definitely 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:01.760
 arese the most usable music and records 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.070
 they were so cheap that it was possible 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.199
 choose from a variety of styles 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.820
 musical and from tomorrow to tomorrow were born 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.820
 new trend groups 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.949
 in the mid- fifties the jukeboxes did 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.500
 their appearance in pubs and cafes 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:23.900
 so now the British could 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.680
 to gather and challenge the social fabric 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:31.610
 and to the country I take milkshakes and listening 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.680
 records of the hit parade of 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.080
 teenagers bought about half 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.849
 of all the discs engraved next to the 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.550
 vinyl the recorder looked like a 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:43.479
 simple diversion many felt that 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:46.069
 the 45 pounds you will never set but 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:48.110
 then something happened that made it appear 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:50.270
 the old-fashioned vinyl record 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.789
 how much the pvc roof of the ford e 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.250
 Papa's grenade the entire monument of the 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:58.550
 pop music was suddenly reduced to 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.979
 a sequence of one and zero 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.169
 one of these is obviously the advantages 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:05.150
 many are very resistant and 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:06.860
 difficult to scratch you don't have to 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.110
 continue to remove dust from the 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:12.319
 needle and there is no danger that the furrows 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:16.300
 if they are damaged then not playable 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.300
 different speed to make you laugh
