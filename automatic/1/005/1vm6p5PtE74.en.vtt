there is something out there that bob
was<00:01:50.720> close<00:01:51.720> enough<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.860> observed<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.350> what

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
was close enough to be observed and what

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:06.590 
was close enough to be observed and what
could<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.619> be

Oh

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.070 

Mike<00:02:36.920> decided<00:02:37.460> he<00:02:37.730> thought<00:02:38.030> he<00:02:38.330> could<00:02:38.360> see<00:02:38.960> it

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
Mike decided he thought he could see it

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.470 
Mike decided he thought he could see it
in<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.500> telescope<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.400> he<00:02:40.670> was<00:02:40.880> able<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.210> do

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
in the telescope and he was able to do

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.510 
in the telescope and he was able to do
that<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.930> when<00:02:42.560> when<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.070> was<00:02:43.190> in<00:02:43.340> one

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
that and when when it was in one

that and when when it was in one
position<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.570> dancers<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.650> ellipses<00:02:46.310> but

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
position the dancers and ellipses but

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.820 
position the dancers and ellipses but
when<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.330> made<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.810> real<00:02:47.990> short<00:02:48.020> be<00:02:48.470> sort<00:02:48.770> of

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.730 

obviously<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:22.920> three<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.190> us<00:03:23.460> were<00:03:23.730> not<00:03:24.000> gonna

learn doubt hey is then we got something
moving<00:03:28.590> along<00:03:29.010> inside<00:03:29.550> of<00:03:29.730> us<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:29.940> we<00:03:30.480> don't

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
moving along inside of us and we don't

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.300 
moving along inside of us and we don't
know<00:03:30.750> what<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:31.050> is<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.590> know<00:03:31.710> can<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:31.980> tell<00:03:32.280> us

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
know what it is you know can you tell us

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.870 
know what it is you know can you tell us
what<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.730> we<00:03:33.420> weren't<00:03:33.630> about<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:33.960> do<00:03:34.320> that

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
what it is we weren't about to do that

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.790 
what it is we weren't about to do that
because<00:03:35.880> we<00:03:36.210> know<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.140> leading<00:03:37.650> those

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
because we know that the leading those

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.410 
because we know that the leading those
transmissions<00:03:38.460> would<00:03:38.820> be<00:03:39.000> heard<00:03:39.180> by<00:03:39.390> all

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
transmissions would be heard by all

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.050 
transmissions would be heard by all
sorts<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.960> people<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.500> who<00:03:41.490> knows<00:03:41.700> what

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
somebody would have demanded that we

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.430 
somebody would have demanded that we
turned<00:03:44.850> back<00:03:44.970> because<00:03:45.570> of<00:03:45.690> aliens<00:03:45.840> or

turned back because of aliens or

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.730 
turned back because of aliens or
whatever<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.940> reason<00:03:48.270> is<00:03:48.420> so<00:03:48.960> we<00:03:49.170> didn't<00:03:49.650> do

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
whatever the reason is so we didn't do

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.690 
whatever the reason is so we didn't do
that<00:03:49.980> but<00:03:50.820> we<00:03:50.970> did<00:03:51.440> decide<00:03:52.440> we<00:03:53.100> just

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
that but we did decide we just

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.980 
that but we did decide we just
cautiously<00:03:54.330> ask<00:03:55.550> Houston<00:03:56.550> where<00:03:56.850> how<00:03:57.660> far

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
cautiously ask Houston where how far

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:21.210 
cautiously ask Houston where how far
away<00:03:58.140> was<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.620> s4b<00:04:03.620> damn<00:04:04.620> any<00:04:04.920> idea<00:04:05.280> what<00:04:05.490> he

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.700 

the<00:04:22.220> mall<00:04:22.490> Emma<00:04:22.790> kissin<00:04:23.360> see<00:04:23.780> it<00:04:23.900> for<00:04:24.170> these<00:04:24.380> of

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
the mall Emma kissin see it for these of

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.680 
the mall Emma kissin see it for these of
that<00:04:24.830> big<00:04:25.280> thousand<00:04:25.850> Oracle

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
that big thousand Oracle

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.290 
that big thousand Oracle
a<00:04:29.470> few<00:04:30.470> moments<00:04:30.650> later<00:04:31.130> why<00:04:31.700> they<00:04:31.880> came<00:04:32.060> back

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
a few moments later why they came back

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.390 
a few moments later why they came back
and<00:04:32.570> said<00:04:32.840> something<00:04:33.260> like<00:04:33.410> there<00:04:33.950> was<00:04:34.100> six

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
and said something like there was six

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.970 
and said something like there was six
thousand<00:04:34.910> miles<00:04:35.090> away<00:04:35.440> because<00:04:36.440> of<00:04:36.650> the

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
thousand miles away because of the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.880 
thousand miles away because of the
maneuver<00:04:37.760> so<00:04:37.940> we<00:04:38.260> really<00:04:39.260> didn't<00:04:39.530> think<00:04:39.560> we

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
maneuver so we really didn't think we

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.300 
maneuver so we really didn't think we
were<00:04:40.040> looking<00:04:40.720> something<00:04:41.720> that<00:04:41.900> far<00:04:42.200> away<00:04:42.620> so

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
were looking something that far away so

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.820 
were looking something that far away so
we<00:04:43.700> decided<00:04:44.150> that<00:04:44.300> after<00:04:45.020> a<00:04:45.230> while<00:04:45.290> watching

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
we decided that after a while watching

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.160 
we decided that after a while watching
it<00:04:46.160> we<00:04:46.730> there's<00:04:47.240> time<00:04:47.420> to<00:04:47.450> go<00:04:47.660> to<00:04:47.720> sleep<00:04:47.870> and

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
it we there's time to go to sleep and

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.200 
it we there's time to go to sleep and
got<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:48.980> talk<00:04:49.190> about<00:04:49.220> it<00:04:49.580> anymore<00:04:49.640> until<00:04:50.030> we

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
got to talk about it anymore until we

00:04:50.210 --> 00:05:02.800 
got to talk about it anymore until we
came<00:04:50.390> back<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:51.250> debriefing

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.050

the possibility that you might encounter
aliens<00:05:05.960> in<00:05:06.169> space<00:05:06.460> has<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.970> be<00:05:08.389> considered<00:05:09.050> in

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
aliens in space has to be considered in

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.710 
aliens in space has to be considered in
a<00:05:09.440> very<00:05:09.980> sensible<00:05:10.639> and<00:05:10.880> positive<00:05:11.600> and
