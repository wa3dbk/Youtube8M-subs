00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.830
 good today's video is about 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.950
 people like me who have the advice 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.499
 or that they have only one console but it 's 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.719
 piloted then there are times that 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:17.960
 we install games on the hard drive as 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.600
 13 9 11 and any game that is not 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.020
 100% engraved 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.110
 gives an error that they call themselves at 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.260
 authorize the test is what it does 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.770
 prevent us from loading the game of 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.710
 a hard drive and here 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.900
 have been one hundred percent detected 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.240
 automatically that is a copy 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.540
 so the console restarts at 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.840
 time to try to play 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:50.850
 every time they have this error of 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.519
 solution is relatively easy 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 you just have to do the following 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.449
 steps that details continuation 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:03.339
 for example, use the receipt set 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.339
 6 I have installed 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.930
 but by not doing the method that 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.020
 as soon as it starts 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.030
 tens of 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.030
 the cinematography 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.200
 accompanies me 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.800
 and it's not campaign or any campaign in 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.880
 handling taxes 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.330
 and start 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.480
 this same 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.810
 at the beginning it will not give us the error 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:45.260
 but when I start to control myself 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.260
 good character many people are already 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.840
 you're fine but things 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.990
 and I need you to rescue two hostages 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.400
 central to whom receives the report 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.170
 I think you do here we have to 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.849
 we evacuate 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.120
 but we have detected back from doing in 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.310
 they 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.210
 is one of those typical ones that are and when 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:40.030
 we recorded on the hard drive a game that 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:42.490
 is not 100% not taxed 98% and not 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.920
 with a good recorder with would be a 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.370
 then act when this error 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.780
 and many in accept will restart 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.780
 automatically to the console 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.510
 be initiated what we proceed to do 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.310
 is the next we wait for him to load 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.310
 again in interface 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.000
 studies 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.000
 neither 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.260
 well we eject the disc and we return it 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.260
 to put 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.140
 then we go to the xbox live guide 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.849
 if we walk music and we put any 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.690
 song that we have on our record 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.760
 the engraving 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.020
 once you have put the song 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.680
 good health gustavo the song we start 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.680
 again 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.510
 the video is a bit accelerated by 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.510
 positions 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.880
 it seemed very frequent 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.159
 you win 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.159
 what is this 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.460
 very well 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.840
 and I want the first argument 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.120
 do not 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:42.080
 look 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.080
 but with these ideas 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.800
 this 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.449
 here we have 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:14.690
 then if we manage to increase life 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.690
 Useful of our readers 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.219
 this day 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.230
 soon more will be done 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:31.930
 videos 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:34.000
 of different topics this video I like 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.590

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.590
 similar problem thanks
