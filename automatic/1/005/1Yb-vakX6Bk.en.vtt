your chili flake sits where something
has<00:01:14.259> acid<00:01:14.679> like<00:01:14.830> this<00:01:15.039> the<00:01:15.369> heat<00:01:15.580> will

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
has acid like this the heat will

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.240 
has acid like this the heat will
continue<00:01:15.849> to<00:01:16.240> rise<00:01:16.450> and<00:01:16.869> so<00:01:17.380> this<00:01:17.830> might<00:01:18.069> be<00:01:18.220> a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
continue to rise and so this might be a

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.219 
continue to rise and so this might be a
little<00:01:18.459> spicier<00:01:19.060> tomorrow<00:01:19.450> than<00:01:19.929> it<00:01:19.959> is<00:01:20.080> today

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229
