overall<00:00:21.060> well<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:22.260> was<00:00:22.380> sort<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.650> tough<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.980> get

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
overall well it was sort of tough to get

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.580 
overall well it was sort of tough to get
too<00:00:23.939> much<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.420> gauge<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.260> it's<00:00:25.380> it's

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
too much of a gauge on it it's it's

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.960 
too much of a gauge on it it's it's
tough<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.010> say<00:00:26.160> what's<00:00:26.369> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.609> happen<00:00:26.849> at

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
tough to say what's going to happen at

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.540 
tough to say what's going to happen at
this<00:00:27.060> point<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.449> really<00:00:27.630> think<00:00:28.080> based<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.160> today

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
this point I really think based on today

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.279 
this point I really think based on today
you've<00:00:30.029> got<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.359> think<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:31.080> could<00:00:31.109> be

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you've got to think that it could be

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.830 
you've got to think that it could be
either<00:00:32.219> one<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.820> three<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.270> Baker

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
either one of the three of Baker

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.440 
either one of the three of Baker
Mayfield<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.530> Cody<00:00:35.309> Thomas<00:00:35.579> or<00:00:36.210> Trevor

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
Mayfield just Cody Thomas or Trevor

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.420 
Mayfield just Cody Thomas or Trevor
Knight<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:37.050> seemed<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:37.559> justice<00:00:38.070> Hansen

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
Knight have seemed like justice Hansen

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.639 
Knight have seemed like justice Hansen
was<00:00:38.520> sort<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.820> clearly<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> fourth<00:00:40.110> option<00:00:40.350> so

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
was sort of clearly the fourth option so

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.200 
was sort of clearly the fourth option so
at<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.890> point<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.399> think<00:00:41.730> you'd<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.090> say

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
at this point I think you'd have to say

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.240 
at this point I think you'd have to say
it's<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.540> those<00:00:42.629> three<00:00:42.989> all<00:00:43.680> three<00:00:43.739> made

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
it's one of those three all three made

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.540 
it's one of those three all three made
mistakes<00:00:44.700> all<00:00:45.000> three<00:00:45.239> threw<00:00:45.510> interceptions

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
mistakes all three threw interceptions

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.330 
mistakes all three threw interceptions
so<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:49.079> not<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.649> mention<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.010> didn't<00:00:50.219> really

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
so and not to mention you didn't really

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.279 
so and not to mention you didn't really
get<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.610> full<00:00:50.910> glimpse<00:00:51.480> at<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.629> offense<00:00:52.110> they

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
get a full glimpse at the offense they

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.990 
get a full glimpse at the offense they
didn't<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.649> very<00:00:52.680> fast<00:00:53.129> that's<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.520> staple<00:00:53.969> of

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
didn't go very fast that's a staple of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.910 
didn't go very fast that's a staple of
Lincoln<00:00:54.300> Riley's<00:00:54.629> offense<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.530> go<00:00:55.620> fast

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
Lincoln Riley's offense is to go fast

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.950 
Lincoln Riley's offense is to go fast
and<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.190> didn't<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.579> go<00:00:56.730> fast<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.300> it's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
and they didn't really go fast so it's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.389 
and they didn't really go fast so it's
really<00:00:58.199> hard<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.590> say<00:00:58.739> at<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.920> point<00:00:59.070> I'm<00:00:59.370> not

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
really hard to say at this point I'm not

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.760 
really hard to say at this point I'm not
so<00:00:59.760> sure<00:00:59.789> we<00:01:00.149> learned<00:01:00.420> much<00:01:01.230> more<00:01:01.530> than<00:01:01.680> we

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
so sure we learned much more than we

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.650 
so sure we learned much more than we
knew<00:01:01.890> before<00:01:02.250> Franklin<00:01:02.760> yeah<00:01:03.120> no<00:01:03.359> doubt<00:01:03.510> about

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
knew before Franklin yeah no doubt about

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.299 
knew before Franklin yeah no doubt about
that<00:01:03.930> Baker<00:01:04.260> Mayfield<00:01:04.530> i<00:01:04.830> think<00:01:05.010> was<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that Baker Mayfield i think was like a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.399 
that Baker Mayfield i think was like a
guy<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:06.060> lot<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.450> people<00:01:06.570> really<00:01:07.260> look

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
guy that a lot of people really look

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.840 
guy that a lot of people really look
forward<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> seeing<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.250> lincoln<00:01:08.520> Riley's

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
forward to seeing in lincoln Riley's

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.640 
forward to seeing in lincoln Riley's
offense<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.330> he<00:01:09.450> said<00:01:09.689> we<00:01:10.080> didn't<00:01:10.350> see<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
offense like he said we didn't see the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.170 
offense like he said we didn't see the
tempo<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.610> didn't<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> lot<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
tempo with that we didn't see a lot of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.840 
tempo with that we didn't see a lot of
the<00:01:12.360> things<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.530> make<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> air<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> air

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the things that make the air a the air

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.420 
the things that make the air a the air
raid<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.750> Baker<00:01:16.439> Mayfield<00:01:16.680> made<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> lot<00:01:17.400> of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
raid but Baker Mayfield made a lot of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.969 
raid but Baker Mayfield made a lot of
good<00:01:17.610> throws<00:01:17.990> made<00:01:18.990> some<00:01:19.170> bad<00:01:19.320> decisions<00:01:19.350> as

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
good throws made some bad decisions as

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.429 
good throws made some bad decisions as
well<00:01:20.159> though<00:01:20.340> he<00:01:20.790> did<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.750> wonder<00:01:22.320> how

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
well though he did but you wonder how

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.780 
well though he did but you wonder how
much<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.100> chalk<00:01:23.340> up<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
much of that you can chalk up to the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.609 
much of that you can chalk up to the
fact<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.330> guy<00:01:24.509> hasn't<00:01:24.750> played<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
fact that this guy hasn't played in a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.260 
fact that this guy hasn't played in a
situation<00:01:25.799> like<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.430> since<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> last

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
situation like this since the last

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.800 
situation like this since the last
spring<00:01:27.659> game<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.579> when<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.420> add<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
spring game and and when you add the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.899 
spring game and and when you add the
fans<00:01:31.290> everybody<00:01:32.040> wants<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> make<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> big<00:01:32.729> play

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
fans everybody wants to make a big play

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.390 
fans everybody wants to make a big play
so<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.990> sort<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.439> maybe<00:01:34.770> Chuck's<00:01:35.070> into<00:01:35.280> that

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
so you sort of maybe Chuck's into that

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.890 
so you sort of maybe Chuck's into that
up<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.670> fact<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.090> they're<00:01:36.570> trying<00:01:36.720> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
up to the fact that they're trying to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.359 
up to the fact that they're trying to
make<00:01:36.960> big<00:01:37.229> plays<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.470> front<00:01:37.770> fans<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.100> think<00:01:38.159> you

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.050 
yeah and the whole point of this you
know<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.560> think<00:02:46.860> for<00:02:47.040> for<00:02:47.069> Bob<00:02:47.459> Stoops<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.910> to

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
know I think for for Bob Stoops is to

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.910 
know I think for for Bob Stoops is to
get<00:02:48.239> out<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.510> here<00:02:48.660> without<00:02:48.840> any<00:02:49.260> injuries<00:02:49.680> and

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
get out of here without any injuries and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.729 
get out of here without any injuries and
they<00:02:50.160> seemed<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.519> do<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.410> defensively<00:02:52.410> I

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
they seemed to do that and defensively I

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.620 
they seemed to do that and defensively I
think<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.280> biggest<00:02:53.670> change<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.209> we<00:02:54.420> saw

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
think the biggest change that we saw

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.569 
think the biggest change that we saw
today<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.049> Mike<00:02:55.410> Stoops<00:02:55.709> called<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.430> game

struggled<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.560> complete<00:03:07.860> interceptions<00:03:08.519> a

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
struggled to complete interceptions a

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.339 
struggled to complete interceptions a
year<00:03:08.790> ago<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.420> couple<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:10.079> those<00:03:10.170> guys

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
year ago a couple of those guys

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.280 
year ago a couple of those guys
especially<00:03:10.620> qatari<00:03:11.190> bird<00:03:11.780> came<00:03:12.780> up<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.170> were

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
especially qatari bird came up and were

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.319 
especially qatari bird came up and were
able<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.860> hold<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.310> ball<00:03:14.430> today<00:03:14.610> yeah

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
able to hold on to the ball today yeah

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.819 
able to hold on to the ball today yeah
and<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.569> think<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:15.900> was<00:03:16.049> encouraging<00:03:16.410> one

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
and I think that was encouraging one

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.530 
and I think that was encouraging one
thing<00:03:17.069> though<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.549> keep<00:03:17.819> an<00:03:17.940> eye<00:03:18.090> on<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.420> just

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
thing though to keep an eye on is just

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.240 
thing though to keep an eye on is just
the<00:03:18.720> depth<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.560> know<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.769> second-team

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
the depth you know the second-team

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.979 
the depth you know the second-team
defense<00:03:20.280> was<00:03:20.790> playing<00:03:21.030> with<00:03:21.180> two<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.750> three

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
defense was playing with two and three

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.009 
defense was playing with two and three
walk-on<00:03:22.410> safeties<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.389> first<00:03:24.630> team<00:03:24.810> guys

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
walk-on safeties the the first team guys

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.170

Thomas<00:03:27.600> those<00:03:27.780> guys<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.440> know<00:03:28.530> looked<00:03:28.739> pretty

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
Thomas those guys you know looked pretty

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.370 
Thomas those guys you know looked pretty
good<00:03:29.160> but<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:30.060> concern<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:30.510> depth<00:03:30.959> there<00:03:31.230> and

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
good but the concern is depth there and

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.379 
good but the concern is depth there and
they<00:03:31.650> that's<00:03:32.069> why<00:03:32.280> they<00:03:32.459> signed<00:03:33.030> three

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
they that's why they signed three

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.610 
they that's why they signed three
freshmen<00:03:33.840> safeties<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.319> are<00:03:34.380> going<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.560> be

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
know scheme wise where we're headed I

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.760 
know scheme wise where we're headed I
think<00:04:53.040> we've<00:04:53.160> made<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.400> lot<00:04:53.490> of<00:04:53.670> strides<00:04:54.770> but

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
think we've made a lot of strides but

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.500 
think we've made a lot of strides but
one<00:04:56.100> thing<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:56.430> we<00:04:56.550> do<00:04:56.760> here<00:04:56.970> in<00:04:57.060> practice

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
one thing that we do here in practice

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.790 
one thing that we do here in practice
it's<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:57.750> little<00:04:57.960> different<00:04:58.080> to<00:04:58.290> me<00:04:58.410> is<00:04:58.500> we<00:04:58.650> get

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
it's a little different to me is we get

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.250 
it's a little different to me is we get
so<00:04:59.070> many<00:04:59.130> more<00:04:59.520> team<00:04:59.820> reps<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.450> know<00:05:01.080> then

the<00:06:27.690> end<00:06:27.810> zone<00:06:27.870> was<00:06:28.170> big<00:06:28.470> um<00:06:28.980> you<00:06:29.790> know<00:06:29.910> overall

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
the end zone was big um you know overall

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.990 
the end zone was big um you know overall
i<00:06:30.360> think<00:06:30.480> we<00:06:30.750> played<00:06:31.050> well<00:06:31.320> um<00:06:31.980> you<00:06:32.700> know<00:06:32.820> just

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
i think we played well um you know just

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.610 
i think we played well um you know just
with<00:06:33.150> our<00:06:33.180> routine<00:06:33.630> place<00:06:33.930> you<00:06:34.140> know<00:06:34.260> dinking

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
with our routine place you know dinking

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.230 
with our routine place you know dinking
and<00:06:34.710> dunking<00:06:34.800> some<00:06:35.400> of<00:06:35.490> the<00:06:35.580> bigger<00:06:35.790> plays<00:06:35.970> I

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
and dunking some of the bigger plays I

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.090 
and dunking some of the bigger plays I
felt<00:06:36.450> like<00:06:36.540> we<00:06:36.750> may<00:06:36.870> have<00:06:36.900> forced<00:06:37.650> it<00:06:37.860> a<00:06:37.919> little

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
felt like we may have forced it a little

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.480 
felt like we may have forced it a little
bit

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
bit

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.219 
bit
but<00:06:38.580> I<00:06:38.639> think<00:06:38.849> you<00:06:39.330> know<00:06:39.419> that<00:06:39.449> that's<00:06:39.840> a<00:06:39.960> big

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
but I think you know that that's a big

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:43.159 
but I think you know that that's a big

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
far as execution goes not really but as

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.600

very generic today and a base you know
odd<00:07:47.130> front<00:07:47.520> in<00:07:47.580> the<00:07:47.669> base<00:07:47.849> even<00:07:48.270> front<00:07:49.130> you

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.130 
odd front in the base even front you

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.890 
odd front in the base even front you
know<00:07:50.250> we<00:07:50.430> wanted<00:07:50.699> to<00:07:50.759> be<00:07:50.880> very<00:07:50.909> vanilla<00:07:51.509> but

again<00:07:52.560> it<00:07:52.680> still<00:07:52.889> gets<00:07:53.070> down<00:07:53.280> to<00:07:53.400> playing

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639

00:07:58.249 --> 00:07:58.259 
it gets down to technique it gets down
