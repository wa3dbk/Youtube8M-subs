first when the Skrill was streaming at

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.620 
first when the Skrill was streaming at
first<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.070> saw<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.549> thought<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.119> crime<00:01:57.390> was

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
first I saw the thought the crime was

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.880 
first I saw the thought the crime was
real<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.140> I'm<00:01:58.290> pretty<00:01:58.560> sure<00:01:58.649> at<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.770> point

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
real like I'm pretty sure at that point

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.499 
real like I'm pretty sure at that point
that<00:01:59.070> maybe<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.430> was<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> little<00:02:00.000> bit<00:02:00.240> real

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
that maybe it was a little bit real

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.840 
that maybe it was a little bit real
because<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.930> was<00:02:01.079> into<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:02.340> basically<00:02:02.579> at

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
because I was into it just basically at
