00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
in the case of nutrition-related

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.509 
in the case of nutrition-related
laminitis<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.290> often<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.620> cause<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.309> an

and your sugars your flipped ins from
the<00:00:42.450> pasture<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.920> looking<00:00:44.399> at<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the pasture so looking at this the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.510 
the pasture so looking at this the
problem<00:00:45.480> doesn't<00:00:45.780> occur<00:00:46.110> from<00:00:46.829> high<00:00:47.190> levels

looking<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:50.760> these<00:00:50.879> two<00:00:51.210> areas<00:00:51.680> so<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
looking at these two areas so in the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.540 
looking at these two areas so in the
case<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.610> laminitis<00:00:54.860> for<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.920> poor<00:00:56.219> doer

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
case of laminitis for the poor doer

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
case of laminitis for the poor doer
because<00:00:57.090> often<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> monistic<00:00:58.410> horses

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
because often not all a monistic horses

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.310 
because often not all a monistic horses
and<00:00:58.980> ponies<00:00:59.129> are<00:00:59.520> overweight<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.050> poor

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and ponies are overweight in the poor

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.920 
and ponies are overweight in the poor
adora<00:01:01.829> what<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.520> need<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.120> source<00:01:03.390> calories

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
adora what is need is to source calories

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.900 
adora what is need is to source calories
from<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.289> safest<00:01:04.800> form<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.759> this

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
from the safest form and in this

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.430 
from the safest form and in this
instance<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.720> will<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.930> from<00:01:07.200> high<00:01:07.410> oil

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
instance it will be from high oil

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.730 
instance it will be from high oil
