00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello everyone, Andrey Andreyev 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:11.400
 Andreevich my site all-all point ru 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:14.940
 1500 11 change under the letter a 40 divided 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.270
 we cannot divide by four tenths 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.710
 so 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.980
 we transfer the comma here by one character 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.340
 right and here the comma is transferred to 1 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.060
 sign right in the empty space we enter 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.140
 the role is that 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:41.100
 400 needs to be divided into four here from 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:45.629
 get 400 here 4 and that 100 under 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.620
 letter b 0,8 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.860
 divide by two point two comma 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.860
 here we move 1 character to the right and here 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.430
 then also one sign to the right 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:08.930
 it turns out 8 divided by 2 and the fact that 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:11.400
 divide by 0.5 by letter 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.820
 here we move the comma 1 character to the right 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.689
 and here then the comma is transferred to 1 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.720
 sign to the right 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:26.509
 of empty space 0 200 share 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.979
 by five if 200 divided by 5 is 40 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:39.320
 under the letter v under the letter g 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:39.320
 what do we divide by so on one tenth 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:51.119
 you can count like this if we are a hundred 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.040
 divide by one tenth divide by one 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:02:00.649
 the tenth is the same as multiplying by 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.649
 ten will be 1000d 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:09.360
 thousand divide by one hundredth 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.989
 divide by one hundredth the same way 1000 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.690
 to thomas plans a thousand divide by one 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:19.160
 one hundredth divided by one hundredth is the same 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:24.630
 the most that multiplied by 100 was 1000 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:32.489
 multiply by 100 it turns out 100 thousand one hundred 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:34.280
 thousand under the letter e 6 divide by zero integers 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.870
 three tenths 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.090
 we transfer the comma here to the right by one 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.500
 sign turns 3 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:46.620
 then I transfer the comma to 1 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:03:04.290
 sign to the right is 60 60 divide by 3 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:03:07.190
 a total of 20 and there are still 3 letters 0, 18 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.660
 divide by zero six 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.970
 we transfer the comma here by one character 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.410
 right then here is also one sign 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:20.959
 right one turns eight 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.959
 tenths divided by 6 g 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:31.200
 one point eight divisible by six 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.430
 the whole part is not divided into 6 we write 0 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.450
 put a comma 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.500
 use the first digit after comma 18 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:55.489
 we divide by six we take on 33 on 618 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:04:03.120
 we get 0 answer 3 tenths so letter z 1 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:05.340
 10 divided by one hundredth well, for example 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.310
 You can do this as we transfer 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.600
 comma here for 2 digits then i'm here 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.350
 2 characters two times right here, 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:20.209
 empty place in write 0 then it turns out 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:24.530
 10 divided by 110 if divided by 1 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:28.460
 It will be 1 well, for example, you can but you can 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.000
 it was different it could be like this oh 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.910
 why 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.890
 and 10 is obtained 10 is obtained if 10 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.680
 divide by 1 it turns out 1000 is not 10 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:43.240
 of course it turns out 10 4 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:49.100
 wrong one wrote why 1 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:52.040
 divide by 0 5 move the comma here 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.590
 on 1 sign it turns out 5 here too 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:05:02.390
 the comma is transferred to 1 character is obtained 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:06.520
 10 10 divided by 5 is two that's all 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.520
 that's all for now
