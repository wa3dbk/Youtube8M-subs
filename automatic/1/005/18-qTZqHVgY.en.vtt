or<00:03:27.170> one<00:03:27.320> player<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.680> don't<00:03:27.829> know<00:03:27.890> if<00:03:27.950> this<00:03:28.100> is

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
or one player I don't know if this is

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.220 
or one player I don't know if this is
I'm<00:03:28.640> assuming<00:03:29.030> this<00:03:29.090> is<00:03:29.239> one<00:03:29.480> guy<00:03:29.690> playing<00:03:29.959> no

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
I'm assuming this is one guy playing no

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.810 
I'm assuming this is one guy playing no
I<00:03:30.260> think<00:03:30.440> it's<00:03:30.620> too<00:03:30.799> i<00:03:30.829> don't<00:03:31.070> know<00:03:31.130> if<00:03:31.190> it's<00:03:31.340> a

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
I think it's too i don't know if it's a

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.250 
I think it's too i don't know if it's a
head-to-head<00:03:32.299> or<00:03:32.570> if<00:03:32.750> it's<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.900> guy<00:03:33.019> playing

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
head-to-head or if it's a guy playing

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.319 
head-to-head or if it's a guy playing
against<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.680> computer<00:03:33.709> nonetheless<00:03:34.670> said<00:03:35.150> that

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
against a computer nonetheless said that

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.789 
against a computer nonetheless said that
they<00:03:35.450> don't<00:03:35.630> look<00:03:35.840> like<00:03:35.900> they're<00:03:36.380> that<00:03:36.620> good

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
they don't look like they're that good

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:37.900 
they don't look like they're that good
at<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.040> game<00:03:37.070> they're<00:03:37.400> probably<00:03:37.579> a<00:03:37.760> little

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
at the game they're probably a little

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.390 
at the game they're probably a little
new<00:03:38.239> so<00:03:38.690> you<00:03:39.440> see<00:03:39.680> them<00:03:39.829> flying<00:03:40.100> around

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
new so you see them flying around

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.789 
new so you see them flying around
pinching<00:03:41.060> left<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:41.480> right<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:42.079> that<00:03:42.709> i<00:03:42.739> think

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
pinching left and right and that i think

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.770 
pinching left and right and that i think
there's<00:03:43.070> a<00:03:43.130> hit<00:03:43.310> right<00:03:43.459> here<00:03:43.630> boom<00:03:44.630> right

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
there's a hit right here boom right

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.360 
there's a hit right here boom right
there<00:03:44.840> see<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.260> little<00:03:45.380> bump<00:03:45.680> it<00:03:45.980> almost

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
there see that little bump it almost

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.860 
there see that little bump it almost
looks<00:03:46.610> like<00:03:46.700> when<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.030> player<00:03:47.239> actually<00:03:47.510> goes

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
looks like when the player actually goes

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.750 
looks like when the player actually goes
to<00:03:47.900> hit<00:03:48.230> someone<00:03:48.470> he<00:03:48.709> kind<00:03:48.890> of<00:03:48.980> jolts<00:03:49.430> towards

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
to hit someone he kind of jolts towards

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.250 
to hit someone he kind of jolts towards
them<00:03:49.970> it's<00:03:50.150> a<00:03:50.209> little<00:03:50.420> more<00:03:50.540> realistic<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:51.200> i

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
them it's a little more realistic so i

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.229 
them it's a little more realistic so i
like<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:51.560> see<00:03:51.739> that<00:03:51.950> there<00:03:52.640> was<00:03:52.820> an<00:03:52.970> instance

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
like to see that there was an instance

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.210 
like to see that there was an instance
and<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:54.049> videos<00:03:54.290> over<00:03:54.530> now<00:03:54.650> there<00:03:54.859> was<00:03:55.010> an

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
and the videos over now there was an

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.610 
and the videos over now there was an
instance<00:03:55.549> where<00:03:56.079> one<00:03:57.079> of<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.230> players<00:03:57.410> was

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
instance where one of the players was

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.300 
instance where one of the players was
going<00:03:57.890> in<00:03:58.010> for<00:03:58.130> a<00:03:58.190> body<00:03:58.430> check<00:03:58.549> and<00:03:59.230> he<00:04:00.230> it<00:04:01.100> was

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
going in for a body check and he it was

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.890 
going in for a body check and he it was
just<00:04:01.459> I<00:04:01.579> can't<00:04:02.000> explain<00:04:02.299> it<00:04:02.420> i'll<00:04:02.510> try<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.750> put

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
just I can't explain it i'll try to put

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.270 
just I can't explain it i'll try to put
the<00:04:02.989> screenshot<00:04:03.380> up<00:04:03.500> right<00:04:03.680> now<00:04:03.799> is<00:04:03.980> just<00:04:04.040> a

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
the screenshot up right now is just a

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.520 
the screenshot up right now is just a
weird<00:04:04.609> little<00:04:04.850> bump<00:04:05.359> in<00:04:05.750> like<00:04:06.079> knocked<00:04:06.350> him

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
weird little bump in like knocked him

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.380 
weird little bump in like knocked him
down<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.950> a<00:04:06.980> knee<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.430> he<00:04:07.519> kind<00:04:07.760> of<00:04:07.790> like<00:04:07.970> got

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
down to a knee and he kind of like got

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.910 
down to a knee and he kind of like got
pushed<00:04:08.630> over<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.079> left<00:04:09.260> her<00:04:09.380> side<00:04:09.530> some

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
pushed over to the left her side some

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.560 
pushed over to the left her side some
weirdness<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.579> was<00:04:10.850> they<00:04:11.060> didn't<00:04:11.450> look

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
weirdness it was they didn't look

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.050 
weirdness it was they didn't look
natural<00:04:12.350> I<00:04:12.470> guess<00:04:12.620> is<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.859> best<00:04:12.890> way<00:04:13.489> to<00:04:13.549> put

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
natural I guess is the best way to put

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.390 
natural I guess is the best way to put
it<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.329> looked<00:04:14.540> unnatural<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:15.859> there's<00:04:16.070> a<00:04:16.130> few

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
it it looked unnatural so there's a few

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.520 
it it looked unnatural so there's a few
things<00:04:16.609> that<00:04:16.910> I<00:04:16.940> didn't<00:04:17.479> like<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:17.840> see<00:04:17.989> overall

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
things that I didn't like to see overall

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.500 
things that I didn't like to see overall
it's<00:04:18.799> not<00:04:19.220> that<00:04:19.400> different<00:04:19.640> from<00:04:19.910> henna<00:04:20.299> gel

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
it's not that different from henna gel

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.290 
it's not that different from henna gel
15<00:04:20.989> if<00:04:21.169> i<00:04:21.260> were<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.620> put<00:04:21.739> up<00:04:21.799> at<00:04:21.919> HL<00:04:22.220> 15<00:04:22.700> content

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
15 if i were to put up at HL 15 content

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.840 
15 if i were to put up at HL 15 content
a<00:04:23.600> gameplay<00:04:24.410> i<00:04:24.440> should<00:04:24.740> say<00:04:24.919> and<00:04:25.160> NHL<00:04:25.669> 16

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
a gameplay i should say and NHL 16

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.080 
a gameplay i should say and NHL 16
gameplay<00:04:26.570> next<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:26.930> each<00:04:27.020> other<00:04:27.880> without<00:04:28.880> i

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
gameplay next to each other without i

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.730 
gameplay next to each other without i
mean<00:04:29.360> obviously<00:04:29.720> you<00:04:29.870> guys<00:04:29.990> know<00:04:30.260> what<00:04:30.470> this

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
mean obviously you guys know what this

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.800 
mean obviously you guys know what this
gameplay<00:04:31.070> looks<00:04:31.460> like<00:04:31.610> for<00:04:31.820> NHL<00:04:32.150> 16<00:04:32.300> but<00:04:32.690> let's

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
gameplay looks like for NHL 16 but let's

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.330 
gameplay looks like for NHL 16 but let's
just<00:04:32.870> say<00:04:33.020> theoretically<00:04:33.380> you<00:04:33.860> didn't<00:04:34.250> know

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
just say theoretically you didn't know

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.380 
just say theoretically you didn't know
what<00:04:34.490> this<00:04:34.610> looked<00:04:34.849> like

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
what this looked like

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.090 
what this looked like
and<00:04:35.810> you<00:04:35.900> had<00:04:35.990> nothing<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.350> compare<00:04:36.380> it<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:36.920> and

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
and you had nothing to compare it to and

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.650 
and you had nothing to compare it to and
you<00:04:37.190> just<00:04:37.310> had<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.580> two<00:04:37.730> side<00:04:37.970> by<00:04:38.120> side<00:04:38.150> I

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
you just had the two side by side I

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.870 
you just had the two side by side I
don't<00:04:39.140> think<00:04:39.380> you'd<00:04:39.500> really<00:04:40.220> be<00:04:40.370> able<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.700> tell

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
don't think you'd really be able to tell

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.750 
don't think you'd really be able to tell
which<00:04:41.060> was<00:04:41.270> NHL<00:04:41.720> 16<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.470> which<00:04:42.830> was<00:04:42.980> NHL<00:04:43.520> 15

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
which was NHL 16 and which was NHL 15

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.580 
which was NHL 16 and which was NHL 15
without<00:04:44.390> of<00:04:44.660> course<00:04:44.900> seeing<00:04:45.140> you<00:04:45.320> know<00:04:45.440> the

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
without of course seeing you know the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.010 
without of course seeing you know the
obvious<00:04:46.070> giveaway<00:04:46.430> is<00:04:46.580> like<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.720> change

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
obvious giveaway is like the the change

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.550 
obvious giveaway is like the the change
score<00:04:48.650> clock<00:04:48.950> and<00:04:49.280> scoreboard<00:04:49.610> and<00:04:50.030> whatnot

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
score clock and scoreboard and whatnot

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.990 
score clock and scoreboard and whatnot
like<00:04:51.560> I<00:04:51.680> said<00:04:51.860> that's<00:04:52.130> not<00:04:52.400> what<00:04:52.580> EA<00:04:52.730> was

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
like I said that's not what EA was
