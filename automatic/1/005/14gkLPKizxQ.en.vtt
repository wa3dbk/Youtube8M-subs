00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.860
 ok sir we had a great time 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.170
 well and we hope that you also the 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.469
 gang of the north I think it's 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.469
 unrepeatable 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.710
 we have cream cheese with milk 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.380
 condensed the cola pepsi I just 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.010
 add the milk cream I'm 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.060
 mixing we are going to divide this mixture into 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.340
 Two parts 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:40.320
 and if it looks like bolívar bolívar 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.300
 in one part we are going to add chocolate 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.670
 That red I love chocolate you 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.080
 puts in a good mood has many 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.080
 antioxidants is also very good 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.670
 Look straight ahead attack me like I say 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.579
 that looks like bolivar says here to the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.559
 another part we place the passion fruit and 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.950
 is reduced so that it has better flavor 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.930
 a more concentrated flavor 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.900
 consider the fruit and the passion was the 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.040
 passion of christ that says that you put yourself 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.490
 passionate 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.750
 imagine I have here but here I have the 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.910
 base already baked and cold I'll see 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.400
 be cold that is hot and it placed you 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.640
 the cream the base that again soft not 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.360
 be a trafficker 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.360
 the passion fruit cream 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.680
 and that's what we take to refrigerate 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.110
 half an hour to set 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.950
 depending on the effort of the fridge and me 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.950
 I have previously 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.940
 and when this has already curdled is 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.360
 durito touch it with your finger slowly 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.110
 We are just going to pour in another flavor 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.110
 that chocolate 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.130
 and again it goes to refrigeration until 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.269
 no one language 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.080
 Once a block is called again 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:15.460
 we unmold has brought another translator 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.460
 when prepared 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.650
 we have what it looks like , not the basis of 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.770
 chocolate cream cookies and let's 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.770
 decorate 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.390
 when you see us we are super friendly 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.220
 with you we are on the downside and when 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.500
 we're on the air when I say no longer 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:48.650
 like let's start an intimate glow 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.320
 with a glow of passion fruit not what 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.420
 they get only boiling in 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.730
 wonder is like a cool and sixth 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.630
 passion fruit with sugar the amount of 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.630
 sugar is to taste 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.180

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:23.560
 and we are going to decorate with some petals of 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:26.280
 free organic rose petals roses 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.280
 of pesticides 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.120
 if then we could eat years not 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.120

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.230
 flower artichokes 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.280

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:49.050
