little monitor so it's kind of like a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.229 
little monitor so it's kind of like a
kbd<00:00:44.100> 300v<00:00:44.550> i<00:00:44.670> don't<00:00:44.820> know<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.030> saw<00:00:45.180> the

kbd 300v i don't know if you saw the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.110 
kbd 300v i don't know if you saw the
video<00:00:45.420> by<00:00:45.690> some<00:00:45.930> car<00:00:46.200> Shay<00:00:46.469> he<00:00:47.070> has<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.489> 300<00:00:47.969> V

video by some car Shay he has the 300 V
which<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> monitor<00:00:49.469> is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
which is like this but the monitor is

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.869 
which is like this but the monitor is
built<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.460> comes<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> bit

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
built in here and it comes out a bit

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.540 
built in here and it comes out a bit
longer<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.710> this<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.829> wired<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.190> using<00:00:53.370> this

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
longer and this is wired up using this

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.000 
only one that will let you do direct
mode<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.290> initially<00:02:28.290> bought<00:02:28.469> this<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.950> I

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
mode so I initially bought this and I

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.229 
mode so I initially bought this and I
thought<00:02:29.189> I<00:02:29.250> was<00:02:29.430> gonna<00:02:29.549> be<00:02:29.639> able<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.819> do<00:02:29.909> direct

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
thought I was gonna be able to do direct

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.300 
thought I was gonna be able to do direct
mode<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:30.659> evidently<00:02:31.319> not<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:31.889> then<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.099> picked

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
mode but evidently not so then I picked

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.890 
mode but evidently not so then I picked
up<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.609> and<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:32.879> got<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.030> deal<00:02:33.209> on<00:02:33.359> this<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.719> only

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
up this and I got a deal on this to only

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.789 
up this and I got a deal on this to only
paid<00:02:34.139> $12<00:02:34.769> for<00:02:34.980> Canadian<00:02:35.489> shipped<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.799> that

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
paid $12 for Canadian shipped so that

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.280 
paid $12 for Canadian shipped so that
was<00:02:37.950> good<00:02:38.159> and<00:02:38.310> here's<00:02:38.489> another<00:02:38.609> KBT<00:02:39.209> 308<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
was good and here's another KBT 308 and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.690 
was good and here's another KBT 308 and
this<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.829> bin<00:02:40.980> where<00:02:41.129> I<00:02:41.159> keep<00:02:41.340> all<00:02:41.639> my

it's<00:02:45.150> my<00:02:45.269> laptop<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.989> was<00:02:46.709> researching<00:02:47.340> how

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
it's my laptop and was researching how

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.580 
it's my laptop and was researching how
to<00:02:47.549> hook<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.849> thing<00:02:47.909> up<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:48.239> tomorrow<00:02:48.810> if<00:02:49.409> it

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
to hook this thing up so tomorrow if it

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.140 
to hook this thing up so tomorrow if it
stops<00:02:49.919> raining<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:50.549> thing's<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.909> will<00:02:51.030> back

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
stops raining this thing's and will back

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.729 
stops raining this thing's and will back
up<00:02:51.359> in<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.599> tree<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.669> this<00:02:53.669> is<00:02:53.849> going<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.180> be

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
up in the tree and this is going to be

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.190 
up in the tree and this is going to be
this<00:02:55.739> is<00:02:55.919> going<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.159> do<00:02:56.250> direct<00:02:56.639> mode<00:02:57.019> for<00:02:58.019> that

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
this is going to do direct mode for that

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.860 
this is going to do direct mode for that
so<00:02:58.439> we<00:02:58.680> will<00:02:58.859> eliminate<00:02:59.159> this<00:03:00.030> bit<00:03:00.299> here<00:03:00.540> and

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.990 

we're<00:03:03.870> going<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.019> be<00:03:04.109> able<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.319> view<00:03:04.590> it

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
we're going to be able to view it

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.920 
we're going to be able to view it
remotely<00:03:06.000> because<00:03:06.359> I'm<00:03:06.450> going<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:06.629> hook<00:03:06.689> it<00:03:06.810> up

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
remotely because I'm going to hook it up

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.599 
remotely because I'm going to hook it up
I've<00:03:07.260> spotted<00:03:07.680> out<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:07.980> DX<00:03:08.219> 8000<00:03:09.000> DVR<00:03:10.609> we're
