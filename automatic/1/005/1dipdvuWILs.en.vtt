 tetela de ocampo villagers forecast 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.769
 an ecocide with the exploration of a 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.140
 property of 11 thousand hectares to heaven 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.020
 open where they presume there is silver gold 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.090
 copper and zinc for three months the 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.609
 frisco mining group owned by 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.380
 multimillionaire carlos slim started the 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.689
 search for valuable minerals in the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.809
 land that is sheltered to 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.699
 two kilometers from the municipal seat 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:36.769
 however the work that daily 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.649
 the miners from 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.930
 now it would be ready according to what the 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.000
 residents of the area to liquidate 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.420
 springs that provide drinking water to 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.629
 the head and five communities 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.190
 affecting more than 25 thousand people 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.100
 even the people who live in the place 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.160
 he fears the 60s sweep stock 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.960
 holes in the ground made 800 meters 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.430
 of depth to obtain the metal 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.620
 precious damage the aquifers 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.360
 their intention is to burst 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.850
 those mountains that they give to us 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.040
 water the first mountain that they 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.690
 they claim to devastate is precisely where 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.720
 there are water springs 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.570
 drinking water that they supply to tetela de ocampo and 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.910
 to their communities to consolidate the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.979
 Tetela fresh mining project 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.810
 I would literally be destroying the 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.820
 mountains surrounding the mountain village 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.610
 since to get an ounce of gold 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.880
 will have to move 70 thousand tons of 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.600
 earth and rocks yes to get an ounce 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:42.270
 of gold they would have to move up to 70 70 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:46.210
 thousand tons of soybean material 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.420
 if they intend to drive around 10 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.310
 thousand tons a day or wherever we go 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.009
 to give us where are you going to give this 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.360
 ecosystem even though in infinity 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.090
 of occasions the direction of ecology 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.920
 from the city ​​council of tetela requested the 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.869
 in charge of the rubén vázquez mine 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.060
 Aranda the different permits that 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.119
 endorse the exploration so far 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.160
 he has not shown any documents and 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.420
 the municipal authority has already denounced the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.910
 facts before the prophecy 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.200
 semarnat and the state secretariat of 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.989
 environmental sustainability of 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.380
 territorial organization the mining group 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.850
 does not have a project at least to 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.310
 City Hall has not presented 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.280
 and no project has been submitted 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.720
 which has to 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.270
 where you express your jobs that are 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.030
 doing them right now they are in the 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.210
 exploration stage are drilling 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.550
 They have more than 60 nation bars in 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.170
 some tours because there is a 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.600
 right of way there is no good way 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.750
 that was not very very this very broad but 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.490
 yes I was uploading a unit then in the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.070
 now they opened a gap 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.110
 gaps they expanded and it's a right of 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.020
 way that has existed for many years 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.000
 by some people who live with liman 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.920
 with these properties 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.319
 since the mining company owns 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.540
 farms 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.939
 then in some tours that we have 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.060
 done we have gone through the 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:16.639
 truck asking us what we do there 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.129
 what is private property we what 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.720
 we have always accredited is that we have 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.810
 straight 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.180
 to the right of way but that's not all 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.490
 san francisco group of gold has been 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.950
 cede already started buying other properties 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.470
 in the area offers seven pesos per meter 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.780
 square and some peasants decided 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.790
 sell them situation that ignited the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.740
 red lights in the commune because in the 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.840
 most of these lands live species 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.720
 in danger of extinction that run the 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.300
 risk of disappearing is important 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.250
 mention that in 2003 the 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.860
 energy secretariat awarded a 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.510
 concession to frisco group where for 50 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.760
 years allows you to practice mining in 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.070
 Mexican territory and currently operates 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.350
 six complexes in baja california sonora 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.650
 zacatecas chihuahua and aguascalientes 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.350
 the mine plan reaches 35 points 3 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.810
 million tons this Wednesday 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.820
 members of the non-conformist association
