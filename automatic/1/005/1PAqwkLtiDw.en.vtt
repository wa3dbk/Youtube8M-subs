00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.230 
okay I recently had an idea for a video
that<00:00:07.680> could<00:00:08.130> make<00:00:10.040> basically<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.280> have<00:00:11.790> three

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
that could make basically I have three

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.450 
that could make basically I have three
copies<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:13.139> Mega<00:00:14.009> Man<00:00:14.250> Anniversary

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
every one is different in certain way

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.269 
every one is different in certain way
basically<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.170> reason<00:00:22.320> why<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.619> have<00:00:22.949> three

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
basically the reason why I have three

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.810 
basically the reason why I have three
copies

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
copies

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.689

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
I bought this first copy a couple years

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.680 
I bought this first copy a couple years
ago<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:30.470> my<00:00:31.470> gamecube<00:00:32.099> killed<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.790> disc<00:00:33.090> as

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
ago and my gamecube killed the disc as

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.010 
ago and my gamecube killed the disc as
you<00:00:33.870> can<00:00:34.050> see<00:00:34.260> here<00:00:35.239> so<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.270> bought<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> second

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
you can see here so I bought a second

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.450 
you can see here so I bought a second
copy<00:00:38.510> which<00:00:39.510> works<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.020> fine<00:00:40.469> barren<00:00:41.309> bar

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460

rather than being shown just in English

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.080 
rather than being shown just in English
it's<00:02:02.100> shown<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.579> English<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.570> Spanish<00:02:04.320> and

it's shown in English and Spanish and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.850 
it's shown in English and Spanish and
when<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.119> opened<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.899> up<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.290> looked<00:02:07.380> at<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
when I opened it up and looked at the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.149 
when I opened it up and looked at the
manuals<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.750> realized<00:02:09.750> there<00:02:10.259> wasn't<00:02:10.440> just<00:02:10.770> an

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
manuals I realized there wasn't just an

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:17.100 
manuals I realized there wasn't just an
but<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.760> Spanish<00:02:13.480> manual<00:02:14.049> as<00:02:14.200> well<00:02:15.629> so<00:02:16.629> enough

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
but a Spanish manual as well so enough

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.270 
but a Spanish manual as well so enough
this<00:02:17.349> was<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.590> game<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.040> was<00:02:18.159> released

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
this was a game that was released

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.149 
this was a game that was released
further<00:02:19.000> south<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:20.519> know<00:02:21.519> it<00:02:21.970> isn't<00:02:22.269> I<00:02:23.159> don't

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
further south I know it isn't I don't

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.160 
further south I know it isn't I don't
think<00:02:24.730> it's<00:02:25.060> from<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:27.549> Spanish<00:02:28.150> because<00:02:29.019> it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
think it's from the Spanish because it

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.309 
think it's from the Spanish because it
plays<00:02:29.530> perfectly<00:02:29.829> for<00:02:30.400> my<00:02:30.670> GameCube<00:02:31.510> it's<00:02:32.140> no

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
plays perfectly for my GameCube it's no

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.300 
plays perfectly for my GameCube it's no
walk<00:02:32.680> out<00:02:32.890> features<00:02:33.400> or<00:02:33.640> anything<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.950> it

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
walk out features or anything and it

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.970 
walk out features or anything and it
plays<00:02:36.489> exactly<00:02:36.879> the<00:02:37.090> same<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.829> during<00:02:38.829> the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
plays exactly the same and during the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.890 
plays exactly the same and during the
game<00:02:39.010> there<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:39.459> no<00:02:39.670> option<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.510> switch

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
game there is no option to switch

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.130 
game there is no option to switch
between<00:02:41.140> English<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:41.980> Spanish<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:43.900> don't

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
between English and Spanish so I don't

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.180 
between English and Spanish so I don't
understand<00:02:44.739> why<00:02:45.659> the<00:02:46.659> cover<00:02:47.170> for<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.650> game<00:02:47.859> is

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
understand why the cover for the game is

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.270 
understand why the cover for the game is
in<00:02:48.879> English<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.569> Spanish<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:53.200> all<00:02:53.799> three<00:02:54.250> of

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
in English and Spanish so all three of

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.960 
in English and Spanish so all three of
these<00:02:54.549> games<00:02:54.940> have<00:02:55.239> some<00:02:55.540> differences<00:02:56.970> this

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
these games have some differences this

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.199 
these games have some differences this
one<00:02:58.269> I<00:02:58.599> guess<00:02:59.349> is<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.799> generic<00:03:00.459> version<00:03:01.200> with

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
one I guess is the generic version with

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.349 
one I guess is the generic version with
basically<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.359> basic<00:03:05.049> version<00:03:05.319> I<00:03:05.680> guess<00:03:06.400> this

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
basically the basic version I guess this

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.530 
basically the basic version I guess this
one<00:03:07.599> has<00:03:07.900> 10<00:03:08.200> games<00:03:08.470> in<00:03:08.709> one<00:03:09.299> load<00:03:10.299> they'll

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
one has 10 games in one load they'll

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.330 
one has 10 games in one load they'll
replace<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.200> dr.<00:03:11.680> wily

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
replace it dr. wily

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.110 
replace it dr. wily
third<00:03:13.060> one<00:03:13.299> brings<00:03:13.599> back<00:03:13.870> dr.<00:03:14.349> wily<00:03:14.799> but<00:03:15.699> on

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
third one brings back dr. wily but on

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.129 
third one brings back dr. wily but on
the<00:03:16.660> back<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.230> shows<00:03:17.459> English<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:18.699> Spanish<00:03:19.139> in

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
the back it shows English and Spanish in

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.030 
the back it shows English and Spanish in
the<00:03:20.290> manual<00:03:21.239> or<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.389> manuals<00:03:22.930> on<00:03:23.260> English<00:03:23.739> and

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
the manual or the manuals on English and

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.089 
the manual or the manuals on English and
Spanish<00:03:24.959> other<00:03:25.959> than<00:03:26.139> that<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.650> disc<00:03:26.889> is

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
Spanish other than that the disc is

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.770 
Spanish other than that the disc is
exactly<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.760> same<00:03:30.060> there's<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.239> basement<00:03:31.419> no

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
exactly the same there's the basement no

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.339 
exactly the same there's the basement no
it's<00:03:32.379> exactly<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.980> same<00:03:33.190> as<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.519> disc<00:03:33.730> remote

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
it's exactly the same as the disc remote

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.439 
it's exactly the same as the disc remote
so<00:03:35.349> I<00:03:35.560> don't<00:03:35.829> know<00:03:35.919> what<00:03:36.220> this<00:03:36.400> was<00:03:36.579> Batman<00:03:36.819> I
