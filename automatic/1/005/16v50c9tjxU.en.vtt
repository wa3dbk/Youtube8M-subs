00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
that it's a real push to get it all in

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.860 
that it's a real push to get it all in
the<00:01:08.330> rail<00:01:08.510> system<00:01:08.780> here<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:09.800> once<00:01:09.979> this<00:01:10.280> lock

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
the rail system here and once this lock

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.390 
the rail system here and once this lock
positively<00:01:11.870> engages<00:01:12.409> I<00:01:12.590> mean<00:01:12.740> it's<00:01:12.920> on<00:01:13.159> there

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
positively engages I mean it's on there

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.149 
positively engages I mean it's on there
it's<00:01:13.640> not<00:01:13.760> going<00:01:14.060> anywhere<00:01:14.390> yeah<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:15.470> even

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
it's not going anywhere yeah and even

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.060 
it's not going anywhere yeah and even
about<00:01:16.820> getting<00:01:17.090> off<00:01:17.240> you<00:01:17.420> really<00:01:17.540> have<00:01:17.750> to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
about getting off you really have to

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.200 
about getting off you really have to
torque<00:01:19.070> down<00:01:19.220> I<00:01:19.280> came<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:19.729> do<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:19.940> with<00:01:20.030> one

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
torque down I came and do it with one

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.840 
torque down I came and do it with one
hand<00:01:20.560> pushing<00:01:21.560> down<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:21.740> got<00:01:22.159> to<00:01:22.250> use<00:01:22.370> two<00:01:22.580> hands

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
hand pushing down I got to use two hands

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.700 
hand pushing down I got to use two hands
and<00:01:23.150> then<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:23.600> got<00:01:23.720> to<00:01:23.870> hold<00:01:24.049> that<00:01:24.229> retention

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
and then you got to hold that retention

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.590 
and then you got to hold that retention
spring<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:25.400> then<00:01:25.490> pull<00:01:25.820> it<00:01:25.940> off<00:01:26.090> there<00:01:26.420> and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
spring and then pull it off there and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.539 
spring and then pull it off there and
that<00:01:27.260> there<00:01:27.560> it's<00:01:27.740> already<00:01:27.950> squeezing<00:01:28.400> on<00:01:28.490> the

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
that there it's already squeezing on the

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.039 
that there it's already squeezing on the
rail<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.150> it's<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.299> little<00:01:29.390> difficult<00:01:29.630> let's

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
rail so it's a little difficult let's

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.750 
rail so it's a little difficult let's
take<00:01:30.200> on<00:01:30.409> off<00:01:30.619> but<00:01:30.890> it's<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.130> really<00:01:31.400> solid

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
take on off but it's a really solid

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.359 
take on off but it's a really solid
piece<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:32.420> it<00:01:33.229> really<00:01:33.260> just<00:01:33.680> becomes<00:01:34.010> part<00:01:34.100> of

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
piece and it really just becomes part of

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.640 
piece and it really just becomes part of
the<00:01:34.460> gun<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.540> feels<00:01:35.780> great<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.350> weight<00:01:36.500> is

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
the gun so it feels great the weight is

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.380 
the gun so it feels great the weight is
nice<00:01:36.860> it<00:01:37.280> doesn't<00:01:37.549> really<00:01:37.640> add<00:01:37.760> too<00:01:38.210> much

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
nice it doesn't really add too much

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.350 
nice it doesn't really add too much
weight<00:01:38.659> to<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.170> gun<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:40.070> begin<00:01:40.310> with<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:40.760> it's

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
weight to the gun to begin with so it's

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.670 
weight to the gun to begin with so it's
pretty<00:01:41.540> comfortable<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:42.229> use<00:01:44.500> I'll<00:01:45.500> pick<00:01:45.650> it

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
pretty comfortable to use I'll pick it

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.810 
pretty comfortable to use I'll pick it
up<00:01:45.860> here<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.970> I'll<00:01:47.240> kind<00:01:47.479> of<00:01:47.540> show<00:01:47.600> you<00:01:47.810> what

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
up here and I'll kind of show you what

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.120 
up here and I'll kind of show you what
the<00:01:49.820> output<00:01:49.850> is<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.479> light<00:01:50.659> output<00:01:50.900> says<00:01:51.530> 35

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
the output is the light output says 35

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.960 
the output is the light output says 35
lumens<00:01:52.750> take<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:53.869> in<00:01:53.990> here<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:54.380> dark<00:01:54.680> area

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
lumens take it in here to a dark area

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.609 
lumens take it in here to a dark area
and<00:01:55.970> you<00:01:56.150> can<00:01:56.270> see<00:01:56.540> that<00:01:56.689> that<00:01:56.840> is<00:01:56.900> plenty

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
and you can see that that is plenty

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.130 
and you can see that that is plenty
bright<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.850> can<00:01:58.970> also<00:01:59.119> see<00:01:59.509> that<00:01:59.750> the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
bright and you can also see that the

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.429 
bright and you can also see that the
center<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:01.310> light<00:02:02.299> is<00:02:02.509> pretty<00:02:03.229> much

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
center of that light is pretty much

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.440 
center of that light is pretty much
point<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.400> aim<00:02:04.780> for<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.920> front<00:02:07.189> sight

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
point of aim for the the front sight

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.599 
point of aim for the the front sight
post<00:02:08.450> so<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.619> can<00:02:09.739> almost<00:02:09.889> get<00:02:10.219> away<00:02:10.340> with

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:10.609 
post so you can almost get away with

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.380 
post so you can almost get away with
just<00:02:10.900> aiming<00:02:11.900> with<00:02:12.319> that<00:02:12.590> that's

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
just aiming with that that's

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.140 
just aiming with that that's
or<00:02:13.450> blow<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:13.930> light<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.670> like<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.790> said<00:02:16.000> it's

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
or blow of light and like I said it's
