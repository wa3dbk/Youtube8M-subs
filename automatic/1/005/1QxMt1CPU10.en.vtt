00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.940 
piercing mat is a wonderful stamping of
tool<00:00:52.430> when<00:00:53.090> we<00:00:53.390> are<00:00:53.750> using<00:00:54.050> our<00:00:54.320> photopolymer

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
tool when we are using our photopolymer

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.610 
tool when we are using our photopolymer
so<00:00:55.670> what<00:00:55.880> I<00:00:55.910> have<00:00:56.180> done<00:00:56.360> is<00:00:56.570> taken<00:00:56.780> a<00:00:57.050> piece<00:00:57.440> of

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
so what I have done is taken a piece of

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.160 
so what I have done is taken a piece of
grit<00:00:57.860> paper<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.490> just<00:00:58.730> taped<00:00:59.090> it<00:00:59.300> on<00:00:59.540> top<00:00:59.840> of

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
grit paper and just taped it on top of

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.850 
grit paper and just taped it on top of
one<00:01:00.590> of<00:01:00.890> my<00:01:01.870> piercing<00:01:02.870> minutes<00:01:03.200> that<00:01:03.650> way<00:01:03.829> I

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
one of my piercing minutes that way I

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.039 
one of my piercing minutes that way I
don't<00:01:04.129> get<00:01:04.339> any<00:01:04.640> ink<00:01:05.089> on<00:01:06.880> my<00:01:07.880> piercing<00:01:08.390> map<00:01:08.570> so

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
don't get any ink on my piercing map so

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.850 
don't get any ink on my piercing map so
I'm<00:01:09.140> going<00:01:09.470> to<00:01:09.649> bring<00:01:09.950> in<00:01:10.549> that<00:01:11.409> lotus<00:01:12.409> flower

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
I'm going to bring in that lotus flower

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.940 
I'm going to bring in that lotus flower
and<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:14.450> thing<00:01:14.810> is<00:01:15.200> because<00:01:15.530> it's

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
and the thing is because it's

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.310 
and the thing is because it's
photopolymer<00:01:16.550> it<00:01:16.940> has<00:01:17.180> no<00:01:17.450> cushion<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.170> so

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
photopolymer it has no cushion and so

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.620 
photopolymer it has no cushion and so
when<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:18.620> use<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.100> piercing<00:01:19.550> mat<00:01:19.729> it<00:01:20.180> just

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
when you use the piercing mat it just

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.670 
when you use the piercing mat it just
makes<00:01:21.080> for<00:01:21.440> great<00:01:22.570> cutting<00:01:23.570> our<00:01:24.020> stamping

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
makes for great cutting our stamping

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.520 
makes for great cutting our stamping
surface<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:25.610> this<00:01:25.909> stamp<00:01:26.330> is<00:01:26.690> considered

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
surface so this stamp is considered

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.950 
surface so this stamp is considered
two-step<00:01:28.250> but<00:01:28.490> actually<00:01:29.030> it's<00:01:29.240> three<00:01:29.659> steps

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
two-step but actually it's three steps

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.260 
two-step but actually it's three steps
and<00:01:30.290> Stampin<00:01:31.100> Up<00:01:31.220> is<00:01:31.370> telling<00:01:31.760> us<00:01:31.909> to<00:01:32.090> do<00:01:32.240> a

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
and Stampin Up is telling us to do a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.940 
and Stampin Up is telling us to do a
little<00:01:32.690> bit<00:01:32.960> different<00:01:33.409> than<00:01:33.560> we<00:01:33.740> normally

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
little bit different than we normally

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.610 
little bit different than we normally
did<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:34.670> always<00:01:35.240> started<00:01:35.600> with<00:01:35.690> my<00:01:35.960> boldest<00:01:36.440> and

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
did I always started with my boldest and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.260 
did I always started with my boldest and
my<00:01:36.740> lightest<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.310> worked<00:01:37.549> up<00:01:37.790> they<00:01:38.240> are

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
my lightest and worked up they are

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.390 
my lightest and worked up they are
telling<00:01:39.080> us<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.440> start<00:01:39.740> with<00:01:39.920> our<00:01:40.100> diet

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
telling us to start with our diet

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.750 
telling us to start with our diet
darkest<00:01:41.299> and<00:01:41.540> move<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.619> our<00:01:42.770> lightest<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.580> it

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
darkest and move to our lightest and it

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.910 
darkest and move to our lightest and it
kind<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.240> gives<00:01:44.450> a<00:01:44.659> different<00:01:45.350> appeal<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:48.530> our

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
kind of gives a different appeal to our

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.020 
kind of gives a different appeal to our
image<00:01:49.880> because<00:01:50.240> we're<00:01:50.479> stamping<00:01:50.869> over<00:01:51.530> top<00:01:51.830> of

image because we're stamping over top of

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.399 
image because we're stamping over top of
something<00:01:53.030> else<00:01:53.299> that's<00:01:53.659> neat<00:01:53.930> with<00:01:54.260> the

something else that's neat with the
lotus<00:01:54.770> flower<00:01:55.100> it<00:01:55.610> does<00:01:55.939> have<00:01:56.420> I<00:01:56.750> don't<00:01:56.900> know

that again my machine sometimes if your

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.060 
that again my machine sometimes if your
machines

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
machines

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.240 
machines
stops<00:04:33.370> cutting<00:04:34.030> well<00:04:34.240> it<00:04:34.870> is<00:04:35.110> because<00:04:35.650> your

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
stops cutting well it is because your

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.180 
stops cutting well it is because your
mats<00:04:36.760> are<00:04:37.210> bowed<00:04:37.570> which<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:38.350> may<00:04:38.530> be<00:04:38.590> some<00:04:39.070> of

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
mats are bowed which that may be some of

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.880 
mats are bowed which that may be some of
the<00:04:39.280> case<00:04:39.490> with<00:04:39.850> mine<00:04:40.360> but<00:04:40.900> also<00:04:41.050> my<00:04:41.380> machine

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
the case with mine but also my machine

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.460 
the case with mine but also my machine
is<00:04:42.100> getting<00:04:42.310> older<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.090> so<00:04:43.930> that<00:04:44.110> makes<00:04:44.320> a

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
is getting older and so that makes a

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.210 
is getting older and so that makes a
difference<00:04:44.830> too<00:04:45.100> so<00:04:45.730> what<00:04:45.970> I'm<00:04:46.090> gonna<00:04:46.240> do<00:04:46.570> is

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
difference too so what I'm gonna do is

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.460 
difference too so what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:04:48.220> going<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.610> not<00:04:49.270> use<00:04:49.540> this<00:04:49.810> piece<00:04:50.050> I<00:04:50.290> can
