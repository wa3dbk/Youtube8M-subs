 hey i want to show you something today 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.279
 which I myself until recently 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.560
 I did not know that for mine 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.580
 all possible lured and which in the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.440
 antique to go 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.090
 there you will find this swirl the 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.090
 exact coordinates I'm nervous 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.490
 competed 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.930
 there jump in or fly like that 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.740
 I now just simple 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.740
 for purely there 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.590
 dana 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.940
 can you in a small 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:51.820
 come down to meet actually 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.870
 nothing like you look at this 8 11 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.970
 3 because in front 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.370
 which I once addressed 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.470
 and I almost offer it back to me 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.660
 Offered but I want that now 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.960
 not at all because I want something for you 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.320
 indicate the swing you will find a 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.840
 few chania ghosts in the end 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.470
 are you think I'm level 11 or something and so 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.190
 you will find the demons hunter cellarius 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.020
 teacher butler a level 12 mon 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.880
 I do not know what he is doing here, but he does 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.970
 She dropped her order after I went twice 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.610
 in the house and finally to his 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.270
 object part of a quest designed 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.800
 which is of course accepted and 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.509
 Now we come to our brothers too 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.289
 Im back because we want to get out of the cave 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.399
 he out again so i want this one 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.399
 leave the place 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:53.100
 there you also see that we have this 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:54.690
 away quasi comes out and built up leaves 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.729
 Of course, otherwise, the whole thing 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.260
 no sense what I mean by the way 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.540
 It's a shame that this one is 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.560
 he succeeds by submitting the quest 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.869
 from this demon hunter gets the cave 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.399
 That's not for the horde 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.959
 So, there is really only if you do 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.850
 in alianza or if you have 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.250
 I would like to upload it somehow 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.920
 have seen the wolf is level 12 of the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.000
 Wachbach is also for little characters 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:26.400
 and then you can stop here in London 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:32.300
 in the bÃ¼ndnerland submit the quest and 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.300
 gets said success 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.610
 press on it because 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.200
 for success in the bag and 10 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.269
 Success points more 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.269
 I wish you much fun bye 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:58.729
