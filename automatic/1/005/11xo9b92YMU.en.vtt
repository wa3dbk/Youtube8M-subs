00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:23.570
 to dog life to sick- minded people 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.519
 they look at us badly for liking this shit 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.960
 I many call us rapper trying 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.970
 offend because they do not understand our 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.980
 way of being here life will be our 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.509
 sentence we work to win a whore 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.010
 misery you know this is not like 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.780
 I would like strong violence in these 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.370
 sidewalks where rich steal poor 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.559
 they pay banks in fiber that the town 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.480
 Rescue then put laws that bind us 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.489
 laws that are like gags treat us 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.469
 As if we were rats, this is enough 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.940
 let's try this rhyme are not a 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.620
 revenge in the essence of take my 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.930
 hope collected in stained lines 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.609
 with ink with them he tried to decipher what 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.590
 that mind and soul do not plot in this body 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.590
 that also has strong but calmly I 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.510
 I'm tired of those vivas who say that 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.399
 they want you go to another ahead you 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.110
 they leave and then they say they feel it for 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.729
 that you play with my feelings so that 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.950
 you lie to me, I'm not going to be fooled anymore 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.810
 I'm going to leave them for their snakes 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.060
 thrown in a hole before it falls 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.470
 again in this fucking game cry and still 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.210
 of this board I am not the king who 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.130
 fuck the whole world and spill 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.320
 too many tears for pibas to which 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.880
 it did not matter, I still have scars 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.890
 wounds that were infected 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.810
 then I armed myself with sharp blades like 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.729
 given stained with ink with a lot of 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.110
 blood and it will be in it embodied the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.330
 words that hover in my head 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.430
 I try to look out there but I do not see 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.899
 nothing I only hate if looks killed already 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.090
 I would be chained locked in between 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.800
 four walls blindfolded and 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.460
 all those bastards would already be 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.460
 buried 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.040
 I can talk to you about crumb policy 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.690
 and everything that fucks me day by day what 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.940
 could not do is inculcate my values 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.590
 and also the gap for more laments like that 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.390
 that stops scratching that I already broke your 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.250
 I gave it to my cardboard colleagues 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.320
 so that other joints could be made 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.270
 He smoked as fast as time and 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.840
 who enjoys this moment I understand 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.840
 I give it
