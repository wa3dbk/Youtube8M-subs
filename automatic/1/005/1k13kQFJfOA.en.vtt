a<00:00:38.280> v6<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.329> an<00:00:39.450> automatic<00:00:39.809> transmission<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
a v6 with an automatic transmission and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.860 
a v6 with an automatic transmission and
before<00:00:41.760> any<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.059> guys<00:00:42.180> asked<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> reason

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
before any of you guys asked the reason

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.110 
before any of you guys asked the reason
why<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> went<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> v6<00:00:43.579> will<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.700> explained

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
why I went with a v6 will be explained

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.990 
why I went with a v6 will be explained
in<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> next<00:00:45.539> video<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.710> I'll<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.980> doing<00:00:47.100> but

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
in the next video that I'll be doing but

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.490 
in the next video that I'll be doing but
it's<00:00:48.090> mostly<00:00:48.360> because<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.600> mileage<00:00:49.170> and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
it's mostly because of mileage and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.580 
it's mostly because of mileage and
because<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> v6<00:00:50.640> gives<00:00:51.570> plenty<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.110> power<00:00:52.289> and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
because the v6 gives plenty of power and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.380 
because the v6 gives plenty of power and
plenty<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.980> torque<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.879> thing<00:00:54.120> has<00:00:54.239> more

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
plenty of torque this thing has more

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.260 
plenty of torque this thing has more
power<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.960> torque<00:00:55.170> than<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.530> v6<00:00:56.190> r<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> v8<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
power and torque than the v6 r the v8 of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.830 
power and torque than the v6 r the v8 of
the<00:00:57.510> 90s<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> pretty<00:00:59.070> powerful

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
the 90s so this is a pretty powerful

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.910 
the 90s so this is a pretty powerful
engine<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.170> bit<00:01:01.289> disappointing<00:01:01.469> it

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
engine it is a bit disappointing it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740 
engine it is a bit disappointing it
doesn't<00:01:02.129> sound<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:02.520> good<00:01:02.609> as<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> v8<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.480> a

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
doesn't sound as good as the v8 but a

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.420 
doesn't sound as good as the v8 but a
little<00:01:04.379> bit<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.530> modifications<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.309> could

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
little bit of modifications you could

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.880 
little bit of modifications you could
make<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> sound<00:01:05.880> pretty<00:01:06.210> good<00:01:06.590> now<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.710> terms

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
make the sound pretty good now in terms

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.850 
make the sound pretty good now in terms
of<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> automatic<00:01:08.430> transmission<00:01:09.409> I<00:01:10.409> was

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
of the automatic transmission I was

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.980 
of the automatic transmission I was
handed<00:01:11.220> down<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.549> car<00:01:11.790> from<00:01:12.479> someone<00:01:12.810> else

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
handed down this car from someone else

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.350 
handed down this car from someone else
and<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.439> took<00:01:13.500> over<00:01:13.799> payments<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.610> wasn't

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and I took over payments it wasn't

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.850 
and I took over payments it wasn't
really<00:01:15.540> my<00:01:15.689> option<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.470> choose<00:01:16.650> which

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
really my option to choose which

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.039 
really my option to choose which
transmission<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.720> fair<00:01:18.990> I

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
transmission I have and to be fair I

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.960 
transmission I have and to be fair I
kind<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.560> prefer<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.580> automatic

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
kind of prefer the automatic

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.490 
kind of prefer the automatic
transmission<00:01:21.600> because<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.960> commute<00:01:22.259> daily

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
transmission because I commute daily

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.219 
transmission because I commute daily
deal<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.250> traffic<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.030> at<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> same<00:01:24.960> time

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
deal with traffic and at the same time

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.740 
deal with traffic and at the same time
the<00:01:26.189> shifters<00:01:26.640> are<00:01:26.790> actually<00:01:27.119> pretty<00:01:27.330> fun<00:01:27.600> in

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the shifters are actually pretty fun in

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.660 
the shifters are actually pretty fun in
terms<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> paddle<00:01:28.439> shifting<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.610> do

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
terms of the paddle shifting and I do

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.609 
terms of the paddle shifting and I do
enjoy<00:01:30.090> having<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.689> because<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.229> lot<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
enjoy having that because a lot of the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.490 
enjoy having that because a lot of the
high<00:01:31.890> rep<00:01:32.159> cars<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.960> you<00:01:33.960> know<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.079> kind<00:01:34.409> of

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
high rep cars that you know I kind of

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.380 
high rep cars that you know I kind of
dream<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.979> having<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.490> day<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.240> it'll

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
dream of having one day but it'll

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.940 
dream of having one day but it'll
probably<00:01:36.570> never<00:01:36.780> happen<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> paddle

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
probably never happen do have the paddle

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.980 
probably never happen do have the paddle
shifters<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:39.150> kind<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.450> cool<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:39.840> able

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
shifters so it's kind of cool to be able

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.550

you'll<00:05:28.580> be<00:05:28.669> able<00:05:28.759> to<00:05:28.909> hear<00:05:29.090> it<00:05:29.349> now<00:05:30.349> we're

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:30.469 
you'll be able to hear it now we're

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:31.689 
you'll be able to hear it now we're
gonna<00:05:30.560> go<00:05:30.680> ahead<00:05:30.740> and<00:05:30.860> pop<00:05:31.009> the<00:05:31.219> hood<00:05:31.250> and<00:05:31.400> see

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
gonna go ahead and pop the hood and see

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.430 
gonna go ahead and pop the hood and see
what<00:05:31.820> I've<00:05:31.909> done<00:05:32.030> in<00:05:32.180> there<00:05:32.360> so<00:05:32.960> under<00:05:33.320> the

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
what I've done in there so under the

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.510 
what I've done in there so under the
hood<00:05:33.469> we've<00:05:33.919> got<00:05:34.159> the<00:05:34.400> phase<00:05:34.880> tech<00:05:35.210> x5<00:05:36.520> cold

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
hood we've got the phase tech x5 cold

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.779 
hood we've got the phase tech x5 cold
air<00:05:37.669> intake<00:05:38.060> which<00:05:39.070> just<00:05:40.070> adds<00:05:40.340> a<00:05:40.520> bit<00:05:40.669> of

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
air intake which just adds a bit of

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.700 
air intake which just adds a bit of
throttle<00:05:41.449> response<00:05:41.719> actually<00:05:42.349> helps<00:05:42.590> my

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
throttle response actually helps my

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.399 
throttle response actually helps my
mileage<00:05:43.130> quite<00:05:43.400> a<00:05:43.430> bit<00:05:43.669> and<00:05:43.969> just<00:05:44.960> overall

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
mileage quite a bit and just overall

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.850 
mileage quite a bit and just overall
helps<00:05:45.680> cool<00:05:45.889> the<00:05:46.070> engine<00:05:46.370> better<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:47.860> you

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
helps cool the engine better and you

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.159 
helps cool the engine better and you
know<00:05:48.919> that's<00:05:49.070> really<00:05:49.159> the<00:05:49.340> only<00:05:49.370> mod<00:05:50.169> under

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
know that's really the only mod under

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:52.659 
know that's really the only mod under
the<00:05:51.289> hood<00:05:51.469> and<00:05:51.740> it<00:05:51.860> probably<00:05:52.159> will<00:05:52.280> stay<00:05:52.490> the

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
the hood and it probably will stay the

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.240 
the hood and it probably will stay the
only<00:05:52.699> mod<00:05:53.090> for<00:05:53.360> a<00:05:53.389> while<00:05:53.919> but<00:05:54.919> down<00:05:55.069> the<00:05:55.219> road

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
only mod for a while but down the road

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.879 
only mod for a while but down the road
forced<00:05:55.880> induction<00:05:56.229> will<00:05:57.229> probably<00:05:57.560> be<00:05:57.650> a<00:05:57.680> good

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
forced induction will probably be a good

00:05:57.889 --> 00:05:59.589 
forced induction will probably be a good
thing<00:05:58.099> to<00:05:58.190> do<00:05:58.340> and<00:05:58.610> possibly<00:05:59.030> long<00:05:59.330> tube

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599 
thing to do and possibly long tube

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.550 
thing to do and possibly long tube
headers<00:06:00.520> but<00:06:01.520> that's<00:06:01.669> it<00:06:01.819> for<00:06:01.849> now<00:06:02.120> I<00:06:02.389> have<00:06:03.110> a

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
headers but that's it for now I have a

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.059 
headers but that's it for now I have a
red<00:06:04.520> dome<00:06:04.849> light<00:06:05.120> up<00:06:05.300> here<00:06:05.539> and<00:06:05.840> down<00:06:06.800> here

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:07.069 
red dome light up here and down here

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:09.850 
red dome light up here and down here
there's<00:06:07.250> a<00:06:07.370> switch<00:06:07.699> that<00:06:07.969> one<00:06:08.719> flicked<00:06:09.080> would

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
there's a switch that one flicked would

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.820 
there's a switch that one flicked would
normally<00:06:10.159> turn<00:06:10.340> on<00:06:10.490> red<00:06:10.699> foot<00:06:11.060> well<00:06:11.240> lights

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
normally turn on red foot well lights

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.080 
normally turn on red foot well lights
but<00:06:12.830> they've<00:06:12.979> been<00:06:13.190> damaged<00:06:13.699> a<00:06:13.759> little<00:06:13.880> bit

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
but they've been damaged a little bit

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.330 
but they've been damaged a little bit
and<00:06:14.270> I<00:06:14.330> have<00:06:14.449> to<00:06:14.599> repair<00:06:14.900> them<00:06:15.110> because<00:06:15.500> the

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
and I have to repair them because the

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.920 
and I have to repair them because the
people<00:06:16.520> that<00:06:16.729> installed<00:06:17.210> them<00:06:17.419> originally

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
people that installed them originally

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.110 
people that installed them originally
screwed<00:06:18.500> up<00:06:18.650> I<00:06:18.919> probably<00:06:19.699> should<00:06:19.909> have<00:06:20.000> never

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
screwed up I probably should have never

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.320 
screwed up I probably should have never
had<00:06:20.360> them<00:06:20.479> installed<00:06:20.870> by<00:06:21.620> someone<00:06:22.099> else<00:06:22.330> but

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
had them installed by someone else but

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.939 
had them installed by someone else but
I'll<00:06:23.479> get<00:06:23.599> that<00:06:23.719> fixed<00:06:24.020> soon<00:06:24.199> and<00:06:24.440> I<00:06:24.530> also<00:06:24.680> have

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:24.949 
I'll get that fixed soon and I also have

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.559 
I'll get that fixed soon and I also have
a<00:06:25.389> Cobra<00:06:27.130> radar<00:06:28.130> detector<00:06:28.580> there<00:06:28.759> so<00:06:29.449> yeah

affected the performance of this car and
and<00:06:49.340> you<00:06:49.550> know<00:06:49.669> the<00:06:49.850> overall<00:06:50.350> experience<00:06:51.350> of
