 is 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.690
 why I sent the email with 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.389
 attached with this link attached and the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.130
 files you need to download despite there 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.490
 may take some time because I am 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.400
 however files as heavy as ever 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.100
 do are these three pdf files of del 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.900
 cartoon for revenge for seats 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.850
 I'm going to explain a method to you now 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.620

 he's probably trying a little bit 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.750
 because they are a bit heavy as a file 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:32.360
