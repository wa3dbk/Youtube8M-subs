00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.330 
and this tutorial it goes over making
chrome<00:00:05.430> and<00:00:05.790> ceramic<00:00:06.540> materials<00:00:07.080> so<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:07.980> have

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
chrome and ceramic materials so I have

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.040 
chrome and ceramic materials so I have
my<00:00:08.550> scene<00:00:08.760> here<00:00:09.030> which<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.450> just<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.719> bunch<00:00:09.929> of

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
my scene here which is just a bunch of

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.520 
my scene here which is just a bunch of
objects<00:00:11.120> around<00:00:12.120> on<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> ground<00:00:12.690> plane<00:00:12.960> no

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
objects around on a ground plane no

objects around on a ground plane no
materials<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> mute<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:15.560> here's<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
materials on the mute so here's just the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.970 
materials on the mute so here's just the
render<00:00:17.520> process<00:00:18.199> like<00:00:19.199> caching<00:00:19.590> irradiance

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
render process like caching irradiance

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.000 
render process like caching irradiance
mapping<00:00:20.869> you<00:00:21.869> know<00:00:21.990> special<00:00:22.439> environment

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
mapping you know special environment

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.980 
mapping you know special environment
settings<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.820> our<00:00:24.180> render<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:24.810> going<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
settings so our render is just going to

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.300 
settings so our render is just going to
be<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> kind<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.460> flat<00:00:26.460> gray<00:00:27.080> so<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.680> had<00:00:28.980> some

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
be a kind of flat gray so I had some

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.150 
be a kind of flat gray so I had some
materials<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.060> scene<00:00:30.330> now<00:00:30.439> so<00:00:31.439> open<00:00:32.040> up

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
materials to the scene now so open up

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.569 
materials to the scene now so open up
the<00:00:32.369> material<00:00:33.329> editor<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.190> right-click<00:00:35.190> on

layer<00:00:52.969> this<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.120> going<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.329> give<00:00:54.449> me<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
layer this is going to give me a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.319 
layer this is going to give me a
reflection<00:00:55.559> layer<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.489> top<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.180> my

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
reflection layer here on top of my

diffuse layer so if I click on the M

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.849 
diffuse layer so if I click on the M
next<00:01:00.210> -<00:01:00.359> reflection<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.050> will<00:01:01.230> bring<00:01:01.350> up<00:01:01.530> the

I<00:01:23.840> have<00:01:24.170> Micro<00:01:24.590> material<00:01:25.100> applied<00:01:27.909> so<00:01:28.909> while

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
I have Micro material applied so while

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.410 
I have Micro material applied so while
we're<00:01:29.900> here<00:01:30.110> we're<00:01:30.290> gonna<00:01:30.380> add<00:01:30.619> a<00:01:31.420> ceramic

glossiness to 0.9 and the reflection

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.130 
glossiness to 0.9 and the reflection
glossiness<00:02:22.310> as<00:02:22.580> well<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:23.030> 0.9<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:25.989> lastly<00:02:26.989> I'm

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
glossiness as well to 0.9 and lastly I'm

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.630 
glossiness as well to 0.9 and lastly I'm
going<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.380> go<00:02:27.470> into<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:27.890> diffuse<00:02:28.310> settings

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
going to go into the diffuse settings

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.280 
going to go into the diffuse settings
and<00:02:28.880> change<00:02:29.720> them<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:31.660> this<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:32.720> going<00:02:33.049> to<00:02:33.110> be

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
and change them so this is going to be

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:41.020 
and change them so this is going to be
the<00:02:33.500> color<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:34.010> my<00:02:34.850> material<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:39.880> just<00:02:40.880> do<00:02:41.000> a

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
the color of my material so just do a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.880 
the color of my material so just do a
quick<00:02:41.360> preview<00:02:41.630> again<00:02:42.049> so<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:42.350> can<00:02:42.380> see<00:02:42.530> what

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
quick preview again so we can see what

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.370 
quick preview again so we can see what
we're<00:02:43.040> working<00:02:43.220> with

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
we're working with

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.340 
we're working with
and<00:02:45.380> we<00:02:46.280> can<00:02:46.459> see<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.940> reflection<00:02:47.120> this<00:02:47.930> like

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
and we can see the reflection this like

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.370 
and we can see the reflection this like
Clausius<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:50.090> i'm<00:02:50.239> gonna<00:02:50.510> select<00:02:50.690> a<00:02:50.930> material

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
Clausius and i'm gonna select a material

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.699 
Clausius and i'm gonna select a material
right<00:02:52.340> click<00:02:52.519> on<00:02:52.670> ceramic<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.420> apply<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.560> to

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
right click on ceramic and apply it to

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.900 
right click on ceramic and apply it to
that<00:02:54.859> material<00:02:56.019> so<00:02:57.070> close<00:02:58.070> out<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.459> material

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
that material so close out the material

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.380 
that material so close out the material
editor<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.530> go<00:03:00.530> ahead

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
editor and go ahead

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.080 
editor and go ahead
we<00:03:01.540> render<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:04.450> now<00:03:05.350> we<00:03:05.410> can<00:03:05.800> see<00:03:06.100> our

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
we render and now we can see our

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.930 
we render and now we can see our
rendering<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.350> can<00:03:08.500> see<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.830> HDRI<00:03:09.610> that

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
rendering and you can see the HDRI that

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.480 
rendering and you can see the HDRI that
we<00:03:10.030> have<00:03:10.270> in<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.810> background<00:03:10.990> slot<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:12.340> that's

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
we have in the background slot so that's

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.370 
we have in the background slot so that's
not<00:03:12.700> affecting<00:03:13.120> our<00:03:13.209> lighting<00:03:13.540> but<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.870> is<00:03:14.020> a

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
not affecting our lighting but it is a

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.740 
not affecting our lighting but it is a
riff<00:03:14.740> let<00:03:15.010> he's<00:03:15.580> affecting<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.209> reflections

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
riff let he's affecting the reflections

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.810 
riff let he's affecting the reflections
in<00:03:16.990> both<00:03:17.260> our<00:03:17.410> ceramic<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.070> our<00:03:18.550> chrome

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
in both our ceramic and our chrome

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.730 
in both our ceramic and our chrome
material<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:21.900> there<00:03:22.900> are<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.170> reflections

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
material so there are the reflections

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.400 
material so there are the reflections
there<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.310> that's<00:03:25.240> it<00:03:25.450> for<00:03:25.750> making<00:03:26.080> chrome

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
there and that's it for making chrome

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.550 
there and that's it for making chrome
and<00:03:26.620> ceramic<00:03:27.040> materials
