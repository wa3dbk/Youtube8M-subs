part the glitch but anyway once you've
done<00:01:25.780> that<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:26.080> can<00:01:26.110> see<00:01:26.439> that<00:01:26.470> you<00:01:26.680> can<00:01:26.799> go

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
done that you can see that you can go

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.710 
done that you can see that you can go
ahead<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:27.159> test<00:01:27.490> it<00:01:27.700> save<00:01:27.939> it<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.180> publish<00:01:28.360> it

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
ahead and test it save it and publish it

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.480 
ahead and test it save it and publish it
and<00:01:28.840> once<00:01:29.259> you<00:01:29.380> publish<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.890> as<00:01:30.040> you<00:01:30.189> can<00:01:30.340> see

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
and once you publish it as you can see

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.550 
and once you publish it as you can see
here<00:01:30.820> is<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:30.939> red<00:01:31.240> helicopter<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.020> what<00:01:32.380> it

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
here is the red helicopter and what it

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.590 
here is the red helicopter and what it
actually<00:01:32.740> looks<00:01:32.950> like<00:01:33.369> and<00:01:33.759> it's<00:01:34.270> basically

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
actually looks like and it's basically

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.120 
actually looks like and it's basically
something<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.200> can<00:01:35.350> show<00:01:35.500> your<00:01:35.590> friends<00:01:35.830> as

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
something you can show your friends as

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.590 
something you can show your friends as
it's<00:01:36.400> not<00:01:36.549> actually<00:01:36.909> an<00:01:37.000> able<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.329> go<00:01:37.450> online

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
it's not actually an able to go online

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.480 
it's not actually an able to go online
but<00:01:38.229> I<00:01:38.290> do<00:01:38.380> hope<00:01:38.619> they<00:01:38.799> add<00:01:38.979> this<00:01:39.189> to<00:01:39.369> the

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
but I do hope they add this to the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.950 
but I do hope they add this to the
online<00:01:39.610> as<00:01:40.030> it's<00:01:40.240> actually<00:01:40.540> a<00:01:40.570> cool<00:01:40.720> feature

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
online as it's actually a cool feature

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.060 
online as it's actually a cool feature
and<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.229> actually<00:01:41.409> looks<00:01:41.650> better<00:01:41.710> in<00:01:41.979> the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
and it actually looks better in the

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.069 
and it actually looks better in the
normal<00:01:42.400> clogger<00:01:42.640> Bob<00:01:42.909> but<00:01:43.479> anyway<00:01:43.720> that's<00:01:43.900> all
