paper back to us and will give you a
better<00:01:33.000> coverage<00:01:33.570> I've<00:01:34.079> tried<00:01:34.500> using<00:01:34.710> tombow

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
better coverage I've tried using tombow

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.730 
better coverage I've tried using tombow
and<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.150> doesn't<00:01:36.570> work<00:01:36.750> because<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.290> leaves

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
and that doesn't work because it leaves

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.090 
and that doesn't work because it leaves
you<00:01:38.329> because<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:39.479> fast<00:01:39.720> drying<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.920> could

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
you because it's fast drying you could

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.880 
you because it's fast drying you could
actually<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.729> marks<00:01:42.270> through<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> ruler
