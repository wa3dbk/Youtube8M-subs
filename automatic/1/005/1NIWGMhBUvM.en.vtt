00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.399
 amaretto 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.880
 first of all let's make the truffles 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.549
 of white chocolate for it 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.190
 we undo the chocolate in the bain marie 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.930
 we toss the chocolate and the butter 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.930
 when it is totally undone 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.910
 we add the cream 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.060
 we remove until we incorporate all the 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.460
 ingredients will pour in an ice bucket 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.610
 we give something less than half we leave 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.680
 stand about 15 minutes in the fridge 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.310
 we take out and put in each one a 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.310
 raspberry 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.590
 we just covered with the mixture of 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.590
 white chocolate 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.120
 we remove the chocolate left over and 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.270
 We booked in the fridge for a couple 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.270
 of hours 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.520
 let's prepare the crepes we crack the 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.880
 eggs we add milk the cream for 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:08.190
 mount essence of vanilla flour salt 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.190
 icing sugar and mix with the rods 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.210
 if necessary we add a little more 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.479
 flour the dough should be slightly 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.050
 thick we put some butter in 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.670
 the pan 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.010
 I have used a frying pan of 20 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.100
 centimeters we go down to medium heat with a 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.360
 dipper pour the mash of pancakes 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.729
 We spread the dough all over the bottom of 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.410
 the pan once the edges are 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.960
 facts we turn the cream and 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.979
 we left 23 minutes on the other side the 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.979
 we take out a plate 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.850
 If the pan dries brush masters with 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.850
 melted butter 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.710
 we try to always catch the same 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.390
 amount of dough with the saucepan of this 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.390
 way all the feet were equal 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.190
 we get truffles from the refrigerator we cast 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.080
 in a bowl sugar icing 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.980
 we remove it from the mold with the help of 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.980
 a sprig or spoon 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.730
 We cover them with icing sugar 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.640
 let's go with the filling and the coverage 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.370
 we put the amaretto in a saucepan 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.280
 put alcohol 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.840
 we throw the cream 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.680
 stir and when it breaks to boil 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.680
 remove from the fire 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.510
 pour the chocolate and stir with 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.720
 some rods until its complete 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.720
 dissolution 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.400
 we let it cool if we do it and 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.800
 We booked in the fridge the day before 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.740
 we heat it a bit in the microwave 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.750
 until there is a spreadable texture 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.310
 we put the first pancake on the plate 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.850
 presentation and we started to extend the 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.850
 chocolate 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.549
 we put another crepe on top and we continue 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.180
 putting together the chocolate and so 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.180
 successively 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.780
 we put the last pancake 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.180
 Now it 's good that chocolate 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.270
 be light to cover well we 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.930
 we help with a spatula to smooth 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.930
 we go over the edges 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.220
 We booked in the fridge so that 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.380
 harden 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.210
 after one hour we took out of the fridge 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.500
 sprinkle with cocoa powder and 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.340
 We crown with our truffles 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.340
 white chocolate 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.250
 let's see how we have been that 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.250
 cut 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.860
 perfect
