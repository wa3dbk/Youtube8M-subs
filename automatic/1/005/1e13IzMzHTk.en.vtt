00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
and I just take it out of the towel I

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.210 
and I just take it out of the towel I
spray<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:36.990> little<00:02:37.170> bit<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.530> this<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:37.710> before<00:02:38.010> I

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220

detangling<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.190> also<00:02:41.340> gives<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.970> little

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
detangling and it also gives it a little

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.570 
detangling and it also gives it a little
