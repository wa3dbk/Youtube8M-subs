00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.110
 two 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.750
 and here 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:30.810
 minecraft and according to non-tutorial in which 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.980
 re explain to make a gold farm yes 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.510
 guys we're here in the 13 w 37 a 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.540
 that has left a few hours ago in 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.700
 how much has gone out and it has already occurred to me 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.100
 this great idea because I have started to 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.290
 work on it and well I will try 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.059
 upload this video as soon as possible 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.270
 since it has cost me a lot very much 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.240
 do the whole mechanism and I do not want that 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.910
 Nobody came forward with a farm 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.870
 gold so big is to say that it is based 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.730
 in the design of jl it's worth that he pulled out 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.110
 very much very much time and things and 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.869
 things that we take advantage of a 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.840
 characteristic of 13 w 37 ay is that it 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.600
 can do portal is a lot more 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.479
 large and in this way then to give 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.000
 we saved a little bit of obsidian worth and 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.700
 we can do this so curious about a 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.009
 most curious way are worth less obsidian 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.890
 also going to see - pigments worth because 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.130
 good because it's like that but the thing is 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.130
 have the maximum amount of block cited 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.860
 ok so we are exposed in pigments 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.990
 let's put this on difficult and let's 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.210
 get here to see what is happening 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.360
 I've spent a bit with the size is worth 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.610
 to say that it happens a little bit to me and as 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.079
 You see we start to see the pigments falling 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.780
 I'm going to lower this in there, that is to say 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.390
 also that it is a squid farm 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.880
 of those that are why they start looking 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.920
 in a very strange way and they go from one side 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.130
 to another and from one place to another is super weird 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.380
 and as you can see, the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.740
 pigments this is starting to start 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.539
 and well the thing is that guys that 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.640
 taking advantage of one of these portals is worth 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.680
 you can make a pretty big model 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.299
 quite efficient years more 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.750
 Efficient obviously but consume 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.860
 more obsidian and it's crazy and good 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.670
 now we will look a little deeper 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:27.799
 about the science of this is how 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:31.640
 it works and I think it's going down the wall 1/7 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.859
 maybe no more time girl down for vale 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.480
 I think it's raining there's a storm 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.329
 as good as you see this is being 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.299
 filling with pigment is very fast 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.120
 we have 700 entities is a piece of 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.920
 madness 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.640
 and as you can see they are all falling here 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.620
 ok and everyone falls down there good is a 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.190
 system per fall of most 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.110
 simple and basic and nothing here 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.590
 we would have used jade now how 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.209
 it works so it's super simple guys 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.840
 basically we have here a burrada of 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.480
 portal is worth and we put a fracture 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.159
 good the structures that do then that 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.989
 the pigments think it's a block 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.360
 normal as if we do if we do 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.459
 here a normal block 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.129
 then clear they leave the portal and 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.900
 they advance and when they advance they fall and 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.220
 then one of the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.200
 problems of this orange is that 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.000
 many pigments stay still and 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.090
 from spanair 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.330
 then as you see 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.480
 there are 750 entities while here 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.140
 down then there are only 200 and so 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.540
 a third or a quarter or a quarter a 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.489
 about one third of the amount of 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.160
 mobile phones that are exposed are those 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.500
 we got together there and we can 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.480
 kill it is important that you know that 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.400
 that a lot of them stay still here 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.250
 well as you can see I'm missing some 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.500
 another area of tractors is worth trying 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.799
 check as many times for 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.780
 that I did not miss any but good and 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.370
 nothing this is what I wanted to bring you 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.590
 guys that has cost me a lot 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.150
 build you have in the description the 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.010
 link of the map so that you lots 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.260
 be for yourselves 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.090
 now we will go down there we will do the trick of 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.470
 lu ting so you can see us european 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.299
 quite pretty dzeko chairs and nothing 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.700
 tell you that that I extended with the 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.700
 size are worth you can cut from there and 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.770
 from there and also from there but what I'm going 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.949
 to do as much as possible so that 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.080
 then I do not have to be short, it's worth 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.180
 say that now I can tell you that as 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.050
 you want until there comes nothing done 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.400
 those 3 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:42.030
 last steps and nothing guys this 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.290
 It can be very useful to get down there 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.780
 when I go 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.730
 350 pigments we are going to get enough gold 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.670
 so be a few seconds imagine 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.950
 have this farm all night 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.080
 turned on it would probably have to 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.710
 make a pigment killing system 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.480
 because it is that if you do not accumulate 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.730
 tens of thousands of pigments yes and it would be 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.340
 too crazy but the guys do not 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:10.610
 we were going to have the same so we 're going to 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.490
 go down here is worth as you see 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.890
 come here all the pigments are worth 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.900
 and as you can see they are all here 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.390
 pigments let's love a sword 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.290
 with lu ting 3 to do the trick of the lu 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.870
 ting is worth it if you do not know what trick is 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.970
 it's a super-cheat trick that allows us 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.689
 use ludin with life positions 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.070
 snapshot 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:38.160
 I would like to find a perfect anvil 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:42.750
 and I would also like to put this here and 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:45.290
 put this here and perfect very well then 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.290
 let's do it 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.680
 my mother, my mother 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:58.629
 wow wow careful with that take care with that you 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:06:00.429
 I'm pulling more mother portions go 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:06.199
 gonna be 

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:08.419
 and this experience is worth as you see 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:11.360
 all this is over here there are drops that 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.789
 they are here because I already tell you the 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.969
 hoppers can not with everything as you see 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:18.499
 Well, I'm going to help the covers a little 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:20.839
 perfect as you see there is a lot of gold 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:24.019
 many swords a lot of meat look 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:25.760
 let's do an inventory to almost 16 

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:27.740
 ingots 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.350
 the amount of drops we get 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.510
 well, it's really amazing and it's channels 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.000
 well we also got a few and I 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.630
 It seems to me very well mola 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.180
 fairly whenever it can 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.400
 pick up the rest 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.430
 to man that is to say kill them by hand 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.960
 for Latin, it's very good and nothing 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.880
 guys in this is working now 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.410
 same I will start to prepare all the 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.419
 news of a snapshot in a video 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.690
 brief since it's not a synapse that 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:57.160
 come loaded with things but I 've 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:01.150
 tapped to make this video I 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:03.009
 It seemed very very very cool and nothing 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.320
 It has taken four or five hours or three or 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:06.940
 two or whatever they are but here that I have 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.030
 managed to bring and I'm pretty 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.770
 happy and nothing guys I hope that you 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.509
 I liked it a lot if you liked it 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.639
 leave your like because it has taken me 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:18.490
 a few hours I think it's 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:19.870
 pretty epic and tell you that you can 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.210
 do in your opponent is very complicated 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.889
 gathering so much obsidian is complicated 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.530
 but you can do it 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:29.050
 perfectly simply you have to have 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.210
 you want in guys I hope that I have 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.669
 liked very much 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.350
 so far I'm going to give it a peak in to see 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:39.100
 what happen 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:41.250
 now come all to me all for 

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.250
 my 

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.100
 a lot
