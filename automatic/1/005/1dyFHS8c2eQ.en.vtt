00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
motivation this week we'll talk about

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.310 
motivation this week we'll talk about
the<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.519> was<00:00:09.150> reading<00:00:09.389> some<00:00:09.540> about<00:00:09.809> some<00:00:09.990> people

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
the I was reading some about some people

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.770 
the I was reading some about some people
talking<00:00:10.500> about<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.950> brain<00:00:11.130> like<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.639> loss<00:00:11.880> /

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
talking about the brain like the loss /

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.530 
talking about the brain like the loss /
reward<00:00:13.200> pathways<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.370> brain<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:15.420> what

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
reward pathways in the brain and what

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.650 
reward pathways in the brain and what
that<00:00:15.570> means<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.230> we<00:00:16.920> all<00:00:17.070> got<00:00:17.539> pathways<00:00:18.539> in

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
that means is we all got pathways in

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.150 
that means is we all got pathways in
that<00:00:18.779> brain<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.260> motivate<00:00:19.710> us<00:00:19.890> when<00:00:20.070> it

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
that brain that motivate us when it

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.330 
that brain that motivate us when it
comes<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.609> fear<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.810> victory<00:00:22.230> or<00:00:22.529> possibility

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
comes to fear of victory or possibility

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.620 
comes to fear of victory or possibility
of<00:00:23.510> gain<00:00:24.510> for<00:00:25.410> example<00:00:26.090> this<00:00:27.090> person<00:00:27.510> was

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
of gain for example this person was

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.509 
of gain for example this person was
saying<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.470> brain<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.769> two<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.369> half

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
saying that the brain is two and a half

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.120 
saying that the brain is two and a half
times<00:00:29.880> more<00:00:30.890> motivated<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.099> avoid<00:00:33.020> fear<00:00:34.130> that

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
times more motivated to avoid fear that

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.850 
times more motivated to avoid fear that
it<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.489> motivated<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> possibility<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it is motivated for the possibility of

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.530 
it is motivated for the possibility of
gaining<00:00:38.160> something<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.790> means<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.360> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
gaining something so that means it's to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.180 
gaining something so that means it's to
you<00:00:39.690> had<00:00:39.870> two<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.230> half<00:00:40.379> times<00:00:40.590> more<00:00:40.800> likely

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
you had two and a half times more likely

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.580 
you had two and a half times more likely
in<00:00:41.460> your<00:00:41.610> brain<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.690> be<00:00:42.840> motivated<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> get

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
in your brain to be motivated to get

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.110 
in your brain to be motivated to get
away<00:00:43.710> from<00:00:43.890> something<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.520> cause<00:00:44.730> pain

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
away from something that can cause pain

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.440 
away from something that can cause pain
or<00:00:45.539> loss<00:00:46.070> then<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.280> are<00:00:47.460> motivated<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:48.210> do

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
or loss then you are motivated to do

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.639 
or loss then you are motivated to do
something<00:00:48.480> that's<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.230> cause<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.530> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
something that's going to cause you to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.709 
something that's going to cause you to
gain<00:00:49.680> anything<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:50.850> example<00:00:51.270> you're<00:00:51.449> more

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
gain anything for example you're more

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.650 
gain anything for example you're more
angry<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:53.309> lose<00:00:53.520> five<00:00:53.940> hours<00:00:54.420> then<00:00:54.629> you

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
angry if you lose five hours then you

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.600 
angry if you lose five hours then you
are<00:00:54.930> happy<00:00:55.379> if<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.649> find<00:00:55.920> five<00:00:56.219> hours

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
are happy if you find five hours

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.900 
are happy if you find five hours
basically<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.410> ways<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.609> game

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
basically so I have ways to this game

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.779 
basically so I have ways to this game
that<00:01:00.149> we<00:01:00.270> all<00:01:00.420> plan<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.170> or<00:01:01.859> any<00:01:02.160> game<00:01:02.430> any

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
that we all plan is that or any game any

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.460 
that we all plan is that or any game any
of<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.030> play<00:01:03.270> or<00:01:03.480> business<00:01:03.899> or<00:01:04.049> whatever<00:01:04.229> it

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
of you play or business or whatever it

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.130 
of you play or business or whatever it
is<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.890> doing<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.489> how<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.450> releases

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
is to doing you like how that releases

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.350 
is to doing you like how that releases
that<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:08.100> basically<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.729> turn<00:01:08.939> off<00:01:08.970> that

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that you basically have to turn off that

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.660 
that you basically have to turn off that
switch<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:10.290> motivates<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> fear<00:01:11.340> that

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
switch that motivates the fear that

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.270 
switch that motivates the fear that
motivates<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> loss<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:13.470> person<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:13.950> also

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
motivates the loss this person was also

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.219 
motivates the loss this person was also
saying<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.760> both<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.390> them<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
saying it both of them are on at the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.620 
saying it both of them are on at the
same<00:01:16.409> time<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.920> both<00:01:17.100> alert<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.790> fear<00:01:18.450> of

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
same time that both alert that fear of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.390 
same time that both alert that fear of
loss<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> possibility<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.920> gaining<00:01:20.159> are

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
loss and the possibility of gaining are

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.670 
loss and the possibility of gaining are
on<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.390> fear<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> loss<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:21.960> gonna<00:01:22.290> win<00:01:22.530> because

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
on the fear of loss is gonna win because

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.109 
on the fear of loss is gonna win because
it's<00:01:23.009> two<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.369> half<00:01:23.520> times<00:01:23.759> stronger

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
it's two and a half times stronger

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.520 
it's two and a half times stronger
that's<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> way<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.840> human<00:01:25.200> beings

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
that's just the way that human beings

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.350 
that's just the way that human beings
are<00:01:25.680> wired<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.490> all<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.850> same<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.270> all

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
are wired but it's all the same for all

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
are wired but it's all the same for all
of<00:01:27.540> us<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.259> got<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.530> completely<00:01:28.950> turn<00:01:29.159> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
of us so you got to completely turn that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.010 
of us so you got to completely turn that
switch<00:01:29.549> off<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.150> not<00:01:30.299> worry<00:01:30.570> about<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
switch off and not worry about the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.710 
switch off and not worry about the
possibility<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> loss<00:01:32.070> will<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:32.880> motivated<00:01:33.689> by

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
possibility of loss will be motivated by

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.450 
possibility of loss will be motivated by
the<00:01:33.869> fear<00:01:34.229> which<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.890> preventing<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.430> from

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the fear which is preventing you from
