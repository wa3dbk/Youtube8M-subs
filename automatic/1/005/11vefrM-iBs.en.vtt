00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
board this is the print and I made an

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.950 
board this is the print and I made an
edition<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.950> 5<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.790> this<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> really<00:00:18.660> fun

style of printmaking and it's not
complicated<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.710> uses<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> piece<00:00:23.369> of
