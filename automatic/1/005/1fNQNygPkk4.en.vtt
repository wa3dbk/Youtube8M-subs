 enter dragon that has very but very 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.599
 good animations and what you can do 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.340
 various things with him as you can see there 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.019
 He is seeing me with his little face of no no 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.460
 mates do not kill me but I'm going to kill him 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.460
 so they can see how he dies then 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.990
 It is very well made 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.640
 skyrim for video games the dragons 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.950
 they move like that then they come out 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.630
 bones and well this is very well done 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.090
 mod then one day I have 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.340
 too many this saddle here I'm going 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.470
 to take out the dragon so they can see it 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.610
 again here we have the truth 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.170
 as to seem 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.420
 let's go to a flatter area to 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.309
 give an idea and right now I teach you 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.379
 what he does is very entertaining 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.180
 this dragon and it is very well done that is 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.500
 best of all since in other ways 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.040
 that they add to the truth even though they are 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.630
 bad facts 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.790
 here we have come out of the dragon of 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.560
 first since he does not have the chair of 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.300
 obviously riding is not going to pay attention to us 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.740
 he will go wherever he wants 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.250
 if we leave because the nothing is going 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.230
 to go flying 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.330
 Well now he's happy he wants 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.680
 stay still but good to do that 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.200
 be our only thing that we have to 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.270
 to do is to give fish of this crude 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.950
 let's right click until you want 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.810
 good until you make them little hearts 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.400
 as they saw and now life appears 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.110
 of the front down when we turn to 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.340
 see if we turn around on the other side 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.500
 remove and we turn to see again 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.470
 it is said cry of the dragon and life 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.880
 abode not as they realize if we have 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.880
 what nowadays doing as a bone 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.500
 we can do it to follow us or that 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.540
 stay still but two right click 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.920

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.770

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.270
 fear cow crap haha and fire not 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.130

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.869
 side and is going to stay there is like to 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.240
 make it a place for him to fall asleep and 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.270
 they leave it there or if they want me to help them 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.100
 to your adventures to walk or go to 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.509
 where is it because the dragon has to 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.740
 continue there is everything like a tree there 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.330
 we're 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.340
 as you can see it has very good 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.590
 animations is the best this mode the 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.360
 animations the rooms move very 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.310
 Realistically with account is counted 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.320
 also the sound is very well done 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.080
 so then well let's go down to 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.530
 that to see the rest of the mod download 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.300
 and go down and dragon hurry up 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.670
 that's how you can see this lake ness 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.740
 it's half immense we always have 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.840
 but hey trees and sat and 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.430
 to drive it we can put the 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.530
 saddle just click right 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.910
 and they have the saddle we can 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.440
 climb to it 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.300
 it was removed there is 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.460
 we could climb it but do not know why 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.650
 can not open 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.840
 we are there we are above our 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.400
 dragon without how can you see this 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.510
 animation is very well done opens the 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.450
 mouth like he is dancing 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.400
 step 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.170
 or can you see the dragon yes because I have 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.190
 the black head and 'what the hell' does not 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.680
 can see the animations that are very 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.040
 good we have the dragon face 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.800
 we can go very fast very soon very 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.230
 fast and before it would be an option that 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.550
 If you gave him this type of watermelon, 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.140
 I put him with a shield and I could go through 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.050
 all the blocks but I was too 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.730
 too much of cheating and they removed it 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.830
 right now if you feed him is what 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.290
 that is being our watermelons 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.270
 nothing happens anymore it stays normal but 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.940
 they are if it is still material 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.390
 so is the head sheet 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.390
 exorcist 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.100
 well this is very well the way 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.290
 I recommend and the best part of all is that I do not 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.720
 requires force then they will tell you 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.010
 already and well you can install it with fort 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.540
 It is also true because there are two 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.190
 versions are nothing with works with matt 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.959
 loader obviously I think you guys 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.480
 they want we have loader that since it is 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:00.640
 much better and also if we lower the 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.640
 life to our dragon to the one below 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.430
 if we lower his life we ​​can give him 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.430
 eat 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.060
 with a poor poor thing you do not run from 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.569
 a dragon crap there is with 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.820
 low life we feed this chicken 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.410
 jn we can give fish as you can see 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.269
 will be regional in life then 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.280
 he is a very good companion for the point 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.160
 of view I think it can serve you 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.360
 quite in your adventures and well that has 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.340
 been everything I hope you like this 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.919
 way to me first I like pretty 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.610
 thanks to your animations and the effort 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.860
 from the creator of the mod 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.480
 although there you can see that when you give 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.970
 turns its tail goes through everything but 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.919
 well that does not matter 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.960
 Cubans how are we going to see how it is installed 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.450
 this mode after you liked it and you can 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.120
 advise online for more motorcycles without 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.860
 force not to the force good as it is 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.050
 truth because even if I'm going to bring them 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.669
 more comfort because there are a lot 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.680
 with force that are very good and therefore not 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.330
 you have to miss your true motes and 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.460
 well let's see how it is installed in 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.780
 10 good way friends and we are here in 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.130
 the installation of this dragon mode 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.360
 mounds and the first thing we have to 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.070
 to do is to enter the forum that I leave 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.570
 the description obviously here they go to 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.340
 come all the pictures as you can see 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.260
 here is a picture with the shaders how 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.479
 it would look and so the truth that although yes 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.380
 that looks pretty good here I have the 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.870
 animations like 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.250
 and well, we keep going down here 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.960
 the downloads will be as they can 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.880
 see there is a version for mods loader and 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.590
 a version for force I recommend them 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.480
 the version for both sides since by 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.640
 course a lot grows to many so 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.830
 who have problems with force and then 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.650
 Modern improving where we click here 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.280
 live link to download 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.200
 we automatically have our 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.940
 dragon mount and you can click here 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.800
 in mod loader or go to the second forum that 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.990
 I leave a description to download 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.030
 mod loader and we simply lower it 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.730
 until you find us loader here is 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.050
 we give you direct download likewise did 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.460
 to start downloading by our module 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.530
 le also possible to download as 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.320
 fly to support the creator of the mod and 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.760
 now if we need to install these two 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.100
 files so that everything works to the 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.780
 perfection and how can you see then here 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.370
 the dragon although here comes all that 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.040
 we are going to install it and we are going to 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.260
 start by 1 2% app data percent 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.090
 users about x to here them 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.890
 they have to appear run he puts him 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.870
 percent percent is percent we're going 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.030
 to the folder roaming the folder point 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.190
 minecraft bean folder minecraft click 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.710
 right to open with wind arg archiver 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.240
 we minimize this bing folder and here 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.650
 in minecraft point heart we eliminate the 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.660
 fast meta and fast folder 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.460
 delete that folder because if not the 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.470
 they eliminate then they will create minecraft and 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.910
 now we open mod loader what we have 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.470
 what to do as what to select all 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.750
 the files that inside and pass them 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.100
 to minecraft point javier to accept from 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.139
 that way the mod will already be installed 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.600
 loader of the dragon mount as you can see 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.039
 comes with springs and other things 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.930
 So now we are going to install that 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:41.610
 we closed that is to say it was armed salamanca 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.320
 background jar we also open the folder 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.600
 minimized that was the bill 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.180
 we managed some time ago we're going to 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.919
 back and here you will see then springs what 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.229
 what we have to do here simply 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.539
 give it then in springs and put this 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:56.880
 dragon's folder on springs 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.289
 our wine in this good way more 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.389
 well at our point minecraft and here 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.320
 is going to be the dragons now what 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.949
 we have to do is create a new 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.199
 folder called mods new folder ms 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:09.210
 inside that folder we have to put 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:13.320
 just the dragon mount zip file 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.669
 just like it goes like this and ready like this 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.830
 our mod must be installed 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:19.440
 the truth is very simple nothing makes 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.870
 follow the steps and then try not to 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.490
 get confused and obviously not have 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.720
 no mode installed since if they have 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.740
 some other way that can do that 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.270
 grow 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.130
 incompatible can add up in clear not going 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.919
 to work and that's not what you 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.910
 they want and well basically this has 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:36.180
 been everything I hope you liked it 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:40.220
 this dragon mod mounts and well then 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.220
 see you next and goodbye
