in<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.269> next<00:03:28.450> one<00:03:28.720> here's<00:03:28.959> flash<00:03:29.230> flash<00:03:29.709> the

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
in the next one here's flash flash the

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.160 
in the next one here's flash flash the
most<00:03:30.760> unique<00:03:31.030> part<00:03:31.330> of<00:03:31.420> this<00:03:31.510> beyblade<00:03:31.989> I

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
most unique part of this beyblade I

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.280 
most unique part of this beyblade I
think<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:32.980> there's<00:03:33.910> this<00:03:34.330> a<00:03:34.480> stamina<00:03:34.720> mode<00:03:35.049> I

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
think so there's this a stamina mode I

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.440 
think so there's this a stamina mode I
think<00:03:35.650> from<00:03:36.280> my<00:03:36.310> knowledge<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:36.910> if<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:37.299> turn

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
think from my knowledge and if you turn

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.130 
think from my knowledge and if you turn
it<00:03:37.630> this<00:03:37.870> way<00:03:39.090> like<00:03:40.090> that<00:03:40.269> then<00:03:40.480> it's<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.780> tack

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
it this way like that then it's a tack

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.170 
it this way like that then it's a tack
mode<00:03:41.440> attack<00:03:42.130> mode<00:03:42.310> is<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.489> lot<00:03:42.700> better<00:03:42.940> for

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
mode attack mode is a lot better for

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.789 
mode attack mode is a lot better for
attack<00:03:43.510> things<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:44.079> don't<00:03:44.230> even<00:03:44.440> think<00:03:44.650> you

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
attack things I don't even think you

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.880 
attack things I don't even think you
would<00:03:44.920> even<00:03:45.010> need<00:03:45.340> stamina<00:03:45.640> mode<00:03:45.970> for<00:03:46.890> attack

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
would even need stamina mode for attack

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.050 
would even need stamina mode for attack
combos<00:03:48.489> here's<00:03:49.299> to<00:03:49.510> 30<00:03:50.280> very<00:03:51.280> good<00:03:51.549> I<00:03:51.820> guess

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
combos here's to 30 very good I guess

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.190
