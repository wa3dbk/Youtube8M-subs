00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
how to make a dandelion and you will

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.430 
how to make a dandelion and you will
need<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.760> ultrafine<00:00:08.760> sharpie<00:00:09.719> marker<00:00:09.750> for<00:00:10.320> this

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
need a ultrafine sharpie marker for this

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.009 
need a ultrafine sharpie marker for this
one<00:00:10.740> because<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.910> details<00:00:12.330> are<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> little<00:00:12.660> bit

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
one because the details are a little bit

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.460 
one because the details are a little bit
more<00:00:13.460> fine<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.150> let's<00:00:15.480> get<00:00:15.690> started<00:00:16.230> we're

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
more fine so let's get started we're

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.670 
more fine so let's get started we're
going<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.680> start<00:00:16.920> out<00:00:17.039> with<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.279> circle<00:00:18.590> in<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
going to start out with a circle in the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.439 
going to start out with a circle in the
middle<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:20.039> your<00:00:20.130> paper<00:00:20.369> maybe<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.970> little<00:00:21.240> bit

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
middle of your paper maybe a little bit

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.910 
middle of your paper maybe a little bit
more<00:00:21.660> towards<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.140> top<00:00:22.730> from<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.939> circle

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
more towards the top from that circle

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.640 
more towards the top from that circle
you're<00:00:25.920> going<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.369> make<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:27.289> straight<00:00:28.289> line

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
you're going to make a straight line

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.769 
you're going to make a straight line
down<00:00:29.039> now<00:00:29.460> I'm<00:00:29.609> probably<00:00:29.849> going<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.449> go<00:00:30.570> out<00:00:30.750> of

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
down now I'm probably going to go out of

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.740 
down now I'm probably going to go out of
your<00:00:31.050> view<00:00:31.320> range<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.309> your<00:00:32.489> paper<00:00:32.759> just

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
your view range but on your paper just

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.810 
your view range but on your paper just
make<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.200> as<00:00:34.320> straight<00:00:34.649> as<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.579> then

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
make it as straight as you can and then

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.119 
make it as straight as you can and then
add<00:00:36.149> another<00:00:36.329> straight<00:00:36.960> line<00:00:37.230> right<00:00:37.559> next<00:00:37.980> to

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
add another straight line right next to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.479 
add another straight line right next to
it<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:39.469> that<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.649> you'll<00:00:40.770> want<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.340> be

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
it and that and you'll want that to be

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.549 
it and that and you'll want that to be
law<00:00:41.700> because<00:00:42.239> dandelion<00:00:42.809> stems<00:00:43.140> are<00:00:43.350> pretty

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
law because dandelion stems are pretty

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.549 
law because dandelion stems are pretty
long<00:00:43.910> now<00:00:44.910> what<00:00:45.239> you'll<00:00:45.390> want<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.719> do<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.170> you

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
long now what you'll want to do is you

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.490 
long now what you'll want to do is you
will<00:00:46.710> want<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.100> make<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.149> straight<00:00:48.719> line<00:00:48.750> coming

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
will want to make a straight line coming

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.729 
will want to make a straight line coming
down<00:00:52.280> from<00:00:53.780> probably<00:00:54.780> about<00:00:54.930> three<00:00:55.230> inches<00:00:55.530> up

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
down from probably about three inches up

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.729 
down from probably about three inches up
right<00:00:56.399> into<00:00:56.579> your<00:00:56.910> circle<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:58.559> you'll

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
right into your circle and then you'll

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.500 
right into your circle and then you'll
want<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.100> come<00:00:59.399> out<00:00:59.579> about<00:00:59.879> three<00:01:00.180> inches

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
want to come out about three inches

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.500 
want to come out about three inches
about<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.020> same<00:01:01.289> amount<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.180> come<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
about the same amount and come out the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.660 
about the same amount and come out the
other<00:01:03.600> side<00:01:03.750> about<00:01:04.199> three<00:01:04.589> inches<00:01:06.920> now<00:01:07.920> what

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
other side about three inches now what

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.340 
other side about three inches now what
we<00:01:08.820> want<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.510> find<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> halfway<00:01:10.110> point

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
we want to do is find the halfway point

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.130 
we want to do is find the halfway point
between<00:01:10.799> these<00:01:11.220> two<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.790> come<00:01:12.540> out<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.869> same

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
between these two and come out the same

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.870 
between these two and come out the same
amount<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:14.490> same<00:01:14.880> distance<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:16.159> then<00:01:17.159> again

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
amount the same distance and then again

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.109 
amount the same distance and then again
the<00:01:18.390> same<00:01:18.630> distance<00:01:19.369> between<00:01:20.369> these<00:01:20.820> two

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the same distance between these two

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.190 
the same distance between these two
lines

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
lines

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.940 
lines
in<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.310> same<00:01:23.610> distance<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:25.710> same

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
in the same distance and the same

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.920 
in the same distance and the same
distance<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.549> doesn't<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.360> exact

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
distance it doesn't have to be exact

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.510 
distance it doesn't have to be exact
of<00:01:28.049> course<00:01:29.960> now<00:01:30.960> between<00:01:31.590> each<00:01:31.830> of<00:01:31.890> these

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
of course now between each of these

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.830 
of course now between each of these
lines<00:01:33.210> we're<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.930> make<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.290> shorter<00:01:34.860> line

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
lines we're going to make a shorter line

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.109 
lines we're going to make a shorter line
so<00:01:36.840> basically<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.530> lot<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> series

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
so basically a lot of this is a series

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.510 
so basically a lot of this is a series
of<00:01:39.149> lines<00:01:40.610> coming<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:43.200> effect<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.250> really

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
of lines coming out the effect is really

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.730 
of lines coming out the effect is really
cool<00:01:44.970> though<00:01:46.039> so<00:01:47.039> we<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.340> keep<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:48.060> with

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
cool though so we just keep going with

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.029 
cool though so we just keep going with
our<00:01:49.740> shorter<00:01:50.460> lines<00:01:51.350> coming<00:01:52.350> out<00:01:52.590> from<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
our shorter lines coming out from the

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.730 
our shorter lines coming out from the
center<00:01:54.740> just<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:57.440> now<00:01:58.440> we're<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.679> to

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
center just like that now we're going to

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.430 
center just like that now we're going to
put<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.069> little<00:01:59.310> detail<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.940> little

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
put the little detail the little

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.469 
put the little detail the little
umbrella<00:02:01.440> things<00:02:01.770> at<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.069> top<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:03.149> what

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
umbrella things at the top so what

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.069 

so<00:02:29.920> each<00:02:30.219> one<00:02:30.489> of<00:02:30.549> those<00:02:30.849> go<00:02:31.359> slowly<00:02:31.780> and

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
so each one of those go slowly and

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:38.520 
so each one of those go slowly and
carefully<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:32.889> you<00:02:32.950> do<00:02:33.219> your<00:02:33.370> best<00:02:33.700> job<00:02:37.379> okay

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
carefully so you do your best job okay

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.789 
carefully so you do your best job okay
now<00:02:38.709> inside<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.730> each<00:02:40.060> one<00:02:40.359> of<00:02:40.389> those<00:02:40.810> then

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
now inside of each one of those then

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.349 
now inside of each one of those then
you're<00:02:41.980> going<00:02:42.189> to<00:02:42.340> want<00:02:42.609> to<00:02:42.670> put<00:02:42.879> a<00:02:43.030> curved

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
you're going to want to put a curved

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.440 
you're going to want to put a curved
line<00:02:43.689> and<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.379> curved<00:02:44.650> line

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
line and a curved line

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.099 
line and a curved line
curved<00:02:46.450> line<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.349> a<00:02:47.469> curved<00:02:47.829> line

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
curved line and a curved line

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.909 
curved line and a curved line
so<00:02:50.109> actually<00:02:50.709> there'll<00:02:50.919> be<00:02:50.950> four<00:02:51.489> little<00:02:52.919> ends

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:53.919 
so actually there'll be four little ends

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.399 
so actually there'll be four little ends
to<00:02:54.159> each<00:02:54.310> one<00:02:54.669> of<00:02:54.700> these<00:02:54.969> little<00:02:55.329> umbrella<00:02:55.900> I

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
to each one of these little umbrella I

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.819 
to each one of these little umbrella I
guess<00:02:57.219> they're<00:02:57.430> seedpods

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
guess they're seedpods

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.790 
guess they're seedpods
just<00:02:59.829> like<00:03:00.189> that

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.820 

just<00:03:05.430> keep<00:03:05.670> going<00:03:06.320> make<00:03:07.320> sure<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.680> get

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
just keep going make sure you get

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.320 
just keep going make sure you get
everyone<00:03:09.740> even<00:03:10.740> very<00:03:11.340> young<00:03:11.430> kids<00:03:11.910> can<00:03:12.150> do

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
everyone even very young kids can do

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.050 
everyone even very young kids can do
this<00:03:12.510> project<00:03:12.750> I've<00:03:13.140> done<00:03:13.410> this<00:03:13.590> with<00:03:13.970> four<00:03:14.970> or

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
this project I've done this with four or

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.140 
this project I've done this with four or
five<00:03:15.270> year-olds<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:17.700> know<00:03:17.820> what<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:17.970> can

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
five year-olds you know what you can

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.850 
five year-olds you know what you can
even<00:03:18.240> do<00:03:18.510> there's<00:03:18.720> probably<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.320> seed<00:03:19.590> pod

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
even do there's probably a seed pod

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.190 
even do there's probably a seed pod
under<00:03:20.100> here<00:03:20.520> so<00:03:20.820> you<00:03:20.880> can<00:03:21.380> do<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.590> as<00:03:22.800> well

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
under here so you can do that as well

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.880 
under here so you can do that as well
maybe<00:03:25.200> even<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:26.780> all<00:03:27.780> right<00:03:27.930> now<00:03:28.110> at<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.440> top

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
maybe even this all right now at the top

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.560 
maybe even this all right now at the top
of<00:03:29.100> each<00:03:29.250> one<00:03:29.520> of<00:03:29.550> these<00:03:29.850> lines<00:03:30.180> we're<00:03:30.450> going

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
of each one of these lines we're going

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.140 
of each one of these lines we're going
to<00:03:30.630> put<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.810> little<00:03:31.080> dot<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.620> little<00:03:31.800> black<00:03:32.730> dot

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
to put a little dot a little black dot

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.660 
to put a little dot a little black dot
at<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.690> top<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:34.200> each<00:03:35.040> one<00:03:37.190> just<00:03:38.190> take<00:03:38.430> some

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
at the top of each one just take some

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.380 
at the top of each one just take some
time<00:03:39.440> but<00:03:40.440> it's<00:03:40.860> worth<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.640> effort<00:03:41.790> because

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
time but it's worth the effort because

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:51.450 
time but it's worth the effort because
the<00:03:42.720> effect<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.560> we<00:03:43.680> really<00:03:44.010> need

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.300 

just<00:03:52.090> keep<00:03:52.390> going<00:03:52.900> until<00:03:53.020> you<00:03:53.350> have<00:03:53.500> all<00:03:53.560> those

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
just keep going until you have all those

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:09.110 
just keep going until you have all those
dots<00:03:57.450> filled<00:03:58.450> in

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.210 

this<00:04:09.690> one<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.110> don't<00:04:10.290> really<00:04:10.500> even<00:04:10.769> have<00:04:10.920> to

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
this one you don't really even have to

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.050 
this one you don't really even have to
color<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.879> looks<00:04:12.120> cool<00:04:12.510> just<00:04:12.870> as<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.590> is<00:04:16.699> if<00:04:17.699> you

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
color it looks cool just as it is if you

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.300 
color it looks cool just as it is if you
would<00:04:18.180> like<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.540> add<00:04:18.690> more<00:04:19.199> lines<00:04:19.560> for<00:04:20.250> a

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
would like to add more lines for a

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.090 
would like to add more lines for a
little<00:04:20.549> bit<00:04:20.699> more<00:04:21.180> detail<00:04:21.740> that<00:04:22.740> would<00:04:22.919> be<00:04:23.070> a

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
little bit more detail that would be a

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.659 
little bit more detail that would be a
good<00:04:23.280> idea<00:04:23.460> too<00:04:24.860> so<00:04:25.860> there<00:04:26.040> you<00:04:26.160> go<00:04:26.340> there's
