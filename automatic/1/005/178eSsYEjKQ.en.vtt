it<00:01:48.490> in<00:01:48.610> Wichita<00:01:48.880> skepticism<00:01:49.540> my<00:01:49.900> technique<00:01:50.230> is

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
it in Wichita skepticism my technique is

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.430 
it in Wichita skepticism my technique is
not<00:01:50.620> that<00:01:50.800> great<00:01:50.980> so<00:01:51.040> I<00:01:51.190> have<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.340> correct<00:01:51.520> it

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
not that great so I have to correct it

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.720 
not that great so I have to correct it
so<00:01:53.440> I<00:01:53.470> have<00:01:53.620> to<00:01:53.710> back<00:01:53.830> myself<00:01:54.070> I<00:01:54.460> have<00:01:54.580> to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
so I have to back myself I have to

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.820 
so I have to back myself I have to
believe<00:01:55.450> myself<00:01:55.690> so<00:01:56.170> I<00:01:56.200> have<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.440> go<00:01:56.560> out<00:01:56.620> there

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
believe myself so I have to go out there

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.890

and<00:01:57.010> give<00:01:57.160> my<00:01:57.310> under<00:01:57.520> percent<00:01:57.790> if<00:01:58.540> I<00:01:58.660> click

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
and give my under percent if I click

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.960 
and give my under percent if I click
then<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.830> other<00:01:59.950> team<00:02:00.130> has<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.340> pay<00:02:00.640> if<00:02:00.820> I

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
then the other team has to pay if I

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.460 
then the other team has to pay if I
