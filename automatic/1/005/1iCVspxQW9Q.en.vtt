than like I'll probably pretty much
mostly<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:49.050> quite<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> few<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.680> them<00:00:49.770> done<00:00:50.039> very

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
mostly get quite a few of them done very

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.939 
mostly get quite a few of them done very
soon<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:52.050> sure<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.260> look<00:00:52.469> out<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.770> those

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
soon so be sure to look out for those

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.500 
soon so be sure to look out for those
now<00:00:53.250> over<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.180> see<00:00:54.300> we've<00:00:54.449> got

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
now over here you can see we've got

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.090 
now over here you can see we've got
different<00:00:54.690> regions<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.410> creating<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.890> set

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
different regions for creating a set

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.529 
different regions for creating a set
piece<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:56.730> some<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.090> free<00:00:57.270> kicks

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
piece you can do some for free kicks

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.840 
piece you can do some for free kicks
close<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.980> when<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.250> comes<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.520> corners

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
close in but when it comes to corners

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.939 
close in but when it comes to corners
you<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.539> both<00:01:00.750> corners<00:01:01.320> separately

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
you have to do both corners separately

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.850 
you have to do both corners separately
so<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> top<00:01:03.390> corner<00:01:03.750> you're<00:01:04.680> more

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
so if you do the top corner you're more

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.080 
so if you do the top corner you're more
or<00:01:04.949> less<00:01:05.070> likely<00:01:05.339> gonna<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
or less likely gonna have to do the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.910 
or less likely gonna have to do the
bottom<00:01:06.270> one<00:01:06.390> separately<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.140> doesn't<00:01:07.650> give

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
bottom one separately it doesn't give

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.980 
bottom one separately it doesn't give
the<00:01:08.159> same<00:01:08.729> source<00:01:09.119> set<00:01:09.299> piece<00:01:09.510> down<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the same source set piece down to the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.080 
the same source set piece down to the
bomb<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:11.070> keep<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.490> mind<00:01:11.670> once<00:01:11.970> you've

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
bomb so do keep that in mind once you've

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.730 
bomb so do keep that in mind once you've
done<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.420> side<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> other

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
done one side you have to do the other

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.950 
done one side you have to do the other
it<00:01:13.979> has<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.369> symmetrical<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.210> over<00:01:15.780> there

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it has to be symmetrical so over there

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.899 
it has to be symmetrical so over there
I'm<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.470> quickly<00:01:16.740> clearing<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.759> did

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
I'm just quickly clearing one that I did

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.730 
I'm just quickly clearing one that I did
before<00:01:18.330> which<00:01:18.509> was<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> tutorial<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
before which was a tutorial one but that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.710 
before which was a tutorial one but that
one<00:01:19.920> wasn't<00:01:20.130> too<00:01:20.280> good<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.790> over<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.450> what<00:01:21.630> we

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
one wasn't too good so over here what we

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.760 
one wasn't too good so over here what we
can<00:01:21.810> do<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:21.990> think<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.320> would<00:01:22.500> press<00:01:22.650> the

puffs<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.590> I've<00:01:31.650> kept<00:01:31.890> those<00:01:31.979> two<00:01:32.159> defenses

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
puffs and I've kept those two defenses

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.800 
puffs and I've kept those two defenses
defenders<00:01:33.240> over<00:01:33.450> there

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
defenders over there

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.289 
defenders over there
more<00:01:34.259> less<00:01:34.380> than<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.590> halfway<00:01:34.770> line<00:01:35.299> because

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
more less than the halfway line because

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.999 
more less than the halfway line because
if<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.479> do<00:01:36.630> get<00:01:36.780> counter-attacked<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.860> got

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
if you do get counter-attacked you got

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.039 
if you do get counter-attacked you got
one<00:01:38.189> player<00:01:38.460> you're<00:01:39.240> more<00:01:39.360> alike<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.840> more

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
one player you're more alike and more

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.480 
one player you're more alike and more
that's<00:01:40.140> gonna<00:01:40.320> get<00:01:40.439> outnumbered<00:01:41.040> when<00:01:41.340> your

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that's gonna get outnumbered when your

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.469 
that's gonna get outnumbered when your
opponents<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.299> quick

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
opponents go for that really quick

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.039 
opponents go for that really quick
counter-attack

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
counter-attack

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.990 
counter-attack
so<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.439> keep<00:01:43.680> two<00:01:43.920> defenders<00:01:44.340> out<00:01:44.460> there<00:01:44.820> now

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
so I keep two defenders out there now

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.910 
so I keep two defenders out there now
over<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:45.899> I'm<00:01:45.990> trying<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.320> understand<00:01:46.740> this

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
over here I'm trying to understand this

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.410 
over here I'm trying to understand this
player<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> believe<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.759> midfielder<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.240> ours

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.719 
player I believe is a midfielder of ours
I<00:01:48.630> think<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.290> ESCO<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:49.799> I'm<00:01:49.890> not<00:01:50.100> mistaken<00:01:50.520> on

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
I think it's ESCO if I'm not mistaken on

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.850 
I think it's ESCO if I'm not mistaken on
this<00:01:50.850> squad<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.659> over<00:01:52.259> there<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:52.560> I'm<00:01:52.619> doing

out<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.880> he's<00:02:27.330> more<00:02:27.510> or<00:02:27.570> less<00:02:27.690> gonna<00:02:27.870> be<00:02:27.960> the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
out and he's more or less gonna be the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.970 
out and he's more or less gonna be the
man<00:02:28.200> who's<00:02:28.230> gonna<00:02:28.440> run<00:02:28.680> in

man who's gonna run in

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.250 
man who's gonna run in
just<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.760> case<00:02:29.940> we<00:02:30.150> overpower<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.810> because<00:02:31.140> we

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
just in case we overpower it because we

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.690 
just in case we overpower it because we
don't<00:02:31.440> want<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.740> opponent's<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.430> get<00:02:32.610> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
don't want the opponent's to get the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.950 
don't want the opponent's to get the
ball<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.060> then<00:02:33.240> suddenly<00:02:33.570> go<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.810> run

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
ball and then suddenly go on a run

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.870 
ball and then suddenly go on a run
purely<00:02:34.680> because<00:02:34.800> we<00:02:35.010> overpower<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.610> ball<00:02:35.760> so

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
purely because we overpower the ball so

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.030 
purely because we overpower the ball so
that's<00:02:36.000> like<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.240> backup<00:02:36.510> player<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.470> over

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
that's like a backup player so over

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.990 
that's like a backup player so over
there<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.250> rest<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.550> players<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.880> we

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
there the rest of the players that we

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.040

after you saved purely Vickers and I

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.040 
after you saved purely Vickers and I
have<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.090> say<00:03:24.210> this<00:03:24.360> all<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.630> time<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.810> have<00:03:24.960> to

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
have to say this all the time I have to

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.560 
have to say this all the time I have to
stress<00:03:25.320> this<00:03:25.440> one<00:03:25.620> out<00:03:25.740> a<00:03:25.770> lot<00:03:26.240> if<00:03:27.240> you<00:03:27.360> don't

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
stress this one out a lot if you don't

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.970 
stress this one out a lot if you don't
sometimes<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:28.080> can<00:03:28.230> test<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.770> then<00:03:28.860> it

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
sometimes you can test it and then it

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.920 
sometimes you can test it and then it
might<00:03:29.220> completely<00:03:29.970> just<00:03:30.150> remove<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.630> so

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
might completely just remove it so

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.920 
might completely just remove it so
always<00:03:31.530> save<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:31.920> first<00:03:32.160> then<00:03:32.670> test<00:03:32.970> later<00:03:33.240> now

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
always save it first then test later now

Bayern Munich and a bit of Barcelona and

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.740 
Bayern Munich and a bit of Barcelona and
I<00:04:36.580> put<00:04:36.759> them<00:04:36.880> in<00:04:37.000> one<00:04:37.210> I<00:04:37.240> was<00:04:37.360> watching<00:04:37.570> them<00:04:37.690> on

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
I put them in one I was watching them on

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.450 
I put them in one I was watching them on
TV<00:04:37.960> and<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.199> just<00:04:38.229> tried<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:38.650> understand<00:04:39.250> how<00:04:39.430> I

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
TV and I just tried to understand how I

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.520 
TV and I just tried to understand how I
can<00:04:39.580> do<00:04:39.850> a<00:04:39.880> dummy<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:40.479> then<00:04:40.570> just<00:04:40.810> off<00:04:40.960> get<00:04:41.500> a

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
can do a dummy and then just off get a

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.350 
can do a dummy and then just off get a
few<00:04:41.680> different<00:04:41.770> players<00:04:42.160> now<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.610> highly

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
few different players now I highly

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.210 
few different players now I highly
recommend<00:04:43.750> probably<00:04:44.139> pause<00:04:44.500> this<00:04:44.680> video<00:04:44.860> and

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
recommend probably pause this video and

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.400 
recommend probably pause this video and
go<00:04:45.389> through<00:04:46.389> it<00:04:46.479> step<00:04:46.720> by<00:04:46.750> step<00:04:46.870> for<00:04:47.259> this

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
go through it step by step for this

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.990 
go through it step by step for this
specific<00:04:47.860> one<00:04:48.039> because<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:48.400> haven't<00:04:48.639> really

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
specific one because I haven't really

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.430 
specific one because I haven't really
covered<00:04:49.180> it<00:04:49.360> before<00:04:49.449> and<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.780> first<00:04:49.990> one<00:04:50.229> is

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
covered it before and the first one is

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.909 
covered it before and the first one is
very<00:04:51.370> very<00:04:51.789> simple<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:53.350> what<00:04:53.470> I<00:04:53.530> do<00:04:53.620> is<00:04:53.830> I

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
very very simple so what I do is I

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.710 
very very simple so what I do is I
normally<00:04:54.190> just<00:04:54.310> practice<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.759> runs<00:04:54.970> without

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
normally just practice the runs without

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.420 
normally just practice the runs without
creating<00:04:56.199> the<00:04:56.350> recording<00:04:57.009> the<00:04:57.070> set<00:04:57.250> piece

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
creating the recording the set piece

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.180 
creating the recording the set piece
then<00:04:57.669> as<00:04:57.820> soon<00:04:57.910> as<00:04:58.000> I<00:04:58.120> record<00:04:58.720> it<00:04:58.870> that<00:04:59.830> is<00:04:59.949> more

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
then as soon as I record it that is more

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.529 
then as soon as I record it that is more
or<00:05:00.250> less<00:05:00.280> what<00:05:00.580> I'd<00:05:00.669> going<00:05:00.970> for<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.240> player

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539

another<00:06:17.590> one<00:06:17.740> was<00:06:17.979> my<00:06:18.159> dipping<00:06:18.430> free<00:06:18.760> kicks

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
another one was my dipping free kicks

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.399 
another one was my dipping free kicks
because<00:06:19.300> I<00:06:19.360> have<00:06:19.449> got<00:06:19.570> some<00:06:19.659> crazy<00:06:19.900> free<00:06:20.199> kicks

because I have got some crazy free kicks
but<00:06:20.560> over<00:06:20.680> there<00:06:20.770> you<00:06:20.889> can<00:06:21.010> see<00:06:21.159> straight<00:06:21.610> away

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
but over there you can see straight away

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.330 
but over there you can see straight away
from<00:06:21.849> the<00:06:22.090> practice<00:06:22.510> it<00:06:22.900> goes<00:06:23.229> and<00:06:23.470> scores<00:06:24.039> so

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
from the practice it goes and scores so

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.279 
from the practice it goes and scores so
this<00:06:24.789> is<00:06:24.909> a<00:06:24.940> really<00:06:25.180> great<00:06:25.389> one<00:06:25.630> all<00:06:26.020> you<00:06:26.169> can

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:27.210 
this is a really great one all you can
do<00:06:26.349> is<00:06:26.440> probably<00:06:26.560> just<00:06:26.710> pause<00:06:26.949> the<00:06:27.039> video

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
do is probably just pause the video

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.980 
do is probably just pause the video
right<00:06:27.370> there<00:06:27.639> and<00:06:27.789> understand<00:06:28.510> the<00:06:28.599> run<00:06:28.720> puffs

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
right there and understand the run puffs

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.860 
right there and understand the run puffs
and<00:06:29.229> then<00:06:29.560> go<00:06:29.800> and<00:06:30.010> create<00:06:30.430> yourself<00:06:31.030> now<00:06:31.330> if

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
and then go and create yourself now if

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.149 
and then go and create yourself now if
you<00:06:32.080> ever<00:06:32.199> want<00:06:32.320> to<00:06:32.349> do<00:06:32.440> a<00:06:32.470> chip<00:06:32.770> into<00:06:33.010> that

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:33.159 
you ever want to do a chip into that

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.200 
you ever want to do a chip into that
player<00:06:33.370> that<00:06:33.580> I<00:06:33.639> think<00:06:33.760> that<00:06:33.820> was<00:06:33.940> a<00:06:33.970> bit<00:06:34.180> too

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
player that I think that was a bit too

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.649 
player that I think that was a bit too
early

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:34.659 
early

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:36.269 
early
all<00:06:35.320> you've<00:06:35.440> got<00:06:35.529> to<00:06:35.590> do<00:06:35.650> is<00:06:35.740> practice<00:06:36.130> a<00:06:36.159> few

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:36.279 
all you've got to do is practice a few

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.279 
all you've got to do is practice a few
times<00:06:36.760> understanding<00:06:37.389> the<00:06:37.479> runs<00:06:37.690> and<00:06:37.960> you'll

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
times understanding the runs and you'll

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.110 
times understanding the runs and you'll
get<00:06:38.440> much<00:06:38.650> bail<00:06:38.919> with<00:06:39.130> these<00:06:39.279> set<00:06:39.580> pieces

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
get much bail with these set pieces

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.240 
get much bail with these set pieces
so<00:06:40.240> you<00:06:41.229> can<00:06:41.350> make<00:06:41.500> I<00:06:41.620> think<00:06:41.800> up<00:06:41.889> to<00:06:41.919> four

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
so you can make I think up to four

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.100 
so you can make I think up to four
maximum<00:06:43.090> and<00:06:43.270> with<00:06:43.360> free<00:06:43.600> kicks<00:06:43.840> as<00:06:43.960> well<00:06:44.080> I

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
maximum and with free kicks as well I

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.330 
maximum and with free kicks as well I
always<00:06:44.410> recommend<00:06:44.560> that<00:06:44.860> look<00:06:44.979> at<00:06:45.070> this<00:06:45.130> over

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
always recommend that look at this over

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.800 
always recommend that look at this over
there<00:06:45.490> going<00:06:45.970> for<00:06:46.060> the<00:06:46.120> finesse<00:06:46.389> shot<00:06:46.419> and

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 
there going for the finesse shot and

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.409 
there going for the finesse shot and
there<00:06:47.800> you<00:06:47.919> go<00:06:48.130> so<00:06:48.460> that's<00:06:48.880> the<00:06:49.030> set<00:06:49.210> pieces

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:49.419 
there you go so that's the set pieces

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.120 
there you go so that's the set pieces
hopefully<00:06:49.900> you'll<00:06:50.020> have<00:06:50.199> enjoyed<00:06:50.590> I<00:06:50.860> think
