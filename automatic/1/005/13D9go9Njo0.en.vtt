00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.610
 phases 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.190
 the game will have several phases all 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.149
 they are cool, it's not much fun 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.240
 easy 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.039
 I'm already giving start of the game more or 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.289
 less so that not all fail 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.929
 do you play here it will allow 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.119
 that you're better off the streets to have 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.220

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.119
 another character will be able to change wait 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.100
 him with new things like that. 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.860
 so good game of great graphics 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.960
 there front graphic of leaving for escape 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.520
 He's going to like the game a lot yet. 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.920
 but I will not change everything 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.720
 The game will always be like this. 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.459
 here in the phase and in the end you will 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.649
 have a boss where you're going to have to 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.890
 defeat the valencia who was the third 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.890
 his 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.709
 this is the game the house of magic is 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.720
 a game released by the contest company 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.700
 mania montepellier that is characterized 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.519
 for great graphics in which your 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.069
 The goal is to walk with this cat here by 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.170
 a house and interacting along the 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.400
 rooms you go in a case started 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.860
 we are here in the yard we will go 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.019
 able to interact with the characters will 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.640
 appearing here the game is the producer out 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.519
 itself is not normal that you should 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.069
 initially after suffering alone 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.959
 and that our goal is seen 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.400
 as no one finds you the character and 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.739
 perform a task that he will send 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.420
 for us we will have to perform 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.890
 a button that opens the head 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.230
 so you're going to have to find some 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.450
 in a phase so I came so much more 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.769
 calm in such a hectic game with 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.829
 all the games that we show here 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.900

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.470

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.830
 dumb or virtual 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.300
 launched by the brand made this player or 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.450
 that one is very different from the others because 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.970
 his installation is highlighted here is a 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.140
 little different when you went to open a 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.720
 survey where a screen appears to 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.220
 You are going to download the file from the 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.560

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.900
 A pk you will be there and you will sin 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.790

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.040
 or at least one minute always open because 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.170
 going late compressing a file that 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.520
 truth is a date file ie you 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.830

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.200
 uncompressed for you and then you 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.940
 will replace a gambling sin even though 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.010

 of cars all home that are very 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.380
 cool 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.270
 the minute the game graph well 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.130

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.700
 many races according to the classes 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.560
 of bc and to carry out these races 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.720
 making appeals of the cars so only 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.700

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.380
 80 thousand kits 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.960
 is a game that has a very high quality 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.510
 good can compete with cold and even 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.100
 the online community or even because the 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.150
 graphic quality is very good 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.130
 mobility also went very well 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.930
 developed and the history of the game 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.330
 It's very good, we'll make a 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.370
 campaign here in single player mode that 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.410
 It's so good, it's even better . 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.639
 that any other game will always grow 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.010

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.350
 We are here in this company scene that 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.330
 It seems like we are your case. 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.220
 character is the only one who did not make a 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.930
 from the rest of the world that will see the zombie 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.940
 so you'll have to control it and so 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.100
 multi-stage ball into the 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.100
 company to get out of here like this 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.020
 survive the attack in a trash 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.060
 he is very interesting is the following you 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.010
 will be under various effects you arrive 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.169
 close to radioactive material if you are 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.110
 attacked with one day you'll be half 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.669
 that no doubt something like that 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.520
 so I'm really good at playing in a 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.740
 monte launched today 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.009
 to close we have the game here 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.229
 makes of the Portuguese cross top oms 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.210
 This is a game released by gameloft and 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.190
 as you can see there looks and 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.560
 very good graphics to play today is fine 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.690
 cool here this is not a gameplay 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.370
 as interesting as other games 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.150
 dolls for now the first mission 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.370
 on here 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.080
 initially we have the control in the 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.690
 Touch the screen is you do not we do not have 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.669
 here is a virtual game pad but for this 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.379
 also of little game the textures they 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.060
 The fighting mode is very good. 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:46.789
 seems tas was to have been very 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.409
 developed and you can see that I touch 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.659
 opponents and can reach the 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.810
 I can touch here is to give a touch 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:56.330
 Special civil two taps on the screen I 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.240
 was a hammer on top of them 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.409
 Or else he can also do a day 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.199
 here on the screen 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.669
 in the case a symbol of lightning what was seen 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.469
 at least it was to be the symbol of the ray 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.110
 to be able to make another attack and so 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:11.840
 is also responsible for this legal good 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.370
