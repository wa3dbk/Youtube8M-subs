quite<00:01:17.890> well<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.810> today<00:01:20.140> like<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:20.710> said<00:01:20.740> we'll

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
quite well and today like I said we'll

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.550 
quite well and today like I said we'll
be<00:01:21.250> looking<00:01:21.369> at<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.759> U<00:01:21.880> boost<00:01:22.149> so<00:01:23.050> just<00:01:23.350> as<00:01:23.470> the

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
be looking at the U boost so just as the

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.639 
be looking at the U boost so just as the
name<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:24.330> description<00:01:25.330> says<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:26.020> U<00:01:26.170> boost<00:01:26.410> is

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
name and description says the U boost is

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.650 
name and description says the U boost is
a<00:01:26.680> battery<00:01:27.190> pack<00:01:27.399> which<00:01:27.640> I<00:01:28.030> suppose

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
a battery pack which I suppose

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.139 
a battery pack which I suppose
advertises<00:01:29.440> allows<00:01:30.190> you<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.369> play<00:01:30.520> twice<00:01:30.910> as

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
advertises allows you to play twice as

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.910 
advertises allows you to play twice as
long<00:01:31.330> on<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:33.369> gamepad<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:34.360> it<00:01:35.320> also<00:01:35.500> has<00:01:35.740> an<00:01:35.860> a

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
long on the gamepad and it also has an a

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.830 
long on the gamepad and it also has an a
built-in<00:01:36.310> adjustable<00:01:36.460> stand<00:01:37.149> now<00:01:37.780> the

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
built-in adjustable stand now the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.919 
built-in adjustable stand now the
gamepad's<00:01:38.440> battery<00:01:38.890> is<00:01:39.220> pretty<00:01:39.850> weak<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.420> I

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
gamepad's battery is pretty weak and I

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.600 
gamepad's battery is pretty weak and I
say<00:01:41.110> that<00:01:41.289> simply<00:01:41.530> because<00:01:41.709> the<00:01:41.979> charge<00:01:42.369> only

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
say that simply because the charge only

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.910 
say that simply because the charge only
lasts<00:01:42.940> for<00:01:43.060> about<00:01:43.270> three<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.349> four<00:01:44.530> hours

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
lasts for about three to four hours

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.339 
lasts for about three to four hours
maybe<00:01:45.160> sometimes<00:01:45.729> five<00:01:46.060> on<00:01:46.569> a<00:01:46.630> single<00:01:47.110> charge

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:47.349 
maybe sometimes five on a single charge

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:50.160 
maybe sometimes five on a single charge
and<00:01:47.590> when<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.429> when<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:49.300> red<00:01:49.630> warning<00:01:49.929> light

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
and when the when that red warning light

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.540 
and when the when that red warning light
comes<00:01:50.349> on<00:01:50.590> you're<00:01:50.770> gonna<00:01:50.890> have<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.160> plug<00:01:51.369> it<00:01:51.520> in

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
comes on you're gonna have to plug it in

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.120 
comes on you're gonna have to plug it in
to<00:01:51.700> an<00:01:52.360> AC<00:01:52.509> outlet<00:01:52.690> and<00:01:53.200> charge<00:01:53.740> from<00:01:53.979> there

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
to an AC outlet and charge from there

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.260 
to an AC outlet and charge from there
while<00:01:54.250> you're<00:01:54.459> using<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.819> and<00:01:54.970> that<00:01:55.030> can

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
while you're using it and that can

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.809 
while you're using it and that can
indeed<00:01:55.630> get<00:01:55.840> tedious<00:01:56.380> so<00:01:56.979> Nike<00:01:57.459> I<00:01:57.580> went<00:01:57.759> ahead

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
indeed get tedious so Nike I went ahead

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.370 
indeed get tedious so Nike I went ahead
and<00:01:58.060> they<00:01:58.149> developed<00:01:58.539> a<00:01:58.630> fundamental<00:01:59.229> way

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
and they developed a fundamental way

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.859 
and they developed a fundamental way
with<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.369> you<00:02:00.459> boost<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:01.360> go<00:02:01.479> ahead<00:02:01.690> and

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
with the you boost to go ahead and

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.050 
with the you boost to go ahead and
extend<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.380> battery<00:02:02.770> life<00:02:02.950> by<00:02:03.280> twice<00:02:03.849> as

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
extend that battery life by twice as

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.699 
extend that battery life by twice as
much<00:02:04.209> so<00:02:04.509> instead<00:02:04.869> of<00:02:04.990> playing<00:02:05.259> for<00:02:05.590> about

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
much so instead of playing for about

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.160 
much so instead of playing for about
four<00:02:06.520> hours<00:02:06.550> you<00:02:07.000> could<00:02:07.179> get<00:02:07.690> up<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.840> at<00:02:08.050> least

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
four hours you could get up to at least

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.000 
four hours you could get up to at least
eight<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:09.340> maybe<00:02:09.550> even<00:02:09.970> ten<00:02:10.179> hours<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.950> a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
eight to maybe even ten hours on a

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.000 
eight to maybe even ten hours on a
single<00:02:12.310> charge<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.380> way<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.620> works<00:02:14.650> is

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
single charge so the way it works is

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.800 
single charge so the way it works is
that<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.310> simply<00:02:15.430> goes<00:02:15.880> straight<00:02:16.480> into<00:02:16.720> the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
that it simply goes straight into the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.250 
that it simply goes straight into the
back<00:02:16.989> of<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.470> unit<00:02:18.599> shrink<00:02:19.599> to<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.840> back<00:02:19.989> and

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
back of the unit shrink to the back and

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.050 
back of the unit shrink to the back and
it<00:02:20.470> charges<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.130> back<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.640> internal

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
it charges the back of the internal

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.089 
it charges the back of the internal
battery<00:02:22.209> through<00:02:22.989> these<00:02:23.140> gold<00:02:23.470> plates<00:02:23.830> which

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
battery through these gold plates which

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.490 
battery through these gold plates which
are<00:02:24.220> used<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.730> charge<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.319> controller<00:02:26.319> when

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
are used to charge the controller when

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.830 
are used to charge the controller when
it's<00:02:26.650> laid<00:02:26.890> down<00:02:27.099> here<00:02:27.520> in<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.420> charging

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
it's laid down here in the charging

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.979 
it's laid down here in the charging
cradle<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.980> simply<00:02:30.310> just<00:02:30.520> turn<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.180> on<00:02:31.330> and

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
cradle you simply just turn it on and

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.350 
cradle you simply just turn it on and
then<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.230> power<00:02:32.500> flows<00:02:32.860> from<00:02:33.459> its<00:02:33.849> internal

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
then the power flows from its internal

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.540 
then the power flows from its internal
power<00:02:34.480> source<00:02:34.780> into<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.800> Wii<00:02:35.890> U<00:02:36.010> gamepad<00:02:36.459> and

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
power source into the Wii U gamepad and

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.550 
power source into the Wii U gamepad and
it<00:02:36.670> keeps<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.180> battery<00:02:37.930> all<00:02:38.319> charged<00:02:38.680> up

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
it keeps the battery all charged up

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.350 
it keeps the battery all charged up
and<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.250> neat<00:02:40.400> thing<00:02:40.580> about<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.819> is<00:02:41.060> when<00:02:41.240> it

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
and the neat thing about it is when it

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.900 
and the neat thing about it is when it
when<00:02:41.690> this<00:02:41.870> runs<00:02:42.110> out<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.319> power<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:43.610> can<00:02:43.790> go

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
when this runs out of power you can go

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.400 
when this runs out of power you can go
ahead<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.270> you<00:02:44.330> can<00:02:44.510> rest<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.870> inside<00:02:45.290> the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
ahead and you can rest it inside the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.480 
ahead and you can rest it inside the
charging<00:02:45.770> cradle<00:02:45.890> itself<00:02:46.720> like<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:49.310> it

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
charging cradle itself like so and it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.190 
charging cradle itself like so and it
will<00:02:49.610> charge<00:02:49.880> or<00:02:50.330> you<00:02:50.360> can<00:02:50.510> go<00:02:50.780> ahead<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.140> you

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
will charge or you can go ahead and you

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.320 
will charge or you can go ahead and you
can<00:02:51.350> plug<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:52.370> AC<00:02:52.520> adapter<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.180> was

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
can plug in the AC adapter that was

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.470 
can plug in the AC adapter that was
included<00:02:53.810> but<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.020> we<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.490> just<00:02:55.490> sent<00:02:56.300> us

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
included but the we you just sent us

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.900 
included but the we you just sent us
exact<00:02:57.110> same<00:02:57.319> porch<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.280> Wii<00:02:58.370> U<00:02:58.489> gamepad

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
exact same porch that the Wii U gamepad

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.440 
exact same porch that the Wii U gamepad
does<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:01.459> while<00:03:01.580> this<00:03:01.730> is<00:03:01.880> charging<00:03:02.300> up<00:03:02.360> they

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
does so while this is charging up they

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.030 
does so while this is charging up they
can<00:03:02.630> continue<00:03:02.810> playing<00:03:03.170> off<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.680> power<00:03:03.860> that

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
can continue playing off the power that

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.680 
can continue playing off the power that
you've<00:03:04.220> already<00:03:04.430> got<00:03:04.819> hearing<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.480> Wii<00:03:05.569> U

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
you've already got hearing the Wii U

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.780 
you've already got hearing the Wii U
gamepad<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.260> when<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.590> runs<00:03:06.770> out<00:03:07.010> simply

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
gamepad and when that runs out simply

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.400 
gamepad and when that runs out simply
take<00:03:08.000> this<00:03:08.150> uh<00:03:08.209> plug<00:03:08.569> it<00:03:08.690> back<00:03:08.720> in<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:09.380> can

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
take this uh plug it back in and you can

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.740 
take this uh plug it back in and you can
just<00:03:09.680> keep<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:09.980> cycle<00:03:10.160> going<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:10.910> way<00:03:11.150> of

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
just keep the cycle going it that way of

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.930 
just keep the cycle going it that way of
course<00:03:12.050> you<00:03:12.170> can<00:03:12.320> go<00:03:13.310> ahead<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.519> keep<00:03:13.760> your

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940

course you can go ahead and keep your
gaming<00:03:14.120> session<00:03:14.570> right<00:03:14.690> here<00:03:14.720> movie<00:03:15.380> watching

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
gaming session right here movie watching

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.590 
gaming session right here movie watching
session<00:03:16.100> going<00:03:16.610> for<00:03:16.790> as<00:03:16.880> long<00:03:17.000> as<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.360> need<00:03:17.540> to

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
session going for as long as you need to

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.280 
session going for as long as you need to
so<00:03:18.019> it's<00:03:18.709> definitely<00:03:19.130> a<00:03:19.459> much<00:03:20.330> much<00:03:21.080> better

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
so it's definitely a much much better

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.259 
so it's definitely a much much better
experience<00:03:21.530> I'm<00:03:22.010> hoping<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.489> Wii<00:03:22.610> U<00:03:22.820> now

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
experience I'm hoping that the Wii U now

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.250 
experience I'm hoping that the Wii U now
they<00:03:23.420> don't<00:03:23.540> have<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.750> be<00:03:23.900> running<00:03:24.080> around

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
they don't have to be running around

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.820 
they don't have to be running around
looking<00:03:24.980> for<00:03:25.040> an<00:03:25.280> AC<00:03:25.730> outlet<00:03:26.620> just<00:03:27.620> to

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
looking for an AC outlet just to

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.710 
looking for an AC outlet just to
continue<00:03:28.519> my<00:03:28.760> playing<00:03:29.030> session<00:03:29.450> and

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
continue my playing session and

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.090 
continue my playing session and
especially<00:03:30.319> when<00:03:30.590> you're<00:03:30.709> moving<00:03:30.860> the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
especially when you're moving the

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.559 
especially when you're moving the
controller<00:03:31.430> around<00:03:31.610> having<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.330> cord

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
controller around having the cord

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.590 
controller around having the cord
hanging<00:03:32.989> it<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:34.040> feel<00:03:34.250> restricted<00:03:34.640> and<00:03:35.269> it

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
hanging it you feel restricted and it

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.210 
hanging it you feel restricted and it
does<00:03:35.750> get<00:03:35.959> kind<00:03:36.110> of<00:03:36.230> annoying<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.069> it's

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
does get kind of annoying so it's

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.100 
does get kind of annoying so it's
definitely<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.670> really<00:03:37.880> really<00:03:38.720> really<00:03:38.810> nice

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
definitely a really really really nice

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.860 
definitely a really really really nice
way<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.410> avoid<00:03:39.800> that<00:03:40.100> so<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.180> installation<00:03:41.450> is

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
way to avoid that so the installation is

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.590 
way to avoid that so the installation is
really<00:03:42.290> easy<00:03:42.590> as<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:43.519> can<00:03:43.579> see<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:44.299> have<00:03:44.329> the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
really easy as you can see you have the

go ahead and you insert it then you use

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.730 
go ahead and you insert it then you use
the<00:04:00.980> thumb<00:04:01.760> screw<00:04:02.200> until<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:03.290> latches<00:04:03.470> on

just want to have the Wii U screen off
to<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.200> side<00:04:33.410> because<00:04:33.590> you<00:04:33.830> don't<00:04:33.860> really

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
to the side because you don't really

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.650 
to the side because you don't really
need<00:04:34.490> it<00:04:34.550> with<00:04:34.760> you<00:04:34.910> at<00:04:35.060> that<00:04:35.090> very<00:04:35.420> moment

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.150 
make their stuff as you can see it
matches<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:20.990> controller<00:05:21.320> quite<00:05:21.680> nicely<00:05:21.920> and

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
matches the controller quite nicely and

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.560 
matches the controller quite nicely and
the<00:05:22.250> build<00:05:22.460> quality<00:05:22.580> is<00:05:22.940> really<00:05:23.150> nice<00:05:23.330> and

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
the build quality is really nice and

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.270 
the build quality is really nice and
it's<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.810> gloss<00:05:24.050> finish<00:05:24.080> like<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:24.980> Wii<00:05:25.100> U

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.850 
it's the gloss finish like the Wii U
gamepad<00:05:26.060> does<00:05:26.270> at<00:05:26.420> the<00:05:26.540> front<00:05:26.810> with<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.650> matte

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
gamepad does at the front with the matte

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.270 
gamepad does at the front with the matte
finish<00:05:28.030> at<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:29.390> back<00:05:29.600> so<00:05:29.840> it<00:05:29.990> it<00:05:30.410> really<00:05:30.470> fits

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
finish at the back so it it really fits

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.090 
finish at the back so it it really fits
the<00:05:31.400> controller<00:05:31.790> quite<00:05:32.060> well<00:05:32.860> even<00:05:33.860> looking

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
the controller quite well even looking

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.410 
the controller quite well even looking
from<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.430> back<00:05:34.580> it<00:05:34.820> really<00:05:34.910> doesn't<00:05:35.330> look

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
from the back it really doesn't look

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.500 
from the back it really doesn't look
ugly<00:05:35.600> at<00:05:35.960> all<00:05:36.790> and<00:05:37.790> when<00:05:37.940> you<00:05:38.030> look<00:05:38.180> at<00:05:38.270> it<00:05:38.360> from

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
ugly at all and when you look at it from

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.750 
ugly at all and when you look at it from
the<00:05:38.600> front<00:05:38.660> it<00:05:38.900> just<00:05:38.930> has<00:05:39.200> a<00:05:39.400> little<00:05:40.400> brick

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
the front it just has a little brick

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.600 
the front it just has a little brick
hanging<00:05:41.240> out<00:05:41.630> of<00:05:41.750> the<00:05:41.840> bottom<00:05:41.990> so<00:05:42.710> it<00:05:43.040> actually

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
hanging out of the bottom so it actually

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.250 
hanging out of the bottom so it actually
fits<00:05:43.850> the<00:05:44.000> decor<00:05:44.330> quite<00:05:44.570> well<00:05:44.810> it<00:05:44.960> doesn't

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
fits the decor quite well it doesn't

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.590 
fits the decor quite well it doesn't
stand<00:05:45.440> out<00:05:45.710> too<00:05:45.920> much<00:05:46.100> doesn't<00:05:47.030> look<00:05:47.150> ugly<00:05:47.270> at

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
stand out too much doesn't look ugly at

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.280 
stand out too much doesn't look ugly at
all<00:05:47.690> it<00:05:47.840> really<00:05:47.930> works<00:05:48.260> and<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.930> only<00:05:51.110> gripe

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
all it really works and the only gripe

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.170 
all it really works and the only gripe
you<00:05:51.530> may<00:05:51.650> have<00:05:51.860> is<00:05:52.010> that<00:05:52.190> it<00:05:52.310> does<00:05:52.490> add<00:05:52.820> a<00:05:52.850> layer

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
you may have is that it does add a layer

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.000 
you may have is that it does add a layer
of<00:05:53.210> weight<00:05:53.690> to<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:54.770> controller<00:05:56.560> but<00:05:57.560> it's

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
of weight to the controller but it's

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.680 
of weight to the controller but it's
only<00:05:58.190> a<00:05:58.280> few<00:05:58.520> ounces<00:05:58.640> more<00:05:59.150> so<00:05:59.390> it<00:05:59.480> really

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
only a few ounces more so it really

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.660 
only a few ounces more so it really
isn't<00:05:59.900> that<00:06:00.530> noticeable<00:06:00.860> to<00:06:01.370> where<00:06:01.520> it's

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.670 
isn't that noticeable to where it's

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.220 
isn't that noticeable to where it's
going<00:06:01.820> to<00:06:02.090> be<00:06:02.240> a<00:06:02.420> problem

my<00:06:40.919> only<00:06:41.100> gripe<00:06:41.310> is<00:06:41.460> that<00:06:41.520> it<00:06:41.820> does<00:06:42.030> add<00:06:42.270> a<00:06:42.300> few

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
my only gripe is that it does add a few

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.540 
my only gripe is that it does add a few
ounces<00:06:42.780> to<00:06:43.229> the<00:06:43.290> controller<00:06:43.590> but<00:06:43.860> even<00:06:44.220> but

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
ounces to the controller but even but

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.490 
ounces to the controller but even but
it's<00:06:44.700> not<00:06:44.850> that<00:06:45.120> noticeable<00:06:45.360> but<00:06:46.200> as<00:06:46.320> most

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
it's not that noticeable but as most

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.530 
it's not that noticeable but as most
will<00:06:46.770> not<00:06:46.919> it<00:06:47.130> may<00:06:47.370> be<00:06:47.430> tedious<00:06:47.940> for<00:06:48.000> some<00:06:48.330> but

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
will not it may be tedious for some but

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.180 
will not it may be tedious for some but
it<00:06:48.870> does<00:06:49.080> take<00:06:49.290> a<00:06:49.320> little<00:06:49.530> bit<00:06:49.650> of<00:06:49.919> extra

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
it does take a little bit of extra

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.060 
it does take a little bit of extra
getting<00:06:50.520> used<00:06:50.820> to<00:06:51.410> but<00:06:52.410> other<00:06:52.560> than<00:06:52.650> that<00:06:52.889> it's

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
getting used to but other than that it's

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.920 
getting used to but other than that it's
a<00:06:53.220> really<00:06:53.610> solid<00:06:53.760> product<00:06:54.270> let's<00:06:54.690> go<00:06:54.870> ahead
