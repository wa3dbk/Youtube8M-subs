00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.999
 once the scan is complete click on repair selected 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:40.779
 in this case it asks if you want to back up the registry changes 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.369
 you should do it even if I've never had problems 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.919
 then click on sky 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.919

 and then click on close 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:15.139
 I advise you to repeat this procedure that is the one related to the cleaning of the 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.840
 register several times 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.029
 as long as from the scan 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.909
 are not found 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.400
 registry keys 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.659
 to be eliminated then 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:29.080
 effect finds problems 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.960
 and in this case 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.800
 you can stop here because I'm not there 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.800
 useless daily mirror keys 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.559
 perfect all operations 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:49.039
 have obviously been completed 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.560
 from the next time it should not make any configuration 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.280
 so once the ct line is started I should simply go to the tab 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.919
 cleaning 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:05.389
 carry out the analysis and then the cleaning of the files go to the register to carry out 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.069
 analysis 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:08.460
 and therefore 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.669
 in this case obviously it is not available because there are not 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.469
 registry keys to remedy 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:15.490
 make 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.490
 cleaning registry keys
