00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.820
 yes very happy very excited because no 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.880
 I had to play or the lion never 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.550
 touched or against the lion the truth is 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.980
 funny not but that ascends in everything 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.260
 long of my good career was when I did not 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.439
 It coincided when Leon was at first 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.539
 and now I hope it touches me obviously 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.340
 I have said it always I do not want much 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.040
 city ​​I want a lot of lion here I started 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.940
 play soccer here I have my family to my 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.100
 friends 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.170
 I started in the lion's basic forces 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.090
 going to see the lion and there was born my 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.250
 illusion for by football now 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.370
 I'm obviously in another team 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.140
 I represent these other colors and what 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.120
 I want to win when there were rumors 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.730
 there were real options that over here if 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.949
 well they did not materialize I do not tell you and no 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.170
 I know what may happen in the future now 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.809
 I am very comfortable with Atlante but 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.039
 you do not know in life everything changes a 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.990
 moment to another and football like this is 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.790
 as well 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.190
 I think since I started here 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.610
 third division second division what 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.800
 I always wanted to play on the team 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.300
 I was born here and he has always said that 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.830
 I would like to play lion always at 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.600
 I've said it throughout my career 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.540
 we come to the best in situations 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.159
 similar we have not gone very 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.009
 well it has been a very bad league tournament 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.929
 they too have also been 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.319
 wrong they have 10 points are behind 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:30.119
 us but we have talked him lion to 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.100
 the best was missing that dose of luck 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.530
 because it is a team that plays well at 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.859
 football that stands on any court 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.240
 of face for with a lot of personality and not 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.670
 they have left things in the tournament 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.969
 but need we need both the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.579
 triumph over the percentage situation 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.859
 because this tournament is fought by them and 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.319
 us but the next one if it does not add up 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:55.289
 now they start from below and 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.969
 we do not say it is very complicated and 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.800
 I tell you lions a team that plays well 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.110
 to football that attacks very well 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.640
 and well we know we know what is the 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.230
 Lion fans or support that gives 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.990
 always to the team and that's important 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.450
 that motivates them a lot then despite 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.110
 the numbers is going to be a pretty game 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:23.339
 complicated 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:23.339
