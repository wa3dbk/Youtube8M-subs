00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.240
 [Music] 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.150
 To paint this box, that door 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:26.349
 jewelry we will be using the 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:30.310
 mdf brushes varied sizes a gap 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:34.780
 Indian acrylic matte white and 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:41.470
 black goes to modeling varnish 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:44.680
 craquelée glassware spatula and molds 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:48.519
 the first step is the application of gum 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:52.030
 Indian lacquer on the entire can 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.920
 preparation of the surface for the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.929
 ink receipt 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.379
 then after all the application of gum 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:02.019
 lacquer it stays this way soon after 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.100
 drying it with a plate 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.470
 we call it the whole box 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.470
 after fully closed we 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.170
 we will be passing two coats of this 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.040
 Black ink 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.770
 across the carton inside and out 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.350
 now we wait 20 minutes for the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.950
 drying to the next step 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.450
 the next step is now the application of 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.060
 cast mold 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.189
 this cast cast all this material we 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.520
 we meet at the artist's house 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:40.450
 then the one that we cast on 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:46.170
 some points of it that permanent glue 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.170
 to be able to fix in the box 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.789
 So there the points that I think I 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.740
 I spent with permanent adhesive causes 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.200
 that female pique mold that in the box and 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.450
 do not dance 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.450
 so I'll get the modeling folder 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:08.740
 with plastic spatula and I will apply this 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:13.630
 template as soon as I pass the mass 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:17.610
 I can already withdraw this mold and there're the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:22.530
 texture that we make in the lid 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:26.720
 on the sides of the box is the same thing 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.720
 I'm going to position the mold 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.209
 he is already in the queue 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:38.550
 permanent points 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.620
 I come with the mass and I will apply the 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.630
 next step in our little box 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.800
 we will be applying a coat of 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.530
 we apply here in the 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.880
 latin side of the box 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:57.750
 then applied this varnish hand 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:04.080
 We'll be living with the paint now. 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:06.300
 white acrylic paint the same ink as 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.580
 we used to give in the box 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.850
 We let her all black we'll be 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.860
 doing this for what you read is 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.340
 the foam beater 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:22.319
 we will be using treat by applying 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.900
 this ink homogeneously 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.329
 so we hit the batter in the ink 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.030
 and we take the excess I'll never get 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.700
 ink here and hit directly then done 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.000
 This we may be putting this 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.790
 box that box lid in the sun 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.310
 using a screen blower that the 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:47.970
 It accelerates the sun crackled process 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.850
 it takes about 25 minutes sock 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.810
 time in total time when the sun is 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.640
 hot the valadares has a hot sun 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.280
 help us a lot after 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.920
 completely dry this texture it goes 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:07.980
 get curly we use again Alexlex 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:12.750
 sharing this excess of brand and 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.120
 I came here with this brush 447 number 12 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.620
 he is a special brush to make 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.140
 this work we are going to do that is 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.209
 the shaded then it is shankar dinho 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.520
 it is not an ordinary brush 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.470
 note that he is cutting dino and he is 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.860
 to make this shading 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.680
 then we look at the water each and 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:36.000
 hydrated in the absence of excess 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:40.290
 humidity in this way we 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.730
 It's from the brush and we're going to do this 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:48.720
 important shading is to get ink only 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:51.780
 on the tip of the brush because the hairs are 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.700
 cleaned from behind is that 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.380
 interact with the front and make themselves 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.280
 shaded to finish on the 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.070
 job 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.030
 after all over the lid of the 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.390
 Cashier 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.500
 We're going to touch up those 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.310
 We gave it here at the time that we 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.070
 sponge was finally given after the 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.400
 totally dry box retouched and 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.580
 Shaded we will glue or glaze 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.630
 to give the extra embellishment on the lid 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.630
 Cashier 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.090
 the glass it comes as soon as we have 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.919
 that coming from the treasury and not cutting 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:33.440
 need lots of glue 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:37.200
 It already comes with the strip of glass beads 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.440
 finishing while drying the glass 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:45.630
 that we roll on the side of the lid 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:47.190
 We will come with varnish to organize all 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.460
 our box 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.520
 that bottom of the box we made 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.870
 only the texture detail with the 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.470
 cast mold 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.750
 we did not crack it because our 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:04.350
 our main star of our box 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.910
 it's the right cover she embellishes 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.460
 really the box 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.380
 the texture detail just right to write 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.450
 best 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:15.780
 then after it is completely dry 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:18.600
 the ventrilo in it in the paste to the mass 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.710
 We will pass the varnish to give 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.720
 finishing 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.620
 we do not need to make up glass 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:28.169
 The glass already has its own 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.289
 this product we can is accelerating 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:34.619
 with the dryer involves it 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:37.800
 Do not worry, we can not 

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:38.999
 put in the sun to wait and the dollars 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.430
 huh 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:43.169
 with hair as five minutes the 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.259
 all the material that we 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:47.969
 we used to make our little box and the 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.559
 material we use the class 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:51.680
 previous it was the plate with craquelê 

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:54.479
 we meet at the artist's house 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.270
 our salespeople will be there 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:59.789
 all ready to attack by putting in 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.550
 hands all material to these two 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:08.009

 list of material and technique and was 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:16.919
