00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.920
 in a few days 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.149
 if you want to buy it the nokia tablet 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.390

 all continental europe with delivery 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.430
 within 48 hours when a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.620
 extra 5 pounds to get it 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.289
 even in 24 adidas bought 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.940
 runtastic is a very sensible fact 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.440
 that who actually produces shoes 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.570
 also owns the technology for 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.399
 measure what you do with those shoes 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.800
 it opens obviously from racing 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.589
 facebook can't resist but it's when 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.150
 someone does a service that works 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.439
 facebook like a band of Japanese 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.479
 multiplied by ten copies 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.760
 immediately in fact here comes the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.220
 direct video on the platform of 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.770
 facebook but only for celebrities who 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.570
 they use facebook mansions blackberry 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.759
 pasport silver edition is already available 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.759
 for the order in England a price of 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.229
 332 pounds plus VAT and therefore everything 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.460
 added a much more competitive price 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.630
 compared to that of previous models 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.770
 security android samsung you are 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.829
 taking it very seriously 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.990
 there is the stage fright problem that is 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.610
 of messages that can even do 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.799
 explode the phone to explode in the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.990
 figurative sense obviously through a 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.340
 mms but some operators around the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.320
 world have blocked the download 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.140
 automatic mms by 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.119
 the first solutions arrive phones 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.570
 for example from the day after tomorrow in 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.310
 distribution for alcatel idol is 3 ma 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.079
 be careful because samsung and google 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.479
 they let you know that from here on out 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.710
 there will be a monthly update for i 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.799
 security issues then 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.719
 much more frequent updates for 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.250
 check the security heart in the 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.590
 world 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.480
 of android about security is 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.180
 a survey was done right on 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.480
 android and ios products compared yes 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.220
 they can take fingerprints 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.160
 from android products is impossible 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.709
 instead access the memory that 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.340
 It contains the footprints of apple then 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.610
 once again android proves more 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.680
 vulnerable 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.030
 microsoft as netflix we talk about it 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.800
 because interesting as the companies in 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.080
 technology is softening a lot of i 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.450
 cordons and controls around and right 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.250
 and employees born yesterday in the announced 6th 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.100
 one year of parental leave for whom 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.600
 love for mothers and fathers who have children 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.209
 obviously in the course of their activity 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.560
 microsoft work also extended the 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.760
 period is not just 20 weeks 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.110
 then five months against the year of 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.670
 netflix apple to messages are 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.760
 lots of news today won't be there 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.459
 the cause just in the case on the web of 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.350
 group is against apple for services 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.570
 imessage that remained doing blocking 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.730
 practically sms messages when you 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.680
 abandoned the ios platform this 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.100
 happened in the past about ios 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.440
 nemorino whatsapp sorry by updating 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.209
 whatsapp on ios and you will have the chance 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.549
 to backup even the videos you have 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.110
 they are sent and otherwise I would say that 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.360
 there is nothing else to say except 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.549
 wish you a fantastic holiday if there 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.130
 obviously gave a good stay 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.380
 in the city its where you live for the 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.130
 period of place we find ourselves like 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.299
 said on 24 obviously very bronzed 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.610
 will be the same as you have to find 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.739
 application 2.0 3.0 that does 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.579
 turning black the whole screen will see us 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.579
 to 24 hello
