90s Marvel decided yet our characters
never<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.430> aged<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.910> let's<00:00:48.090> bump<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
never really aged so let's bump up the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.299 
never really aged so let's bump up the
timeline<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> little<00:00:49.230> bit<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.680> let's<00:00:50.160> say

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
timeline a little bit and let's say

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.889 
timeline a little bit and let's say
Punisher<00:00:50.730> fought<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> Gulf<00:00:51.329> War<00:00:51.480> instead

Punisher fought in the Gulf War instead
of<00:00:52.020> Vietnam<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.739> think<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.520> was<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> bit<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
of Vietnam I think that was a bit of a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.520 
of Vietnam I think that was a bit of a
problem<00:00:54.390> because<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> fact<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.440> think

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
problem because of the fact that I think

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.799 
problem because of the fact that I think
that<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.370> psychological<00:00:56.850> scarring<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
that the psychological scarring and the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.450 
that the psychological scarring and the
things<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.379> Punisher<00:00:58.949> went<00:00:59.219> through

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
things that Punisher went through

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.029 
things that Punisher went through
Vietnam<00:01:00.420> had<00:01:00.629> such<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> huge<00:01:01.289> part<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.890> that

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
Vietnam had such a huge part of that

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.979 
Vietnam had such a huge part of that
needs<00:01:02.280> such<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> character<00:01:03.149> from<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.539> time<00:01:03.809> in
