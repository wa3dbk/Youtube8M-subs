premiere<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.330> really<00:00:15.660> cabin<00:00:16.080> first<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:16.650> build

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
premiere is really cabin first we build

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.500 
premiere is really cabin first we build
the<00:00:17.160> plane<00:00:17.400> around<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.850> cabin<00:00:18.210> out<00:00:18.330> the

the plane around the cabin out the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.349 
the plane around the cabin out the
cockpit<00:00:18.930> as<00:00:19.590> we<00:00:19.740> went<00:00:19.859> out<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.189> various<00:00:20.760> owners

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359

your<00:00:24.449> first<00:00:24.630> jet<00:00:25.130> the<00:00:26.130> end<00:00:26.310> result<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.849> is

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
your first jet the end result of that is

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.050 
your first jet the end result of that is
what<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.869> see<00:00:28.019> right<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.699> premiere<00:00:29.699> 1a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
what you see right here the premiere 1a

what you see right here the premiere 1a
as<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.779> today

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
as it is today

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.220 
as it is today
and<00:00:31.590> that's<00:00:32.579> really<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.540> genesis<00:00:34.020> for

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
and that's really the the genesis for

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.319 
and that's really the the genesis for
how<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.469> aircraft<00:00:34.710> came<00:00:35.160> into<00:00:35.340> being<00:00:35.579> we

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
how the aircraft came into being we

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.819 
how the aircraft came into being we
learned<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.660> lot<00:00:36.780> from<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.260> starship<00:00:37.680> on

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
learned a lot from the starship on

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.430 
learned a lot from the starship on
composites<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.670> composites<00:00:39.570> allows<00:00:40.170> us<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
composites and composites allows us to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.950 
composites and composites allows us to
build<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.710> larger<00:00:41.129> fuselage<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:42.510> less<00:00:42.690> weight

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
build a larger fuselage with less weight

this<00:00:43.800> wing<00:00:44.100> was<00:00:44.309> built<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:44.969> aircraft<00:00:45.180> we

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
this wing was built for this aircraft we

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.840 
this wing was built for this aircraft we
didn't<00:00:45.930> use<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> borrowed<00:00:46.829> wing<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:47.789> a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
didn't use a borrowed wing and it's a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.400 
didn't use a borrowed wing and it's a
supercritical<00:00:48.210> wing<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.870> actually<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.320> one

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
supercritical wing and actually is one

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.170 
supercritical wing and actually is one
of<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> keys<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> aircraft's

quickly<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.079> aircraft<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:55.890> that

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
quickly in this aircraft you can do that

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.340 
quickly in this aircraft you can do that
there<00:00:56.910> hadn't<00:00:57.180> been<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.300> clean<00:00:57.899> sheet<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.199> paper

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
light jet in over 25 years and so as I

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.920 
light jet in over 25 years and so as I
always<00:01:01.920> say<00:01:02.219> when<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.910> start<00:01:03.570> from<00:01:03.719> scratch

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
always say when you start from scratch

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.380 
always say when you start from scratch
you<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.260> really<00:01:04.619> think<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.949> through<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:06.060> only

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
you can really think it through not only

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.469 
you can really think it through not only
did<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:07.320> through<00:01:07.770> surveys<00:01:08.250> what<00:01:08.790> people

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
did we get through surveys what people

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.880 
did we get through surveys what people
or<00:01:09.659> what<00:01:09.840> our<00:01:09.930> customers<00:01:10.290> wanted<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.650> see<00:01:10.799> in

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
or what our customers wanted to see in

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.950 
or what our customers wanted to see in
our<00:01:11.010> lights<00:01:11.189> yet<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.700> also<00:01:11.909> formed<00:01:12.510> what

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
our lights yet but we also formed what

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.830 
our lights yet but we also formed what
we<00:01:13.049> call<00:01:13.260> an<00:01:13.409> operator<00:01:13.799> advisory<00:01:14.369> team<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
we call an operator advisory team and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.570 
we call an operator advisory team and
they<00:01:15.840> became<00:01:16.170> part<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> design<00:01:16.979> team<00:01:17.340> that

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
they became part of the design team that

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.039 
they became part of the design team that
defined<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> requirements<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.689> aircraft

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
defined the requirements of the aircraft

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.499 
defined the requirements of the aircraft
as<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.070> walk<00:01:20.280> around<00:01:20.580> today<00:01:20.700> later<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.270> I'll

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
as we walk around today later on I'll

as we walk around today later on I'll
point<00:01:21.720> out<00:01:21.840> some<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> things<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.830> example

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
point out some of the things for example

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.940 
point out some of the things for example
this<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.090> six<00:01:24.360> passenger<00:01:24.600> light<00:01:25.320> yet<00:01:25.590> not<00:01:25.920> a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
this is a six passenger light yet not a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.100 
this is a six passenger light yet not a
four<00:01:26.189> passenger<00:01:26.430> light<00:01:26.850> yet<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.270> was<00:01:27.900> told

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
four passenger light yet I was told

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.859 
four passenger light yet I was told
early<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.950> was<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> kind<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.270> debatable

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
early on that was a kind of a debatable

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.480 
early on that was a kind of a debatable
thing<00:01:31.110> should<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.500> go<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:31.829> seats<00:01:32.100> or<00:01:32.250> six

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
thing should we go for seats or six

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.480 
thing should we go for seats or six
seats<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.720> see<00:01:33.900> through<00:01:34.409> our

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
seats and you can see through our

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.920 
seats and you can see through our
customer<00:01:35.490> input<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.240> six<00:01:36.509> seed<00:01:36.689> jet

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
customer input we have a six seed jet

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.569 
customer input we have a six seed jet
and<00:01:37.110> which<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.530> course<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.950> think<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> right

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
and which is of course I think the right

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.080

was<00:02:15.590> definitely<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.310> major<00:02:16.880> major<00:02:17.420> design

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
was definitely a major major design

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.500 
was definitely a major major design
point<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.350> what<00:02:19.340> allowed<00:02:19.640> us<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.820> do<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.300> of

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
point and what allowed us to do that of

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.390 
point and what allowed us to do that of
course<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.960> our<00:02:21.110> belief<00:02:21.620> in<00:02:21.860> composite

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
course is our belief in composite

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.200 
course is our belief in composite
technology<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.150> then<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.140> second<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.620> speed

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
technology and then the second is speed

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.370 
technology and then the second is speed
people<00:02:26.210> want<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.480> travel<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.110> get<00:02:27.200> there

people want to travel and get there

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.980 
people want to travel and get there
quickly<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:29.030> speed<00:02:29.360> was<00:02:29.600> certainly<00:02:29.900> a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
quickly and so speed was certainly a

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.890 
quickly and so speed was certainly a
design<00:02:30.980> point<00:02:31.220> with<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.520> aircraft<00:02:31.940> what<00:02:32.780> we

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
design point with the aircraft what we

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.320 
design point with the aircraft what we
learned<00:02:33.140> from<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:34.010> premier<00:02:34.490> one<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.120> 1a

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
learned from the premier one to the 1a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.720 
learned from the premier one to the 1a
and<00:02:35.750> then<00:02:35.900> on<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.380> two<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.800> that<00:02:37.130> as<00:02:37.580> we

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
and then on to the two is that as we

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.820 
and then on to the two is that as we
reflect<00:02:38.060> back<00:02:38.240> on<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.690> 1<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.050> 1a<00:02:39.170> the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
reflect back on the 1 and 1a the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.410 
reflect back on the 1 and 1a the
customers<00:02:40.459> told<00:02:40.700> us<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.060> they<00:02:41.150> loved<00:02:41.390> the

customers told us and they loved the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.180 
customers told us and they loved the
aircraft<00:02:41.959> they<00:02:42.110> loved<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.410> avionics<00:02:42.830> they

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
aircraft they loved the avionics they

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.730 
aircraft they loved the avionics they
liked<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.580> speed<00:02:43.880> they<00:02:44.180> liked<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.540> cabin<00:02:44.959> but

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
liked the speed they liked the cabin but

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.650 
liked the speed they liked the cabin but
they<00:02:45.860> wanted<00:02:46.160> more<00:02:46.340> payload<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.030> range<00:02:47.090> and

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
they wanted more payload and range and

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.500 
they wanted more payload and range and
that<00:02:48.260> was<00:02:48.440> really<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.580> number<00:02:49.910> one<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.300> guess

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
that was really the number one I guess

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.840 
that was really the number one I guess
you<00:02:50.630> might<00:02:50.750> say<00:02:51.220> shortfall<00:02:52.220> that<00:02:52.400> we<00:02:52.489> had<00:02:52.640> with

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
you might say shortfall that we had with

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.810 
you might say shortfall that we had with
the<00:02:52.940> aircraft<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.660> in<00:02:53.870> terms<00:02:54.440> of<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.800> 1<00:02:55.310> in<00:02:55.489> 1a

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
the aircraft and in terms of the 1 in 1a

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.140 
the aircraft and in terms of the 1 in 1a
people<00:02:56.540> always<00:02:56.780> want<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.170> go<00:02:57.290> further<00:02:57.620> and

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
people always want to go further and

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.090 
people always want to go further and
that<00:02:59.150> was<00:02:59.360> our<00:02:59.480> focus<00:02:59.840> was<00:02:59.959> led<00:03:00.200> us<00:03:00.320> to<00:03:00.530> the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
that was our focus was led us to the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.470 
that was our focus was led us to the
premier<00:03:01.459> 2<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.940> which<00:03:02.090> we'll<00:03:02.269> talk<00:03:02.420> about

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
premier 2 and which we'll talk about

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.259 
premier 2 and which we'll talk about
here<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.140> now<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.800> little<00:03:04.070> bit<00:03:04.220> we<00:03:04.910> did<00:03:05.090> some

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
here and now in a little bit we did some

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.460 
here and now in a little bit we did some
other<00:03:05.390> system<00:03:05.840> improvements<00:03:06.320> to<00:03:06.380> the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
other system improvements to the

other system improvements to the
aircraft<00:03:06.890> for<00:03:07.130> example<00:03:07.519> we<00:03:07.670> went<00:03:07.820> to<00:03:08.000> master

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
aircraft for example we went to master

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.630 
aircraft for example we went to master
cylinder<00:03:08.989> brakes<00:03:09.200> which<00:03:09.980> was<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.190> nice<00:03:10.400> nice

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
cylinder brakes which was a nice nice

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.330 
cylinder brakes which was a nice nice
out<00:03:10.880> of<00:03:11.000> feature<00:03:11.180> with<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.540> new<00:03:12.130> anti<00:03:13.130> skid

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.520 
out of feature with a new anti skid
valve<00:03:13.610> we<00:03:14.300> changed<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.690> lift<00:03:14.870> on<00:03:15.019> system<00:03:15.410> on

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
valve we changed the lift on system on

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.710 
valve we changed the lift on system on
the<00:03:15.620> aircraft<00:03:15.769> we're<00:03:16.340> on<00:03:16.580> landing<00:03:17.060> when
