00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 ok 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.940
 if there is a suggestion of stretches 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.590
 I really like witches and 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.640
 this year wanted to offer you the trick 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.100
 scenic witch witch crow 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.170
 point that also had elements that 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.780
 remember this super bird 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.070
 haunting me over there are done all 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.110
 a story sooner or later there 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.230
 I'll tell you, but now let's move on to the trick 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.230
 eyes 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.360
 first we go to cover the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.830
 our eyebrows with putty and them 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.720
 we pull upwards before yes 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.110
 dry in this way will flatten 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.330
 well and after having fixed them with some 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.280
 loose powder loose will not give 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.410
 particular problems to be covered 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.570
 with cosmetic plasticine 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.650
 this because we want to delete them not 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.840
 so completely perfect but also 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.660
 in a summary way just because though 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.000
 they will be covered by the color we don't want 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.190
 that they are too obvious so let's go 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.250
 to first tap on a foundation 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.960
 high coverage and then to blend 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.500
 the effect with a little sponge 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:46.080
 wet now I apply the primer on everything 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.690
 the eye and a small brush 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.690
 small I am going to start drawing the 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.430
 my silhouette with black paste colors 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.540
 in my case I'm using water 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.540
 akrai or lan color 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.240
 first draw the entire eyelid and 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.090
 then he started drawing black too 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.910
 towards tear duct proceeding to 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.200
 along my eyebrow 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.560
 I really want to give a connotation and 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.440
 of crow to this bird's eye 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.170
 so as if the trick were getting longer 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.650
 from the eye to the eyebrow up to 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.720
 nose along the phage route but beginning a 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.110
 draw lines that must be 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.450
 the straight but absolutely summary like 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.459
 direction that is the important thing that not 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.769
 then the makeup is flickering e 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.660
 trace them very quickly though they must 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.690
 go right in all directions 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.640
 nice of this game than that not 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.370
 will have to be precise for nothing there 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.930
 it will be a lot of fun to mess around 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.299
 yes the face 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.579
 therefore the tracks are at the edges 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:58.099
 of the eye is the contours of the 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.099
 eyebrows always with black in cream 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.640
 with a smaller brush goes by 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.100
 refine the effect because obviously the 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.750
 brush he used before from a 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.310
 effect a little more coarse while 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.620
 I also want a lot more lines 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.680
 thin that capelliano an idea of 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.690
 fine plumage here is the black we have 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.330
 finished and now let's add the 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.470
 same details but white always in the 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.470
 outline of our makeup 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.640
 obviously my suggestion is always 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.990
 the one to trace these lines the most 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.070
 quickly the pist 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.070
 intimately possible 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.489
 when we are satisfied with the result 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.310
 let's finally get ours 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.870
 true river here are these feathers 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.780
 that I found at the brico io with which 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.909
 I'm being stupid and fix them with 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.310
 of the putty because I finished the glue 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.049
 for false eyelashes so currently use 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.060
 the putty but the glue is sufficient for 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.000
 I 'm going to apply fake eyelashes to mine 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.780
 taste as it seems to me that they remember more 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.250
 just a bird I apply those first 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:22.850
 black and then later those 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.479
 white attention that you will find 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.130
 feathers for the home for weeks 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.550
 here are the eyes are finished are 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.440
 been fast enough to make 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.330
 in the sense it is a choreographic trick that 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.789
 however it takes very little time 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.220
 fun because it's not stressful not 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:43.400
 you have to be symmetrical and this thing 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.810
 here I found it very suitable indeed to 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.789
 a halloween trick that maybe you 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.990
 he wants to do the evening and not spend it all 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.940
 the day 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.530
 let's move on to very simple lip make-up 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.840
 also optional because the lips are 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.310
 you can also simply delete the 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:01.330
 we always fill from the usual color 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.330
 kneads black quite accurately 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.400
 and then we go to draw what I own 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.430
 mom when i saw the makeup picture 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.370
 he called the beard or if we go to do 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:18.490
 the same straight black lines and in 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:21.419
 totally random directions also in the 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.419
 mouth design 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.339
 how did we have eyes is 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.960
 tense but also a smaller brush 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:33.449
 from fine arts to finish a little 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.879
 the effect this mouth in my opinion from 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.349
 just the disturbing effect that yes 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:40.550
 good for makeup but if you don't like it 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.550
 you can not me for the 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:47.259
 et voila our trick to explain 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.259
 crow and he finished you 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.699
 I hope this my second proposal 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.770
 for halloween you enjoyed it and that 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:24.419
 can you use this trick too 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.830
 in different ways , many of you 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:29.759
 when he showed you a preview 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:32.340
 on instagram they assumed it was the 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:34.680
 trick for the black swan maybe doing 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.190
 only the eyes can be a good one 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.380
 option 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.380
 I hope to see you soon kisses 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:07:03.150
 to 66 66 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:10.800
 you don't want wi pie wi in your white 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.800
 and 6 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.420

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.510
