00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
vehicle if you will well though it's not

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.749 
vehicle if you will well though it's not
as<00:00:10.230> big<00:00:10.440> as<00:00:10.620> some<00:00:10.740> other<00:00:10.950> previous<00:00:11.340> years<00:00:11.580> but

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
as big as some other previous years but

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.009 
as big as some other previous years but
it's<00:00:11.880> still<00:00:12.030> pretty<00:00:12.240> cool<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.719> what<00:00:12.840> it's<00:00:12.960> a

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
it's still pretty cool and what it's a

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.930 
it's still pretty cool and what it's a
nice<00:00:13.230> special<00:00:13.769> feature<00:00:14.009> about<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.700> it

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
nice special feature about it is that it

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.279 
nice special feature about it is that it
turns<00:00:15.179> into<00:00:15.420> what<00:00:16.199> do<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.410> call<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:17.119> battle

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
turns into what do you call it battle

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.109 
turns into what do you call it battle
front<00:00:19.289> battle<00:00:19.680> placement<00:00:20.189> okay<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:20.970> here

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
front battle placement okay and so here

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.480 
front battle placement okay and so here
we<00:00:21.210> are<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.390> ship<00:00:21.779> mode<00:00:22.050> right<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.369> comes

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
we are in ship mode right so it comes

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.849 
we are in ship mode right so it comes
with<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> clone<00:00:24.180> pilot<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.350> as<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:25.830> see

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
with a clone pilot and as you can see

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.859 
with a clone pilot and as you can see
here<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.340> thing<00:00:26.609> as<00:00:26.730> packing<00:00:27.210> some<00:00:27.359> he's<00:00:27.539> got

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
here is thing as packing some he's got

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.509 
here is thing as packing some he's got
loads<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.170> firepower<00:00:28.560> projectiles<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
loads of firepower projectiles on the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.820 
loads of firepower projectiles on the
front<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.300> rotating<00:00:30.750> guns<00:00:30.900> here<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.710> was

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
front the rotating guns here it was

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.080 
front the rotating guns here it was
really<00:00:32.219> cool<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.700> great<00:00:33.000> feature<00:00:33.570> here

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.610 

just<00:00:40.090> so<00:00:40.240> this<00:00:40.600> is<00:00:40.720> a<00:00:40.750> prototype<00:00:41.050> so<00:00:41.470> not

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
just so this is a prototype so not

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.050 
just so this is a prototype so not
everything<00:00:41.860> is<00:00:42.100> working<00:00:42.280> exactly<00:00:42.550> and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
everything is working exactly and

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.090 
everything is working exactly and
actually<00:00:43.330> you<00:00:43.390> can<00:00:43.540> put<00:00:43.750> a<00:00:43.780> clone<00:00:44.110> attached<00:00:44.830> to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
actually you can put a clone attached to

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.979 
actually you can put a clone attached to
this<00:00:45.220> and<00:00:45.460> have<00:00:45.580> him<00:00:45.760> loaded<00:00:46.240> up<00:00:46.360> so<00:00:46.780> when<00:00:46.930> he

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
this and have him loaded up so when he

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.380 
this and have him loaded up so when he
pops<00:00:47.290> up<00:00:47.500> into<00:00:47.680> play<00:00:47.920> he's<00:00:48.670> actually<00:00:48.970> I<00:00:49.150> see

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
pops up into play he's actually I see

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.060 
pops up into play he's actually I see
their<00:00:49.600> peg<00:00:49.930> holes<00:00:50.140> on<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.410> bottom<00:00:50.560> so<00:00:50.890> he's

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
their peg holes on the bottom so he's

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.470 
their peg holes on the bottom so he's
already<00:00:51.220> that's<00:00:51.850> right<00:00:52.000> he's<00:00:52.180> already

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
already that's right he's already

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.270 
already that's right he's already

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
Manning the weapon station in addition

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.369 
Manning the weapon station in addition
on<00:00:54.520> top<00:00:54.760> here<00:00:55.000> we<00:00:55.120> have<00:00:55.210> a<00:00:55.330> run<00:00:55.960> here<00:00:56.260> is<00:00:56.350> a

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
on top here we have a run here is a

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.110 
on top here we have a run here is a
projectile<00:00:56.860> launcher<00:00:57.220> okay<00:00:57.700> which<00:00:58.000> is

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
projectile launcher okay which is

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.790 
projectile launcher okay which is
missing<00:00:58.450> at<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:58.570> moment<00:00:58.900> maybe<00:00:59.290> someone<00:00:59.620> shot

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
missing at the moment maybe someone shot

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.119 
missing at the moment maybe someone shot
it<00:00:59.920> probably<00:01:01.230> depends<00:01:02.230> if<00:01:02.559> that<00:01:02.710> is<00:01:02.890> cool

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
it probably depends if that is cool

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.920 
it probably depends if that is cool

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
exciting thing here is that this baby

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.080 
exciting thing here is that this baby
open<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.740> convert<00:01:09.100> into<00:01:09.520> this<00:01:09.670> great

battle<00:01:10.510> in<00:01:10.780> station<00:01:11.229> you<00:01:11.740> see<00:01:11.950> here<00:01:12.160> that<00:01:12.190> our

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
battle in station you see here that our

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.210 
battle in station you see here that our
you've<00:01:13.000> got<00:01:13.180> rotating<00:01:13.780> guns<00:01:13.960> on<00:01:14.170> top<00:01:14.440> figures

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
you've got rotating guns on top figures

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.120 
you've got rotating guns on top figures
can<00:01:15.430> stand<00:01:15.700> up<00:01:15.850> here<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.380> scout<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.410> area<00:01:17.680> out

particular how much or little platform

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.620 
particular how much or little platform
there<00:01:24.040> said<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.399> figure<00:01:24.640> does<00:01:25.090> that<00:01:25.210> raise<00:01:25.390> up

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
there said the figure does that raise up

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.510 
there said the figure does that raise up
and<00:01:25.750> down<00:01:25.869> or<00:01:26.020> is<00:01:26.110> it<00:01:26.259> Stan<00:01:26.560> it<00:01:26.710> is<00:01:26.860> not<00:01:27.070> it's

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
together yeah it's just station okay now

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.760 
together yeah it's just station okay now
here<00:01:31.479> on<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.720> side<00:01:31.930> you<00:01:32.259> can<00:01:32.350> see<00:01:32.380> we've<00:01:32.619> got

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
here on the side you can see we've got

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.580 
here on the side you can see we've got
this<00:01:32.890> great<00:01:33.190> blast<00:01:33.790> shields<00:01:34.300> open<00:01:35.290> up<00:01:35.410> and

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
this great blast shields open up and

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.950 
this great blast shields open up and
Eva's<00:01:35.800> little<00:01:35.979> flip<00:01:36.280> over<00:01:36.520> guns<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:37.750> looks

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
Eva's little flip over guns this looks

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.600 
Eva's little flip over guns this looks
to<00:01:38.050> be<00:01:38.080> a<00:01:38.170> sort<00:01:38.440> of<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.649> weapons<00:01:39.009> Rack<00:01:39.220> built<00:01:39.490> on

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
to be a sort of a weapons Rack built on
