00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
tried to do land on top of the VAB this

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.960 
tried to do land on top of the VAB this
is<00:00:32.770> much<00:00:32.920> trickier<00:00:33.160> than<00:00:33.520> most<00:00:33.730> other

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
is much trickier than most other

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.490 
is much trickier than most other
landings<00:00:34.360> because<00:00:34.630> of<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:34.810> smaller<00:00:35.080> landing

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
landings because of the smaller landing

to<00:00:56.620> do<00:00:56.800> this<00:00:56.920> trick<00:00:57.070> is<00:00:57.250> very<00:00:57.310> simple<00:00:57.880> but

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
to do this trick is very simple but

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.000 
to do this trick is very simple but
first<00:00:58.990> I<00:00:59.110> want<00:00:59.290> to<00:00:59.320> show<00:00:59.470> you<00:00:59.560> the<00:00:59.680> original

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
first I want to show you the original

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.270 
first I want to show you the original
technique<00:01:00.340> that<00:01:00.550> spooty<00:01:00.970> man<00:01:01.090> discovered<00:01:01.570> I

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
technique that spooty man discovered I

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.380 
technique that spooty man discovered I
think<00:01:03.280> he<00:01:03.340> stumbled<00:01:03.670> across<00:01:03.760> this<00:01:04.119> while<00:01:04.299> he

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
think he stumbled across this while he

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.570 
think he stumbled across this while he
was<00:01:04.479> working<00:01:04.720> on<00:01:04.809> his<00:01:05.080> SS<00:01:05.890> Tio's<00:01:06.159> on<00:01:06.430> his

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
was working on his SS Tio's on his

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.910 
was working on his SS Tio's on his
stream<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:08.020> concept<00:01:08.409> behind<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.650> trick<00:01:08.799> is

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
stream the concept behind the trick is

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.530 
stream the concept behind the trick is
that<00:01:08.950> something<00:01:09.280> that<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.430> lot<00:01:09.490> of<00:01:09.640> SSTO<00:01:10.240> or

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
that something that a lot of SSTO or

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.789 
that something that a lot of SSTO or
high-altitude<00:01:10.900> fliers<00:01:11.380> will<00:01:11.619> know<00:01:11.710> about

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
high-altitude fliers will know about

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.980 
high-altitude fliers will know about
when<00:01:12.729> your<00:01:12.850> engines<00:01:13.060> flame<00:01:13.299> out<00:01:13.450> they<00:01:13.720> stay

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
when your engines flame out they stay

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.929 
when your engines flame out they stay
spooled<00:01:14.380> up<00:01:14.530> even<00:01:15.280> when<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.490> engines<00:01:15.729> aren't

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
spooled up even when the engines aren't

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.480 
spooled up even when the engines aren't
providing<00:01:16.360> any<00:01:16.509> thrust<00:01:17.039> as<00:01:18.039> soon<00:01:18.219> as<00:01:18.310> they<00:01:18.399> get

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
providing any thrust as soon as they get

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.340 
providing any thrust as soon as they get
air<00:01:18.640> again<00:01:18.880> though<00:01:19.060> they<00:01:19.479> return<00:01:19.869> instantly

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
air again though they return instantly

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.310 
air again though they return instantly
to<00:01:20.469> the<00:01:20.619> thrust<00:01:20.859> level<00:01:21.130> they<00:01:21.310> were<00:01:21.369> at<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:23.170> can

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
to the thrust level they were at you can

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.539 
to the thrust level they were at you can
use<00:01:23.409> this<00:01:23.499> information<00:01:23.679> to<00:01:24.070> your<00:01:24.219> advantage

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
use this information to your advantage

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:25.889

suggest<00:01:47.079> that<00:01:47.319> you<00:01:47.469> try<00:01:47.590> this<00:01:47.679> out<00:01:47.950> if<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.189> get

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
suggest that you try this out if you get

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.160 
suggest that you try this out if you get
a<00:01:48.369> chance<00:01:48.549> I<00:01:48.880> had<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:49.509> lot<00:01:49.689> of<00:01:49.719> fun<00:01:49.929> messing

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
a chance I had a lot of fun messing

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.359 
a chance I had a lot of fun messing
around<00:01:50.289> with<00:01:50.469> it<00:01:50.590> after<00:01:50.829> I<00:01:50.859> watched<00:01:51.039> booty

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
around with it after I watched booty

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.289 
around with it after I watched booty
man's<00:01:51.520> video<00:01:56.789> after<00:01:57.789> playing<00:01:57.999> around<00:01:58.179> with

man's video after playing around with
his<00:01:58.450> discovery<00:01:58.749> for<00:01:59.049> quite<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.289> while<00:01:59.530> I

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
his discovery for quite a while I

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.499 
his discovery for quite a while I
decided<00:02:00.159> that<00:02:00.280> toggling<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:00.880> intakes<00:02:01.209> worked

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
decided that toggling the intakes worked

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.419 
decided that toggling the intakes worked
well<00:02:01.810> but<00:02:02.200> Ashley<00:02:02.590> toggling<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.069> engines

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
well but Ashley toggling the engines

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:04.980 
well but Ashley toggling the engines
worked<00:02:03.639> better<00:02:03.880> for<00:02:03.999> flying<00:02:04.450> and<00:02:04.659> landing

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
worked better for flying and landing

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.109 
worked better for flying and landing
beetles<00:02:05.399> thrust<00:02:06.399> memory<00:02:06.670> is<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:06.789> very<00:02:06.939> cool

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
beetles thrust memory is a very cool

feature<00:02:07.179> for<00:02:07.659> foodies<00:02:07.899> method<00:02:08.289> but<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.740> only

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
feature for foodies method but the only

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.440 
feature for foodies method but the only
problem<00:02:09.069> it<00:02:09.280> has<00:02:09.490> is<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.880> intakes<00:02:10.209> take<00:02:10.420> a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
problem it has is the intakes take a

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.090 
problem it has is the intakes take a
second<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.929> close<00:02:10.959> up<00:02:11.350> meaning<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.830> can't

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
second to close up meaning you can't

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.559 
second to close up meaning you can't
close<00:02:12.370> them<00:02:12.550> as<00:02:12.700> quickly<00:02:12.910> as<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.180> might<00:02:13.390> want

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
close them as quickly as you might want

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.710 
close them as quickly as you might want
to

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
to

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.090 
to
when<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.810> toggle<00:02:17.110> off<00:02:17.290> your<00:02:17.470> engines<00:02:17.830> they

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
when you toggle off your engines they

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.860 
when you toggle off your engines they
respond<00:02:18.460> right<00:02:18.640> away<00:02:18.910> which<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.270> what<00:02:19.360> I<00:02:19.420> like

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
respond right away which is what I like

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.420 
respond right away which is what I like
the<00:02:20.319> main<00:02:20.500> difference<00:02:20.860> though<00:02:21.010> is<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.310> when

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
the main difference though is that when

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.770 
the main difference though is that when
the<00:02:21.520> engines<00:02:21.819> are<00:02:21.970> turned<00:02:22.120> off<00:02:22.420> they're

the engines are turned off they're

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.320 
the engines are turned off they're
spooling<00:02:23.110> down<00:02:23.440> as<00:02:23.650> well<00:02:23.910> when<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.000> turn<00:02:25.150> them

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
spooling down as well when you turn them

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.650 
spooling down as well when you turn them
back<00:02:25.450> on

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
back on

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.880

there'll<00:02:25.959> be<00:02:26.020> slightly<00:02:26.380> weaker<00:02:26.650> than<00:02:26.800> they

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
there'll be slightly weaker than they

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.230 
there'll be slightly weaker than they
were<00:02:26.980> before<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.580> they'll<00:02:27.760> need<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.000> spool

back<00:02:28.390> up<00:02:28.600> again<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:30.880> isn't<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.209> problem<00:02:31.510> if

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
back up again this isn't a problem if

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:32.970 
back up again this isn't a problem if
you<00:02:31.660> toggle<00:02:31.840> them<00:02:32.050> off<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.470> on<00:02:32.500> immediately

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
you toggle them off and on immediately

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.470 
you toggle them off and on immediately
but<00:02:33.340> if<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.490> wait<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.670> second<00:02:34.000> or<00:02:34.120> two

problems

problems
butI<00:02:38.860> man's<00:02:39.040> method<00:02:39.220> doesn't<00:02:39.490> have<00:02:39.730> this

butI man's method doesn't have this

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.550 
butI man's method doesn't have this
issue<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.510> have<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.720> try<00:02:40.900> both<00:02:41.050> methods

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
issue so you have to try both methods

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.170 
issue so you have to try both methods
out<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:42.040> decide<00:02:42.340> which<00:02:42.489> one<00:02:42.640> works<00:02:42.760> best<00:02:43.060> for

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
out and decide which one works best for

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:54.790 
out and decide which one works best for
you

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.540 

now<00:02:55.800> I'll<00:02:55.920> run<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.160> through<00:02:56.220> how<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.460> use

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
now I'll run you through how to use

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.340 
now I'll run you through how to use
these<00:02:56.790> methods<00:02:57.000> performing<00:02:57.930> each<00:02:58.020> one<00:02:58.230> is

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
these methods performing each one is

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.050 
these methods performing each one is
practically<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.950> same<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.670> can<00:02:59.850> apply

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
practically the same so you can apply

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.640 
practically the same so you can apply
these<00:03:00.120> principles<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.720> both<00:03:00.900> techniques<00:03:01.260> I'll

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
these principles to both techniques I'll

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.470 
these principles to both techniques I'll
approach<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.490> from<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.760> engine<00:03:03.060> toggling

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
approach this from the engine toggling

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.240 
approach this from the engine toggling
method<00:03:03.780> though<00:03:03.930> if<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.860> watch<00:03:05.040> my<00:03:05.220> previous

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
advocate for finding your every point

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.920 
advocate for finding your every point
and<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.910> is<00:03:09.030> still<00:03:09.300> valuable<00:03:09.720> information

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
and it is still valuable information

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.710 
and it is still valuable information
here<00:03:11.000> when<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.090> do<00:03:12.180> this<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.480> want<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.660> be

this<00:03:14.880> gives<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.180> buffer<00:03:15.510> zone<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.750> work

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
this gives you a buffer zone to work

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.120 
this gives you a buffer zone to work
with<00:03:16.080> when<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.260> toggle<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.680> engines<00:03:16.980> off

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
different ways the first one is using it

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.910 
different ways the first one is using it
to<00:03:58.090> eliminate<00:03:58.510> all<00:03:58.690> your<00:03:58.720> vertical<00:03:59.319> speed<00:03:59.560> to
