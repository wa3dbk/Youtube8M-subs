00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.190
 and where ladies and gentleman cedor 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.139
 I hope you are well 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.030
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.630
 new fashion presentation that of the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.340
 renault 95 points 14 xt and there you from 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.279
 tell you but he backs off the tractor and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.480
 well yes friends backs back there no 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.519
 I will show you why not 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.099
 of worry so let's do a quick 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.480
 tractor ride so honestly I the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.470
 find super nice you will see 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.110
 the interior etc 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.079
 he's really cool with people 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.460
 time a little crado but it's 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.780
 normal it's normal simply 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.379
 because it's a tractor that's 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.730
 released in the 1980s so 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.620
 necessarily if he did not have a little bit of 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.809
 rust is that it would have served as 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.300
 decoration so it's normal and even that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.860
 adds a touch of realism that is 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.270
 awesome so I ride the tractor that is 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.859
 do so we'll talk a little bit of 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.800
 the engine so it's a tractor 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.870
 which is between 80 and 85 horses so 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.869
 do not expect pulled the mountains with 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.000
 but still it's a great way there 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.180
 must remember 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.710
 so then we go a little bit to 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.520
 the interior so the interior that is 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.870
 rather nice task so here is a quick 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.760
 tower 1 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.060
 orders that are very well done 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.380
 the steering wheel that is very much needed for 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.840
 to start it is really a thing 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.460
 great I'll show you so he goes 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.200
 have to call on the key y a 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.750
 first time 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.980
 so here he starts to move forward 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.330
 look at the pedals everything is ready 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.630
 we call back in second time and I will 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.630
 lets listen 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.250
 here is the tractor is finally starting is 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.230
 on the other hand a negative thing for me 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.450
 it's just watching when you're at 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.910
 inside the tractor everything is fine by 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.800
 against so we have different measures in 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.880
 outside view which is a pity that's 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.140
 that we do not see the man at 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.240
 inside the tractor when riding 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.690
 so that's not good enough 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.940
 pity but hey it's not it's not the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.280
 more dramatic either when we roll 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.570
 with it's true we really feel 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.420
 very good sensations way i'm going 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.890
 show you what happens when he turns 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.840
 and it's watching a little bit 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.180
 frankly i find it just awesome 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.920
 pity the counter does not work 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.770
 not but hey we forgive him again 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.080
 time by cons really look at a 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.940
 little when we go on 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.989
 posts or others really feels everything 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.620
 in this tractor so it's really 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.450
 something very nice tosh here 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.160
 I think I did a quick tour 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.239
 the tractor for the same to extinguish it 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.730
 press the key here is there 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.760
 the tractor is beautiful is well off and 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.590
 so now that this famous tractor 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.940
 and we will cut the video the friends in 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.590
 Anyway I hope that this little mode 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.239
 you will be pleased if it is 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.470
 do not hesitate to put a little thumb 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.300
 green as you always do 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.800
 and then let go of 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.959

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.040
 description also as always I 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.459
 tell you next time it was 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.239
 dangerous

 by everyone
