00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 yes alex pastor when the ajax is nec 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.799
 on it 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.600
 prior to this competition you 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.980
 plan to keep playing your own game 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.200
 nevertheless seemed a bit coolest 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.740
 Uterina arises that you also get more 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.610
 defense the player is right because yes we 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.340
 wild ones 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.289
 Invite Ajax and and try in the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.570
 counterattack 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.580
 but we do get rid of you a bit 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.230
 words that time and play your own game 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.640
 that NATO 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.869
 yes you prefer to play of course on the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.640
 half of the opponent but the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.050
 honesty area we also say 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.050
 that in previous editions 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.420
 keep trying and without much 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.219
 good luck 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.280
 nevertheless took and is in the initial phase 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.280
 it has possibilities here 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.690
 I touch you know which way you play 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.340
 You always feel against Ajax 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.620
 chance but it is also true that the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.180
 ajax play offers your chances 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.010
 become dangerous in the counterattack 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.510
 with name and first 15 minutes 15 minutes 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.309
 He has told us that a number of times 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.449
 excellent succeeded without us 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.579
 ultimately score 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.870
 because you do need the course 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.220
 above a plate, for example, that 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.420
 yield sneered 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.340
 yes, and it is prepared a bit 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.680
 the difference that's why it becomes 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.030
 what they read more effectively 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.710
 Well not just that because I think so 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.280
 ajax because it is easier than football 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.799
 We only do that if you know them 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.799
 invites on your own half and in the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.420
 counterattack which means that 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.369
 Keep it full easier when you get off and on 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.409
 toe in a shot and well we had then 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.090
 that did not work and they had the scoring 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.490
 from stage very difficult to 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.290
 field occupation a bit adjusted and 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.600
 I have to say in that phase and also in the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.259
 our share became the second half 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.799
 in particular 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.399
 if we had the ball much better and 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.009
 with 208 there are two three big chances 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.210
 had to get a connection hit or 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.920
 to score even more 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.270
 and if that fails then it stays 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.450
 of course a difficult story 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.939
 veda or box of navarone for which it says 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.960
 exact reason from after what we could 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.490
 better at it 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.100
 in the field occupation familiar to us 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.180
 are going to play 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.119
 well i thought it worked out well 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.770
 because he played a certain second 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.720
 half 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.560
 yes he has four or one 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.319
 scoreboard 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.180
 yes you mail tito doing good 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.600
 Matters how will you feel now 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.459
 i'm c-level your nakie in loss not 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 like it and certainly not with this kind 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.940
 numbers and on the other hand on it 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.110
 moment a rash in this way 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.630
 comes about 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.430
 then I like to look at the things that those 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.980
 very good and critical of the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.540
 things we want to improve and that 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.700
 is a moment apart from or a name river and 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.200
 another four and lose and that 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.700
 it will need each other because in 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.290
 the last 6 matches will be the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.450
 prizes will not be distributed next 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.850
 week but in all those competitions 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.170
 Well then it makes no sense at the moment 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.350
 that you lose going into a well 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.350
 to sit
