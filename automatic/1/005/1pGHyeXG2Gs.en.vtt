you're making inside proxy gap to plunge

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.699 
you're making inside proxy gap to plunge

out of the six space put it into the
plunge<00:02:38.030> base<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:39.340> suddenly<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.610> have<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.760> very

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.790 

and<00:02:51.400> there's<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.730> multitude<00:02:52.300> of<00:02:52.600> settings<00:02:52.990> so

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
and there's a multitude of settings so

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.400 
and there's a multitude of settings so
that<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:53.980> can<00:02:54.130> return<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:55.210> three<00:02:55.840> preset

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
that you can return to three preset

that you can return to three preset
stops<00:02:56.740> when<00:02:57.340> using<00:02:57.520> a<00:02:57.730> dovetail<00:02:57.940> jig<00:02:58.630> with<00:02:58.960> a

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.560 
stops when using a dovetail jig with a
router<00:02:59.490> it's<00:03:00.490> best<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.880> use<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:01.060> fixed<00:03:01.390> base

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
router it's best to use a fixed base

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.050 
router it's best to use a fixed base
router<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.650> reason<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.130> if<00:03:03.760> you<00:03:03.880> use<00:03:04.030> a

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
router and the reason is if you use a

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.140 
router and the reason is if you use a
plunge<00:03:04.450> router<00:03:04.630> like<00:03:04.870> this<00:03:05.730> there's<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.820> chance

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
plunge router like this there's a chance

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.330 
plunge router like this there's a chance
because<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.990> dovetail<00:03:08.410> bit<00:03:08.590> is<00:03:08.740> wider<00:03:09.040> at<00:03:09.310> the

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
because the dovetail bit is wider at the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.680 
because the dovetail bit is wider at the
bottom<00:03:09.930> below<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.110> fingers<00:03:11.500> here<00:03:12.600> after<00:03:13.600> you

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
chatter more as you make the cut because

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.690 
chatter more as you make the cut because
they're<00:03:50.290> not<00:03:50.530> as<00:03:50.770> rigid<00:03:50.980> there's<00:03:51.550> less
