polished<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.189> see<00:01:20.369> how<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.820> since<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.299> use

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
polished so you see how I since I use

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.109 
polished so you see how I since I use
the<00:01:21.479> wide<00:01:21.750> tooth<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.710> still<00:01:23.119> maintaining

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the wide tooth it's still maintaining

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.649 
the wide tooth it's still maintaining
that<00:01:24.450> textural<00:01:25.229> effect<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.970> if<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.060> few<00:01:27.240> pieces

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
that textural effect and if a few pieces

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.210 
that textural effect and if a few pieces
fall<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.110> front<00:01:28.380> that's<00:01:28.619> even<00:01:29.009> better
