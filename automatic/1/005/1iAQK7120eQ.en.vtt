the total divas show if I've forgotten
any<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.869> don't<00:01:43.079> think<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.590> just<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.310> come

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
any I don't think I have just to come

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.249 
any I don't think I have just to come
out<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.790> start<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.180> brawl<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.899> attack

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
out and start a brawl and just attack

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.440 
out and start a brawl and just attack
everybody<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.369> ring<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:48.299> would

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
everybody in the ring that would

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.149 
everybody in the ring that would
probably<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.990> perfect<00:01:49.229> way<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> advert

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
probably be the perfect way to advert

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.770 
probably be the perfect way to advert
advert<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.479> actual<00:01:51.899> total<00:01:52.439> divas<00:01:52.860> show<00:01:53.450> but<00:01:54.450> I

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
advert the actual total divas show but I

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.289 
advert the actual total divas show but I
think<00:01:55.770> that'd<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:56.040> slightly<00:01:56.460> far-fetched<00:01:57.030> to

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
think that'd be slightly far-fetched to

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.660 
think that'd be slightly far-fetched to
be<00:01:57.390> honest<00:01:57.689> I'd<00:01:58.649> probably<00:01:59.009> go<00:01:59.310> for<00:01:59.610> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
be honest I'd probably go for a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.580 
be honest I'd probably go for a
count-out<00:02:00.299> between<00:02:00.689> Italian<00:02:01.170> Brie<00:02:01.380> Bella

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
where nobody wins so they broke take the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.899 
where nobody wins so they broke take the
brawl<00:02:04.140> outside<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:05.159> ring<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.549> then<00:02:05.759> they

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
brawl outside the ring and then they

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.150 
brawl outside the ring and then they
just<00:02:06.180> both<00:02:06.329> get<00:02:06.570> counted<00:02:06.960> out<00:02:07.140> or<00:02:07.380> one<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> them
