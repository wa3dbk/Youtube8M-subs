00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:04.940 

on<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.270> discussion<00:00:03.810> board<00:00:04.080> were<00:00:04.319> discussing

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
on the discussion board were discussing

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.070 
on the discussion board were discussing
the<00:00:05.040> importance<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.730> mechanics<00:00:06.330> that<00:00:06.390> first

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
the importance of mechanics that first

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.020 
the importance of mechanics that first
accelerates<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.919> bat<00:00:08.099> head<00:00:08.280> rearward<00:00:08.790> from

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
accelerates the bat head rearward from

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.190 
accelerates the bat head rearward from
the<00:00:09.150> launch<00:00:09.389> position

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
the launch position

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.919 
the launch position
now<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.650> refer<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.429> mechanic<00:00:12.000> as<00:00:12.210> tht

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
now I refer to this mechanic as tht

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.160 
now I refer to this mechanic as tht
because<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> torquing<00:00:15.450> action<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.020> we

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
because it is a torquing action and we

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.930 
because it is a torquing action and we
can<00:00:16.350> get<00:00:16.500> into<00:00:16.710> how<00:00:16.859> its<00:00:17.039> applied<00:00:17.340> later<00:00:17.609> but<00:00:17.910> I

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
can get into how its applied later but I

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.330 
can get into how its applied later but I
thought<00:00:18.270> was<00:00:18.539> showing<00:00:18.930> some<00:00:19.800> batters<00:00:20.160> that

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
thought was showing some batters that

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.580 
thought was showing some batters that
exhibit<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> mechanic<00:00:21.420> compared<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> few

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
exhibit the mechanic compared to a few

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.089 
exhibit the mechanic compared to a few
that<00:00:22.800> don't<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.970> can<00:00:24.150> see<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:25.099> difference

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
that don't we can see the the difference

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.769 
that don't we can see the the difference
and<00:00:26.310> therefore<00:00:26.460> appreciate<00:00:27.119> why<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.630> so

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
and therefore appreciate why it's so

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.390 
and therefore appreciate why it's so
important<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:28.529> I'm<00:00:28.710> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.949> start<00:00:29.220> off<00:00:29.369> here

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
important so I'm going to start off here

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.950 
important so I'm going to start off here
with<00:00:29.849> petroliana

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
with petroliana

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.359 
with petroliana
but<00:00:31.230> he<00:00:31.410> weighs<00:00:31.619> about<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.920> hundred<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
but he weighs about a hundred and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.700 
but he weighs about a hundred and
seventy-five<00:00:32.759> eighty<00:00:33.090> pounds<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.960> therefore

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
seventy-five eighty pounds and therefore

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.900 
seventy-five eighty pounds and therefore
he's<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.430> really<00:00:35.610> take

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
he's going to have to really take

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.090 
he's going to have to really take
advantage<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.600> good<00:00:37.050> mechanics<00:00:37.590> right<00:00:37.800> from

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
advantage of good mechanics right from

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.610 
advantage of good mechanics right from
initiation<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.660> produce<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.110> bat<00:00:40.290> speedy

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
initiation to produce the bat speedy

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.319 
initiation to produce the bat speedy
death<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.070> I'm<00:00:41.160> gonna<00:00:41.280> draw<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> line<00:00:41.940> here

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
death so I'm gonna draw in the line here

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.330 
death so I'm gonna draw in the line here
we'll<00:00:42.989> draw<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.320> right<00:00:43.500> down<00:00:43.710> through<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> bat

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
we'll draw it right down through the bat

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.970 
we'll draw it right down through the bat
down<00:00:44.610> into<00:00:44.969> here<00:00:45.120> now<00:00:45.450> that's<00:00:45.739> about<00:00:46.739> his

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
down into here now that's about his

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.560 
down into here now that's about his
starting<00:00:47.489> position<00:00:47.640> then<00:00:48.210> I'm<00:00:48.360> going<00:00:48.539> to

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
starting position then I'm going to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.560 
starting position then I'm going to
cycle<00:00:48.840> him<00:00:49.140> forward<00:00:49.620> now<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.360> first

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
cycle him forward now to to the first

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.450 
cycle him forward now to to the first
four<00:00:51.840> frames<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:52.680> we're<00:00:52.890> looking<00:00:53.039> at<00:00:53.250> him

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
four frames and now we're looking at him

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.790 
four frames and now we're looking at him
here<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.969> sixty<00:00:54.629> frames<00:00:54.780> per<00:00:54.989> second<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.530> his

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
here in sixty frames per second so his

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.650 
here in sixty frames per second so his
initiation<00:00:56.280> time<00:00:56.760> would<00:00:57.000> actually<00:00:57.360> be<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
initiation time would actually be the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.810 
initiation time would actually be the
first<00:00:57.690> four<00:00:58.199> frames<00:00:58.559> when<00:00:59.280> we're<00:00:59.399> looking<00:00:59.520> at

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
first four frames when we're looking at

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.060 
first four frames when we're looking at
batters<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.780> 30<00:01:01.050> frames<00:01:01.379> per<00:01:01.559> second<00:01:01.920> that

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
batters in the 30 frames per second that

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.590 
batters in the 30 frames per second that
would<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.250> probably<00:01:02.760> about<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.120> first<00:01:03.359> two

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
would be probably about the first two

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.509 
would be probably about the first two
and<00:01:03.750> that's<00:01:04.290> how<00:01:04.500> long<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.830> takes<00:01:05.040> normally

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and that's how long it takes normally

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.910 
and that's how long it takes normally
for<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> back<00:01:06.000> elbow<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.140> lower<00:01:07.439> down<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
for the back elbow to lower down to the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.250 
for the back elbow to lower down to the
side<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.729> see<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.090> most<00:01:09.390> all<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.840> hitters<00:01:10.020> so

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
side we see that most all the hitters so

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.899 
side we see that most all the hitters so
let's<00:01:10.470> take<00:01:10.650> him<00:01:10.799> forward<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.430> there's<00:01:11.640> one

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
let's take him forward here there's one

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.240 
let's take him forward here there's one
two<00:01:13.040> three<00:01:14.040> four<00:01:14.909> all<00:01:15.299> right<00:01:15.570> now<00:01:15.810> he's<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
two three four all right now he's a

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.219 
two three four all right now he's a
elbow<00:01:17.250> basically<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.119> lowered<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> friend

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
elbow basically as lowered in the friend

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.020 
elbow basically as lowered in the friend
and<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> initiation<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.490> swing<00:01:20.700> has<00:01:20.880> been

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
and the initiation of swing has been

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.780 
and the initiation of swing has been
accomplished<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.070> let's<00:01:23.070> take<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> look<00:01:23.580> here

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
accomplished and let's take a look here

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.550 
accomplished and let's take a look here
now<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.270> draw<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.509> line<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:25.049> through<00:01:25.320> here

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
now if we draw a line up through here

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.390 
now if we draw a line up through here
that's<00:01:25.920> about<00:01:26.220> how<00:01:26.490> far<00:01:26.520> his<00:01:27.090> bat<00:01:27.390> deflected

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
that's about how far his bat deflected

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.560 
that's about how far his bat deflected
rearward<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.759> other<00:01:29.939> words<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.329> rearward

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
rearward in other words the rearward

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.440 
rearward in other words the rearward
acceleration<00:01:31.409> during<00:01:32.220> initiation<00:01:32.610> now<00:01:33.240> let's

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
acceleration during initiation now let's

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.179 
acceleration during initiation now let's
take<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> look<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.049> even<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.740> angle

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
take a look we can even get that angle

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.390 
take a look we can even get that angle
there<00:01:35.369> now<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.659> first<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.079> here<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.189> I'm

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
there now and this first one here so I'm

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.920 
there now and this first one here so I'm
gonna<00:01:38.579> put<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:38.970> line<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.869> all<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:40.890> down

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
gonna put in line here all right down

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.840 
gonna put in line here all right down
like<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.320> then<00:01:43.619> we'll<00:01:43.860> see<00:01:44.310> about<00:01:44.460> what

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
like that then we'll see about what

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.450 
like that then we'll see about what
angle<00:01:45.270> he's<00:01:45.420> got<00:01:45.720> there<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.290> noticed<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:47.220> here

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
angle he's got there I noticed here here

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.740 
angle he's got there I noticed here here
it<00:01:47.579> shows<00:01:47.790> about<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.119> hundred<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.600> nine

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
it shows about a hundred and nine

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.719 
it shows about a hundred and nine
degrees<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.649> that's<00:01:49.860> about<00:01:50.220> normal

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
degrees and that that's about normal

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.700 
degrees and that that's about normal
what<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:51.030> find<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.509> most<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.500> very

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
what we find in most of all of the very

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.109 
what we find in most of all of the very
best<00:01:52.950> hitters<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.729> be<00:01:53.820> somewhere

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
best hitters it's going to be somewhere

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.280 
best hitters it's going to be somewhere
between<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.479> hundred<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.840> hundred<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
between a hundred and hundred and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.800 
between a hundred and hundred and
fifteen<00:01:55.649> degrees<00:01:58.610> now<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.820> Chase<00:02:00.240> Utley<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
fifteen degrees now this Chase Utley and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.350 
fifteen degrees now this Chase Utley and
I've<00:02:00.960> already<00:02:01.290> drawn<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.579> starting

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
I've already drawn in the the starting

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.350 
I've already drawn in the the starting
point<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.920> where<00:02:04.920> they<00:02:05.189> elbow<00:02:05.520> were<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.180> bat

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
point and where they elbow were the bat

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.180 
point and where they elbow were the bat
was<00:02:06.540> when<00:02:06.750> he<00:02:06.840> Overlord<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.649> side<00:02:07.950> here

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
was when he Overlord to the side here

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.960 
was when he Overlord to the side here
are<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> first<00:02:08.520> four<00:02:08.729> frames<00:02:09.090> again<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
are the first four frames again and

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.590 
are the first four frames again and
let's<00:02:10.090> take<00:02:10.270> a<00:02:10.300> look<00:02:12.180> one<00:02:13.180> two<00:02:14.880> three<00:02:15.880> four

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
let's take a look one two three four

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.210 
let's take a look one two three four
from<00:02:16.960> these<00:02:17.140> down<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.650> that's<00:02:17.770> about<00:02:18.040> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
from these down and that's about the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.250 
from these down and that's about the
angle<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:19.030> other<00:02:19.210> words<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.570> chase<00:02:19.840> gets<00:02:20.140> you

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
angle in other words the chase gets you

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.250 
angle in other words the chase gets you
will<00:02:20.410> look<00:02:20.560> at<00:02:20.680> another<00:02:20.950> one<00:02:21.190> now<00:02:25.110> all<00:02:26.110> right

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
will look at another one now all right

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.200 
will look at another one now all right
now<00:02:26.320> this<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.980> rod<00:02:27.220> let's<00:02:27.490> take<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.700> look

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
now this is a rod let's take a look

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:39.330 
now this is a rod let's take a look
there's<00:02:28.390> one<00:02:29.400> two<00:02:30.400> three<00:02:32.100> four

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.160 

all<00:02:40.340> right<00:02:40.520> this<00:02:40.940> is<00:02:41.150> David<00:02:41.480> right<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.020> I

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
all right this is David right and I

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.110 
all right this is David right and I
think<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.590> can<00:02:42.800> see<00:02:42.980> regardless<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.730> who<00:02:43.880> we

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
think you can see regardless of who we

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.570 
think you can see regardless of who we
get<00:02:44.330> we'll<00:02:44.600> always<00:02:44.870> find<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:45.560> these<00:02:46.069> very

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
get we'll always find that these very

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.790 
get we'll always find that these very
top<00:02:46.880> hitters<00:02:47.270> will<00:02:47.569> their<00:02:48.020> deflections<00:02:48.650> it's

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
top hitters will their deflections it's

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.410 
top hitters will their deflections it's
gonna<00:02:48.920> be<00:02:49.069> like<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.400> said<00:02:49.640> beginning<00:02:50.060> somewhere

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
gonna be like I said beginning somewhere

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.870 
gonna be like I said beginning somewhere
around<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.950> hundred<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.310> hundred<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.700> ten

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
around a hundred to a hundred and ten

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.490 
around a hundred to a hundred and ten
degrees<00:02:53.000> now<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.660> can<00:02:53.810> measure<00:02:53.990> out<00:02:54.290> those

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
degrees now you can measure out those

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.470 
degrees now you can measure out those
angles<00:02:54.980> it's<00:02:55.160> hard<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.490> tell<00:02:55.640> exactly<00:02:55.700> when

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
angles it's hard to tell exactly when

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.410 
angles it's hard to tell exactly when
the<00:02:56.600> elbow<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:56.990> down<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.470> can<00:02:57.650> vary<00:02:58.010> some<00:02:58.420> but

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
the elbow is down it can vary some but

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.270 
the elbow is down it can vary some but
but<00:02:59.660> I<00:02:59.690> think<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.050> get<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.470> idea<00:03:00.530> but<00:03:00.920> anyway

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
but I think you get the idea but anyway

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.430 
but I think you get the idea but anyway
there's<00:03:01.490> one<00:03:01.790> two<00:03:02.750> three<00:03:02.980> four<00:03:04.900> all<00:03:05.900> right<00:03:05.959> now

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
there's one two three four all right now

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.010 
there's one two three four all right now
then<00:03:06.800> once<00:03:07.760> again<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.239> get<00:03:08.360> about<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.810> same

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
then once again you get about the same

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.080 
then once again you get about the same
so<00:03:09.200> now<00:03:09.230> let's<00:03:09.560> stop<00:03:09.770> and<00:03:09.920> take<00:03:10.069> a<00:03:10.130> look<00:03:10.250> at

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
so now let's stop and take a look at

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.810 
so now let's stop and take a look at
some<00:03:11.420> hitters<00:03:11.780> that<00:03:12.489> basically<00:03:13.489> I'm<00:03:13.610> going<00:03:13.730> to

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
some hitters that basically I'm going to

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.280 
some hitters that basically I'm going to
show<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.000> some<00:03:14.209> boys<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:14.630> are<00:03:14.930> in<00:03:15.050> college

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
show you some boys that are in college

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.770 
show you some boys that are in college
Oriole<00:03:16.010> are<00:03:16.190> their<00:03:16.459> end<00:03:16.640> in<00:03:17.030> tournaments

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
Oriole are their end in tournaments

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.410 
Oriole are their end in tournaments
trying<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.830> get<00:03:19.010> in<00:03:19.370> top<00:03:19.610> prospect<00:03:20.180> type

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
trying to get in top prospect type

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.020 
trying to get in top prospect type
tournaments<00:03:21.190> trying<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.310> get<00:03:22.459> into<00:03:22.700> college

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
tournaments trying to get into college

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.479 
tournaments trying to get into college
and<00:03:23.060> take<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.390> look<00:03:23.630> at<00:03:23.720> their<00:03:23.870> mechanics<00:03:27.489> well

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
and take a look at their mechanics well

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.070 
and take a look at their mechanics well
now<00:03:28.640> this<00:03:28.790> is<00:03:28.850> hitter<00:03:29.180> one<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.780> he<00:03:29.840> pretty

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
now this is hitter one and he pretty

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.810 
now this is hitter one and he pretty
well<00:03:30.170> represents<00:03:31.040> what<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:31.190> well<00:03:31.580> what<00:03:31.760> I

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
well represents what I well what I

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.690 
well represents what I well what I
normally<00:03:31.970> see<00:03:32.660> in<00:03:32.930> most<00:03:33.739> young<00:03:34.040> hitters<00:03:34.430> and

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
normally see in most young hitters and

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.790 
normally see in most young hitters and
what<00:03:35.360> we're<00:03:35.540> seeing<00:03:35.810> here<00:03:36.140> is<00:03:36.200> let's<00:03:36.590> watch

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
what we're seeing here is let's watch

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.610 
what we're seeing here is let's watch
now<00:03:36.830> as<00:03:37.220> we<00:03:37.340> go<00:03:37.640> through<00:03:38.050> these<00:03:39.050> batters<00:03:39.590> that

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
now as we go through these batters that

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.650 
now as we go through these batters that
normally<00:03:40.220> are<00:03:40.250> what<00:03:40.610> we<00:03:40.730> call<00:03:40.940> what<00:03:41.209> I<00:03:41.239> refer

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
normally are what we call what I refer

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.660 
normally are what we call what I refer
to<00:03:41.690> as<00:03:42.019> top<00:03:42.290> hand<00:03:42.620> dominant<00:03:43.190> they're<00:03:43.340> more<00:03:43.579> or

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
to as top hand dominant they're more or

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.370 
to as top hand dominant they're more or
less<00:03:43.850> luring<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.510> elbow<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:44.959> everything<00:03:45.290> to

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
less luring the elbow and everything to

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.380 
less luring the elbow and everything to
get<00:03:45.500> into<00:03:45.799> a<00:03:45.829> position<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.610> finish<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.060> swing

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
get into a position to finish the swing

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.750 
get into a position to finish the swing
once<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.110> elbow<00:03:48.410> is<00:03:48.530> down<00:03:48.799> so<00:03:49.160> let's<00:03:49.340> look<00:03:49.549> and

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
once the elbow is down so let's look and

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.880 
once the elbow is down so let's look and
then<00:03:49.940> see<00:03:50.180> here<00:03:50.840> we<00:03:50.930> go<00:03:51.079> there's<00:03:51.290> one<00:03:51.560> two

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
then see here we go there's one two

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.000 
then see here we go there's one two
three<00:03:51.940> four<00:03:52.940> he's<00:03:53.780> down<00:03:54.079> and<00:03:54.350> that's<00:03:54.799> the

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
three four he's down and that's the

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.300 
three four he's down and that's the
amount<00:03:55.190> of<00:03:56.049> that<00:03:57.049> deflection<00:03:57.530> he<00:03:57.769> had<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:58.220> guess

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
amount of that deflection he had I guess

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.740 
amount of that deflection he had I guess
that'd<00:03:58.670> be<00:03:58.850> somewhere<00:03:59.120> around<00:03:59.239> thirty<00:03:59.660> five

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
that'd be somewhere around thirty five

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.750 
that'd be somewhere around thirty five
or<00:03:59.959> forty<00:04:00.260> degrees<00:04:00.890> somewhere<00:04:01.190> in<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.400> range

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
or forty degrees somewhere in that range

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.490 
or forty degrees somewhere in that range
compared<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.660> one<00:04:02.750> hundred<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:03.079> ten<00:04:03.320> or

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
compared to the one hundred and ten or

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.680 
compared to the one hundred and ten or
twenty<00:04:03.890> whatever<00:04:04.549> we<00:04:04.640> saw<00:04:04.850> in<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.120> other<00:04:05.269> so

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
twenty whatever we saw in the other so

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.690 
twenty whatever we saw in the other so
now<00:04:05.900> let's<00:04:06.110> take<00:04:06.260> a<00:04:06.290> look<00:04:06.530> at<00:04:06.620> another<00:04:06.890> one<00:04:09.700> all

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
now let's take a look at another one all

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.220 
now let's take a look at another one all
right<00:04:10.850> now<00:04:11.030> we're<00:04:11.239> looking<00:04:11.329> to<00:04:11.540> hit<00:04:11.720> or<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.019> and

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
right now we're looking to hit or to and

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.640 
right now we're looking to hit or to and
the<00:04:12.320> cycle<00:04:12.769> him<00:04:12.950> forward<00:04:13.690> there's<00:04:14.690> one<00:04:14.989> two

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
the cycle him forward there's one two

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.120 
the cycle him forward there's one two
three<00:04:15.680> four<00:04:16.630> nail<00:04:17.630> was<00:04:17.989> pretty<00:04:18.229> well<00:04:18.440> down<00:04:18.680> and

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
three four nail was pretty well down and

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.550 
three four nail was pretty well down and
you<00:04:19.669> can<00:04:19.880> see<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.269> bad<00:04:20.450> deflection<00:04:21.019> that<00:04:21.200> this

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
you can see the bad deflection that this

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.520 
you can see the bad deflection that this
matter<00:04:21.799> has

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.589 

here's<00:04:27.009> batter<00:04:27.310> three<00:04:27.759> let's<00:04:28.030> cycle<00:04:28.419> him

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
here's batter three let's cycle him

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.740 
here's batter three let's cycle him
forward<00:04:29.080> there's<00:04:29.229> one<00:04:29.500> two<00:04:30.099> three<00:04:30.750> well

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
forward there's one two three well

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.350 
forward there's one two three well
actually<00:04:31.960> he's<00:04:32.229> down<00:04:32.470> now<00:04:32.800> all<00:04:33.490> right<00:04:33.729> but

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
actually he's down now all right but

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.689 
actually he's down now all right but
anyway<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:35.500> backing<00:04:35.949> back<00:04:36.159> up<00:04:36.430> here<00:04:36.669> again

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
anyway this backing back up here again

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.980 
anyway this backing back up here again
one<00:04:37.629> two<00:04:38.289> three<00:04:39.009> four<00:04:39.520> all<00:04:40.270> right<00:04:40.389> now<00:04:40.750> then

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
one two three four all right now then

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.379 
one two three four all right now then
notice<00:04:41.379> from<00:04:41.530> this<00:04:41.740> point<00:04:42.009> on<00:04:42.280> he<00:04:42.879> has<00:04:43.120> pretty

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
notice from this point on he has pretty

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.809 
notice from this point on he has pretty
decent<00:04:43.479> mechanics<00:04:44.409> on<00:04:44.560> around<00:04:44.889> all<00:04:45.340> right<00:04:45.550> to

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
decent mechanics on around all right to

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.330 
decent mechanics on around all right to
making<00:04:46.150> contact<00:04:46.689> but<00:04:47.289> the<00:04:47.319> problem<00:04:47.860> is<00:04:48.069> when

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
making contact but the problem is when

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.129 
making contact but the problem is when
you<00:04:48.460> get<00:04:48.610> up<00:04:48.819> here<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:49.090> you<00:04:49.270> start<00:04:49.629> here<00:04:50.020> and

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
you get up here and you start here and

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.709 
you get up here and you start here and
the<00:04:50.409> first<00:04:50.680> two<00:04:51.669> or<00:04:51.699> three<00:04:51.849> frames<00:04:52.419> you're

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:52.719 
the first two or three frames you're

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:54.510 
the first two or three frames you're
just<00:04:52.900> letting<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.259> bat<00:04:53.439> drag<00:04:53.860> like<00:04:54.189> this

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
just letting a bat drag like this

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.760 
just letting a bat drag like this
there's<00:04:55.090> no<00:04:55.330> way<00:04:55.599> can<00:04:55.900> you<00:04:55.990> catch<00:04:56.259> up<00:04:56.560> in<00:04:56.740> the

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
there's no way can you catch up in the

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.219 
there's no way can you catch up in the
end<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.099> last<00:04:57.310> bit<00:04:57.669> with<00:04:58.180> BHT<00:04:58.539> as<00:04:58.930> we

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
end the last bit with BHT as we

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.969 
end the last bit with BHT as we
discussed<00:04:59.650> on<00:04:59.830> the<00:04:59.949> site<00:05:00.190> there

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.409 

well<00:05:05.979> here's<00:05:06.219> hitter<00:05:06.460> number<00:05:06.819> four<00:05:07.090> list

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
well here's hitter number four list

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.110 
well here's hitter number four list
cycle<00:05:07.810> him<00:05:07.960> forward<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:08.680> I<00:05:09.009> think<00:05:09.310> one<00:05:09.580> two

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
cycle him forward and I think one two

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.129 
cycle him forward and I think one two
three<00:05:10.900> four<00:05:11.319> ease<00:05:11.530> down<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:12.780> that<00:05:13.780> this<00:05:13.930> is

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
three four ease down and that this is

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.050 
three four ease down and that this is
normally<00:05:14.560> about<00:05:14.770> like<00:05:15.039> I<00:05:15.069> say<00:05:15.370> what<00:05:15.550> I<00:05:15.580> see<00:05:15.909> in

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
normally about like I say what I see in

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.209 
normally about like I say what I see in
so<00:05:16.360> many<00:05:16.690> young<00:05:16.930> hitters<00:05:17.349> I'm<00:05:17.590> using<00:05:17.889> these

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 
so many young hitters I'm using these

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.909 
so many young hitters I'm using these
just<00:05:19.000> as<00:05:19.180> an<00:05:19.330> example<00:05:19.900> of<00:05:19.990> what<00:05:20.169> I<00:05:20.199> find<00:05:20.590> but<00:05:20.889> I

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
just as an example of what I find but I

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.550 
just as an example of what I find but I
find<00:05:21.340> very<00:05:21.460> very<00:05:21.849> few<00:05:22.569> that<00:05:22.930> get<00:05:23.169> anywhere

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
find very very few that get anywhere

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.670 
find very very few that get anywhere
near<00:05:23.620> close<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.669> the<00:05:24.969> the<00:05:25.779> acceleration<00:05:26.650> the

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
near close to the the acceleration the

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.170 
near close to the the acceleration the
rearward<00:05:26.979> acceleration<00:05:27.669> that<00:05:27.729> we<00:05:27.789> saw<00:05:28.029> in

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
rearward acceleration that we saw in

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.879 
rearward acceleration that we saw in
those<00:05:28.300> great<00:05:28.599> hitters<00:05:28.900> now<00:05:29.080> next<00:05:29.529> what<00:05:29.740> we'll

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
those great hitters now next what we'll

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.100 
those great hitters now next what we'll
do<00:05:30.069> is<00:05:30.279> I'm<00:05:30.879> gonna<00:05:31.029> go<00:05:31.210> back<00:05:31.419> in<00:05:31.629> and<00:05:31.750> on

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
do is I'm gonna go back in and on

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.709 
do is I'm gonna go back in and on
another<00:05:32.289> video<00:05:32.529> here<00:05:32.979> and<00:05:33.279> we'll<00:05:33.719> start

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:34.719 
another video here and we'll start

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:36.570 
another video here and we'll start
showing<00:05:35.020> petroi<00:05:35.409> in<00:05:35.650> some<00:05:35.860> of<00:05:35.979> these<00:05:36.099> and<00:05:36.430> try

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
showing petroi in some of these and try

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.249 
showing petroi in some of these and try
to<00:05:36.699> explain<00:05:37.180> the<00:05:37.419> mechanic<00:05:37.900> that<00:05:37.930> they're

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
to explain the mechanic that they're

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.980 
to explain the mechanic that they're
used<00:05:38.560> in<00:05:38.710> there<00:05:38.889> that<00:05:39.069> we<00:05:39.159> refer<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.460> as<00:05:39.669> tht<00:05:40.389> to

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
used in there that we refer to as tht to

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.260 
used in there that we refer to as tht to
really<00:05:41.560> produce<00:05:41.770> that<00:05:42.129> acceleration<00:05:43.089> that

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
really produce that acceleration that

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.620 
really produce that acceleration that
really<00:05:43.599> acceleration<00:05:44.199> we<00:05:44.409> saw
