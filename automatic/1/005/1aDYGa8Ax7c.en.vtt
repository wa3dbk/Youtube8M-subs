game<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.290> poker<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:05.790> developed<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
game of poker and so we developed a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.870 
game of poker and so we developed a
product<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.840> totally<00:01:07.409> Universal<00:01:07.880> that

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
product that is totally Universal that

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.420 
product that is totally Universal that
allows<00:01:09.150> any<00:01:09.450> player<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:10.080> any<00:01:10.409> site<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:11.100> any

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
allows any player on any site in any

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700 
allows any player on any site in any
particular<00:01:11.610> game<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.439> main

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
particular game to have all of the main

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.890 
particular game to have all of the main
basic<00:01:14.310> functions<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.360> allow<00:01:15.540> them<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.720> do

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
basic functions and allow them to do

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.140 
basic functions and allow them to do
them<00:01:16.020> fast

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
them fast

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.130 
them fast
so<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> wireless<00:01:18.509> spoke<00:01:18.659> control<00:01:18.960> has<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
so the wireless spoke control has a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.580 
so the wireless spoke control has a
number<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:20.400> cool<00:01:20.610> features<00:01:21.590> firstly

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
number of really cool features firstly

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.010 
number of really cool features firstly
it<00:01:22.710> has<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.970> bet<00:01:23.970> meter<00:01:24.180> which<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.750> call<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
it has a bet meter which we call the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.340 
it has a bet meter which we call the
razor<00:01:25.259> meter<00:01:25.590> which<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.580> essentially<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
razor meter which is essentially a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.109 
razor meter which is essentially a
circular<00:01:28.350> dial<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.280> allows<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.790> turn<00:01:29.970> it

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
circular dial that allows you to turn it

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.960 
circular dial that allows you to turn it
left<00:01:30.420> or<00:01:30.689> turn<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.200> right<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:32.040> decrease<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
left or turn it right to decrease or to

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.510 
left or turn it right to decrease or to
increase<00:01:33.329> your<00:01:33.450> bet<00:01:33.689> now<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:35.220> difference

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
increase your bet now the difference

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.010 
increase your bet now the difference
between<00:01:35.610> having<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.060> over<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> mouse<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
between having this over a mouse is the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.390 
between having this over a mouse is the
mouse<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.380> kind<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.829> click<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.369> drag

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
mouse you kind of have to click and drag

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.670 
mouse you kind of have to click and drag
on<00:01:38.790> screen<00:01:39.150> which<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.570> kind<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.140> hard<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.439> get
