00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.420
 good greetings to you the freedman and a 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.160
 I greet all your panel that is very good 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.379
 thank you very much manolo what a pleasure 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.590
 listen to how you would rate the start 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:15.820
 of the people in this tournament 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:19.060
 and regular or we are missing a lot but 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.270
 missing union of lines more concepts 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.480
 firm however I am very happy 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.580
 by the way the boys have 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.880
 received the people because they do not 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.920
 you received the you can live and this and 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.900
 really those who came from outside have 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.110
 there were very important elements 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.019
 that had already been important 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.780
 others who want to do it in Puebla and 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.340
 obviously those who are here have had 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.829
 of a lot because they do not have so many 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.770
 failures then it's really been done 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.649
 a very good work team I'm 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.920
 really very happy with them they are 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.809
 this 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.809
 taxes to all 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.250
 in short everything really has been very 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.509
 satisfactory in that effect I would 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.880
 I mean that just from the beginning 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.280
 we can sing victory we can not 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.039
 even say that it was a see no 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.280
 Indicate if there are 23 more games left to 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:23.590
 say the regular bad start software 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.509
 aguirre prior right now not to mention his 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.770
 manolo universe with so many years of 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.560
 experience with so many experiences 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.679
 accumulated how are you living this 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.729
 return to direct in the first division 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:40.210
 look as if he had caught on 82-83 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.310
 it's the same, I feel very good 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.709
 I feel very strongly with much desire 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.380
 with much enthusiasm with the same 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.310
 enthusiasm with desire to do well 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.350
 things 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.890
 applying things that are observed in the mi 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.110
 absence time and this and even in 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.800
 this moment you can say that 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.650
 and we are going to send a greeting ciro procuna 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.720
 watching the last game against saints 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.210
 lagoon called my attention as 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.680
 shaped the waist of the town I 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.020
 I mean the second castle Luis Miguel 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.630
 noriega by the center with good and 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.400
 walls trying on the right sides 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.950
 and left respectively 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.060
 what am I going to four players whose first 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.520
 quality that we in a point of view is 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.840
 defensive and that is what it claims 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.280
 manuel lapuente y llera is still 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.790
 local 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.560
 what idea do you have with a combination 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.060
 similar or if you wait a little longer than 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.420
 good and of walls in the offensive part 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.360
 with a new scheme we do not have a 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.280
 we still do not have an ideal picture that 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.580
 say one this is my team and with this I 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.860
 I am also on the way I like this to me 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.800
 I like to move players change 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.880
 players depends a lot on our rivals 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.709
 that really are of a very good level 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.370
 then yes you have to basically beat him 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.070
 when you are in lesser possibility 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.709
 to do it on paper what you have to 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.560
 to do is to kiss us and not beat them and 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.050
 see where their deficiencies are and 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.120
 where can you attack us 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.569
 basically we reload the strips by the 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.330
 center is that idea not necessarily not 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.239
 defensive but we charge the attack for the 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.069
 center that was different because we think 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.799
 which will be the ideal against the saints 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.170
 and fortunately it turned out we had several 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.450
 goal plays and in no way 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.790
 can you say that this I do not consider 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.700
 no defensive defense except that 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.709
 I put myself back there are times that it is necessary 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.530
 do it until now we have not had 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.930
 need to get into a truck 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.180
 back definitely we have not done 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.180
 we will do it if required 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.810
 it will not be necessary on Saturday but it will be necessary 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:07.610
 Saturday 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.550
 now bad since that depends as the 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.430
 market 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:17.110
 we will see in what time if 5 are missing 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.110
 minutes of the match 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.800
 good afternoon thinking right now in 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.600
 that morning game against blue cross 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.850
 where by the way people have a streak 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.210
 of four consecutive games of no 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.010
 be able to beat the machine where they would be 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.479
 those weaknesses that he does 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.520
 reference on the equipment that you already 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.250
 you have been facing to neutralize 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.970
 to blue cross and think about being able to win the 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.970
 tomorrow's match 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.310
 if I really knew from this moment 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.240
 where obviously would not be lost either 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.240
 but 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:59.819
 we are looking for you to whom life 

00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:02.209
 impossible at least tomorrow and we're 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.799
 trying to win this game too 

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:05.879
 correct manolo thank you very much 

00:05:04.799 --> 00:05:08.149
 as long as you have taken this 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.149
 call 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:16.250
 and if you can not hang up please manolo 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.250
 well he's going to stay there in lalin
