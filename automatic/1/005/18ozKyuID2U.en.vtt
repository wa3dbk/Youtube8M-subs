00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
here's something like something like

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.410 
here's something like something like
that<00:03:12.909> spackle

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.860 

yeah<00:03:17.930> i'm<00:03:18.050> basically<00:03:18.349> experimenting<00:03:19.069> with<00:03:19.130> it

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
yeah i'm basically experimenting with it

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.550 
yeah i'm basically experimenting with it
such<00:03:21.319> bounce<00:03:21.799> around<00:03:22.069> fly<00:03:22.459> there

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.220 

Gabe<00:03:26.340> probably<00:03:27.500> exactly<00:03:28.940> program<00:03:30.080> see<00:03:31.080> that

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
Gabe probably exactly program see that

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.680 
Gabe probably exactly program see that
was<00:03:31.349> an<00:03:31.470> example<00:03:31.590> of<00:03:32.239> hitting<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.360> from<00:03:33.599> the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
was an example of hitting it from the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.830 
was an example of hitting it from the
top

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:47.140 

so

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.320 

I<00:03:47.269> don't<00:03:47.569> play<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.840> die

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.840 

big<00:03:51.630> blue

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.640 

basically<00:03:55.480> this<00:03:55.600> box<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.990> will<00:03:56.050> just<00:03:56.260> get<00:03:56.500> you

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
basically this box it will just get you

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.310 
basically this box it will just get you
the<00:03:56.770> secret<00:03:57.430> pipes<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:57.940> stuff<00:03:58.120> me<00:03:58.570> no<00:03:58.990> need<00:03:59.200> to

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
the secret pipes and stuff me no need to

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.710 
the secret pipes and stuff me no need to
walk<00:03:59.470> through<00:03:59.680> Mario

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.589 

soon<00:04:03.560> where<00:04:03.800> do<00:04:03.890> I<00:04:03.920> go<00:04:04.210> do<00:04:05.210> I<00:04:05.240> go<00:04:05.480> do<00:04:05.900> I<00:04:05.930> go<00:04:06.110> right

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
soon where do I go do I go do I go right

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.030 
soon where do I go do I go do I go right
there's<00:04:08.599> another<00:04:08.750> glitch

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.339 

yeah<00:04:13.610> I<00:04:13.640> actually<00:04:13.819> watch<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.390> video<00:04:14.599> on<00:04:14.870> it

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
yeah I actually watch the video on it

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.499 
yeah I actually watch the video on it
and<00:04:15.560> I<00:04:15.799> test<00:04:16.039> it<00:04:16.130> out<00:04:16.280> for<00:04:16.609> there's<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.359> lot<00:04:17.479> of

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:17.509 
and I test it out for there's a lot of

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:23.100 
and I test it out for there's a lot of
crazy<00:04:17.750> stuff

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.480 

Africa<00:04:24.110> that<00:04:24.230> plant<00:04:24.560> cake

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
Africa that plant cake

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.250 
Africa that plant cake
second

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.930 

screw<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.220> plant<00:04:32.630> k<00:04:33.630> up<00:04:33.780> that

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
screw the plant k up that

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.550 
screw the plant k up that
you<00:04:35.390> saw<00:04:35.660> it

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
you saw it

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:54.150 
you saw it
Oh

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.800 

I'm<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.760> meeting<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.090> a<00:04:55.120> lot<00:04:55.330> of<00:04:55.420> things<00:04:55.630> in<00:04:55.720> this

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.830 
I'm a meeting to a lot of things in this

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.860 

like<00:04:59.169> you<00:04:59.260> can't<00:04:59.470> get<00:04:59.560> hit<00:04:59.710> from<00:04:59.800> above<00:05:00.870> jump

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
like you can't get hit from above jump

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.930 
like you can't get hit from above jump
on<00:05:01.960> enemies<00:05:02.160> if<00:05:03.160> one<00:05:03.400> of<00:05:03.520> those<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.639> black

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
on enemies if one of those a black

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.430 
on enemies if one of those a black
turtle<00:05:04.330> shows<00:05:04.510> those<00:05:04.690> things<00:05:04.930> only<00:05:05.290> those

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
turtle shows those things only those

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.770 
turtle shows those things only those
things<00:05:05.740> if<00:05:06.160> it<00:05:06.280> it's<00:05:06.400> my<00:05:06.520> foot<00:05:06.850> it<00:05:07.570> just

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
things if it it's my foot it just

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.689 
things if it it's my foot it just
balances<00:05:07.960> like<00:05:08.320> automatically<00:05:08.889> so<00:05:09.639> I

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
balances like automatically so I

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.040 
balances like automatically so I
understand<00:05:10.090> there<00:05:10.240> it'll<00:05:10.389> bounce<00:05:10.540> off<00:05:10.870> like

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
understand there it'll bounce off like

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.390 
understand there it'll bounce off like
I'm<00:05:11.169> a<00:05:11.260> pipe<00:05:11.440> or<00:05:11.650> something

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.749 

it's<00:05:14.910> so<00:05:15.150> easy<00:05:15.360> see<00:05:16.110> like<00:05:16.259> I<00:05:16.410> just<00:05:16.699> avoided<00:05:17.699> the

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
it's so easy see like I just avoided the

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.210 
it's so easy see like I just avoided the
plant

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
plant

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:28.820 
plant
here's<00:05:20.220> for<00:05:20.430> glitches

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.400 

oh<00:05:28.890> yeah<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:29.460> have<00:05:29.670> my<00:05:29.820> own<00:05:30.080> 360<00:05:31.080> controller

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
oh yeah I have my own 360 controller

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.820 
oh yeah I have my own 360 controller
hooked<00:05:31.590> up<00:05:31.740> for<00:05:31.950> program

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.220 

one<00:05:35.400> of<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.550> dick<00:05:35.970> Metroid<00:05:36.720> I<00:05:36.810> could<00:05:37.110> do<00:05:37.170> a

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
one of the dick Metroid I could do a

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.239 
one of the dick Metroid I could do a
metroid

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:41.249 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:50.710 

no<00:05:41.459> no<00:05:41.639> I<00:05:41.669> was<00:05:41.819> never<00:05:41.939> that<00:05:42.029> good

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.990 

a<00:05:50.870> little

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
a little

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.480 
a little
and<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.390> time<00:05:53.740> that<00:05:54.740> normal<00:05:55.040> timer<00:05:55.220> is<00:05:55.400> that

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
and the time that normal timer is that

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.640 
and the time that normal timer is that
with<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:55.640> program<00:05:55.820> to<00:05:56.180> install<00:05:56.630> fence<00:05:57.080> maybe

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
with the program to install fence maybe

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.800 
with the program to install fence maybe
was

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:01.820 

by<00:06:01.139> the<00:06:01.200> way<00:06:01.320> I'm<00:06:01.380> just<00:06:01.440> wasting<00:06:01.650> time

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
by the way I'm just wasting time

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:11.519 
by the way I'm just wasting time
bringing<00:06:02.730> every<00:06:02.880> brick

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:13.220 

nice<00:06:12.069> Bobby

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
nice Bobby

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:24.230 
nice Bobby
but<00:06:13.620> not<00:06:13.740> wanted

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.939 

by<00:06:24.750> the<00:06:24.810> way<00:06:24.930> if<00:06:24.990> you<00:06:25.080> didn't<00:06:25.229> know<00:06:25.349> even<00:06:25.800> on

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
by the way if you didn't know even on

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:28.159 
by the way if you didn't know even on
the<00:06:26.069> original<00:06:26.460> NES<00:06:26.759> their<00:06:27.599> specialized

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
the original NES their specialized

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.670 
the original NES their specialized
bricks<00:06:28.620> a<00:06:28.830> jump<00:06:29.400> through<00:06:29.580> to<00:06:30.150> another

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.930 

that's<00:06:33.250> why<00:06:33.370> you<00:06:33.460> could<00:06:33.580> do<00:06:33.639> the<00:06:33.789> negative

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
that's why you could do the negative

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.110 
that's why you could do the negative
world<00:06:34.330> pull

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
world pull

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.210 
world pull

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
by jumping through the wall there's some

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.370 
by jumping through the wall there's some
wall<00:06:37.400> in<00:06:37.550> the<00:06:37.639> game<00:06:37.790> redo<00:06:38.150> it<00:06:38.300> no<00:06:38.960> one<00:06:39.080> take<00:06:39.229> you

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
wall in the game redo it no one take you

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.140 
wall in the game redo it no one take you
anywhere<00:06:39.620> and<00:06:39.770> what<00:06:39.889> the<00:06:39.979> whole<00:06:40.130> said<00:06:40.400> that

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
anywhere and what the whole said that

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.870 
anywhere and what the whole said that
wasn't<00:06:41.570> happening

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:53.670
