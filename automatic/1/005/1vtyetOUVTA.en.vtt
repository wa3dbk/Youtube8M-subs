00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.950
 hello good today I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.149
 some bacon cheese frys if some of you are 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.070
 good you are usual of the 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.910
 Foster restaurants in general and 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.980
 I recommend you are very good 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.410
 the ingredients are very simple are 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.400
 grated cheese if it can be 4 that's 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.470
 better the brands are indifferent some 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.610
 french fries and fried have the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.710
 we have put a little salt and the 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.300
 we have taken out the oil with this paper 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.040
 absorbent 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.699
 and finally bacon and we have it fried and 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.990
 is prepared then the only thing that 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.210
 we have to do is mix it 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.110
 first, throw 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.110
 French fries 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.870
 It's different, I usually do it like that 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.810
 because it's like more I like but good 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.690
 you can try as you want 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.570
 then I would go 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.910
 discard the missing 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.230
 and then usually throw another bit of cheese 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.230
 more later at the end 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.070
 we think cheese 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.210
 and then the sauce the most important thing is the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.250
 sauce and they look exactly like the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.020
 from foster this sauce you can 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.810
 find good already bought carrefour 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.340
 It is not always and not all 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.870
 carrefour but usually you usually 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.360
 find it with some ease calculates 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:34.200
 and if not in Alcampo it is worth of this brand 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.710
 the specialty is range and then the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.710
 sauce 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.370
 we take good sauce that we have left 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.750
 if you need something from us a little 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.290
 the potatoes so you can get through 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.290
 in between 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.100
 and that's it, then I usually use a little bit of 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.100
 cheese on top 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.810
 and finally 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.810
 but beacons 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.729
 and the only thing that would be missing would be 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.670
 put it in the preheated oven about 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.379
 180 degrees and put it for five minutes 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.530
 you are going to see nothing more 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.130
 that you have a bit of cheese and they would be 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.880
 lists 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.880
 here 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.800
 well, nothing we have already had five 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.280
 minutes in the oven and as you can see they are 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.740
 lists 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.210
 it's just heating the oven 200 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.470
 degrees and put it to five minutes already 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.690
 you will have seen in terms of weight 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.450
 is gratin and you can take them out and now 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.350
 the table is already do not forget the most 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.820
 complicated to get is this sauce already 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.070
 I told you what you can find in 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.420
 carrefour is almost always in the field 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.610
 for I have practically always wanted 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.900
 always found if it is not in the 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.440
 hall of the sauces because it is usually 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:58.540
 in the foreigners hall so 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.540
 nothing I hope you like guys
