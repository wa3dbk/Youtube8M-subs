going to be able to record any of his
ninja<00:03:52.110> defuse<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:52.620> what<00:03:52.739> we're<00:03:52.890> going<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.070> do

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
ninja defuse so what we're going to do

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.280 
ninja defuse so what we're going to do
is<00:03:53.430> we're<00:03:54.150> going<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.330> show<00:03:54.510> off<00:03:54.690> more<00:03:54.959> than<00:03:55.080> one

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
is we're going to show off more than one

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.930 
is we're going to show off more than one
spot<00:03:55.620> at<00:03:55.890> each<00:03:56.510> at<00:03:57.510> each<00:03:57.780> bomb<00:03:58.610> but<00:03:59.610> we're<00:03:59.820> only

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
spot at each at each bomb but we're only

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.920 
spot at each at each bomb but we're only
going<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.209> have<00:04:00.360> one<00:04:02.180> one<00:04:03.180> spot<00:04:03.480> actually

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
going to have one one spot actually

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.990 
going to have one one spot actually
getting<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.320> ninja<00:04:04.620> defuse<00:04:04.739> live<00:04:05.070> so<00:04:05.880> it's

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
getting the ninja defuse live so it's

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.070 
getting the ninja defuse live so it's
going<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.150> be<00:04:06.270> a<00:04:06.300> little<00:04:06.450> bit<00:04:06.570> different<00:04:06.930> but

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
going to be a little bit different but

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.510 
going to be a little bit different but
hopefully<00:04:07.530> it'll<00:04:07.709> be<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.860> little<00:04:08.070> bit<00:04:08.160> more<00:04:08.430> in

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
hopefully it'll be a little bit more in

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.720 
hopefully it'll be a little bit more in
depth<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.020> guys<00:04:10.170> can<00:04:10.380> really

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
depth and so you guys can really

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.130 
depth and so you guys can really
understand<00:04:11.730> the

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
understand the

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.590 
understand the
