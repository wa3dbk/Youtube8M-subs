00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
individual shooter so that they can

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.450 
individual shooter so that they can

almost all the Magnum spring piston guns

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.109 
almost all the Magnum spring piston guns
are<00:01:06.960> they<00:01:07.500> need<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> larger<00:01:08.550> compression

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
are they need a larger compression

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.719 
are they need a larger compression
chamber<00:01:09.330> they<00:01:09.600> also<00:01:09.720> need<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> longer<00:01:10.440> barrel

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
chamber they also need a longer barrel

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.980 
chamber they also need a longer barrel
that<00:01:11.729> makes<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.149> cocking<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.660> little<00:01:12.869> bit

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that makes the cocking a little bit

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.870 
that makes the cocking a little bit
easier<00:01:13.440> these<00:01:13.679> guns<00:01:13.920> take<00:01:14.220> some<00:01:14.490> cocking

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
easier these guns take some cocking

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.029 
easier these guns take some cocking
effort<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.899> longer<00:01:16.200> barrel<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.649> also<00:01:16.920> on

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
effort and the longer barrel and also on

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.190 
effort and the longer barrel and also on
this<00:01:17.159> gun<00:01:17.399> the<00:01:17.520> moderator<00:01:18.030> serves<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
this gun the moderator serves as a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.139 
this gun the moderator serves as a
cocking<00:01:19.619> handle<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.459> makes<00:01:20.910> it<00:01:21.060> much

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
cocking handle really makes it much

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.199 
cocking handle really makes it much
easier<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:22.649> rifle<00:01:23.009> has<00:01:23.250> an<00:01:23.580> 11<00:01:24.000> millimeter

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:24.209 
easier the rifle has an 11 millimeter

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.630 
easier the rifle has an 11 millimeter
dovetail<00:01:25.050> it<00:01:25.289> also<00:01:25.470> has<00:01:25.679> a<00:01:25.739> weaver<00:01:26.009> style<00:01:26.429> so

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
dovetail it also has a weaver style so

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.999 
dovetail it also has a weaver style so
you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.880> use<00:01:27.060> either<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.630> conventional<00:01:28.619> 22

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
you can use either a conventional 22

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.520 
you can use either a conventional 22
rimfire<00:01:29.520> type<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.450> mount<00:01:30.660> or<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.289> use<00:01:31.500> a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
rimfire type of mount or you can use a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.260 
rimfire type of mount or you can use a
weaver<00:01:31.890> mount<00:01:32.190> I<00:01:32.399> like<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.090> of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
weaver mount I like that it's one of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.940 
weaver mount I like that it's one of
those<00:01:33.360> little<00:01:33.569> things<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> think<00:01:34.619> really

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
those little things that I think really

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.339 
those little things that I think really
shows<00:01:35.459> some<00:01:36.239> intelligence<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.929> the<00:01:37.020> design

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:37.349 
shows some intelligence in the design

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:40.699 
shows some intelligence in the design
