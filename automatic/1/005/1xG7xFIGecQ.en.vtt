on the top for the roof but that's about

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.240 
on the top for the roof but that's about
what<00:04:31.370> they<00:04:31.520> look<00:04:31.700> like<00:04:31.729> I<00:04:32.500> also<00:04:33.500> run<00:04:33.950> some

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
what they look like I also run some

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.790 
what they look like I also run some

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
sides to help so they won't twist during

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.330
