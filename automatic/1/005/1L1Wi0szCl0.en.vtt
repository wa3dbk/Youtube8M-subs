00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
that if I had a tenor it would sound

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.510 
that if I had a tenor it would sound
like<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.780> be<00:03:48.990> if<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.350> had<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> tenor<00:03:49.830> out<00:03:50.070> because

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
like the be if I had a tenor out because

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.100 
like the be if I had a tenor out because
it's<00:03:50.730> actually<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.120> different<00:03:51.540> fingering<00:03:51.930> but

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
it's actually a different fingering but

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.930 
it's actually a different fingering but
it's<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.350> same<00:03:52.620> actual<00:03:53.100> pitch<00:03:53.340> when<00:03:53.610> you<00:03:53.700> play

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
it's the same actual pitch when you play

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.480 
it's the same actual pitch when you play
it<00:03:54.120> when<00:03:54.300> you<00:03:54.810> hear<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:55.110> it's<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.500> same<00:03:55.740> so<00:03:56.370> it

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
it when you hear it it's the same so it

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.620 
it when you hear it it's the same so it
would<00:03:56.610> sound<00:03:56.820> like<00:03:57.030> this<00:03:59.300> even<00:04:00.300> though<00:04:00.420> you're

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
would sound like this even though you're

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.390 
would sound like this even though you're
figuring<00:04:01.050> it<00:04:01.200> this<00:04:01.560> way<00:04:01.770> okay<00:04:02.700> for<00:04:03.180> tenor
