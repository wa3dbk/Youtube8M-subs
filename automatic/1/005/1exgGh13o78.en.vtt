00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
hi this is Trevor Sharon from appadvice

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.679 
hi this is Trevor Sharon from appadvice
calm<00:00:02.490> we've<00:00:02.639> got<00:00:02.790> another<00:00:02.939> test<00:00:03.270> between<00:00:03.419> the

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
calm we've got another test between the

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.170 
calm we've got another test between the
ipad<00:00:03.899> 2<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.200> iPad<00:00:04.470> one<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:05.279> time<00:00:05.580> it's<00:00:05.970> going

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
ipad 2 and iPad one this time it's going

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.880 
ipad 2 and iPad one this time it's going
to<00:00:06.210> be<00:00:06.359> about<00:00:06.480> fast<00:00:06.899> app<00:00:07.140> switching<00:00:07.170> or

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
to be about fast app switching or

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.140 
to be about fast app switching or
multitasking<00:00:08.490> however<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:08.820> want<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:08.970> call<00:00:09.030> it

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
multitasking however you want to call it

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.140 
multitasking however you want to call it
so<00:00:09.599> will<00:00:09.719> clear<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.679> multitasking<00:00:11.550> tray<00:00:11.849> and

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
so will clear the multitasking tray and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.600 
so will clear the multitasking tray and
start<00:00:13.049> launching<00:00:13.440> up<00:00:13.590> some<00:00:13.799> apps<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.280> see<00:00:14.460> how

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
start launching up some apps and see how

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.359 
start launching up some apps and see how
these<00:00:14.759> two<00:00:15.059> iPads<00:00:15.480> handle<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.529> ipad<00:00:16.830> 2<00:00:17.130> is

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
these two iPads handle it the ipad 2 is

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.109 
these two iPads handle it the ipad 2 is
on<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.640> left<00:00:17.850> ipad<00:00:18.750> 1<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> right<00:00:20.160> now

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
on the left ipad 1 is on the right now

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.250 
on the left ipad 1 is on the right now
we<00:00:21.180> can<00:00:21.390> assume<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.900> dual<00:00:22.050> core

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
we can assume that the dual core

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.740 
we can assume that the dual core
processor<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:23.220> will<00:00:23.460> be<00:00:23.580> faster<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.390> ipad<00:00:24.600> 2

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
processor it will be faster the ipad 2

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.779 
processor it will be faster the ipad 2
will<00:00:24.869> be<00:00:24.960> faster<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:26.039> question<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.519> by

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
will be faster but the question is by

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.509 
will be faster but the question is by
how<00:00:26.939> much<00:00:27.470> now<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> test<00:00:29.010> both<00:00:29.250> devices

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
how much now for the test both devices

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.030 
how much now for the test both devices
are<00:00:29.730> running<00:00:30.000> iOS<00:00:30.330> 4.3<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.170> multitasking

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
are running iOS 4.3 and a multitasking

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.440 
are running iOS 4.3 and a multitasking
gestures<00:00:32.099> enabled<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.940> really<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
gestures enabled to really see the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.889 
gestures enabled to really see the
difference<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.960> how<00:00:34.500> quick<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.719> devices<00:00:36.719> can

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
difference and how quick the devices can

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.540 
difference and how quick the devices can
switch<00:00:37.110> between<00:00:37.230> em<00:00:37.559> not<00:00:37.980> only<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.370> this

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
switch between em not only is this

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.860 
switch between em not only is this
dependent<00:00:39.030> upon<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.300> dual<00:00:39.600> core<00:00:39.840> processor

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
dependent upon the dual core processor

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.959 
dependent upon the dual core processor
on<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.379> 512<00:00:41.010> megabytes<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.460> RAM<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:41.850> it's

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
on the 512 megabytes of RAM but it's

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.450 
on the 512 megabytes of RAM but it's
also<00:00:42.200> internet<00:00:43.200> capabilities<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.040> how<00:00:44.129> quick

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
also internet capabilities and how quick

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.369 
also internet capabilities and how quick
it<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.760> load<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.690> lot<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.079> Internet

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
it can load a lot of Internet

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.959 
it can load a lot of Internet
Information<00:00:46.950> because<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> lot<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.370> these<00:00:47.670> apps

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
Information because a lot of these apps

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.850 
Information because a lot of these apps
most<00:00:48.329> apps<00:00:48.750> are<00:00:49.020> dependent<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> internet

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
most apps are dependent on the internet

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
every single time you notice how much

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760 
every single time you notice how much
quicker<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.820> pad<00:01:00.030> two<00:01:00.300> loads<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.350> nap<00:01:01.530> as

to you or use map it's not really the
case<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.229> ipad<00:01:19.560> 1<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.369> don't<00:01:20.580> notice<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.299> as

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
case on ipad 1 you don't notice it as

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.899 
case on ipad 1 you don't notice it as
much<00:01:21.509> until<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.229> see<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> direct<00:01:22.909> comparison

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
much until you see the direct comparison

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.120 
much until you see the direct comparison
with<00:01:24.180> both<00:01:24.630> devices<00:01:24.930> side-by-side<00:01:25.650> now<00:01:26.070> we

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
with both devices side-by-side now we

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.819 
with both devices side-by-side now we
also<00:01:26.340> tested<00:01:26.909> home<00:01:27.090> share<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.509> these<00:01:27.829> devices

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
also tested home share and these devices

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.679 
also tested home share and these devices
are<00:01:29.100> both<00:01:29.280> sharing<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> home<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.479> same

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
are both sharing to the home the same

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.249 
are both sharing to the home the same
itunes<00:01:31.170> account<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.460> see<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.659> this

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
itunes account and we can see that this

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.560 
itunes account and we can see that this
is<00:01:34.409> another<00:01:34.650> internet-based<00:01:35.130> thing<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.909> ipad

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
is another internet-based thing and ipad

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.899 
is another internet-based thing and ipad
2<00:01:36.810> again<00:01:37.200> beats<00:01:37.530> ipad<00:01:37.979> 1<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.460> loading<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.790> up

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
2 again beats ipad 1 and loading it up

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.330 
2 again beats ipad 1 and loading it up
but<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:39.630> not<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.110> real<00:01:40.259> test<00:01:40.590> here<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
but that's not the real test here the
