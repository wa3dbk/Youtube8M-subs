i use this 9 volt battery so we'll use

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.750 
i use this 9 volt battery so we'll use
the<00:00:43.500> 9-volt<00:00:43.950> battery<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> 12<00:00:45.090> volt<00:00:45.180> motor

about<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:02.090> did<00:02:03.090> notice<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.630> when<00:02:04.049> I

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
about it I did notice that when I

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.990 
about it I did notice that when I
measured<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.710> comb<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.350> actually<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.310> bit

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
measured this comb it is actually a bit

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.750 
measured this comb it is actually a bit
too<00:02:09.270> long<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:10.530> I'll<00:02:10.590> have<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.739> trim<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.400> ends

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
too long so I'll have to trim the ends

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.210 
too long so I'll have to trim the ends
to<00:02:11.910> make

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
it fits within my 15 x 15 x 15 but other

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.870 
it fits within my 15 x 15 x 15 but other
than<00:02:17.350> that<00:02:17.470> everything<00:02:18.280> else<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:19.080> there<00:02:20.880> got

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
than that everything else is there got

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.240 
than that everything else is there got
one<00:02:22.060> other<00:02:22.180> thing<00:02:22.560> needs<00:02:23.560> some<00:02:23.770> plastic

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
one other thing needs some plastic

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.560 
glue the wheels on the reason I like
these<00:03:01.480> is<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:04.030> have<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.240> drill<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.510> hole

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
these is you have to drill a hole

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.680 
these is you have to drill a hole
through<00:03:04.750> them<00:03:05.320> because<00:03:06.250> they<00:03:06.459> existing<00:03:07.450> holes

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
through them because they existing holes

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.920 
through them because they existing holes
aren't<00:03:08.020> big<00:03:08.260> enough<00:03:09.300> if<00:03:10.300> I'm<00:03:10.480> not<00:03:10.690> even<00:03:10.900> sure

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
aren't big enough if I'm not even sure

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.570 
aren't big enough if I'm not even sure
if<00:03:11.200> there<00:03:11.350> are<00:03:11.500> holes<00:03:11.770> in<00:03:11.950> them<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.220> begin<00:03:12.310> with

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
if there are holes in them to begin with

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.770 
if there are holes in them to begin with
but<00:03:12.730> certainly<00:03:13.030> I've<00:03:13.150> had<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.420> drill<00:03:13.600> holes

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
but certainly I've had to drill holes

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.670 
but certainly I've had to drill holes
through<00:03:14.020> them<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:16.140> then<00:03:17.140> they've<00:03:17.290> got<00:03:17.320> a<00:03:17.440> nice

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
through them and then they've got a nice

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.580 
through them and then they've got a nice
big<00:03:18.090> area<00:03:19.090> there<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:19.989> can<00:03:20.140> fill<00:03:20.410> with

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
big area there that you can fill with

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:30.240 
big area there that you can fill with
hot<00:03:20.620> glue<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.489> hold<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:22.600> onto<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:24.239> skewer<00:03:29.250> it

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
hot glue to hold it onto the skewer it

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.250 
hot glue to hold it onto the skewer it
makes<00:03:30.489> them<00:03:30.640> very<00:03:30.850> secure<00:03:31.540> on<00:03:31.870> their<00:03:34.110> mind<00:03:35.110> you

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
makes them very secure on their mind you

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.810 
makes them very secure on their mind you
there<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.470> good<00:03:35.709> tight<00:03:35.980> fit<00:03:36.280> anyway<00:03:38.550> right<00:03:39.550> well

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
there a good tight fit anyway right well
