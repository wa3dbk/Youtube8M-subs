00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:23.770 

so<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.150> like<00:04:17.599> the<00:04:17.780> length<00:04:17.989> right<00:04:18.709> now<00:04:22.569> we<00:04:23.569> are

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
so I like the length right now we are

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.629 
so I like the length right now we are
going<00:04:24.099> to<00:04:25.099> go<00:04:25.490> in<00:04:25.819> and<00:04:26.300> I<00:04:27.020> can<00:04:27.530> start<00:04:27.860> by

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
going to go in and I can start by

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.710 
going to go in and I can start by
sub-sites<00:04:29.599> with<00:04:29.930> things<00:04:30.289> and<00:04:31.419> what<00:04:32.419> it<00:04:32.509> means

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
sub-sites with things and what it means

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.149 
sub-sites with things and what it means
is<00:04:33.080> that<00:04:33.110> it's<00:04:33.740> short<00:04:34.699> here<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:36.159> gradually

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
is that it's short here it gradually

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:42.990 
is that it's short here it gradually
goes<00:04:37.580> down<00:04:38.379> gradually<00:04:39.379> gets<00:04:40.159> longer<00:04:40.870> so<00:04:41.870> I

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
goes down gradually gets longer so I

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.800 
goes down gradually gets longer so I
found<00:04:44.000> my<00:04:44.180> being<00:04:44.770> this<00:04:45.770> way<00:04:46.150> but<00:04:47.150> when<00:04:47.360> I<00:04:47.389> cut

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
found my being this way but when I cut

00:04:47.810 --> 00:05:23.580 
found my being this way but when I cut
I'm<00:04:48.050> gonna<00:04:48.409> strip<00:04:49.039> it

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.960 

so<00:05:24.100> you<00:05:24.250> know<00:05:24.370> it's<00:05:24.580> a<00:05:24.730> little<00:05:25.120> choppy
