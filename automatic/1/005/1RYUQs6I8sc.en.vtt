00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello everyone so today 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.960
 I will teach you how to make a boat 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.590
 in paper but for that you have 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.880
 need a blank sheet at 4 so 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.570
 to start we will fold the sheet 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.859
 like this you support it in two 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.470
 brands and well include then wanting 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:29.640
 fold in half and unfold just a 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.079
 just right in then you see 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.480
 the opening go down it is down 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:41.809
 so you take the side where is not 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:45.510
 open and you bend like this 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:52.199
 So here it is open downstairs so you 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:57.289
 go back and bend like these 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:03.239
 always open at the bottom so then folded 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:05.580
 like this here is for it to be 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.770
 the fold limit to fold you well 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.680
 until the end 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:16.979
 Return forget like the following camp 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.549
 you take it like these and you 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.689
 take the see it's like that and so 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.740
 you take that side there you input them 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:32.840
 you bend also makes return 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.840
 you fold and you fold like that 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.060
 so 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:45.360
 then you take it like this 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:47.399
 open and bend like this so 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.890
 you call his links us then 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.310
 you have center like that 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.140
 see you take the side shot where 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.840
 opened you down 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.630
 until like these the same from the side 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.630
 see I return so I flap 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.140
 then you 're still 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.459
 like those on the side you open yourself 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.980
 so you were like that you have 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:22.330
 open you have flattens in the blood 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:26.500
 so that gives you that and then you 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:30.630
 take that you gently pull out 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.459
 the conflicts on them on his pieces there 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.760
 then what are you going to do if you 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.630
 go flatten the boat so when you 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:47.140
 have it green that flattens it's all right 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:52.980
 the boat in every way like those 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:57.819
 the one that gives you saw something like that 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:02.220
 if you see a threshold between you 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:05.920
 slide flying and this gives in battery 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.280
