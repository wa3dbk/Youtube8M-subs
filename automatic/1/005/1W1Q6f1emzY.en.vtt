what<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.770> changing<00:00:20.160> about<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.060> what<00:00:22.050> changes

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
what is changing about it what changes

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.920 
what is changing about it what changes
from<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.650> original<00:00:23.189> breeze<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:24.029> basically

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
from the original breeze is basically

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.389 
from the original breeze is basically
we're<00:00:25.020> making<00:00:25.259> it<00:00:25.349> lighter<00:00:25.529> weight<00:00:25.739> and<00:00:26.040> we're

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:26.399 
we're making it lighter weight and we're

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.550 
we're making it lighter weight and we're
making<00:00:26.610> it<00:00:26.700> more<00:00:26.759> durable<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:28.169> some

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
making it more durable so it's some

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.389 
making it more durable so it's some
product<00:00:29.009> or<00:00:29.099> richman's<00:00:29.520> that<00:00:29.759> help<00:00:30.559> the<00:00:31.559> air

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
product or richman's that help the air

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.160 
product or richman's that help the air
mass<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> much<00:00:33.329> more<00:00:33.480> durable<00:00:33.690> air<00:00:33.960> mesh

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
mass is a much more durable air mesh

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.459 
mass is a much more durable air mesh
it's<00:00:34.410> always<00:00:34.710> been<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.190> point<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:37.199> is

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
it's always been that point of is it is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.990 
it's always been that point of is it is
a<00:00:37.500> durable<00:00:37.739> enough<00:00:37.949> for<00:00:38.219> hiking<00:00:38.370> boot<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.879> we

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
a durable enough for hiking boot so we

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.540 
a durable enough for hiking boot so we
found<00:00:39.210> intermesh<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.989> about<00:00:40.340> twice<00:00:41.340> as

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
found intermesh that is about twice as

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.040 
found intermesh that is about twice as
durable<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.269> original<00:00:42.570> air<00:00:42.690> mesh<00:00:42.870> we

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
durable as the original air mesh we

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.660 
durable as the original air mesh we
didn't<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> problem<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.429> but<00:00:44.579> we

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
didn't have a problem with that but we

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.829 
didn't have a problem with that but we
wanted<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> make<00:00:45.059> sure<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.329> was<00:00:45.420> bomb<00:00:45.600> proof

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
wanted to make sure it was bomb proof

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.079 
wanted to make sure it was bomb proof
the<00:00:46.410> second<00:00:46.710> thing<00:00:46.859> is<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.460> added<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
the second thing is that we added a

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.720 
the second thing is that we added a
molded<00:00:48.570> rubber<00:00:48.660> toe<00:00:48.960> cap<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.679> is<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.980> high

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
molded rubber toe cap and that is a high

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.310 
molded rubber toe cap and that is a high
you<00:00:50.789> Syria<00:00:51.269> in<00:00:51.359> the<00:00:51.449> boot<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.079> really

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
you Syria in the boot so that really

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.509 
you Syria in the boot so that really
helps<00:00:53.660> keep<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.809> keep<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.289> protected<00:00:55.519> the

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
helps keep it keep it protected the

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.489 
helps keep it keep it protected the
other<00:00:56.850> thing<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.539> bottom<00:00:57.989> package<00:00:58.409> is

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
other thing is the the bottom package is

00:00:58.499 --> 00:00:59.959 
other thing is the the bottom package is
much<00:00:58.679> lighter<00:00:58.920> than<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.399> original<00:00:59.730> bottom

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
much lighter than the original bottom

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.520 
much lighter than the original bottom
package<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:01.109> has<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> dual<00:01:01.469> density<00:01:01.710> Eva<00:01:01.949> a

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
package it has a dual density Eva a

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.050 
package it has a dual density Eva a
midsole<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.280> software<00:01:05.670> didn't<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
midsole so a software didn't see in the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.149 
midsole so a software didn't see in the
heel<00:01:06.240> where<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.659> your<00:01:06.690> heel<00:01:06.930> strike<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
heel where you have your heel strike and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.560 
heel where you have your heel strike and
then<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.310> lighter<00:01:08.520> weight<00:01:08.729> TPU<00:01:09.119> plates<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
then a lighter weight TPU plates in the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.420 
then a lighter weight TPU plates in the
original<00:01:09.689> boot<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.350> overall<00:01:10.590> much<00:01:11.159> lighter

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
original boot so overall much lighter

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.660 
original boot so overall much lighter
weight<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.939> more<00:01:12.329> durable<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:13.409> right<00:01:13.710> um<00:01:14.130> so

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
weight and more durable all right um so

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.429 
weight and more durable all right um so
what<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> about<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.840> breeze<00:01:16.079> that<00:01:16.320> you

do people love it um I think when you
need<00:01:21.689> an<00:01:21.780> actual<00:01:21.990> hiking<00:01:22.560> boot<00:01:22.770> we've

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
need an actual hiking boot we've

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.459 
need an actual hiking boot we've
combined<00:01:24.030> an<00:01:24.149> actual<00:01:24.450> hiking<00:01:24.750> boot<00:01:24.930> with<00:01:25.200> an

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
combined an actual hiking boot with an

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.980 
combined an actual hiking boot with an
athletic<00:01:25.890> shoe<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:27.119> has<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> benefits<00:01:27.899> of

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
athletic shoe so it has the benefits of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.149 
athletic shoe so it has the benefits of
an<00:01:28.110> athletic<00:01:28.350> shoe<00:01:28.500> construction

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
an athletic shoe construction

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.819 
an athletic shoe construction
breathability<00:01:29.899> waterproofness<00:01:30.899> but<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.680> an

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
breathability waterproofness but in an

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:32.929 
breathability waterproofness but in an
actual<00:01:32.040> hiking<00:01:32.369> boot<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.579> gives<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.790> full

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
actual hiking boot that gives you full

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.810 
actual hiking boot that gives you full
support<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:35.070> strikes<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> balance

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
support so it's it strikes the balance

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.760 
support so it's it strikes the balance
between<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.119> two<00:01:36.299> types<00:01:36.539> of<00:01:36.780> shoes<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.350> so

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
between the two types of shoes and so

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.319 
between the two types of shoes and so
it's<00:01:37.950> really<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.340> comfortable<00:01:38.909> hiking<00:01:39.060> boot

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
it's really a comfortable hiking boot

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.080 
it's really a comfortable hiking boot
and<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.740> more<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> day<00:01:41.520> hike<00:01:41.759> or

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
and this is this more for a day hike or
