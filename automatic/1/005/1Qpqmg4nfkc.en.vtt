interesting tricks so let's hear it
first<00:00:45.090> let's<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:45.719> how<00:00:45.750> you're<00:00:46.079> supposed<00:00:46.649> to

slide<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.219> ipad<00:00:47.610> 3<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:49.789> like<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.289> at<00:00:52.289> first

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
slide the ipad 3 in like this at first

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.369 
slide the ipad 3 in like this at first
it<00:00:52.860> seems<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> bit<00:00:53.489> too<00:00:53.699> too<00:00:54.570> crammed<00:00:54.960> to

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
it seems like a bit too too crammed to

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.590 
it seems like a bit too too crammed to
tie<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.960> time<00:00:57.960> it'll<00:00:58.170> loosen<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:59.640> it

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
tie but in time it'll loosen up now it

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.399 
tie but in time it'll loosen up now it
snap<00:01:00.840> into<00:01:01.050> place<00:01:02.899> when<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.989> want<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> close

it<00:01:04.820> those<00:01:05.820> parts<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.390> overlapping<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
it those parts are overlapping the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.350 
it those parts are overlapping the
margins<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> ipad<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:08.909> should<00:01:09.119> close

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
margins of the ipad so we should close

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.210 
margins of the ipad so we should close
pretty<00:01:09.890> solid<00:01:11.750> all<00:01:12.750> buttons<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.680> all<00:01:13.830> ports

put your hand and keep the EPPA like

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.680 
put your hand and keep the EPPA like
this<00:02:41.599> it's<00:02:42.599> very<00:02:42.959> solid<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.620> won't<00:02:43.860> fall<00:02:44.160> so

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
this it's very solid it won't fall so

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.750 
this it's very solid it won't fall so
it's<00:02:45.690> perfect<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.319> make<00:02:46.830> some<00:02:47.130> presentations

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
it's perfect to make some presentations

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.300 
it's perfect to make some presentations
to<00:02:47.910> work<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.420> goal<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:49.620> everything<00:02:50.130> that

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
to work on the goal and everything that

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.759 
to work on the goal and everything that
that's<00:02:51.180> supposed<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.660> make<00:02:51.989> ripe<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.410> look<00:02:52.590> like

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
that's supposed to make ripe I look like

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.120 
that's supposed to make ripe I look like
a<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:53.250> act<00:02:53.400> like<00:02:53.519> I<00:02:54.319> don't<00:02:55.319> like<00:02:55.620> an<00:02:55.709> agenda

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
a and act like I don't like an agenda

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.080 
a and act like I don't like an agenda
now<00:02:57.030> let's<00:02:57.660> see<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.170> other<00:02:58.920> heated<00:02:59.519> function

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
now let's see the other heated function

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.920 
now let's see the other heated function
is<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:01.010> stand<00:03:02.010> mode<00:03:02.250> for<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.540> have<00:03:03.750> to

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
is the stand mode for that you have to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.280 
is the stand mode for that you have to
unhook<00:03:04.190> these<00:03:05.190> two<00:03:05.959> folders<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.750> iPad

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
unhook these two folders and the iPad

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.590 
unhook these two folders and the iPad
can<00:03:11.190> be<00:03:11.340> used<00:03:11.549> in<00:03:12.140> with<00:03:13.580> with<00:03:14.580> two<00:03:14.819> angles<00:03:15.330> one

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
can be used in with with two angles one

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.410 
can be used in with with two angles one
it's<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.989> more<00:03:16.530> vertical<00:03:16.769> it's<00:03:17.190> more<00:03:17.420> suited

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
it's a more vertical it's more suited

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.449 
it's a more vertical it's more suited
for<00:03:18.450> watching<00:03:18.989> movies<00:03:19.140> for<00:03:20.130> browsing

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
for watching movies for browsing

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.270 
for watching movies for browsing
occasionally<00:03:21.269> one<00:03:21.989> it's<00:03:22.200> suited<00:03:22.590> for<00:03:22.799> type<00:03:23.010> it

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
occasionally one it's suited for type it

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.430 
occasionally one it's suited for type it
typing<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.239> long<00:03:24.390> angle<00:03:24.720> but<00:03:24.930> as<00:03:25.170> I've

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
typing it's a long angle but as I've

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.830 
typing it's a long angle but as I've
seen<00:03:25.739> it's<00:03:26.220> very<00:03:26.489> easy<00:03:26.640> for<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.060> tablet<00:03:27.480> to

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
seen it's very easy for the tablet to

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.890 
seen it's very easy for the tablet to
see<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.380> sleep<00:03:28.620> like<00:03:28.829> this<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:30.209> you'll<00:03:30.450> find<00:03:30.780> in

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
see to sleep like this so you'll find in

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.420 
see to sleep like this so you'll find in
google<00:03:31.019> will<00:03:31.380> find<00:03:31.620> yourself<00:03:31.920> using<00:03:32.070> your

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
google will find yourself using your

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.259 
google will find yourself using your
mode<00:03:32.579> like<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.299> one<00:03:34.070> because<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:35.850> can<00:03:36.120> use

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
mode like this one because you can use

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.050 
mode like this one because you can use
it<00:03:36.329> like<00:03:36.540> this<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:39.920> they'll<00:03:40.920> have<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.220> this<00:03:41.880> is

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
it like this so they'll have it this is

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.440 
it like this so they'll have it this is

because<00:04:23.159> the<00:04:23.370> stink<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:23.880> what<00:04:24.060> is<00:04:24.180> pretty

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
because the stink of what is pretty

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.379 
because the stink of what is pretty
slowly<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.990> darkest<00:04:25.620> and
