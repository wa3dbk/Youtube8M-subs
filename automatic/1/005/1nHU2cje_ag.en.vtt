00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.950 
because earlier he was kind of twisted
and<00:02:06.729> he's<00:02:06.850> pushing<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.240> bike<00:02:07.420> down<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:07.690> whole

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
and he's pushing the bike down the whole

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.840 
and he's pushing the bike down the whole
time<00:02:08.170> but<00:02:08.350> now<00:02:08.530> he's<00:02:08.709> kind<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:09.009> more<00:02:09.520> like<00:02:09.550> this

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
time but now he's kind of more like this

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.370 
time but now he's kind of more like this
he<00:02:10.030> still<00:02:10.239> kind<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.450> does<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:10.780> going<00:02:10.929> into<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
he still kind of does it going into the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.900 
he still kind of does it going into the
corner<00:02:11.650> which<00:02:11.770> is<00:02:11.920> okay<00:02:12.250> going<00:02:12.489> in<00:02:12.700> because

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
corner which is okay going in because

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.830 
corner which is okay going in because
you're<00:02:13.060> getting<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.300> thing<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.600> change

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
you're getting the thing to change

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.190 
you're getting the thing to change
directions<00:02:14.190> but<00:02:15.510> one<00:02:16.510> thing<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.810> always<00:02:16.840> saw

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
directions but one thing I always saw

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.479 
directions but one thing I always saw
you<00:02:17.350> had<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.470> problem<00:02:17.680> with<00:02:17.950> was<00:02:18.160> he<00:02:18.310> never

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
you had a problem with was he never

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.420 
you had a problem with was he never
really<00:02:18.880> set<00:02:19.120> up<00:02:19.209> for<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.420> corner<00:02:19.720> soon<00:02:19.959> enough

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
really set up for the corner soon enough

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.800 
really set up for the corner soon enough
and<00:02:21.430> that's<00:02:21.520> why<00:02:21.760> if<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.000> saw<00:02:22.180> him<00:02:22.300> crash<00:02:22.540> most

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
and that's why if you saw him crash most

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.240 
and that's why if you saw him crash most
time<00:02:23.020> he<00:02:23.140> crashed<00:02:23.380> going<00:02:23.650> into<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.920> corner

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
time he crashed going into the corner

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.220 
time he crashed going into the corner
he'd<00:02:24.790> wait<00:02:25.030> till<00:02:25.270> he<00:02:25.330> got<00:02:25.450> into<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.900> corner

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
he'd wait till he got into the corner

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.330 
he'd wait till he got into the corner
because<00:02:26.530> he<00:02:26.620> had<00:02:26.709> kind<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:26.950> go<00:02:27.040> in<00:02:27.160> like<00:02:27.310> this

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
because he had kind of go in like this

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.150 
because he had kind of go in like this
and<00:02:27.730> then<00:02:27.850> rising<00:02:28.239> it<00:02:29.140> was<00:02:29.290> about<00:02:29.680> here<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.040> go

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
and then rising it was about here you go

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.460 
and then rising it was about here you go
poop<00:02:30.400> like<00:02:31.239> his<00:02:31.360> knee<00:02:31.510> out<00:02:31.540> right<00:02:31.870> well

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
poop like his knee out right well

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.900 
poop like his knee out right well
problem<00:02:32.709> with<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.519> it<00:02:33.640> kind<00:02:33.850> of

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
problem with that is is that it kind of

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.380 
problem with that is is that it kind of
upsets<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.510> chassis<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:35.019> little<00:02:35.230> bit
