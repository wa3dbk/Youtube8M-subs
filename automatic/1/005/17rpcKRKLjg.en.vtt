00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.100
 I do not want to conceal 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.140
 yes even more special gear is like 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.590
 For example, a transfer case for 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.080
 all-wheel or a downforce for the 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.900
 Concrete mixer to be driven 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.550
 or a motor pump so that's what I want 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.379
 do not deepen but I want to now 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.300
 go on after we go and 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.790
 have completed automatic transmission 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.519
 and I take the standard first 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.040
 drive motor and gearbox front and 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.989
 drive back there I need now yes 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.210
 a connecting wave namely one 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.159
 Cardan shaft from the gearbox 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.370
 in the beginning cases to the ax differential 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.979
 the rear axle guides this cardan shaft 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.820
 in the simplest case can be a simple one 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:05.379
 wave with a cross joint because 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.040
 the rear axle makes bigger 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.920
 Movements up and down leaving the wave 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.530
 yes, you also have to join in these movements 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.540
 and that happens about a joint though 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.909
 these movements are bigger 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.090
 then i need two joints 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.479
 arise because gelängen in these cross 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.920
 so-called errors in the error I too 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.020
 do not want to deepen also not so 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.789
 only if they are important are important 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.090
 wonder or are there two joints or 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:38.140
 also shared carlén waves 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.170
 then the reason is to look for one 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.759
 Cardan shaft usually also needs a 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.490
 have length compensation 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.280
 that is when the rear axle is up 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.140
 and downstairs because of blowholes 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.030
 then you think because it's so visually 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.630
 she just looks up and goes 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.340
 down 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.329
 in fact, it does describe one 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.810
 circular arc and this arc leads 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:03.670
 to that the Kardanwelle longer and 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.590
 has to be shorter and that happens 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.200
 by a sliding piece because there is 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.330
 steers longest longest in the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.050
 Cardan shaft and in the opposite and 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.880
 then she does not break off even split 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.500
 Cardan shaft I addressed in the 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.830
 grunde taken are waves all keller 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.840
 maintenance-free a bit bold on the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.490
 in length compensation is not quite 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.140
 wrong and the cross joints can 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.950
 maybe after a long time 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.560
 knock down or if water in 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.850
 this stock will then get moisture 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.180
 They do not last as long either 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.750
 otherwise they are maintenance free 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.120
 maybe they have once before 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.670
 seen that there is so small sheet surface 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.450
 on which no waves are welded 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.500
 so inflated that are out of balance 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.610
 pieces because a cardan shaft does yes 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.010
 engine speed or more, think about it 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.180
 the fourth direct gang or more 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.190
 gears and speeds where they already 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.010
 Unbalances would feel pretty strong 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.600
 there will be size vibration and that 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.910
 you want and have to avoid it 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.910
 therefore stir this small area
