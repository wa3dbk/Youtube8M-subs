00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 I in my redemption I saw my sambar people 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.000
 By the seas she comes, Janaína 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 On the road I walked Sometimes I tried to search 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 An explanation, the truth 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 January first it's time to pay The fireworks are over, so let's hand 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 The sea is open, the sky is closed I ask for the sand, always stay by my side 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Across the sea I heard a singing tribe 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.000
 In false lull, sacrifice 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 They said my blood was worth a high price. I wear a black suit and I wear a tie. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.000
 I have bare feet, light a candle I see my soul in a sip of cachaça 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:51.000
 This is my country, no comparison I do not wait for my death, this is my condition 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:38.500
 This is my country, no comparison I do not wait for my death, this is my condition 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
