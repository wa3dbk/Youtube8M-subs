00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 that without the will of our gods do not even want 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.059
 a blade of hair of our head does not fall 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.580
 our gods created this universe 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.059
 they are creatures that sun came 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.080
 the planets went up to our ancestors relatives 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.170
 our ancestors 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.330
 they are laws but the universe created 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.500
 how can you allow something 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.970
 bad can happen to us, you 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.099
 look there is no living thing 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.170
 which our wallpaper would not have bothered 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.550
 because they, too, will be the same people 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.590
 gods passing 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.960
 development of mineral pine animal 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.610
 human plant operates you 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.040
 will find at least one living creature that 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.530
 I am given there a habitat cave 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.629
 possible reproduction ie full 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.640
 possibility of evolutionary development and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.250
 really think you cheated in 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.309
 something like you can Malawi such 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.750
 after all, all nature is not on that 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.090
 that we blow away dust particles just already 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.619
 answering the question why did you come here 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:08.580
 to this world for what 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:10.890
 heavenly planet or can you rest there 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.460
 we came here to learn and become 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.979
 by gods 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.140
 and to become gods you must pass and 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.729
 Crimea and water and copper pipes as of us 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.210
 more plum fried mental 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.869
 There is no sanity about what wealth 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.549
 can go 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:32.909
 so we came here to learn how to eat 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.979
 would we each have rock have lessons 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:41.460
 which we have to go through lessons then 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:43.860
 certain situation is also there all that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.930
 you and not all programmed for 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.409
 our good 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.499
 our whole life is painted by the minute 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.960
 until the end of life everything is known where you are 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:56.210
 who will you communicate what words 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.179
 there will be some actions to do everything already 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.549
 painted painted and this program 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.380
 perfect and need this world mitya 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.020
 but you need with the help of this world with 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.899
 this program itself makes me sense 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:14.410
 life how can you help me talk about 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.030
 she walked when it stopped there was no reason 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.129
 one hundred percent can no longer get 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.410
 well, that is, you have a pit of species that 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.989
 when people live up to 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.590
 and see the injustice of this world and 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.650
 they say i'm there i live like we stole 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.870

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.959
 in the world here I am between now 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.200
 the man himself will not move 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.629

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:53.750
 absolutely fair she absolutely was 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:57.260
 because the goals are our learning goes 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:02.389
 and if we add with the help of arrogance 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:05.750
