00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.170 
but there is no ought for the ipad if
you're<00:03:49.820> not<00:03:50.030> a<00:03:50.330> fan<00:03:50.810> of<00:03:50.840> ebook<00:03:51.260> reading<00:03:52.030> then<00:03:53.030> I

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
you're not a fan of ebook reading then I

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.449 
you're not a fan of ebook reading then I
guess<00:03:53.870> this<00:03:54.260> app<00:03:54.440> isn't<00:03:54.650> for<00:03:54.920> you<00:03:55.010> it's<00:03:55.160> free

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
guess this app isn't for you it's free

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.190 
guess this app isn't for you it's free
though<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:55.910> I<00:03:56.540> would<00:03:56.720> definitely<00:03:56.870> recommend

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
though and I would definitely recommend

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.690 
though and I would definitely recommend
checking<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.980> out<00:03:58.100> because<00:03:58.370> you<00:03:58.459> can<00:03:58.580> get

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
checking it out because you can get

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.300 
checking it out because you can get
cheaper<00:03:59.090> prices<00:03:59.420> and<00:04:00.070> that's<00:04:01.070> about<00:04:01.190> it

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
cheaper prices and that's about it

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.800 
cheaper prices and that's about it
