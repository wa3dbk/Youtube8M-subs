00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 Eiger Thank Izu road belated while we buy finally to ios 6 of I 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.710
 iphone 4 s 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:16.720
 This would've been wanted to direct, and they do not bought yet Five distress 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:20.050
 I don't really talk at all but I think I 'm in a person who is troubled with os now 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.080
 It's not because I can use the law 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.560
 I was worried about trying to get ios 6 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.600
 I was not wanted to direct, and they Na or easily no need to etch 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.840
 You can get a panorama 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.540
 This is already 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:39.559
 Another Hey Why do not you have to raise the video Tteyuu take raw photos of this price plasterer's how 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:43.220
 I'd like to give you a lot of pick up that llama but I usually go through 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.790
 Rather than trying to use this for a moment, pizza is an opto conversion 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.079
 lens 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:51.829
 It will be more panorama if you take a panorama using this 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:55.250
 It is funny to say that more panoramas, but something is not a slave like a funny dress again 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:59.260
 This is a little narrow from now on 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.630
 I'm going to try it in this narrow 8 tatami and a half venture 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.230

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:08.370

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.540
 yasuko retro ever since I have an option to look for the usual 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.310
 Panorama 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.550
 First of all, no conversion lens 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.159
 Beginning 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.460
 When the center line and press the importance Te 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.460
 Yes yes 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.990

00:01:49.770 --> 00:02:01.850

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.990
 Round and round 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.440

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.690
 Now 0.55 by the 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.690
 Such a feeling with a lens 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.950
 this 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.290
 Wow 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.550
 A little of beyond this window oh well it may be natural tea natural that the Is compared to the earlier of 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.950
 How far did I go 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.950
 You can go behind the window 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.499
 It looks like this is 0.55 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:46.799

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.299

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.299
 I like not touching them got hung the propeller of Raui 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.360
 ãƒ¼ 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.360
 I want to collect this for a moment 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.330
 I bought 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.700
 It advanced a little yesterday in 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.190
 Oh 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:19.420
 It's been a little while now, let's see a little 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.050
 Crew that ceiling propeller is strange somehow after all 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.770
 Yeah and Groen and Oyakoko 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:32.330
 It has become strange from the top and bottom hung or rather the four corners 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:37.850
 I could do it for a week and it will be like this when I do a panorama today 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:39.230
 It may be inconvenient for people who are doing panoramas normally, but if you think 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.960
 It is the first panorama 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:49.940
 I early this interesting was there an effective know considerably mountains in the my first panorama 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.220
 In Buddhism you can do panoramic photography with ios, so you can use the conversion lens 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.090
 used 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:59.470
 It was a challenge to take a panoramic shot and was likely to get into a funny drama 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.920
 It was a panorama shooting with the conversion lens, which can now be in the ios 6 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.540
 The 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.320
 Everyone who already has a conversion lens is absolutely interesting rain if you try outside 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.160

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.240
