00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.889
 1 good 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:13.939
 there is no problem of not having faced players in the same branch 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:14.610
 female 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.800
 a little more with a new massive framework 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:24.819
 greeted inhabitants 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.779
 Man, it turns out that my friend and I 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.999
 we are wrong, mine is normal if you consider that it does buti years 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.690
 that is already forgetting how it is divided and how it is subtracted 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.120
 and my buddy was the one with the plans 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.410
 to forget 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.410
 when we made the count of the cinemas that there are in Puebla 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.190
 to forget colonial historical annotator and the two called amalucan but these 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.720
 I think they closed 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.540
 if I call iron soon for the will 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.890
 50 movie theaters 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.020
 Of course today's cinemas are a little bigger than they should have been 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.090
 those original rooms from the era of silent movies 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.090
 that one can imagine adapted 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.530
 for the then novel function 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.550
 and of the time also of the huge salons 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.910
 only a small sample of the colonies remains 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.619
 I've made an imitation of a legendary mall dfd cinema 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.230
 that has disappeared 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.230
 with its balconcitos and its sky with moon and stars 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.380
 with the walls simulating colonial facades and so on 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.030
 from iz intel colonial currently 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.880
 a public comes out pretending not to enter 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.850
 it did not come in or go out 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.900
 like he did not go to see porn 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.380
 like looking for comets and stars like waiting 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.340
 the disque transports poblanos that there are stop 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.930
 and is that the filmed porn say this country railways 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.940
 That is 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.880
 they leave the same colonial as in the town 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.390
 they went out at night, they were covered in pegaditos to the walls 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.980
 the most conservative poblanos 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.860
 the nostalgic ones of iturbide and Maximilian maxims 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.770
 whom they did not know and in addition but there are still grandchild inhabits people 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.629
 nostalgic of maximiliano and iturbide 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:09.930
 well then those 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.160
 that secretly went to the cinema puebla verb cacho 70 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.060
 a movie of wonder and fable 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.929
 with three stories 3 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.779
 directed in that order by felini 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:21.919
 visconti 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.779
 and of sica those three glories 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:26.570
 in the first one I already told here 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.439
 a massu doctor appears gold and a sister hers called donatela 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:36.669
 just like you and I know identical to those who were hiding in 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:37.910
 the clandestine 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.420
 highly hypocritical was formidable found in two they were put to see 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.389
 palazuelo pals and the no 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:49.259
 that cinema town so beautiful so excessively big was with mexico 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:54.139
 and the coliseum and the reform so delayed the varieties and the warrior shows 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.129
 a time when going to the movies was a ritual 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.039
 which included the empire and fucked wind and evening gala 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.569
 when in the lobby 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.669
 jol de ushuaia and if you want 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.209
 it was social life 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.019
 and commenting on the film was also a chronicle of the people 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.749
 that had been seen there 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.879
 and his clothes and his behavior 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.249
 never ceaselessly pil 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:19.059
 the little hill is over 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:21.969
 the cinema now serves to see cinema nothing more 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.770
 and if you no longer have young people the young man 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.740
 to necessarily carry the alleged mother-in-law 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.579
 and the odious with habits and controls chocolates ice cream popcorn malted 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.579
 what remains the same is the complicity of ateneu 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.519
 to increase as much as possible 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.199
 and every day you can more 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.659
 the relations man women 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.019
 that does not change or change 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.640
 what is not well understood 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.859
 it's time to buy the huge one 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:50.979
 an elephant 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:54.799
 that came to be the formerly luxurious and reform that even served to 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.250
 concerts among them 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.099
 one of arturo rubinstein 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.679
 in whose faÃ§ade that is crumbling 6th is a field 

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:05.909
 there is a big blanket and it even broke and that says 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.260
 it sells income items and even some seven-digit telephone numbers 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.840
 because there will be buyer was not missing more his tenant was missing less 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.230
 although God knows what use can be given 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.459
 to that nostalgic neighing 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.359
 I knew one thing 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.710
 that in those places 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.510
 the authorities think to beg the street vendors to install themselves 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.419
 the idea is not bad 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.330
 to the reef like of film 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.520
 ginobili 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.379
 bolivia ingo 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.929
 let's see
