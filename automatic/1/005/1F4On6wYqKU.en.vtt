00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
particularly beneficial for rheumatism

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.670 
particularly beneficial for rheumatism
and<00:02:25.459> in<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:26.640> context<00:02:27.299> you<00:02:27.329> would<00:02:27.569> boil<00:02:28.470> it

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
and in this context you would boil it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.470 
and in this context you would boil it
down<00:02:28.790> about<00:02:29.790> three<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.329> a<00:02:30.420> half<00:02:30.680> ounces<00:02:31.680> in

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
down about three and a half ounces in

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.100 
down about three and a half ounces in
one<00:02:33.980> litre<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.129> water<00:02:35.310> for<00:02:36.060> about<00:02:36.150> one<00:02:36.569> hour<00:02:36.599> so

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
one litre of water for about one hour so

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.960 
one litre of water for about one hour so
you're<00:02:37.200> creating<00:02:37.379> a<00:02:37.620> potent<00:02:38.099> combo<00:02:38.670> here

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
you're creating a potent combo here

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.030 
you're creating a potent combo here
horsetail<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.200> then<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:40.620> add<00:02:40.799> that<00:02:40.980> to

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
horsetail and then you can add that to

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.640 
horsetail and then you can add that to
your<00:02:41.340> bath<00:02:41.579> and<00:02:41.609> sit<00:02:42.239> sit<00:02:42.629> in<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.900> soak<00:02:43.260> up<00:02:43.470> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
your bath and sit sit in it soak up the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.930 
your bath and sit sit in it soak up the
mineral<00:02:44.150> silica<00:02:45.859> it's<00:02:46.859> powerful<00:02:47.579> as<00:02:47.760> an

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
mineral silica it's powerful as an

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.599 
mineral silica it's powerful as an
astringent<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.019> very<00:02:49.590> very<00:02:50.010> bitter<00:02:50.370> it

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
astringent so it's very very bitter it

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.530 
astringent so it's very very bitter it
it<00:02:51.120> allows<00:02:52.190> muscles<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.430> contract<00:02:53.730> in<00:02:54.420> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
it allows muscles to contract in the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.740 
it allows muscles to contract in the
body<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:55.079> proteins<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:56.579> contract<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:57.569> is

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
body so proteins to contract and this is

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.599 
body so proteins to contract and this is
particularly<00:02:58.139> beneficial<00:02:58.470> for<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.159> urinary

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
particularly beneficial for the urinary

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.250 
particularly beneficial for the urinary
tract<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.329> it's<00:03:01.260> useful<00:03:01.560> in<00:03:03.049> working<00:03:04.049> with<00:03:04.079> a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
tract and it's useful in working with a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.390 
tract and it's useful in working with a
variety<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.920> conditions<00:03:05.190> from<00:03:05.700> bedwetting<00:03:06.540> in

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
variety of conditions from bedwetting in

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.670 
variety of conditions from bedwetting in
children<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:10.430> incontinence<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.879> elderly

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
children to incontinence in the elderly

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.069 
children to incontinence in the elderly
in<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:14.069> case<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.459> bedwetting<00:03:14.940> it's<00:03:15.209> also<00:03:15.420> acts

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
in the case of bedwetting it's also acts

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.720 
in the case of bedwetting it's also acts
as<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.379> diuretic<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.220> don't<00:03:17.459> want<00:03:17.669> to

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
as the diuretic so you don't want to

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.330 
as the diuretic so you don't want to
take<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:17.970> within<00:03:18.930> two<00:03:19.260> hours<00:03:19.290> before<00:03:19.949> bed<00:03:20.160> so

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
take it within two hours before bed so

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.460 
take it within two hours before bed so
we<00:03:20.400> can<00:03:20.430> have<00:03:20.639> the<00:03:20.790> opposite<00:03:21.419> effect<00:03:21.540> in

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
we can have the opposite effect in

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.629 
we can have the opposite effect in
children<00:03:23.010> which<00:03:23.160> isn't<00:03:23.370> ideal<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:24.510> course<00:03:25.639> but

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
children which isn't ideal of course but
