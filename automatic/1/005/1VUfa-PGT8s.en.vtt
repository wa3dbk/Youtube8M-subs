00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
well many of you have been asking how to

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.300 
well many of you have been asking how to
set<00:00:03.090> up<00:00:03.120> flight<00:00:03.480> conditions<00:00:04.049> in<00:00:04.350> your<00:00:04.470> 18<00:00:04.830> MZ

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
set up flight conditions in your 18 MZ

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.330 
set up flight conditions in your 18 MZ
it's<00:00:05.910> actually<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.299> very<00:00:06.420> simple<00:00:06.750> process

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
it's actually a very simple process

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.470 
it's actually a very simple process
we're<00:00:08.340> going<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.519> start<00:00:08.670> with<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.820> fresh<00:00:08.940> model

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
we're going to start with a fresh model

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.060 
we're going to start with a fresh model
here<00:00:09.630> just<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.110> show<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.620> how<00:00:10.800> it<00:00:10.920> goes

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
here just to show you how it goes

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.669 
here just to show you how it goes
together<00:00:11.330> so<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.660> conditions<00:00:13.110> are<00:00:13.259> set<00:00:13.500> in

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
together so the conditions are set in

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.770 
together so the conditions are set in
the<00:00:13.830> air<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.460> model<00:00:14.820> menu<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.450> we'll<00:00:15.599> touch

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
the air in the model menu so we'll touch

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.470 
the air in the model menu so we'll touch
the<00:00:16.139> model<00:00:16.619> menu<00:00:17.119> then<00:00:18.119> we're<00:00:18.210> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> go

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the model menu then we're going to go

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.590 
the model menu then we're going to go
into<00:00:18.690> condition<00:00:19.170> select<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.480> in<00:00:21.480> this

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
into condition select and in this

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.970 
into condition select and in this
instance<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.199> want<00:00:22.439> I'm<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> set<00:00:22.859> up

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
instance I want I'm going to set up

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.700 
instance I want I'm going to set up
three<00:00:23.279> different<00:00:23.310> flight<00:00:24.029> conditions<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
three different flight conditions so the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.500 
three different flight conditions so the
first<00:00:25.920> thing<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.160> need<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.400> do<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.060> add<00:00:27.180> two

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
first thing I need to do is to add two

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.259 
first thing I need to do is to add two
more<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.199> go<00:00:28.470> down<00:00:28.619> here<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.800> hit<00:00:28.920> add<00:00:29.279> and

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
more so go down here and hit add and

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.650 
more so go down here and hit add and
we're<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.599> add<00:00:30.689> condition<00:00:31.170> two<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.660> add

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
we're going to add condition two and add

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.060 
we're going to add condition two and add
condition<00:00:34.530> three

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
condition three

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.580 
condition three
now<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:36.030> rename<00:00:36.390> these<00:00:36.630> as<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.350> you

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
now you can rename these as you like you

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.130 
now you can rename these as you like you
down<00:00:37.800> here<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.219> see<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> rename<00:00:38.940> function<00:00:39.210> so

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
down here you see the rename function so

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.639 
down here you see the rename function so
if<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.649> want<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.950> snap<00:00:41.280> roll<00:00:41.610> or<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.649> spin

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
if you want a snap roll or a spin

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.880 
if you want a snap roll or a spin
condition<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.760> name<00:00:45.030> those<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> next

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
condition you can name those so the next

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.889 
condition you can name those so the next
thing<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.160> need<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.030> tell<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.450> what

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
thing we need to do is to tell it what

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.150 
thing we need to do is to tell it what
switch<00:00:49.370> we<00:00:50.370> want<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.969> use<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.770> how<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:52.829> want

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
switch we want to use and how we want

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.029 
switch we want to use and how we want
that<00:00:53.309> switch<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.750> turn<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> conditions<00:00:55.829> on

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
that switch to to turn the conditions on

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.069 
that switch to to turn the conditions on
and<00:00:56.250> off<00:00:56.480> so<00:00:57.480> we're<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> go<00:00:57.840> over<00:00:57.989> here

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and off so we're going to go over here

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.200 
and off so we're going to go over here
to<00:00:58.199> condition<00:00:58.590> three<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.070> hit<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.940> off

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
to condition three and hit the off

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.819 
to condition three and hit the off
button<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:00.960> we're<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> go<00:01:01.350> down<00:01:01.469> here

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
button then we're going to go down here

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.789 
button then we're going to go down here
and<00:01:01.949> hit<00:01:02.039> off<00:01:03.379> forehand<00:01:04.379> we're<00:01:04.619> going<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
and hit off forehand we're going to

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.950 
and hit off forehand we're going to
assign<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.220> switch<00:01:05.549> si<00:01:06.000> which<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.720> one

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
assign it to switch si which is this one

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.980 
assign it to switch si which is this one
up<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.580> we'll<00:01:08.580> touch<00:01:08.790> si<00:01:09.270> now<00:01:09.750> we're<00:01:09.900> going

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
up here we'll touch si now we're going

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.469 
up here we'll touch si now we're going
to<00:01:10.049> sign<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.619> position<00:01:11.340> now<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.330> see

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
to sign the on position now you can see

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.620 
to sign the on position now you can see
we<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.750> three<00:01:13.110> options<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.090> if<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.180> move<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
we have three options and if I move the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.580 
we have three options and if I move the
switch<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.590> see<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.890> actually<00:01:17.040> moves<00:01:17.549> in

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
switch you can see it actually moves in

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.609 
switch you can see it actually moves in
as<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:19.830> wanted<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.509> want<00:01:22.200> condition

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
as we wanted to so I want condition

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.929 
as we wanted to so I want condition
three<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.070> turned<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.670> switch<00:01:23.909> in

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
three to be turned on with the switch in

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.120 
three to be turned on with the switch in
his<00:01:24.119> lowermost<00:01:24.450> condition<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.860> just

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
his lowermost condition and that just

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.969 
his lowermost condition and that just
happened<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.520> already<00:01:26.850> become<00:01:27.150> upset<00:01:27.979> so

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
happened to already become upset so

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.789 
happened to already become upset so
we'll<00:01:29.100> close<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:30.119> close<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.750> menu<00:01:31.020> now

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
we'll close this and close this menu now

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.560 
we'll close this and close this menu now
we're<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.220> condition<00:01:32.820> two<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.270> exactly

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
we're to go condition two and do exactly

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.960 
we're to go condition two and do exactly
the<00:01:33.869> same<00:01:34.110> thing<00:01:36.829> si<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.890> assigned<00:01:38.340> on

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the same thing si is assigned on

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.510 
the same thing si is assigned on
position<00:01:39.840> now<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.590> time<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.829> want<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.430> be

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
position now this time I want it to be

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.280 
position now this time I want it to be
in<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.759> middle<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.689> again<00:01:42.899> if<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.079> move

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
in the middle so if I again if I move

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.870 
in the middle so if I again if I move
the<00:01:43.470> switch<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> middle<00:01:44.310> position<00:01:44.460> you'll

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the switch to the middle position you'll

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.670 
the switch to the middle position you'll
see<00:01:45.060> where<00:01:45.240> we're<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.810> I'm<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.560> turn

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
see where we're at so I'm going to turn

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.280 
see where we're at so I'm going to turn
that<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.970> want<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.659> turned<00:01:49.020> off

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
that on and I want this to be turned off

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.730 
that on and I want this to be turned off
down<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.479> doesn't<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.560> in

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
down here so it doesn't it's not on in

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.899 
down here so it doesn't it's not on in
both<00:01:52.920> positions<00:01:53.610> close<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.960> close<00:01:55.170> that

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
both positions close that and close that

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.649 
both positions close that and close that
okay<00:01:56.909> now<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.540> three

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
okay now you see we have three

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.550 
okay now you see we have three
conditions<00:01:58.280> if<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.549> move<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.000> switch<00:02:00.560> looking

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
conditions if I move the switch looking

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.499 
conditions if I move the switch looking
right<00:02:01.740> here<00:02:01.770> you'll<00:02:02.219> see<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:03.000> conditions

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
right here you'll see the conditions

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.789 
right here you'll see the conditions
will<00:02:03.659> change<00:02:03.899> I'm<00:02:04.049> currently<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.530> middle

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
will change I'm currently in the middle

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.999 
will change I'm currently in the middle
position<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.460> top<00:02:06.329> position<00:02:06.869> back<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
position a top position back to the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.029 
position a top position back to the
middle<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.429> bottom<00:02:08.970> position<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.440> now<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.679> have

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
middle and bottom position so now I have

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.120 
middle and bottom position so now I have
my<00:02:11.250> three<00:02:11.550> conditions<00:02:11.879> assigned

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
my three conditions assigned

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.720 
my three conditions assigned
I<00:02:13.190> can<00:02:14.150> get<00:02:14.570> out<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.840> this<00:02:14.990> menu<00:02:15.290> let's<00:02:16.250> say<00:02:16.520> we

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
I can get out of this menu let's say we

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.510 
I can get out of this menu let's say we
want<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.030> change<00:02:17.360> our<00:02:17.570> rates<00:02:18.250> now<00:02:19.250> I've<00:02:19.370> gone

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
want to change our rates now I've gone

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.940 
want to change our rates now I've gone
back<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.970> condition<00:02:20.420> one<00:02:20.630> so<00:02:21.500> we're<00:02:21.800> going<00:02:21.890> to

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
back to condition one so we're going to

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.680 
back to condition one so we're going to
change<00:02:22.190> they're<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.460> dual<00:02:22.850> rates<00:02:23.060> for<00:02:23.330> various

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
change they're in dual rates for various

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.500 
change they're in dual rates for various
things<00:02:23.720> here<00:02:24.670> now<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.730> first<00:02:25.970> thing<00:02:26.150> we<00:02:26.300> want

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
things here now the first thing we want

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.380 
things here now the first thing we want
to<00:02:26.650> determine<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:27.860> which<00:02:28.100> surface<00:02:28.760> we<00:02:28.880> want<00:02:29.120> to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
to determine is which surface we want to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.390 
to determine is which surface we want to
affect<00:02:30.290> here<00:02:30.800> we're<00:02:30.950> just<00:02:31.100> going<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.250> do<00:02:31.370> a

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
affect here we're just going to do a

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.150 
affect here we're just going to do a
lower<00:02:31.670> on<00:02:31.820> you<00:02:32.810> want<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.170> make<00:02:33.350> sure<00:02:33.560> that<00:02:33.830> this

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
lower on you want to make sure that this

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.180 
lower on you want to make sure that this
is<00:02:34.610> not<00:02:35.210> in<00:02:35.420> group<00:02:35.660> like<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.020> is<00:02:36.140> right<00:02:36.380> now<00:02:36.590> but

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
is not in group like it is right now but

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.040 
is not in group like it is right now but
in<00:02:37.370> single<00:02:37.910> if<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.300> want<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.630> change<00:02:38.900> the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
in single if you want to change the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.160 
in single if you want to change the
conditions<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.450> can<00:02:41.720> see<00:02:41.930> right<00:02:42.140> now

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
conditions so you can see right now

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.670 
conditions so you can see right now
condition<00:02:42.860> one<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.250> set<00:02:43.520> at<00:02:43.700> 90<00:02:44.360> percent<00:02:44.690> let's

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
condition one is set at 90 percent let's

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.450 
condition one is set at 90 percent let's
make<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.130> hundred<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:49.040> we<00:02:49.160> can<00:02:49.280> see<00:02:49.430> some

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
make that a hundred so we can see some

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.110 
make that a hundred so we can see some
changes<00:02:50.060> here<00:02:51.040> now<00:02:52.040> I'm<00:02:52.430> going<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.700> flip<00:02:52.850> down

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
changes here now I'm going to flip down

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.860 
changes here now I'm going to flip down
to<00:02:53.480> condition<00:02:53.900> two<00:02:55.300> again<00:02:56.300> want<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.600> make<00:02:56.750> sure

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
to condition two again want to make sure

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.450 
to condition two again want to make sure
that<00:02:57.020> says<00:02:57.290> single<00:02:57.710> it's<00:02:57.800> going<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.040> default

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
that says single it's going to default

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.360 
that says single it's going to default
to<00:02:59.200> group<00:03:00.220> let's<00:03:01.220> take<00:03:01.490> that<00:03:01.700> down<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:01.970> 80<00:03:02.390> on

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
to group let's take that down to 80 on

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.190 
to group let's take that down to 80 on
both<00:03:04.370> sides<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:05.360> I'm<00:03:05.540> just<00:03:05.690> doing<00:03:05.810> simple

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
both sides and I'm just doing simple

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.590 
both sides and I'm just doing simple
dual<00:03:06.380> rate<00:03:06.560> changes<00:03:06.980> here<00:03:07.190> in<00:03:07.970> condition

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
dual rate changes here in condition

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.510 
dual rate changes here in condition
three

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
three

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.220 
three
we'll<00:03:10.520> leave<00:03:10.730> we'll<00:03:11.180> leave<00:03:11.210> that<00:03:11.510> at<00:03:11.690> 90<00:03:12.020> for

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
we'll leave we'll leave that at 90 for

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.790 
we'll leave we'll leave that at 90 for
right<00:03:12.410> now

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
right now

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.760 
right now
so<00:03:13.340> now<00:03:13.640> if<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.300> move<00:03:14.480> my<00:03:14.510> switch<00:03:14.960> looking<00:03:15.620> right

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
so now if I move my switch looking right

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.520 
so now if I move my switch looking right
here<00:03:15.800> you<00:03:16.010> can<00:03:16.130> see<00:03:16.160> condition<00:03:16.670> 3<00:03:16.970> 90

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
here you can see condition 3 90

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.320 
here you can see condition 3 90
condition<00:03:18.530> 280<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:19.600> condition<00:03:20.600> 1<00:03:20.870> 100%<00:03:22.180> if<00:03:23.180> I

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
want to do a different surface if I want

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.900 
want to do a different surface if I want
to<00:03:27.020> do<00:03:27.140> elevator<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:28.250> would<00:03:28.490> do<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.700> same

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
to do elevator that would do the same

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.330 
to do elevator that would do the same
thing<00:03:28.970> take<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:29.930> out<00:03:30.110> of<00:03:30.140> group<00:03:30.470> put<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.250> in

switch<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:38.690> single<00:03:40.270> and<00:03:41.270> let's<00:03:41.630> take<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:42.050> down

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
switch and single and let's take it down

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.550

to<00:03:42.290> 90<00:03:43.130> on<00:03:43.340> both<00:03:43.730> sides<00:03:45.640> condition<00:03:46.640> 3<00:03:47.560> single

to 90 on both sides condition 3 single
and<00:03:49.600> we'll<00:03:50.600> just<00:03:50.780> run<00:03:50.990> it<00:03:52.030> all<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.270> way<00:03:53.390> down

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
and we'll just run it all the way down

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.580 
and we'll just run it all the way down
to<00:03:54.040> 100<00:03:55.040> 75<00:03:57.910> so<00:03:58.910> that<00:03:59.150> is<00:03:59.420> actually<00:04:00.020> all<00:04:00.320> there

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
to 100 75 so that is actually all there

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.100 
to 100 75 so that is actually all there
is<00:04:00.770> to<00:04:01.070> setting<00:04:01.340> up<00:04:01.580> conditions<00:04:01.930> it's<00:04:02.930> very

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
is to setting up conditions it's very

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.860 
is to setting up conditions it's very
simple<00:04:03.670> and<00:04:04.670> you<00:04:04.730> can<00:04:04.910> do<00:04:05.240> a<00:04:05.270> lot<00:04:05.570> of<00:04:05.600> other

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
simple and you can do a lot of other

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.540 
simple and you can do a lot of other
things<00:04:06.200> with<00:04:06.380> conditions<00:04:06.890> I<00:04:06.980> just<00:04:07.190> showed<00:04:07.400> you

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
things with conditions I just showed you

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.860 
things with conditions I just showed you
a<00:04:07.580> dual<00:04:07.850> rate<00:04:08.150> change<00:04:09.050> here<00:04:10.000> but<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:11.420> can<00:04:11.600> set

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
a dual rate change here but you can set

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.540 
a dual rate change here but you can set
many<00:04:12.110> you<00:04:12.260> do<00:04:12.410> almost<00:04:12.560> any<00:04:12.890> other<00:04:13.070> function

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
many you do almost any other function

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.100 
many you do almost any other function
any<00:04:13.700> function<00:04:13.730> almost<00:04:14.420> that<00:04:14.570> you<00:04:14.660> set<00:04:14.930> in<00:04:15.050> the

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
any function almost that you set in the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.400 
any function almost that you set in the
airplane<00:04:15.590> menu<00:04:16.040> or<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:16.850> model<00:04:17.180> menu<00:04:17.390> you<00:04:18.260> can

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
airplane menu or the model menu you can

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.010 
airplane menu or the model menu you can
affect<00:04:18.859> with<00:04:19.310> conditions<00:04:19.940> this<00:04:20.540> saves<00:04:20.840> you<00:04:20.989> a

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
affect with conditions this saves you a

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.450 
affect with conditions this saves you a
lot<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.260> time<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.620> don't<00:04:22.040> have<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.280> flip

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
lot of time you don't have to flip

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.860 
lot of time you don't have to flip
multiple<00:04:22.910> switches<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.419> go<00:04:23.570> into<00:04:23.720> different

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
multiple switches to go into different

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.460 
multiple switches to go into different
rates<00:04:24.290> or<00:04:25.190> anything<00:04:25.400> like<00:04:25.640> that<00:04:25.700> so<00:04:25.880> first

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
rates or anything like that so first

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.100 
rates or anything like that so first
simple<00:04:26.680> very<00:04:26.890> easy<00:04:27.420> next<00:04:28.420> segment<00:04:28.840> will<00:04:28.930> show

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
simple very easy next segment will show

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.110 
simple very easy next segment will show
you<00:04:29.170> a<00:04:29.320> couple<00:04:29.560> of<00:04:29.740> examples<00:04:30.130> of<00:04:30.640> conditions

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
you a couple of examples of conditions

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.690 
you a couple of examples of conditions
that<00:04:31.270> we've<00:04:31.420> set<00:04:31.660> up
