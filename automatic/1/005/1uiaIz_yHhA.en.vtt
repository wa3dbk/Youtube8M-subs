00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
it's unlike a typical young pod because

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.700 
it's unlike a typical young pod because
it's<00:04:43.400> a<00:04:43.460> game<00:04:43.610> change<00:04:43.940> but<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.180> does<00:04:44.360> he<00:04:44.479> have

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
it's a game change but it does he have

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.550

just thought it sounded interesting me

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.000 
just thought it sounded interesting me
it<00:04:50.690> reminds<00:04:50.900> me<00:04:51.169> slightly<00:04:51.500> even<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:51.919> old

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010
