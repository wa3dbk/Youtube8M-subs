package<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.960> just<00:00:07.560> kind<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.429> look<00:00:08.580> at<00:00:08.670> this

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790

play and talk a little bit more about it
it's<00:00:12.300> kind<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.480> similar<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> zone<00:00:13.139> read<00:00:13.490> but

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
it's kind of similar to a zone read but

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.260 
it's kind of similar to a zone read but
a<00:00:14.790> zone<00:00:15.330> read<00:00:15.570> you're<00:00:16.049> gonna<00:00:16.170> have<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.920> zone

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
a zone read you're gonna have the zone

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.429 
a zone read you're gonna have the zone
running<00:00:18.270> one<00:00:18.449> direction<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.140> then<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
running one direction and then a

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.750 
running one direction and then a
quarterback<00:00:19.800> keeper<00:00:20.160> going<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.430> opposite

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
quarterback keeper going the opposite

quarterback keeper going the opposite
direction

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
direction

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.179 
direction
quarterbacks<00:00:22.260> gonna<00:00:22.470> kind<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.680> be<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:22.890> his<00:00:23.039> own

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
quarterbacks gonna kind of be on his own

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.429 
quarterbacks gonna kind of be on his own
and<00:00:23.580> then<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> read<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.750> blocking<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.289> going

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
and then the read the blocking is going

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.109 
and then the read the blocking is going
to<00:00:25.500> go<00:00:25.560> one<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.980> other<00:00:26.189> direction<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:27.000> this

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
to go one the other direction in this

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.820 
to go one the other direction in this
case<00:00:27.180> which<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.310> power<00:00:29.310> read<00:00:30.830> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
case which is the power read the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.290 
case which is the power read the
quarterback<00:00:32.099> would<00:00:32.369> keep<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.850> run<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> power

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
quarterback would keep to run the power

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.910 
quarterback would keep to run the power
which<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.260> see<00:00:34.380> we're<00:00:34.500> doing<00:00:34.559> power

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
which you can see we're doing power

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.400 
which you can see we're doing power
blocking<00:00:35.340> here<00:00:35.630> you<00:00:36.630> can<00:00:36.750> see<00:00:36.870> snow<00:00:37.170> pulling

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
blocking here you can see snow pulling

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.709 
blocking here you can see snow pulling
on<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.770> play<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:40.100> then<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.850> sweep<00:00:42.149> sort<00:00:42.629> of

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
on this play and then to sweep sort of

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.950 
on this play and then to sweep sort of
serves<00:00:42.989> as<00:00:43.219> the<00:00:44.219> outside<00:00:44.579> run<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.300> both<00:00:45.629> runs

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
serves as the outside run so both runs

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.990 
serves as the outside run so both runs
are<00:00:46.140> kind<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.440> pressuring<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> same<00:00:47.730> set<00:00:47.969> of

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
are kind of pressuring the same set of

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.420 
are kind of pressuring the same set of
the<00:00:48.149> defense<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:49.260> from<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> inside<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.219> one

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the defense one from the inside and one

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.549 
the defense one from the inside and one
on<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> outside<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.110> puts<00:00:52.289> tremendous

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
on the outside so this puts tremendous

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.510 
on the outside so this puts tremendous
pressure<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.789> side<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> defense<00:00:55.520> and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
pressure on one side of the defense and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.130 
pressure on one side of the defense and
you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.730> kind<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.120> both<00:00:57.270> also<00:00:57.539> shows<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:57.989> we

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
you can kind of both also shows what we

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.260 
you can kind of both also shows what we
think<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.469> Ashe<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:59.039> terms<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> runner<00:00:59.640> we

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
think of Ashe in terms of a runner we

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.020 
think of Ashe in terms of a runner we
see<00:01:00.480> him<00:01:00.660> as<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:01.140> power<00:01:01.350> runner<00:01:01.820> similar<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
see him as a power runner similar to

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.560 
see him as a power runner similar to
Tebow<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.960> he<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.650> Florida<00:01:05.040> um<00:01:05.970> him<00:01:06.420> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
Tebow what he was for Florida um him and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.789 
Tebow what he was for Florida um him and
Monroe<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> field<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.350> same<00:01:07.530> time

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
Monroe on the field at the same time

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.820 
Monroe on the field at the same time
presents<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.430> real<00:01:08.729> problem<00:01:09.229> for<00:01:10.229> these<00:01:10.619> play

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
presents a real problem for these play

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.010 
presents a real problem for these play
side<00:01:11.040> offenders<00:01:12.619> just<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> zone<00:01:14.070> read

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
side offenders just like a zone read

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.800 
side offenders just like a zone read
he's<00:01:16.020> gonna<00:01:16.229> read<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:17.729> defensive<00:01:18.240> end<00:01:18.390> which

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
he's gonna read the defensive end which

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.870 
he's gonna read the defensive end which
is<00:01:18.900> what<00:01:19.080> we're<00:01:19.200> doing<00:01:19.409> here<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.460> defensive

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
is what we're doing here the defensive

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.109 
is what we're doing here the defensive
end<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.090> crashing<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:22.530> he's<00:01:23.460> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.880> hand

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
end is crashing then he's going to hand

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.359 
end is crashing then he's going to hand
the<00:01:24.210> ball<00:01:24.330> off<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.570> Monroe<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.950> defensive

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the ball off to Monroe if the defensive

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.940

end<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.850> staying<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:27.900> home<00:01:28.080> then<00:01:28.619> he's<00:01:28.799> going

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
end is staying at home then he's going

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.039 
end is staying at home then he's going
to<00:01:29.009> keep<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> ball<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.880> exploit<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.540> C<00:01:30.810> gap

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.330 

so<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.829> really<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.659> great<00:01:36.659> play<00:01:37.340> and

so this is really a great play and
there's<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.759> lot<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.030> different<00:01:39.270> things<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.509> can

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
there's a lot of different things we can
