 dynamism each player can break the 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.340
 combo rival combining the keys

 breaker each combo received a name that 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.049
 depended on the number of strokes made 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.689

 fluid perhaps the most noticeable change in 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.470
