come<00:00:10.000> up<00:00:10.120> the<00:00:10.210> temperature<00:00:10.510> and<00:00:10.810> shut<00:00:10.960> itself

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
come up the temperature and shut itself

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.280 
come up the temperature and shut itself
off<00:00:11.500> so<00:00:11.970> I<00:00:12.970> thought<00:00:13.300> I'd<00:00:13.510> open<00:00:13.780> her<00:00:13.870> up<00:00:13.900> and

apparently pajamas but not hot water

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.500 
apparently pajamas but not hot water
proof<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:28.220> someone<00:02:28.580> found<00:02:28.760> out<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.239> then

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
proof so someone found out and then

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.340 
proof so someone found out and then
complained<00:02:30.170> loudly<00:02:30.350> about<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.989> I<00:02:33.080> didn't

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
complained loudly about it and I didn't

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.060 
complained loudly about it and I didn't
help<00:02:33.410> by<00:02:33.620> laughing<00:02:33.830> in<00:02:34.070> it<00:02:35.920> there's<00:02:36.920> the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
help by laughing in it there's the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.770 
help by laughing in it there's the
temperature<00:02:37.459> sensor<00:02:37.850> which<00:02:38.150> turns<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.660> whole

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
temperature sensor which turns the whole

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.000 
temperature sensor which turns the whole
system<00:02:39.020> on<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.410> off<00:02:39.470> I've<00:02:39.590> got<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.860> whole

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
system on and off I've got the whole

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.350 
system on and off I've got the whole
system<00:02:40.220> unplugged<00:02:40.700> at<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:40.910> moment<00:02:41.150> so<00:02:41.239> it's

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
system unplugged at the moment so it's

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.729 
system unplugged at the moment so it's
not<00:02:41.480> going<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.690> light<00:02:41.870> up<00:02:41.900> on<00:02:42.200> me<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.440> start

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
not going to light up on me and start

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.360 
not going to light up on me and start
frying<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:44.620> fence<00:02:45.620> on<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.920> brand<00:02:46.220> or

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
frying the fence on the brand or

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.210 
frying the fence on the brand or
anything<00:02:46.730> stupid<00:02:47.120> that's<00:02:48.080> just<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.620> normally

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
anything stupid that's just a normally

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.150 
anything stupid that's just a normally
closed<00:02:49.750> temperature<00:02:50.750> sensor

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
closed temperature sensor

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.210 
closed temperature sensor
it<00:02:52.550> runs<00:02:52.850> up<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.060> 90<00:02:53.480> degrees<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:54.200> then<00:02:54.860> opens

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
it runs up to 90 degrees and then opens

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.180 
it runs up to 90 degrees and then opens
the<00:02:55.340> circuit<00:02:55.760> which<00:02:56.000> shuts<00:02:56.270> everything<00:02:56.390> down

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
the circuit which shuts everything down

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.550 
the circuit which shuts everything down
temperature<00:02:58.190> drops<00:02:58.460> to<00:02:58.610> 85<00:02:59.030> degrees<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.750> at

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.000 

kicks<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.610> closes<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.030> circuit<00:03:04.270> again<00:03:04.540> and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
kicks it closes the circuit again and

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.740 
kicks it closes the circuit again and
the<00:03:06.010> system<00:03:06.340> kicks<00:03:06.580> into<00:03:06.760> gear<00:03:06.849> and<00:03:07.060> off<00:03:07.390> we<00:03:07.690> go

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.809 

try<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:10.930> get<00:03:11.050> a<00:03:11.080> video<00:03:11.290> here<00:03:11.709> shortly<00:03:12.099> of<00:03:12.340> it

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
try and get a video here shortly of it

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:19.130 
try and get a video here shortly of it
lighting<00:03:13.300> up<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:15.069> getting<00:03:16.000> itself<00:03:16.270> running

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.000 

yeah<00:03:20.280> sort<00:03:21.280> of<00:03:22.410> that's<00:03:23.410> me<00:03:23.620> burner<00:03:24.489> system<00:03:24.790> and

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
yeah sort of that's me burner system and

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.820 
yeah sort of that's me burner system and
Babington<00:03:27.010> bebington<00:03:27.790> burner<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.830> that's

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
Babington bebington burner and that's

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.380 
Babington bebington burner and that's
what<00:03:30.010> can't<00:03:30.280> keep<00:03:30.489> me<00:03:30.640> warm<00:03:30.790> this<00:03:31.000> one<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.269> wear

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
what can't keep me warm this one to wear

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.449 
what can't keep me warm this one to wear
what<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.900> frost<00:03:32.440> last<00:03:32.650> night<00:03:32.980> was<00:03:33.190> probably

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
what a frost last night was probably

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.660 
what a frost last night was probably
down<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:33.670> about<00:03:33.970> minus<00:03:34.510> two<00:03:34.900> degrees<00:03:35.049> and<00:03:35.670> when

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
down to about minus two degrees and when

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.360 
down to about minus two degrees and when
I<00:03:36.700> woke<00:03:36.850> up<00:03:37.000> this<00:03:37.150> morning<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.720> house<00:03:37.900> was<00:03:38.110> at

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
I woke up this morning the house was at

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.739 
I woke up this morning the house was at
