00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
maybe he became unlikable to a few

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.080 
maybe he became unlikable to a few
people<00:03:49.370> by<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.549> way<00:03:50.670> he<00:03:50.760> played<00:03:50.970> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
people by the way he played the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.280 
people by the way he played the
character<00:03:51.239> by<00:03:51.570> think<00:03:51.780> that's<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:51.959> point<00:03:52.110> of

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
character by think that's the point of

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.759 
character by think that's the point of
the<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.950> guy<00:03:52.980> he's<00:03:53.579> an<00:03:53.730> unlikable<00:03:54.299> guy

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
the of the guy he's an unlikable guy

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.470 
the of the guy he's an unlikable guy
he's<00:03:55.769> been<00:03:56.010> fraud<00:03:56.459> if<00:03:56.910> anything<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:59.239> you<00:04:00.239> see

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
he's been fraud if anything and you see

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.229 
he's been fraud if anything and you see
the<00:04:00.660> reason<00:04:00.810> why<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:01.530> mean<00:04:02.220> he's<00:04:03.000> trying<00:04:03.120> to

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
the reason why I mean he's trying to

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.120 
the reason why I mean he's trying to
capitalize<00:04:03.450> basically<00:04:04.290> on<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.769> fact<00:04:05.070> that

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
capitalize basically on the fact that

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.069 
capitalize basically on the fact that
Tony<00:04:05.340> Stark<00:04:05.730> really<00:04:06.000> doesn't<00:04:06.269> want<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.480> be<00:04:06.930> in

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
Tony Stark really doesn't want to be in

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.160 
Tony Stark really doesn't want to be in
the<00:04:07.200> weapons<00:04:07.560> game<00:04:07.799> anymore<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.810> he's<00:04:09.810> taking

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
the weapons game anymore and he's taking

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.000 
the weapons game anymore and he's taking
advantage<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.630> and<00:04:12.630> he's<00:04:13.620> men<00:04:13.799> to<00:04:13.890> be

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
advantage of that and and he's men to be

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.009 
advantage of that and and he's men to be
dislikeable<00:04:14.609> so<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:15.000> thought<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.540> Sam

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
dislikeable so I thought that Sam

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.319 
dislikeable so I thought that Sam
Rockwell<00:04:16.320> played<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.650> role<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:17.760> perfectly

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
Rockwell played the role and perfectly

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.520 
Rockwell played the role and perfectly

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
around tiny star but the pacing of the

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.480 
around tiny star but the pacing of the
film<00:04:25.289> is<00:04:25.700> it's<00:04:26.700> it's<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.690> know<00:04:27.870> it's<00:04:27.900> fine
