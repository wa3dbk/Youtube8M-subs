karat<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.940> first<00:00:38.180> step<00:00:38.480> in<00:00:38.629> this<00:00:38.750> process<00:00:39.020> is

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
karat the first step in this process is

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.200 
karat the first step in this process is
to<00:00:39.649> calculate<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.340> amount<00:00:40.430> of<00:00:40.730> silver<00:00:41.180> that

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
to calculate the amount of silver that

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.209 
to calculate the amount of silver that
should<00:00:41.629> be<00:00:41.719> added<00:00:42.140> in<00:00:42.260> order<00:00:42.769> to<00:00:42.890> make<00:00:43.100> the

should be added in order to make the

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.549 
should be added in order to make the

for<00:00:53.390> in<00:00:53.600> courting<00:00:54.079> I<00:00:54.230> always<00:00:54.949> use<00:00:55.219> scrap

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
for in courting I always use scrap

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.240 
for in courting I always use scrap
sterling<00:00:56.359> silver<00:00:56.780> this<00:00:57.379> basically<00:00:57.949> gives<00:00:58.160> the

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
sterling silver this basically gives the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.040 
sterling silver this basically gives the
opportunity<00:00:58.579> to<00:00:59.089> hit<00:00:59.300> two<00:00:59.449> birds<00:00:59.690> with<00:00:59.839> one

stone<00:01:00.079> as<00:01:00.559> I<00:01:01.100> also<00:01:01.370> get<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:01.879> refine<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.420> silver

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:02.749 
stone as I also get to refine the silver

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.079 
stone as I also get to refine the silver
from<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:02.989> scrap<00:01:03.320> sterling<00:01:03.829> for<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.790> amount

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
from the scrap sterling for the amount

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.600 
from the scrap sterling for the amount
of<00:01:05.210> 18<00:01:05.660> karat<00:01:05.990> scrap<00:01:06.290> I<00:01:06.470> have<00:01:06.650> here<00:01:06.920> I'll<00:01:07.400> need

is 185 point four four grams of six
karat<00:01:21.259> gold<00:01:21.770> alloy<00:01:22.189> you<00:01:22.939> could<00:01:23.119> calculate<00:01:23.299> it

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
karat gold alloy you could calculate it

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.749 
karat gold alloy you could calculate it
yourself<00:01:24.020> or<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:24.290> can<00:01:25.040> simply<00:01:25.430> use<00:01:25.460> the

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
yourself or you can simply use the

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.090 
yourself or you can simply use the
calculator<00:01:26.270> on<00:01:26.479> my<00:01:26.659> website<00:01:27.079> it's<00:01:27.770> pretty

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
calculator on my website it's pretty

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.460 
calculator on my website it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:28.720> here's<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.930> link<00:01:30.170> I'll

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
self-explanatory here's the link I'll

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.020 
self-explanatory here's the link I'll
leave<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:31.159> here<00:01:31.189> in<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.490> corner<00:01:31.790> for<00:01:31.939> a<00:01:32.000> while

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
leave it here in the corner for a while

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.819 
leave it here in the corner for a while
alright<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.689> next<00:01:35.719> step<00:01:36.079> is<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.649> melt

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
alright the next step is to melt

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.280 
alright the next step is to melt
everything<00:01:37.159> together<00:01:37.509> keep<00:01:38.509> in<00:01:38.689> mind<00:01:38.930> that

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
everything together keep in mind that

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.310 
everything together keep in mind that
the<00:01:39.560> alloy<00:01:40.009> needs<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.549> be<00:01:40.729> homogeneous<00:01:41.320> so

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
the alloy needs to be homogeneous so

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.139 
the alloy needs to be homogeneous so
that<00:01:42.500> means<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:43.100> stir<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.549> liquid<00:01:43.579> metals

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
that means to stir the liquid metals

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.899 
that means to stir the liquid metals
thoroughly<00:01:44.600> of<00:01:44.770> course<00:01:45.770> if<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:46.399> are<00:01:46.549> melting

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
thoroughly of course if you are melting

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.300 
thoroughly of course if you are melting
the<00:01:47.030> scrap<00:01:47.329> with<00:01:47.539> an<00:01:47.689> induction<00:01:48.079> furnace

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
the scrap with an induction furnace

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.830 
the scrap with an induction furnace
stirring<00:01:49.310> is<00:01:49.430> not<00:01:49.610> necessary

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.929 

to<00:01:54.840> granulate<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.619> metal<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.100> will<00:01:56.579> pour<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
to granulate the metal I will pour the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.789 
to granulate the metal I will pour the
molten<00:01:57.180> metal<00:01:57.600> into<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.930> bucket<00:01:58.200> filled<00:01:58.649> with

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
molten metal into a bucket filled with

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.800 
molten metal into a bucket filled with
water<00:01:59.070> from<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.790> height<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.060> about<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.450> foot<00:02:00.720> to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
water from a height of about a foot to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.100 
water from a height of about a foot to
half<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.950> water<00:02:02.250> depth<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.850> about<00:02:03.479> fourteen

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
half the water depth is about fourteen

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:22.069 
half the water depth is about fourteen
inches<00:02:04.490> okay<00:02:05.490> here<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.360> go

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.270 

pouring<00:02:23.079> the<00:02:23.110> molten<00:02:23.409> metal<00:02:23.769> from<00:02:24.099> this

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
pouring the molten metal from this

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.819 
pouring the molten metal from this
