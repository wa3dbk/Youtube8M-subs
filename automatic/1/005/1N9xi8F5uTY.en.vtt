00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
pro is very optional I just like it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.539 
pro is very optional I just like it
because<00:01:36.049> it<00:01:36.289> decreases<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:36.859> reload<00:01:37.219> time<00:01:37.249> for

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
I find it just a little bit more useful

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.020

footsteps<00:02:24.450> four<00:02:24.690> times<00:02:24.900> louder<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.739> also

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
footsteps four times louder and it also

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.500 
footsteps four times louder and it also
makes<00:02:26.310> your<00:02:26.400> teammates<00:02:26.819> puts<00:02:27.030> up<00:02:27.180> four<00:02:27.390> times

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
makes your teammates puts up four times

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.809 
makes your teammates puts up four times
quieter<00:02:27.870> rather<00:02:28.560> than<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.069> conceal<00:02:29.489> your<00:02:29.550> own

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
quieter rather than to conceal your own

footsteps so that's kind of my take on

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.020 
footsteps so that's kind of my take on
the<00:02:31.620> sitrep<00:02:31.950> Pro<00:02:32.160> versus<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.640> dead<00:02:32.819> silence

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
guys can see on screen now if you're in

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.420 
guys can see on screen now if you're in
the<00:02:54.090> 2<00:02:54.239> V<00:02:54.360> 2<00:02:54.510> or<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.870> 3<00:02:54.900> V<00:02:55.200> 3<00:02:55.230> playlist<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.220> maps

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
the 2 V 2 or the 3 V 3 playlist the maps

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.680 
the 2 V 2 or the 3 V 3 playlist the maps
are<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:56.819> small<00:02:57.150> where<00:02:57.330> if<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.540> actually

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
are so small where if you actually

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.990 
are so small where if you actually
spread<00:02:58.230> out<00:02:58.380> most<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.799> radars<00:02:59.160> evenly<00:02:59.580> you

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
spread out most of the radars evenly you

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.460 
spread out most of the radars evenly you
can<00:03:00.030> pretty<00:03:00.330> much<00:03:00.420> cover<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.989> whole<00:03:01.140> map<00:03:01.319> and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
can pretty much cover the whole map and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.350 
can pretty much cover the whole map and
what<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.860> will<00:03:01.980> do<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.400> pretty<00:03:02.819> much<00:03:02.910> predict

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
what that will do is pretty much predict

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.850 
what that will do is pretty much predict
wherever<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> enemies<00:03:04.140> spawn<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.709> can

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
wherever the enemies spawn and you can

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.380 
wherever the enemies spawn and you can
pretty<00:03:05.069> much<00:03:05.160> see<00:03:05.310> wherever<00:03:05.819> they're<00:03:06.030> at<00:03:06.060> at

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
pretty much see wherever they're at at
