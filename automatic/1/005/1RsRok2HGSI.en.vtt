00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.450 
mine still at 2.7 and it is this is
really<00:00:45.899> effective<00:00:46.320> i<00:00:46.440> tried<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.980> my<00:00:47.250> katie

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
really effective i tried it and my katie

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.430 
really effective i tried it and my katie
when<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:48.539> whole<00:00:48.719> point<00:00:48.899> because<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.260> only

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
when I one whole point because I only

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.650 
when I one whole point because I only
tried<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:51.239> know<00:00:51.360> how<00:00:51.539> long

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
tried it for like I don't know how long

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.229 
tried it for like I don't know how long
it<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:51.960> maybe<00:00:52.379> five<00:00:52.980> matches<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.640> it's

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
it was maybe five matches and it's

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.939 
it was maybe five matches and it's
really<00:00:54.510> effective<00:00:54.899> unless<00:00:55.079> you're<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> first

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
really effective unless you're the first

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.000 
really effective unless you're the first
infected<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.670> infected<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> basically<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.890> go

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
infected in infected so basically you go

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.250 
infected in infected so basically you go
to<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> infected<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.840> fine<00:01:01.020> game

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
to the infected it's in the fine game

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.410 
to the infected it's in the fine game
and<00:01:01.410> then<00:01:01.500> standard<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.879> start<00:01:03.120> out<00:01:03.239> with<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
and then standard you start out with a

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.880 
and then standard you start out with a
shotgun<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.140> shotgun<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.559> called<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
shotgun the shotgun is called the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.320 
shotgun the shotgun is called the
bulldog<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.880> has<00:01:06.030> six<00:01:07.729> six<00:01:08.729> shots<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.150> one

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
bulldog and it has six six shots in one

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.050 
bulldog and it has six six shots in one
mag<00:01:09.510> six<00:01:10.200> bullets<00:01:10.790> whatever<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.880> want<00:01:12.000> to

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
mag six bullets whatever you want to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.600 
mag six bullets whatever you want to
call<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:13.380> start<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:14.010> those<00:01:14.400> six

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
call it and you start out with those six

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.630 
call it and you start out with those six
bullets<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.420> spare<00:01:15.750> 20<00:01:16.310> but<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.490> also

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
bullets and the spare 20 but you also

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.700 
bullets and the spare 20 but you also
have<00:01:17.880> scavenger<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.540> you're<00:01:18.689> able<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.140> kill

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
have scavenger so you're able to kill

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.070 
have scavenger so you're able to kill
the<00:01:19.860> person

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
the person

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.560 
the person
scavenge<00:01:22.010> I<00:01:22.250> don't<00:01:22.910> know<00:01:22.970> how<00:01:23.090> I<00:01:23.270> think<00:01:23.450> it's

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
scavenge I don't know how I think it's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.030 
scavenge I don't know how I think it's
six<00:01:24.500> more<00:01:24.740> bullets<00:01:25.070> every<00:01:25.310> time<00:01:25.540> so<00:01:27.040> basically

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
six more bullets every time so basically

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.220 
six more bullets every time so basically
you<00:01:28.430> don't<00:01:28.700> necessarily<00:01:28.970> ever<00:01:29.420> run<00:01:29.630> out<00:01:29.660> I

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
you don't necessarily ever run out I

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.050 
you don't necessarily ever run out I
found<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.890> best<00:01:31.100> strategies<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.640> camp<00:01:31.880> with<00:01:32.000> a

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
found the best strategies to camp with a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.310 
found the best strategies to camp with a
group<00:01:32.300> of<00:01:32.450> people<00:01:32.600> not<00:01:33.500> too<00:01:33.800> big<00:01:34.010> though<00:01:34.220> about

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
group of people not too big though about

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.790 
group of people not too big though about
44<00:01:36.320> at<00:01:36.710> max<00:01:37.070> I<00:01:37.370> would<00:01:37.520> say<00:01:37.730> and<00:01:38.530> kind<00:01:39.530> of<00:01:39.560> hide

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
44 at max I would say and kind of hide

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.070 
44 at max I would say and kind of hide
because<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:41.030> throwing<00:01:41.390> eyes<00:01:41.510> bounced<00:01:41.810> off

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
because the throwing eyes bounced off

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.720 
because the throwing eyes bounced off
things<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.710> then<00:01:42.950> they<00:01:43.130> kill<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:43.550> and<00:01:43.700> then

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
things and then they kill you and then

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.670 
things and then they kill you and then
you<00:01:43.880> get<00:01:44.000> really<00:01:44.300> mad<00:01:44.630> like<00:01:45.470> I<00:01:45.710> did<00:01:46.060> but<00:01:47.680> you're

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
you get really mad like I did but you're

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.990 
you get really mad like I did but you're
able<00:01:48.830> to<00:01:49.010> have<00:01:49.130> an<00:01:49.220> advantage<00:01:49.520> of<00:01:49.730> having<00:01:49.880> a

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
able to have an advantage of having a

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.910 
able to have an advantage of having a
shotgun<00:01:50.390> over<00:01:50.600> people<00:01:50.840> with<00:01:50.990> a<00:01:51.200> knife<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:51.860> a

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
shotgun over people with a knife and a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.320 
shotgun over people with a knife and a
throwing<00:01:52.130> knife<00:01:52.220> which<00:01:52.580> people<00:01:52.880> know<00:01:53.030> throw

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
throwing knife which people know throw

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.820 
throwing knife which people know throw
knives<00:01:53.510> aren't<00:01:53.720> super<00:01:54.110> accurate<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.650> only

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
knives aren't super accurate the only

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.980 
knives aren't super accurate the only
reason<00:01:55.430> they<00:01:55.550> do<00:01:55.729> anything<00:01:56.120> so<00:01:56.300> so<00:01:56.450> it's<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.780> one

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
reason they do anything so so it's a one

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.990 
reason they do anything so so it's a one
hit<00:01:57.140> kill<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.620> some<00:01:58.520> people<00:01:58.760> get<00:01:58.850> really

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
hit kill and some people get really

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.910

your corners you have an IED and you

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.509 
your corners you have an IED and you
have<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.400> flashbang<00:02:23.060> which<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:24.340> just<00:02:25.340> pretty

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
have a flashbang which is just pretty

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.400

good<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.880> IED<00:02:26.269> really<00:02:26.810> helps<00:02:27.080> if<00:02:27.290> you're

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
good the IED really helps if you're

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.040 
good the IED really helps if you're
camping<00:02:27.890> with<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.070> team<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.630> flash<00:02:29.810> spring

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
camping with a team and the flash spring

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.180 
camping with a team and the flash spring
really<00:02:30.320> helps<00:02:30.620> if<00:02:30.739> you're<00:02:30.830> running<00:02:31.100> around

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
really helps if you're running around

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.400 
really helps if you're running around
although<00:02:32.150> if<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.630> might<00:02:32.780> flash<00:02:33.019> yourself<00:02:33.350> a

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
although if you might flash yourself a

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.750 
although if you might flash yourself a
couple<00:02:33.680> times<00:02:33.860> because<00:02:34.010> you're<00:02:34.220> always<00:02:34.580> on<00:02:34.730> a

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
couple times because you're always on a

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.690 
couple times because you're always on a
run<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.650> more<00:02:36.650> people<00:02:36.860> there<00:02:37.100> is<00:02:37.220> harder<00:02:37.580> it

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
run and more people there is harder it

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.300 
run and more people there is harder it
is<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.269> camping<00:02:39.260> really<00:02:39.530> helps<00:02:39.769> when<00:02:39.920> it's<00:02:40.100> the
