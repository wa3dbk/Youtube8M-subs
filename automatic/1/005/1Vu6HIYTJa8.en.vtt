00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
what is going on guys slippy here and

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.710 
what is going on guys slippy here and
today<00:00:01.890> we<00:00:02.159> were<00:00:02.220> taking<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.580> look<00:00:02.730> at<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:02.970> t54

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
today we were taking a look at the t54

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.330 
today we were taking a look at the t54
mod<00:00:04.279> 1949<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.089> another<00:00:06.450> new<00:00:06.930> t54<00:00:07.859> in<00:00:08.130> the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
mod 1949 this is another new t54 in the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.000 
mod 1949 this is another new t54 in the
tank<00:00:08.730> tree<00:00:09.090> for<00:00:09.300> Russia<00:00:09.769> so<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:10.920> is

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
tank tree for Russia so this is

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.950 
tank tree for Russia so this is
obviously<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.519> medium<00:00:11.910> tank<00:00:12.240> we<00:00:12.540> know<00:00:12.690> what<00:00:12.809> to

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
obviously a medium tank we know what to

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.020 
obviously a medium tank we know what to
expect<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.830> don't<00:00:14.250> really<00:00:14.549> know<00:00:14.849> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
expect I don't really know the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.540 
expect I don't really know the
difference<00:00:15.240> I'm<00:00:15.599> not<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> very<00:00:15.990> good<00:00:16.550> Russian

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
difference I'm not a very good Russian

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.760 
difference I'm not a very good Russian
tanker<00:00:18.199> but<00:00:19.199> we're<00:00:19.289> going<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.500> look<00:00:19.560> at<00:00:19.680> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
tanker but we're going to look at the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.470 
tanker but we're going to look at the
armor<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.250> see<00:00:20.520> if<00:00:20.910> there's<00:00:21.210> anything

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
armor and see if there's anything

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.759 
armor and see if there's anything
different<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.109> guys<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.470> pick<00:00:22.590> out

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
different that you guys can pick out

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.300 
different that you guys can pick out
from<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.939> normal<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.859> 120<00:00:25.859> millimeters

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
from the normal one so 120 millimeters

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.670 
from the normal one so 120 millimeters
slope<00:00:26.640> back<00:00:26.820> at<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> steep<00:00:27.630> ass<00:00:27.900> angle<00:00:28.439> that's<00:00:28.529> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
slope back at a steep ass angle that's a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.170 
slope back at a steep ass angle that's a
very<00:00:28.920> steep<00:00:29.160> angle<00:00:29.480> it<00:00:31.040> equates<00:00:32.040> equipped<00:00:32.790> I

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
very steep angle it equates equipped I

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.819 
very steep angle it equates equipped I
was<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.630> say<00:00:33.750> quigley<00:00:34.140> eights<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.559> don't

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
was going to say quigley eights I don't

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.380 
was going to say quigley eights I don't
know<00:00:34.890> what<00:00:35.010> equivocate<00:00:35.370> says<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.940> quite<00:00:36.149> still

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
know what equivocate says it quite still

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.280 
know what equivocate says it quite still
like<00:00:36.590> 220<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:38.040> 230<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.390> some<00:00:39.600> spots<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
like 220 to 230 in some spots and the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.190 
like 220 to 230 in some spots and the
lower<00:00:40.500> plate<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.100> same<00:00:41.960> front<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.050> the

turret by the mantlet is 200 sloped

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.950 
turret by the mantlet is 200 sloped
obviously<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:47.879> rounded<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.600> goes<00:00:48.750> from

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
obviously it's rounded it goes from

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.549 
obviously it's rounded it goes from
anywhere<00:00:49.320> from<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.530> 270<00:00:50.370> auto<00:00:50.610> ricochet<00:00:51.180> to

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
anywhere from like 270 auto ricochet to

anywhere from like 270 auto ricochet to
230<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:54.120> mantlet<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.719> not<00:00:55.079> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> be

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
230 the mantlet is not going to be

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010 
230 the mantlet is not going to be
penned<00:00:56.030> even<00:00:57.030> though<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.360> very<00:00:57.570> slim

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
penned even though it's a very slim

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.340 
penned even though it's a very slim
mantlet<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.489> sides<00:00:59.730> over<00:01:00.059> here<00:01:00.239> are<00:01:00.539> 125

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
mantlet and the sides over here are 125

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.969 
mantlet and the sides over here are 125
but<00:01:01.739> they<00:01:01.859> are<00:01:02.039> also<00:01:02.340> very<00:01:02.850> well<00:01:03.629> rounded<00:01:03.979> you

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
but they are also very well rounded you

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.590 
but they are also very well rounded you
could<00:01:05.159> hit<00:01:05.280> somewhere<00:01:05.640> right<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.000> here<00:01:06.450> and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
could hit somewhere right in here and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
45 side of the turret is 125 like I said

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.039 
45 side of the turret is 125 like I said
before<00:01:34.820> see<00:01:35.820> where<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.030> kill<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.840> got

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
before see where to kill it so it's got
