little bit more clarity and vocals but

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.360 
little bit more clarity and vocals but
they're<00:03:10.060> pretty<00:03:10.300> darn<00:03:10.480> close<00:03:10.810> okay<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:12.250> the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
they're pretty darn close okay and the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.170 
they're pretty darn close okay and the

okay<00:03:16.630> stands<00:03:17.140> are<00:03:17.320> 2250<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:21.340> here's<00:03:21.550> the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
okay stands are 2250 and here's the

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.460 
okay stands are 2250 and here's the
amplifier<00:03:22.000> that's<00:03:22.120> real<00:03:22.360> sharp<00:03:22.510> looking<00:03:22.810> yeah

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
amplifier that's real sharp looking yeah

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.610 
amplifier that's real sharp looking yeah
yeah<00:03:23.709> but<00:03:23.860> we're<00:03:24.190> really<00:03:24.340> proud<00:03:24.550> of<00:03:24.610> that<00:03:24.760> yeah

yeah but we're really proud of that yeah
again<00:03:26.620> it's<00:03:26.830> really<00:03:27.370> simple

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
again it's really simple

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.780 
again it's really simple
we<00:03:28.840> got<00:03:28.959> three<00:03:29.140> controls<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.830> volume<00:03:30.190> we<00:03:30.580> went

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
we got three controls and volume we went

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.030 
we got three controls and volume we went
for<00:03:31.000> purity<00:03:31.270> of<00:03:31.330> sound<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.050> it's<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.890> really

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
for purity of sound and it's a really

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.910 
for purity of sound and it's a really
sleek<00:03:33.340> looking<00:03:33.670> it's<00:03:34.450> pure<00:03:34.810> aluminum<00:03:35.200> so<00:03:35.470> I

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
sleek looking it's pure aluminum so I

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.830 
sleek looking it's pure aluminum so I
think<00:03:36.160> it's<00:03:36.430> going<00:03:36.550> to<00:03:36.640> be<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:36.730> good<00:03:37.570> seller

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840
