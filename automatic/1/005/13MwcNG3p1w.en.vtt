00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.480
 I am an instructor to kill the girl and 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.480
 Once applied once prepared the natural nail 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.650
 and has applied what was protemax 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.009
 let's place 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.199
 in this way for sculptures 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.589
 this time we are going to work 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.439
 the spear point union 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.079
 working a complete theory technique we will work what is technical ruz 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.989
 the initial this design let's make a totally crystal base 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.230
 it's not that we were elaborating 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.230
 the base but this time progress is going to be a fingernail 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.760
 totally crystal since the decoration and Russian technique 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.810
 it is a decoration that was not encapsulated 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.020
 like a man the last pearl 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.350
 on point 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.350
 reminding them that the tip of a 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.020
 Spearhead technique has to totally finish 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.680
 in you 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.600
 we wait for it to dry 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.980
 to be able to invest 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.080
 once it will be known tomorrow 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.280
 ponce withdraw cultural form pérez 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.160
 the animals with our 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.280
 endless 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.460
 one is that we finish lima to miss remove the ecdc support in 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.220
 this time we will not remove 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.830
 so we are going to polish 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.560
 with what is our lima expo and i 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.720
 since we are going to make our decoration with acrylic 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.250
 mate 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.800
 on this occasion that are organic the solid credit option and 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.819
 soft consistency and we need the reinforcement of the pawns of lalín 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.050
 we will win 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.500
 will start to put us german and very wet colors 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.510
 to be able to sweep them 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.800
 quique delgaditos since this decoration everything will be encouraged 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.479
 we must be very careful of what was totally different 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.420
 there is no opportunity for Lima 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.420
 Once applied the order and black color 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.710
 let's work a mix 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.659
 where it says still purple tone 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:11.659
 mixing organic pink red 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.029
 We were going to blur 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.729
 to integrate it with the color black 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.569
 the teacher in the mit 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.539
 covering like this 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.349
 the whole kristen base 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.889
 we wait for it to dry 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.309
 start the next part of our school 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:32.229
 once it is with extrabase 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:33.869
 let's start working 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:39.309
 very simple flowers with very open petals buzzi outside the roda the 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.429

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:48.349
 we are working on the color of living of the pastel collection in its line 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.429
 pearlite and open more the petal 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:54.029
 signing a little 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:56.169
 this mood 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.129
 once the firecrackers are finished 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.290
 let's adhere the stones in purple tone tommaso 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.739
 in the middle 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.539
 decade 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.499
 to give it another touch 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.719
 let's take a crystal technical pearl 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.979
 we are going to submerge it per cent vidal gilbert that is one day the silver 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.549

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.439
 explained what was 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.059
 the diversity 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:36.859
