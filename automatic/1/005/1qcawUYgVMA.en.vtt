so as to control the narrow section in

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.929 
so as to control the narrow section in
front<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> station<00:01:07.310> we're<00:01:08.310> still<00:01:08.549> working

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.850 
front of the station we're still working
out<00:01:09.150> whether<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.689> might<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> pedestrian

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
out whether we might have a pedestrian

crossing at the left-hand side of the
station<00:01:12.950> which<00:01:13.950> would<00:01:14.159> make<00:01:14.369> an<00:01:14.549> excuse<00:01:14.970> for

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
station which would make an excuse for

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.870 
station which would make an excuse for
another<00:01:15.270> stop<00:01:15.780> point<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.380> both<00:01:17.130> sides<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.790> the

another stop point on both sides of the
road<00:01:18.060> which<00:01:18.450> would<00:01:18.750> give<00:01:18.930> us<00:01:19.020> another<00:01:19.320> control

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
road which would give us another control

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.330 
road which would give us another control
over<00:01:20.280> traffic<00:01:20.970> through<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> station<00:01:22.340> and

over traffic through the station and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.870 
over traffic through the station and
we're<00:01:23.610> also<00:01:23.759> currently<00:01:24.540> investigating<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
we're also currently investigating the

we're also currently investigating the

adaptation of 12-volt car relays into
electromagnets<00:01:30.950> because<00:01:31.950> we've<00:01:32.070> got<00:01:32.220> about

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
electromagnets because we've got about

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.830 
electromagnets because we've got about
possible<00:01:33.240> 13<00:01:33.689> stops<00:01:35.000> we're<00:01:36.000> trying<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.689> work

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
possible 13 stops we're trying to work

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.510 
possible 13 stops we're trying to work
out<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.170> cheapest<00:01:37.530> way<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.710> doing<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
out the cheapest way of doing this and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.510 
out the cheapest way of doing this and
this<00:01:39.390> will<00:01:39.630> produce<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:40.619> separate<00:01:41.189> video<00:01:41.460> on

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
this will produce a separate video on

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.359 
this will produce a separate video on
the<00:01:41.759> process<00:01:41.939> for<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.840> watch<00:01:43.189> we're<00:01:44.189> also

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the process for you to watch we're also
