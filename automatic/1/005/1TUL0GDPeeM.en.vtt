but this isn't the only talking point of

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.729 
but this isn't the only talking point of
the<00:00:40.219> case<00:00:40.460> this<00:00:40.910> impact<00:00:41.510> ology<00:00:41.989> property<00:00:42.530> that

the case this impact ology property that

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.410

they have with their device with all

they have with their device with all
their<00:00:44.600> cases<00:00:45.140> is<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.770> really<00:00:46.160> unique<00:00:46.309> material

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
their cases is a really unique material

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.240 
their cases is a really unique material
called<00:00:47.270> d3o<00:00:47.899> which<00:00:48.200> essentially<00:00:48.649> protects

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
called d3o which essentially protects

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.100 
called d3o which essentially protects
your<00:00:49.399> iphone<00:00:49.820> better<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.480> harder<00:00:50.840> that<00:00:50.989> you

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
your iphone better the harder that you

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.350 
your iphone better the harder that you
hit<00:00:51.320> it<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:52.100> you<00:00:52.160> hit<00:00:52.489> it<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:52.789> it<00:00:52.910> disperses

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
hit it so you hit it and it disperses

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.029 
hit it so you hit it and it disperses
all<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.930> shock<00:00:54.219> around<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:55.610> case<00:00:55.879> so<00:00:56.480> and

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
all the shock around the case so and

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.770 
all the shock around the case so and
essentially<00:00:58.039> stiffens<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:59.270> it<00:00:59.359> starts<00:00:59.539> off

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
essentially stiffens so it starts off

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.700 
essentially stiffens so it starts off
like<00:00:59.899> a<00:00:59.960> soft<00:01:00.670> stiff<00:01:01.670> rubber<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.270> then<00:01:03.260> when

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
like a soft stiff rubber and then when

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.320 
like a soft stiff rubber and then when
the<00:01:03.920> harder<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:04.309> hit<00:01:04.430> it<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.759> harder<00:01:05.059> it<00:01:05.089> gets

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
the harder you hit it the harder it gets

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.090 
the harder you hit it the harder it gets
is<00:01:05.630> pretty<00:01:06.050> awesome<00:01:06.229> Irial<00:01:06.680> that's<00:01:06.860> on<00:01:06.979> the

bottom<00:01:48.410> part<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.950> top<00:01:49.160> part<00:01:49.429> which<00:01:49.610> fits

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
bottom part and the top part which fits

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.870 
bottom part and the top part which fits
over<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.209> front<00:01:50.569> of<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.810> case<00:01:51.429> now<00:01:52.429> so<00:01:52.700> we'll

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
over the front of the case now so we'll

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.889 
over the front of the case now so we'll
just<00:01:52.910> pull<00:01:53.300> that<00:01:53.330> off<00:01:55.360> so<00:01:56.360> that's<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.630> rear

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
just pull that off so that's the rear

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.839 
just pull that off so that's the rear
shell<00:01:57.259> for<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.830> patrol<00:01:58.280> then<00:01:58.580> there's<00:01:58.789> a

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
shell for the patrol then there's a

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.029 
shell for the patrol then there's a
front<00:01:59.090> cover<00:01:59.420> that<00:01:59.599> kind<00:01:59.750> of<00:01:59.899> surrounds<00:02:00.890> the

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
front cover that kind of surrounds the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.070 
front cover that kind of surrounds the
edges<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.459> also<00:02:01.759> adds<00:02:02.149> a<00:02:02.330> lot<00:02:02.479> of<00:02:02.539> protection

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
edges and also adds a lot of protection

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.690 
edges and also adds a lot of protection
to<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.319> front<00:02:03.530> of<00:02:03.590> your<00:02:03.709> phone<00:02:03.979> you've<00:02:04.489> got<00:02:04.670> a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.609 
to the front of your phone you've got a
good<00:02:04.849> couple<00:02:05.119> of<00:02:05.270> millimeters<00:02:05.780> there<00:02:05.989> so<00:02:06.560> if

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
good couple of millimeters there so if

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.680 
good couple of millimeters there so if
you<00:02:06.800> drop<00:02:07.069> it<00:02:07.099> facedown<00:02:07.459> it<00:02:07.940> your<00:02:08.149> phone

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
you drop it facedown it your phone

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.290 
you drop it facedown it your phone
screen<00:02:08.899> shouldn't<00:02:09.500> smash<00:02:09.879> what<00:02:10.879> we've<00:02:11.000> got<00:02:11.180> on

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
screen shouldn't smash what we've got on

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.350 
screen shouldn't smash what we've got on

may look familiar to you because I've
actually<00:02:16.430> reviewed<00:02:17.060> what<00:02:17.270> something<00:02:17.630> very

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
actually reviewed what something very

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.350 
actually reviewed what something very
this<00:02:18.530> called<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.890> impact<00:02:19.310> mesh<00:02:19.640> now<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.060> can

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
this called the impact mesh now you can

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.030 
this called the impact mesh now you can
buy<00:02:20.510> something<00:02:20.960> like<00:02:20.990> this<00:02:21.110> just<00:02:21.530> on<00:02:21.680> its<00:02:21.860> own

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
buy something like this just on its own

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.430 
buy something like this just on its own
and<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:23.030> orange<00:02:23.300> material<00:02:23.630> that<00:02:23.990> you<00:02:24.020> can<00:02:24.260> see

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
and the orange material that you can see

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.920 
and the orange material that you can see
inside<00:02:24.830> there<00:02:25.070> is<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.550> d3o<00:02:26.030> material<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.900> i

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
inside there is the d3o material that i

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.020 
inside there is the d3o material that i
mentioned<00:02:27.440> before<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.370> can<00:02:28.580> actually<00:02:28.700> use

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
mentioned before so you can actually use

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.150 
mentioned before so you can actually use
this<00:02:29.270> just<00:02:29.840> as<00:02:29.990> it<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.260> on<00:02:30.290> its<00:02:30.620> own<00:02:30.800> but<00:02:31.040> the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
this just as it is on its own but the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.250 
this just as it is on its own but the
extra<00:02:31.550> protection<00:02:32.060> obviously<00:02:32.390> comes<00:02:32.630> when

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
extra protection obviously comes when

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.430 
extra protection obviously comes when
you<00:02:33.350> add<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.620> patrol<00:02:34.070> shell<00:02:34.910> on<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.210> outside

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
you add the patrol shell on the outside

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.300 
you add the patrol shell on the outside
and<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.530> think<00:02:36.740> that's<00:02:36.890> what's<00:02:37.040> great<00:02:37.220> about

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
and I think that's what's great about

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.010 
and I think that's what's great about
this<00:02:37.700> case<00:02:37.970> actually<00:02:38.240> is<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.600> get<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.780> lot<00:02:38.990> of

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
this case actually is you get a lot of

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.630 
this case actually is you get a lot of
cases<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.560> are<00:02:39.770> made<00:02:39.950> up<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.250> two<00:02:40.460> different

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
cases that are made up of two different

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.180 
cases that are made up of two different
materials<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.450> different<00:02:41.900> parts<00:02:42.290> but

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
materials to different parts but

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.980 
materials to different parts but
normally<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.790> can<00:02:44.030> only<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.540> have<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.870> use

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
normally you can only you have to use

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.750 
normally you can only you have to use
them<00:02:45.200> together<00:02:45.350> you<00:02:45.650> can't<00:02:45.920> use<00:02:46.130> one<00:02:46.400> or<00:02:46.430> the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
them together you can't use one or the

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.340 
them together you can't use one or the
other<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.180> if<00:02:47.630> you're<00:02:47.810> going<00:02:47.930> out<00:02:48.140> somewhere

the<00:04:04.430> price<00:04:04.640> is<00:04:04.850> a<00:04:04.880> bit<00:04:04.970> steep<00:04:05.120> for<00:04:05.420> you<00:04:05.720> I<00:04:05.930> guess

that's<00:04:06.830> your<00:04:07.100> choice<00:04:07.400> but<00:04:07.900> personally<00:04:08.900> I

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
that's your choice but personally I

think it's fantastic flexibility the
