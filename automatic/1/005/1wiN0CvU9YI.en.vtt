00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.760
Never thought I could become this strong in my whole life

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.440
Crowd going back and forth

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.510
They would take you somewhere

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.420
So you have to stand strong

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.920
And never let 'em take you to places you don't want

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.980
I won't let someboby else

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.810
Tell me that I am wrong

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.620
And I'm not listening when they say that I'm messed up

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.580
I'm okey even when I'm lost

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.560
Because I have faith

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.220
Don't need somebody to take my hand and lead me through

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.980
Get back what you lost a long ago

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.840
Never let it go when you have your dreams in your hands

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.580
Get back what you lost a long ago

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.920
'Cause if you let go, it's gone

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.120
So now I stand alone

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.320
Standing tall

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.140
No matter how strong

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.940
the wind and rain is in my way and never going away

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.100
Alive and I'm free as I can be

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.160
Nobody stop me

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.240
Because I stand alone

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.530
Standing tall

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.390
No matter how strong

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.110
the wind and rain is in my way and never going away

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.210
Alive and I'm free as I can be

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.650
Nobody stop me as I go my way

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.380
So you know that she wanted to keep you in her cage

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.110
And you know they always wanted you on their side

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.030
He just had to have everything in his hands

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.530
All inside the swirling mind

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.450
Get back what you lost a long ago

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.440
Something that made your life amazing and beautiful

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.380
Get back what you lost a long ago

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.470
'Cause it's still there in your heart

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.390
So now I stand alone

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.830
Standing tall

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.770
No matter how strong

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.380
the wind and rain is in my way and never going away

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.520
Alive and I'm free as I can be

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.540

Nobody stop me as I go my way

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.980
Don't tell me to live your way, No

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.760
