a<00:01:11.330> hard<00:01:11.540> knock<00:01:11.720> down<00:01:11.960> is<00:01:12.140> that<00:01:12.260> you<00:01:12.440> can't<00:01:12.650> do<00:01:12.800> a

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
a hard knock down is that you can't do a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.370 
a hard knock down is that you can't do a
quick<00:01:13.100> rise<00:01:13.360> so<00:01:14.360> if<00:01:14.660> you<00:01:14.750> can't<00:01:14.960> do<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.140> quick

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
meter she builds when reflecting oh oh

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.780 
meter she builds when reflecting oh oh
just<00:04:00.300> missed<00:04:00.750> time<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.470> reflect<00:04:02.010> just

a<00:04:05.550> little<00:04:05.850> more<00:04:06.030> awkward<00:04:06.060> trying<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.019> catch

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
a little more awkward trying to catch

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
ground fireballs but still that's got to

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.199 
ground fireballs but still that's got to
be<00:04:12.000> painful<00:04:12.300> to<00:04:13.040> lose<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.310> such<00:04:14.580> a<00:04:14.610> close<00:04:14.910> round

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209

this<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:23.729> just<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.200> settle<00:04:25.200> himself<00:04:25.410> down<00:04:25.770> or

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
this is just to settle himself down or

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.340 
this is just to settle himself down or
if<00:04:26.010> he's<00:04:26.130> gonna<00:04:26.250> switch<00:04:26.669> characters<00:04:27.350> common

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
just use that as kind of a little time

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.060 
just use that as kind of a little time
to<00:04:35.850> yourself<00:04:36.290> delay<00:04:37.290> things<00:04:37.350> a<00:04:37.680> little<00:04:37.890> bit

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
to yourself delay things a little bit

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.560 
to yourself delay things a little bit

slow down the opponent's momentum that's

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:58.450 
slow down the opponent's momentum that's
what<00:04:42.690> he<00:04:42.750> did

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.070 

all<00:04:59.460> right<00:04:59.669> I<00:04:59.789> mean<00:04:59.969> gootecks<00:05:00.360> basically

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
all right I mean gootecks basically

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.959 
all right I mean gootecks basically
barely<00:05:01.560> lost<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:01.979> lot<00:05:02.159> of<00:05:02.189> those<00:05:02.430> rounds

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 
barely lost a lot of those rounds

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.010 
barely lost a lot of those rounds
there's<00:05:03.240> let's<00:05:03.689> see<00:05:04.009> if<00:05:05.009> you<00:05:05.159> can<00:05:05.340> just<00:05:06.270> it's

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
there's let's see if you can just it's

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.959 
there's let's see if you can just it's
just<00:05:07.199> clutching<00:05:07.740> it<00:05:08.009> out<00:05:08.159> a<00:05:08.189> little<00:05:08.460> bit<00:05:08.610> more

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
this time a more defensive start doesn't

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.480
