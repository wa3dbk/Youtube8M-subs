00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the computer and as you can tell things

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.970 
the computer and as you can tell things
are<00:00:32.340> crammed<00:00:32.759> pretty<00:00:33.000> tight<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.360> machine

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
are crammed pretty tight in this machine

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.319 
are crammed pretty tight in this machine
because<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.250> being<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.610> slim<00:00:35.940> form<00:00:36.270> factor

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

anyways<00:01:10.050> I'm<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.010> power<00:01:11.220> supply<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.000> says

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
anyways I'm the power supply like I says

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.570 
anyways I'm the power supply like I says
what<00:01:12.330> filling<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.720> machine<00:01:13.160> and<00:01:14.160> this<00:01:14.400> thing

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
what filling this machine and this thing

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.160 
what filling this machine and this thing
doesn't<00:01:14.880> smell<00:01:15.060> very<00:01:15.120> good<00:01:15.540> either<00:01:15.720> because

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
doesn't smell very good either because

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.510 
doesn't smell very good either because
when<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.410> pull<00:01:16.620> the<00:01:16.830> cover<00:01:17.040> off<00:01:17.190> you<00:01:17.370> can

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
when you pull the cover off you can

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.300 
when you pull the cover off you can
really<00:01:17.820> smell<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.150> burning<00:01:18.780> smell<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.439> I'm

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310

the<00:01:20.460> owner<00:01:20.610> said<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.210> thing<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.659> power

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
the owner said this thing that power

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.749 
the owner said this thing that power
supply<00:01:22.170> let<00:01:22.409> out<00:01:22.530> some<00:01:22.680> magic<00:01:23.009> smoke<00:01:23.159> when<00:01:23.579> it

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
supply let out some magic smoke when it

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.880 
supply let out some magic smoke when it
went<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.290> gonna<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.619> look<00:01:25.710> at<00:01:25.799> that

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
went so it's gonna have a look at that

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.749 
went so it's gonna have a look at that
power<00:01:26.040> supply<00:01:26.430> while<00:01:27.119> we're<00:01:27.299> at<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:29.670> I

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
power supply while we're at it and I

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.999 
power supply while we're at it and I
made<00:01:29.970> videos<00:01:30.270> before<00:01:30.420> about<00:01:30.840> gateways<00:01:31.530> using

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
made videos before about gateways using

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.310 
made videos before about gateways using
underpowered<00:01:32.460> power<00:01:32.820> supplies<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.540> think<00:01:34.229> I

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
underpowered power supplies I think I

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.109 
underpowered power supplies I think I
have<00:01:34.560> maybe<00:01:35.040> some<00:01:35.250> time<00:01:35.490> before<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.820> probably

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
have maybe some time before I probably

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.609 
have maybe some time before I probably
didn't<00:01:36.390> make<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.509> video<00:01:36.840> about<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.470> not

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
didn't make a video about that one not

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.679 
didn't make a video about that one not
Harmison<00:01:37.979> sure<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> haven't<00:01:39.390> made<00:01:39.450> some

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
Harmison sure but I haven't made some

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.710 
Harmison sure but I haven't made some
videos<00:01:39.990> about<00:01:40.259> Dale's<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.820> some<00:01:42.540> other

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720

supplies<00:01:47.030> anyways<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> Newton<00:01:49.200> power

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409

watts<00:02:02.100> that's<00:02:03.060> barely<00:02:03.299> even<00:02:03.479> enough<00:02:03.840> to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
watts that's barely even enough to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.990 
watts that's barely even enough to
handle<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.409> whole<00:02:04.560> machine<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.759> managed

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
handle this whole machine and it managed

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.399 
handle this whole machine and it managed
to<00:02:06.119> handle<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:06.689> probably<00:02:06.960> eight<00:02:07.110> or<00:02:07.259> so

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
to handle it for probably eight or so

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.310 
to handle it for probably eight or so
years<00:02:07.439> for<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.130> died<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.690> guess<00:02:09.930> that<00:02:10.140> led<00:02:10.289> a

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
years for it died so I guess that led a

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.270 
years for it died so I guess that led a
pretty<00:02:10.649> pretty<00:02:11.039> --scent<00:02:11.370> life<00:02:12.710> well<00:02:13.710> now<00:02:13.890> what

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
pretty pretty --scent life well now what

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.560 
pretty pretty --scent life well now what
I'm<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.520> do<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.940> seems<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.360> power

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
I'm going to do is seems that power

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.380 
I'm going to do is seems that power
supply<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:16.230> proprietary<00:02:16.940> designed<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.210> don't

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
supply is proprietary designed I don't

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.050 
supply is proprietary designed I don't
have<00:02:18.570> any<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.960> these<00:02:19.130> so<00:02:20.130> I'm<00:02:20.280> going<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.490> do<00:02:20.730> is

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
have any of these so I'm going to do is

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.120 
have any of these so I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:21.420> going<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.690> rebuild<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.440> system<00:02:22.860> into<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
I'm going to rebuild this system into a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.570 
I'm going to rebuild this system into a
standard<00:02:23.550> micro<00:02:23.940> ATX<00:02:24.319> mini<00:02:25.319> tower<00:02:25.620> case<00:02:26.010> they

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
standard micro ATX mini tower case they

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.870 
standard micro ATX mini tower case they
use<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.849> standard<00:02:27.330> ATX<00:02:27.660> power<00:02:27.959> supply

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
use a standard ATX power supply

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.820 
use a standard ATX power supply
and<00:02:29.880> luckily<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.390> motherboard<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:31.080> like<00:02:31.740> I

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
and luckily the motherboard is like I

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.730 
and luckily the motherboard is like I
says<00:02:31.980> micro-atx<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:33.180> can<00:02:33.390> easily<00:02:33.570> install<00:02:34.410> that

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
says micro-atx I can easily install that

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.280 
says micro-atx I can easily install that
and<00:02:34.890> Nene<00:02:35.180> my<00:02:36.180> create<00:02:36.480> X<00:02:36.810> form<00:02:37.290> factor<00:02:37.620> machine

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
and Nene my create X form factor machine

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.420 
and Nene my create X form factor machine
so<00:02:40.290> anyways<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:40.710> guy<00:02:40.830> start<00:02:41.100> tearing<00:02:41.310> this

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
so anyways this guy start tearing this

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.640 
so anyways this guy start tearing this
thing<00:02:41.490> down

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
thing down

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.680 
thing down

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.180 
out the group the drive cage that way
you<00:02:48.840> can<00:02:49.020> get<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.170> better<00:02:49.290> idea<00:02:49.500> if<00:02:49.740> everything

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
you can get a better idea if everything

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.280 
you can get a better idea if everything

replace<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:27.750> couple<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:28.169> capacitors<00:04:28.740> in<00:04:28.890> it<00:04:29.010> but

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
replace a couple of capacitors in it but

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.320 
replace a couple of capacitors in it but
it<00:04:29.700> works<00:04:29.880> perfectly<00:04:30.330> fine<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:33.030> of<00:04:33.120> course

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
it works perfectly fine and of course

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.550 
it works perfectly fine and of course
Sarah's<00:04:33.810> had<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.020> rest<00:04:34.200> of<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.350> computer

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
Sarah's had the rest of the computer

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.150 
Sarah's had the rest of the computer
looks

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.810 

anyways<00:04:42.160> I<00:04:42.190> almost<00:04:42.340> forgot<00:04:42.670> to<00:04:42.790> mention

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
anyways I almost forgot to mention

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.640 
anyways I almost forgot to mention
there's<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.480> original<00:04:43.540> power<00:04:44.050> supply<00:04:44.170> out<00:04:44.560> of

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
there's the original power supply out of

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.240 
there's the original power supply out of
the<00:04:44.740> computer

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
the computer

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.540 
the computer
yeah<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:46.060> Gateway<00:04:46.830> ain't<00:04:47.830> now<00:04:47.920> actually<00:04:48.310> open

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
yeah the Gateway ain't now actually open

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.070 
yeah the Gateway ain't now actually open
this<00:04:48.640> up<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:48.970> have<00:04:49.150> a<00:04:49.180> look<00:04:49.330> at<00:04:49.450> it<00:04:49.570> in<00:04:49.660> another

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
this up and have a look at it in another

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.750 
this up and have a look at it in another
video<00:04:50.590> because<00:04:50.770> I<00:04:51.010> got<00:04:51.130> so<00:04:51.310> much<00:04:51.370> stuff<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.640> guy

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
video because I got so much stuff a guy

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.610 
video because I got so much stuff a guy
going<00:04:51.970> to<00:04:52.060> get<00:04:52.180> done<00:04:52.420> and<00:04:52.690> I'm<00:04:53.260> gonna<00:04:53.350> let<00:04:53.500> this

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
going to get done and I'm gonna let this

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.340 
going to get done and I'm gonna let this
thing<00:04:53.680> sit<00:04:54.070> overnight<00:04:54.900> it's<00:04:55.900> that<00:04:56.020> way<00:04:56.140> any

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
thing sit overnight it's that way any

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.050 
thing sit overnight it's that way any
residual<00:04:56.740> charge<00:04:56.950> and<00:04:57.220> the<00:04:57.280> capacitors<00:04:57.820> will

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
residual charge and the capacitors will

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.740 
residual charge and the capacitors will
discharge<00:05:00.750> anyways<00:05:03.330> in<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.480> question

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
discharge anyways in the question

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.180 
discharge anyways in the question
