00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.210 
to swirl it because then I just lose a
lot<00:01:39.820> of<00:01:39.850> product<00:01:40.390> so<00:01:40.720> pressing<00:01:41.650> it<00:01:41.890> is<00:01:42.040> more

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
lot of product so pressing it is more

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.950 
lot of product so pressing it is more
ideal<00:01:42.370> and<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:42.940> kind<00:01:43.120> of<00:01:43.150> sets<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.480> concealer

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
ideal and it kind of sets the concealer

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.740 
ideal and it kind of sets the concealer
that<00:01:44.050> I<00:01:44.200> put<00:01:44.500> on<00:01:44.650> earlier<00:01:45.100> as<00:01:45.340> well<00:01:45.660> and<00:01:46.660> this

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
that I put on earlier as well and this

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.120 
that I put on earlier as well and this
one<00:01:46.930> does<00:01:47.080> have<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.380> little<00:01:47.560> bit<00:01:47.710> of<00:01:47.800> coverage

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
one does have a little bit of coverage

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.920 
one does have a little bit of coverage
which<00:01:48.340> is<00:01:48.460> really<00:01:48.580> good<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.120> it's<00:01:49.600> very<00:01:49.780> light

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
which is really good and it's very light

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.990 
which is really good and it's very light
on<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.200> face<00:01:51.660> so<00:01:52.660> just<00:01:52.870> dab<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:53.080> that<00:01:53.260> on<00:01:53.350> and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
on the face so just dab it that on and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.040 
on the face so just dab it that on and
then<00:01:55.000> I'm<00:01:55.120> going<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.360> take<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.570> smaller<00:01:55.840> brush

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
then I'm going to take a smaller brush

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.200 
then I'm going to take a smaller brush
like<00:01:56.620> this<00:01:56.650> and<00:01:57.280> put<00:01:57.520> in<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.700> putter<00:01:57.880> again

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
like this and put in the putter again

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.330 
like this and put in the putter again
and<00:01:58.810> just<00:01:58.990> put<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.380> underneath<00:01:59.620> my<00:01:59.830> eyes<00:02:00.010> to

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
and just put it underneath my eyes to

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.740 
and just put it underneath my eyes to
set<00:02:00.550> that<00:02:00.700> concealer<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:03.330> also<00:02:04.330> give<00:02:04.510> it<00:02:04.540> a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
set that concealer and also give it a

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.320 
set that concealer and also give it a
little<00:02:04.870> bit<00:02:05.080> more<00:02:05.260> coverage<00:02:06.870> and<00:02:08.820> I<00:02:09.820> do<00:02:09.940> tend

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
little bit more coverage and I do tend

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.820

my<00:02:10.420> own<00:02:10.540> browser<00:02:10.780> home<00:02:11.140> now<00:02:11.320> so<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.620> kind<00:02:11.800> of

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
my own browser home now so it kind of

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.230 
my own browser home now so it kind of
saves<00:02:12.040> me<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.190> lot<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.400> time<00:02:12.520> when<00:02:13.000> getting

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240

especially<00:02:15.310> really<00:02:15.700> important<00:02:16.390> why<00:02:17.080> have<00:02:17.260> to

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
especially really important why have to

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.430 
breaks my lashes I don't know why but it
does<00:04:37.230> so<00:04:37.710> I<00:04:37.740> just<00:04:37.950> kind<00:04:38.160> of<00:04:38.190> just<00:04:38.340> apply<00:04:38.760> it<00:04:38.790> and

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
does so I just kind of just apply it and

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.470

I<00:04:40.440> like<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.770> apply<00:04:40.950> a<00:04:40.980> lot<00:04:41.460> of<00:04:41.640> mascara<00:04:41.790> like<00:04:42.240> I

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
I like to apply a lot of mascara like I

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.060 
I like to apply a lot of mascara like I
layer<00:04:43.410> them<00:04:43.860> like<00:04:44.280> crazy<00:04:45.080> because<00:04:46.080> I<00:04:46.350> don't

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
layer them like crazy because I don't

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.760 
layer them like crazy because I don't
have<00:04:47.220> any<00:04:47.660> flashes<00:04:48.660> really<00:04:49.050> sure<00:04:49.380> it's<00:04:49.620> really

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
have any flashes really sure it's really

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.870 
have any flashes really sure it's really
sparse<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:52.130> just<00:04:53.130> layering<00:04:53.340> it<00:04:53.550> on<00:04:53.610> really

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
sparse so just layering it on really

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.840 
sparse so just layering it on really
helps<00:04:54.300> it<00:04:54.920> all<00:04:55.920> right<00:04:56.130> so<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.310> million<00:04:56.670> layers

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
helps it all right so a million layers

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.240 
helps it all right so a million layers
of<00:04:57.060> mascara<00:04:57.210> later<00:04:57.690> my<00:04:57.990> eyes<00:04:58.230> are<00:04:58.530> done<00:04:58.860> and
