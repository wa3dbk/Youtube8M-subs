sitting in my little garage diorama here

and you guys can see the stance there

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.410 
and you guys can see the stance there
it's<00:00:32.300> pretty<00:00:32.599> low<00:00:33.970> you<00:00:34.970> know<00:00:35.060> I<00:00:35.090> kind<00:00:35.390> of

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
it's pretty low you know I kind of

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.510 
it's pretty low you know I kind of
wanted<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:35.750> do<00:00:35.960> it<00:00:36.140> where<00:00:36.350> it<00:00:36.680> wasn't<00:00:37.070> just<00:00:37.250> an

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
wanted to do it where it wasn't just an

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.990 
wanted to do it where it wasn't just an
outrageous<00:00:38.120> build<00:00:39.309> something<00:00:40.309> that<00:00:40.550> would<00:00:40.700> be

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
outrageous build something that would be

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.660 
outrageous build something that would be
a<00:00:41.290> little<00:00:42.290> more<00:00:42.470> you<00:00:42.590> know<00:00:42.620> realistic<00:00:43.309> it

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
a little more you know realistic it

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.549 
a little more you know realistic it
could<00:00:43.820> actually<00:00:44.000> be<00:00:44.210> driven<00:00:45.020> on<00:00:45.170> public

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
could actually be driven on public

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.000 
could actually be driven on public
streets<00:00:46.449> so<00:00:47.449> that's<00:00:47.840> why<00:00:48.050> it's<00:00:48.260> not<00:00:48.440> slammed

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
streets so that's why it's not slammed

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.889 
streets so that's why it's not slammed
all<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.370> way<00:00:49.489> to<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.730> ground<00:00:50.000> but<00:00:50.390> it's<00:00:50.600> you

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
all the way to the ground but it's you

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.160 
all the way to the ground but it's you
know<00:00:50.929> lowered<00:00:51.440> probably<00:00:52.039> maybe<00:00:52.839> maybe<00:00:53.839> a<00:00:53.929> two

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
know lowered probably maybe maybe a two

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.889 
know lowered probably maybe maybe a two
or<00:00:54.320> three<00:00:54.530> inch<00:00:54.559> drop<00:00:55.039> I<00:00:55.309> would<00:00:55.489> say<00:00:55.899> but

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
or three inch drop I would say but

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.229 
or three inch drop I would say but
that's<00:00:57.679> about<00:00:57.980> it<00:00:58.190> for<00:00:58.429> that<00:00:58.870> and<00:01:00.429> I<00:01:01.429> have<00:01:01.850> the

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
that's about it for that and I have the

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.380 
that's about it for that and I have the
flat<00:01:02.719> black<00:01:02.960> hood<00:01:03.199> on<00:01:03.379> there<00:01:03.559> of<00:01:03.679> course<00:01:04.390> just

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
flat black hood on there of course just

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.180 
flat black hood on there of course just
kind<00:01:05.600> of<00:01:05.720> I<00:01:05.990> don't<00:01:06.260> know<00:01:06.380> I<00:01:06.440> like<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.860> look<00:01:07.040> of

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
kind of I don't know I like the look of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.520 
kind of I don't know I like the look of
the<00:01:07.310> flat<00:01:07.550> black<00:01:07.790> hood<00:01:08.090> on<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.870> painted<00:01:09.230> cars

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
the flat black hood on the painted cars

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.010 
the flat black hood on the painted cars
I<00:01:09.860> just<00:01:10.040> think<00:01:10.159> it<00:01:10.250> looks<00:01:10.400> really<00:01:10.550> cool<00:01:10.820> I<00:01:11.420> did

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
I just think it looks really cool I did

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.460 
I just think it looks really cool I did
another<00:01:12.920> car<00:01:13.159> like<00:01:13.370> that<00:01:13.400> before<00:01:13.880> too<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:14.470> it

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
another car like that before too so it

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.960 
another car like that before too so it
just<00:01:15.620> kind<00:01:15.800> of<00:01:15.860> bounces<00:01:16.280> off<00:01:16.430> of<00:01:16.580> this<00:01:16.670> gold

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
just kind of bounces off of this gold

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.350 
just kind of bounces off of this gold
paint<00:01:17.330> really<00:01:17.780> nice<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.759> front<00:01:20.000> grille

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
paint really nice so the front grille

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.270 
paint really nice so the front grille
has<00:01:20.720> been<00:01:21.229> washed<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.930> everything<00:01:24.280> that

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
has been washed and everything that

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.630 
has been washed and everything that
looks<00:01:25.549> really<00:01:25.759> good<00:01:26.149> and<00:01:26.890> then<00:01:27.890> I<00:01:27.920> have<00:01:28.369> those

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
looks really good and then I have those

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.240 
looks really good and then I have those
Pegasus<00:01:29.450> rims<00:01:30.380> on<00:01:30.680> there<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:31.570> they<00:01:32.570> have<00:01:33.250> the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
Pegasus rims on there and they have the

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.359 
Pegasus rims on there and they have the
brakes<00:01:34.549> inside<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.240> them<00:01:35.979> so<00:01:36.979> they<00:01:37.159> look

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
brakes inside of them so they look

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.660 
brakes inside of them so they look
really<00:01:37.399> good<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:40.700> then<00:01:41.649> on<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.920> sides<00:01:43.280> here

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
really good and then on the sides here

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.630 
really good and then on the sides here
where<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.210> door<00:01:44.450> panel<00:01:44.960> lines<00:01:45.229> are<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.829> did<00:01:46.610> a

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
where the door panel lines are I did a

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.429 
where the door panel lines are I did a
little<00:01:46.880> black<00:01:47.090> wash<00:01:47.390> inside<00:01:47.869> of<00:01:48.020> all<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.229> those

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
little black wash inside of all of those

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.380 
little black wash inside of all of those
panel<00:01:48.920> lines<00:01:49.130> just<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:49.759> make<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:50.149> look<00:01:50.299> a

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
panel lines just to make it look a

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.670 
panel lines just to make it look a
little<00:01:50.539> more<00:01:50.689> realistic<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:52.060> everything<00:01:53.680> so

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
little more realistic and everything so

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.139 
little more realistic and everything so
that<00:01:54.890> came<00:01:55.130> out<00:01:55.310> really<00:01:55.520> nice<00:01:56.770> as<00:01:57.939> you<00:01:58.939> guys

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
that came out really nice as you guys

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.560 
that came out really nice as you guys
have<00:01:59.390> seen<00:01:59.450> before<00:02:00.549> there<00:02:01.549> is<00:02:01.789> that<00:02:02.119> vinyl<00:02:02.509> top

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
have seen before there is that vinyl top

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.569 
have seen before there is that vinyl top
and<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:05.780> was<00:02:06.130> something<00:02:07.130> new<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.460> I've

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
and that was something new that I've

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.150 
and that was something new that I've
never<00:02:07.729> done<00:02:08.000> before<00:02:08.350> but<00:02:09.350> I<00:02:09.410> think<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:09.920> turned

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
never done before but I think it turned

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.190 
never done before but I think it turned
out<00:02:10.340> really<00:02:10.399> good<00:02:10.880> for<00:02:10.940> my<00:02:11.240> first<00:02:11.450> try<00:02:11.870> and

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
out really good for my first try and

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.310 
out really good for my first try and
everything<00:02:13.390> looks<00:02:14.390> pretty<00:02:14.630> realistic<00:02:14.900> I

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
everything looks pretty realistic I

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.440 
everything looks pretty realistic I
would<00:02:15.470> say<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:16.760> also<00:02:17.210> added<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:18.320> little<00:02:18.350> antenna

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
would say I also added a little antenna

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.170 
would say I also added a little antenna
right<00:02:20.450> here<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.080> just<00:02:21.760> use<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.790> little<00:02:22.910> piece

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
right here and just use a little piece

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.420 
right here and just use a little piece
of<00:02:23.300> copper<00:02:23.600> wire<00:02:23.630> for<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.380> just<00:02:25.250> adds

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
of copper wire for that just adds

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.840 
of copper wire for that just adds
another

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
another

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.570 
another
you<00:02:26.150> know<00:02:26.270> level<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.050> realism<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.130> model

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
you know level of realism to the model

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.050 
you know level of realism to the model
and<00:02:29.380> let<00:02:30.380> me<00:02:30.470> show<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.710> guys<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.070> backside

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
really nice I was a little worried at

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.390 
really nice I was a little worried at
first<00:03:59.990> cuz<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.470> wasn't<00:04:00.620> quite<00:04:00.800> sure<00:04:00.860> how<00:04:01.250> it

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
first cuz I wasn't quite sure how it

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.140 
first cuz I wasn't quite sure how it
would<00:04:01.520> look

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
would look

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.000 
would look
against<00:04:02.720> this<00:04:02.840> gold<00:04:03.140> paint<00:04:03.470> but<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.710> think<00:04:03.890> it

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
against this gold paint but I think it

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.530 
against this gold paint but I think it
turned<00:04:04.190> out<00:04:04.310> really<00:04:04.370> nice<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:05.030> think<00:04:05.150> it<00:04:05.300> pops

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
turned out really nice I think it pops

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.760 
turned out really nice I think it pops
really<00:04:05.780> good<00:04:06.280> so<00:04:07.280> that's<00:04:07.490> that<00:04:07.990> there<00:04:08.990> is<00:04:09.350> the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
really good so that's that there is the

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.540 
really good so that's that there is the
magazines<00:04:10.400> in<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:11.150> passenger<00:04:11.660> seat<00:04:11.990> and<00:04:12.550> the

magazines in the passenger seat and the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.240 
magazines in the passenger seat and the
dash<00:04:13.820> is<00:04:14.120> down<00:04:14.360> in<00:04:14.540> there<00:04:14.750> so<00:04:14.990> it<00:04:15.830> looks<00:04:16.010> really

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250
