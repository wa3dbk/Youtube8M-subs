00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.169
 [Music] 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.240
 back with improved displacement 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.180
 and today we are going to talk here about this 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.210
 quadricycle that can be your dream of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.949
 consumption and to explain more about this 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.320
 can be with 12 years here in a 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.240
 authorized dealer in the city of 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.039
 Manaus 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.309
 he will explain all that the Corinthians 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.380
 has to offer you my work in the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.980
 My place is for pleasure on the 9th 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.290
 Brazil is usually this is the drx 420 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.230
 by trotting an excellent vehicle of use 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.539
 agricultural and sports market that adds comfort 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.350
 in the handling of good handling and 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.610
 an excellent use not so much in the modality 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.710
 sports as well as agricultural 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.289
 you can see that your part 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.530
 front has the tug grids on the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.030
 proof towing equipment 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.579
 as a sprinkling machine 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.830
 poison is fertilizer among others 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.380
 the rear has the tug 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.030
 capacity of 385 kilos 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.799
 excellent for boat transport 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.710
 jet 15 among others 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.060
 As I said his sporting use is also 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.619
 very recommended 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.590
 today we have Amazon categories of 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.780
 400 four hundred twenty and 450 city 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.670
 he competes for three more to have a 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.460
 differential than its front wheel drive and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.409
 back with four-wheel drive shaft 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.040
 both front and front 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.040
 how much in the rear 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.119
 moses that we can find this 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.320
 also two versions are 42 and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.240
 44 is this 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.090
 that's right it has version 4.2 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.670
 simple transition and 44 which is the traction 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.350
 on the four wheels is how you can 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.890
 observe is easy to operate in the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.119
 left side in version 4 2 plus 44 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.310
 as preferred 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.830
 he has the pretension of climbing dan 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.360
 driving 42 simply find the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.880
 rear is and chat drives the front 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.810
 also the cardan it spreads in the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.480
 front and rear filling each 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.760
 the benefit of the quadricycle is the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.260
 cardan shaft it has the shape shielded 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.239
 simply an axis that replaces 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.069
 the chain thus avoiding small 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.049
 from contact with the 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.959
 gear is not able to walk is not going 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.209
 mud comes in because it is 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.489
 most precious indication of sand mud 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.470
 in extreme and adverse situations and here 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.750
 you can also find an engine 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.760
 already protected at the bottom and part 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.299
 sure it has load and protection 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.459
 of the engine and you can use it on terrain 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.100
 rugged stick that will not rock 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.170
 straight to the house of the engine and in the case 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.810
 can only say that this quadricycle 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.670
 well it 's pretty safe, I already explained 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.920
 also comes with several indications of 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.150
 security for the person to use 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.799
 certain terrain 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.690
 that's one of the big differences 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.450
 it is the sensor of a training when 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.459
 you're flying up the ramp 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.370
 will even happen a rollover 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.310
 so that his rotation does not continue 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.480
 even with you f losing control of the 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.880
 vehicle 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.780
 will a tilt system goes 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.780
 stop immediately 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.110
 and we can also identify that 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.180
 it is quite simple even in the 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.890
 panel is what kind of information 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.319
 We could find the panel 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.750
 fast forces on his panel you go 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.970
 find download indication 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.190
 neutron indicating the temperature of the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.959
 engine as well as we can observe is 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.510
 indicator of the electronic injection so that 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.060
 indicates that the power supply is being 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.799
 constant and also has a student 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.500
 indicating the reverse gear when it was 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.690
 triggered and in case there are two 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.819
 curiosities especially here in the port 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.849
 before you can find one of them is 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.500
 the passage of male how owns law 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.870
 correctly the passage but how can we 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.090
 watching it is on the right side is 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.849
 differentiated to motorcycles 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.849
 it is by an impulse lever both 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.200
 is and pressing how much retracting of 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.090
 according to the need 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.680
 which in itself brings disadvantages to the 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.840
 person who will be driving this 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.609
 extreme pilotage and 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.949
 best relationship he do this 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.959
 also because the 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:24.039
 When you're the bikes when you 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.710
 It's speeding, she can pull your 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.120
 can pull and e continuous acceleration 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.979
 this happens a lot with the advice 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.840
 only two wheels the beginning is for 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.250
 be used in extreme situations of 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.229
 sports driving 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.830
 it is indicated in this way because 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.810
 time you feel inclined 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.620
 you can simply hold the handlebar 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.660
 and avoid future problems in the case then 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.160
 it can have much greater control over 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.590
 speed it will be putting 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.880
 on the quadricle for sure and also 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.580
 another curiosity that we can 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.440
 find it is to be able to turn the 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.240
 quadricycle is how it worked 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.760
 I'll do a little demonstration 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.030
 It's very simple for you, it's not triggering a 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.420
 new left 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.420
 [Music] 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:15.699
 just arrived work waiting for the bomb 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.860
 fuel plant nÃ© 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.810
 Easy electric start-up for 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.300
 to push back 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:28.360
 year and throw down 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.360
 there it is already thrown there it just accelerates here 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.819
 Aye, there's no way to get backed up. 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.470
 Let's already be in my father later. 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:42.780
 a first does not mean a system 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.220
 very easy and practical for those who want 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.560
 use the priest because the person can 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.530
 piloting simpler easy and practical 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.409
 So who would you indicate this to? 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.840
 table and five pictures to all 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:57.030
 there are adventurers on duty there 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.849
 enjoying with us so the 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.669
 but the sand on the beaches is not 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.560
 on muddy terrain 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.000
 another with another curiosity that the 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.770
 people is the question of 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.690
 fuel tank and the marker 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.069
 it gets to the bottom does not get you good 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.300
 is well below a marker for 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:14.190
 you do not get lost in the consumption of 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.509
 fuel so more practicality 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.509
 for the consumer 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.680
 [Music] 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.170
 Oh, my God, man, to those who suddenly 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.120
 fell in love with this quadricycle that is yours 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.220
 to fulfill your dream of walking in 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.630
 four wheels is independent of the terrain 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.400
 How does he do better? 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.220
 it can make a visit to is to 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.910
 people here on the big circular boulevard 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:43.830
 6571 are Joseph or call us at 21 25 14 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:46.260
