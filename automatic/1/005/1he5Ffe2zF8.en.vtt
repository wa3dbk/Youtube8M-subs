this was actually my very first time
playing<00:03:44.050> little<00:03:44.350> talks<00:03:44.500> because<00:03:44.710> I<00:03:44.980> always

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
playing little talks because I always

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.770 
playing little talks because I always
thought<00:03:45.400> that<00:03:45.460> leads<00:03:45.790> in<00:03:45.940> injury<00:03:46.300> but

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
thought that leads in injury but

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.570 
thought that leads in injury but
honestly<00:03:47.170> my<00:03:47.590> foot<00:03:47.860> felt<00:03:48.100> surprisingly

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
honestly my foot felt surprisingly

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.410

with<00:03:54.070> this<00:03:54.190> model<00:03:54.550> because<00:03:54.850> when<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.030> first

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
with this model because when I first

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.210 
with this model because when I first

but<00:03:57.610> that's<00:03:57.850> expected<00:03:58.240> as<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.750> was<00:03:58.960> dead<00:03:59.200> space

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
but that's expected as it was dead space

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.590 
but that's expected as it was dead space

traction<00:04:34.060> I<00:04:34.240> see<00:04:34.420> in<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.570> video<00:04:34.810> was<00:04:34.990> a<00:04:35.140> one

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
traction I see in the video was a one

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.650

though one thing I noticed was the kobe
nice<00:04:40.419> traction<00:04:40.960> was<00:04:41.080> slightly<00:04:41.380> more
