gives the shine it shouldn't be
overpowering<00:06:00.820> but<00:06:01.600> it<00:06:01.660> has<00:06:01.900> to<00:06:02.020> be<00:06:02.140> because

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
overpowering but it has to be because

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.380 
overpowering but it has to be because
that<00:06:02.650> takes<00:06:03.040> things<00:06:03.340> to<00:06:03.550> take<00:06:03.700> a<00:06:03.730> lot<00:06:04.030> of<00:06:04.060> the
