this<00:02:24.860> camp<00:02:25.129> we<00:02:25.489> had<00:02:25.580> one<00:02:25.879> great<00:02:26.360> week<00:02:26.659> when<00:02:27.080> I

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
this camp we had one great week when I

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.750 
this camp we had one great week when I
first<00:02:27.349> got<00:02:27.530> here<00:02:27.769> really<00:02:27.920> good<00:02:28.129> training<00:02:28.549> for

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
first got here really good training for

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.030 
first got here really good training for
about<00:02:28.879> five<00:02:29.360> six<00:02:29.690> days<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.680> then<00:02:30.799> a<00:02:30.830> big

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
about five six days and then a big

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.500 
about five six days and then a big
weather<00:02:31.250> front<00:02:31.370> just<00:02:31.879> moved<00:02:32.060> in

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
weather front just moved in

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.180 
weather front just moved in
weather<00:02:33.049> it's<00:02:33.200> not<00:02:33.290> always<00:02:33.470> perfect<00:02:33.739> you<00:02:34.069> know

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
weather it's not always perfect you know

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.009 
weather it's not always perfect you know
so<00:02:34.459> we<00:02:34.970> chased<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.360> snow<00:02:35.540> around<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.840> world

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
so we chased the snow around the world

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.449 
so we chased the snow around the world
so<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.260> got<00:02:36.409> to<00:02:36.500> expect<00:02:36.799> there<00:02:36.980> would<00:02:37.159> be<00:02:37.220> some

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
so you got to expect there would be some

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.240 
so you got to expect there would be some
days<00:02:37.640> that<00:02:37.970> are<00:02:38.690> gonna<00:02:38.810> be<00:02:38.989> pretty<00:02:39.170> blustery

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.650 

we're<00:02:43.250> ski<00:02:43.640> racers<00:02:44.000> you<00:02:44.180> know<00:02:44.239> we're<00:02:44.390> used<00:02:44.540> to

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
we're ski racers you know we're used to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:57.970 
we're ski racers you know we're used to
battle<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.260> elements<00:02:56.799> we're<00:02:57.799> in<00:02:57.860> an

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
battle in the elements we're in an

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.610 
battle in the elements we're in an
outdoor<00:02:58.190> sport<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.360> can<00:02:59.569> happen<00:03:00.170> in<00:03:00.290> races

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
outdoor sport and it can happen in races

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.140 
outdoor sport and it can happen in races
too<00:03:00.799> so<00:03:01.069> it's<00:03:01.340> sometimes<00:03:01.640> it's<00:03:01.760> not<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:01.940> bad

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
too so it's sometimes it's not a bad

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.110 
too so it's sometimes it's not a bad
thing<00:03:02.359> to<00:03:02.599> to<00:03:03.470> deal<00:03:04.250> with<00:03:04.459> bad<00:03:04.609> weather<00:03:04.819> and

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
thing to to deal with bad weather and

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.490 
thing to to deal with bad weather and
training<00:03:05.480> it<00:03:07.840> weather<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.109> snow<00:03:09.319> conditions

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
training it weather and snow conditions

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.830 
training it weather and snow conditions
are<00:03:10.010> just<00:03:10.250> two<00:03:10.519> variables<00:03:10.879> that<00:03:11.180> can<00:03:11.390> affect<00:03:11.480> a

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
are just two variables that can affect a

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.270 
are just two variables that can affect a
racer<00:03:12.200> speed<00:03:12.879> equipment<00:03:13.879> is<00:03:14.299> another<00:03:15.280> every

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
racer speed equipment is another every

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
something but all that stuff is just

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.720 
something but all that stuff is just
little<00:03:38.750> things<00:03:39.049> that<00:03:39.200> might<00:03:39.470> make<00:03:39.530> us<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.190> tenth

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
little things that might make us a tenth

faster on the downhill course I'm always

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.800 
faster on the downhill course I'm always
working<00:03:45.620> on<00:03:45.799> my<00:03:45.889> aerodynamics<00:03:46.579> and<00:03:46.849> tactics

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
working on my aerodynamics and tactics

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.420 
working on my aerodynamics and tactics
we're<00:03:48.440> always<00:03:48.560> doing<00:03:48.799> that<00:03:48.980> every<00:03:49.190> day<00:03:49.310> we

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
we're always doing that every day we

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.309 
we're always doing that every day we
train<00:03:49.669> our<00:03:49.880> coaches<00:03:50.239> set<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.750> challenging

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
train our coaches set a challenging

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.210 
train our coaches set a challenging
course<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:51.799> we<00:03:51.889> have<00:03:52.549> to<00:03:52.730> figure<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.090> out<00:03:54.220> some

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
course and we have to figure it out some

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.740 
course and we have to figure it out some
guys<00:03:55.430> have<00:03:55.639> knowit<00:03:55.970> that<00:03:56.120> really<00:03:56.329> stepped<00:03:56.599> up

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
guys have knowit that really stepped up

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.539 
guys have knowit that really stepped up
I<00:03:56.959> thought<00:03:57.109> Steven<00:03:57.560> diamond<00:03:57.919> he's<00:03:58.160> scheming<00:03:58.489> a

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
I thought Steven diamond he's scheming a

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.580 
I thought Steven diamond he's scheming a
much<00:03:58.730> better<00:03:58.910> balanced<00:03:59.389> position<00:03:59.540> he's<00:04:00.410> got

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
much better balanced position he's got

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.979 
much better balanced position he's got
tremendous<00:04:00.980> upper-body<00:04:01.790> stability<00:04:02.599> which<00:04:02.810> is

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
tremendous upper-body stability which is

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.270 
tremendous upper-body stability which is
something<00:04:03.169> that<00:04:03.380> we've<00:04:03.530> been<00:04:03.680> trying<00:04:04.099> to<00:04:04.130> get

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
something that we've been trying to get

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.460 
something that we've been trying to get
him<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.549> do<00:04:04.700> for<00:04:04.910> years<00:04:05.090> it's<00:04:05.930> kind<00:04:06.169> of<00:04:06.230> funny

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
him to do for years it's kind of funny

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.849 
him to do for years it's kind of funny
