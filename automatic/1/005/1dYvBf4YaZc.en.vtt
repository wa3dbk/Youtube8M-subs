00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
box and now you got to do this a bit

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.330 
box and now you got to do this a bit
kind<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.210> 3d<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.439> imagine<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.070> ball

rather than a you know just a circle so
we'll<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:26.070> bringing<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.519> kind<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.820> line<00:00:27.060> down

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
we'll be bringing this kind of line down

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.650 
we'll be bringing this kind of line down
like<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.170> just<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.830> give<00:00:29.039> us<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
3-dimensional feel for it and let's just

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.020 
3-dimensional feel for it and let's just
kind<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.140> put<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> nose<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.890> there<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.790> give<00:00:35.940> us
