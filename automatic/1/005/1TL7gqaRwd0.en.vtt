00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.639
 the compact car with different style 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.070
 which was already good of consumption volkswagen 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.839
 anp now has a more poisoned version 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:21.720
 and believe me even more economical is the amp 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:25.050
 t is if the anc has gained a new engine 1.0 ts 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.420
 and three - cylinder is stronger and more 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.150
 but it is also the result of a 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.399
 restructuring of the engine plant of the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.920
 volkswagen in san carlos interior 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.860
 Sao paulo and of breaking he still provoked 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.110
 the release of a new version at speedy 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.010
 there is good news of the German brand that I 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.010
 I explain better now 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.600
 this story began with the announcement of 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.640
 according to the contribution made by Volkswagen 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.190
 carlos engine factory 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.030
 interior of sÃ£o paulo this in the last month 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.250
 of June 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.160
 the money used for modernization 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.920
 of the factory and the most important 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:11.060
 start-up of the first 1.0 engine 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.610
 flex of Brazil with dts technology that 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.729
 uses direct fuel injection and 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.729
 turbocharger 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.550
 Yes we speak of the engine 1.0 of three 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.760
 cylinders already known from ap 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.120
 but as engineering recalls 90% of this 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.180
 new tse version some examples 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.970
 Crankshaft pistons and connecting rods are more 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.880
 to withstand increased pressure 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.340
 The intake control is double 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.140
 of course we have the turbocharger and 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.140
 direct fuel injection system 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.920
 in practice this recipe guaranteed a 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.020
 very interesting engine combination 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.750
 small with larger model performance 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.960
 and with consumption equal to the hybrid car 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:09.300
 Brazilian labeling program . 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:13.050
 inmetro the ftse led the note to comedy of 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.550
 13.8 kilometers per liter in the city and 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.230
 16.1 kilometers per liter on the road 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.720
 with gasoline 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.380
 but for those who are attentive to the most 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.970
 economical it is very easy to achieve up to 20 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.970
 kilometers per liter on the road 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.600
 to also help in the low consumption to 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.450
 transmission differential ratio 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.670
 five-speed manual has been lengthened and 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.850
 this has further contributed to 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.790
 another strong point of the engine 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.950
 very well at low engine speeds on the road 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.510
 for example at 100 kilometers per hour 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.970
 in fifth gear 1.0 ts smooth ride 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.970
 in the range of 2,000 and 300 rpm 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.670
 but in the celebration of the party with the new engine 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.390
 volkswagen has released a special version 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.780
 limited to speed a the content base is 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.640
 the radius version but the special version is only 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.519
 offered in white 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.250
 always with ceiling in black color bands 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:27.599
 on the sides and mirrors and 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.599
 alloy wheels rim 15 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.970
 and before you ask the proposal that 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.310
 it is not exploring the sporting personality 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.970
 despite the turbo engine the visual 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.800
 provocative suspension hits 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.740
 brakes and dual system brakes 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.860
 what is going to be exalted is the 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.380
 commitment to energy efficiency 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.620
 thing that now the amp delivers with 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.320
 competence thanks to the new engine is tse 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.390
 a technology that shows the consumer 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.310
 giving to break the paradigm that 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.050
 You want a car with more performance? 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.370
 you'll pay for a larger displacement 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.209
 but at the same time you will spend more 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.400
 fuel 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.049
 this engine this technology shows that 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.430
 you can have more engine performance 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.430
 and more fuel economy 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.340
 the 1.0 ts total flex engine is now 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.850
 available in the other versions of op - 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.100
 tec to differentiate between the 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.950
 lid always comes in color 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.440
 black and takes the acronym ts this mine 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.630
 first contact with the pps was very 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.700
 positive in particular for this great 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.190
 brand bet on it really 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.800
 now has a stronger engine and a lot 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.320
 economic and look from this 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.010
 It must make a lot of difference in his favor. 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.010
 in the national market
