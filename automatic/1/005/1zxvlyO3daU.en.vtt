00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:25.189
 good morning and welcome to medicine 33 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.429
 lose the voice to have a lowering of 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.820
 voice when it is a simple ailment of 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:35.570
 season a parainfluenza symptom like 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.089
 it says and when to worry instead e 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.750
 check with your doctor 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:44.839
 let's see I 'm a teacher then a nice one 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.659
 day with a simple cold are 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.549
 left without faces it happened to everyone of 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.619
 find yourself at least once voiceless 

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:53.330
 maybe after the flu for all 

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:54.949
 lowering of voice is not always fruit 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.720
 of the season's ills 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.309
 Sometimes the problem can hide a 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.589
 larynx or vocal cords 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.509
 when it happens frequently or does not go away 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.200
 you must immediately contact the 

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:08.180
 specialist the vocal cords when we 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.340
 we talk they approach the air it passes into 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.470
 half produces a sound practically 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.110
 both the swelling if any small 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.100
 irregularities benign nodules for example 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.570
 or tumors can alter a good one 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.909
 closing the vocal cords then the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.550
 airflow is not correct and patient 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.460
 speaks badly some categories are more 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.070
 subject to these problems you accuse 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.110
 very much the voice for example and the 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.210
 teachers the singers who therefore do not 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.159
 have a good coordination for 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.409
 lamonica ie not breathe in a manner 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.330
 correct when talking and then smokers 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.159
 tomatoes are a very high category 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.360
 risk of lowering the item e 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.950
 also of tumors 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.470
 sometimes they form on the vocal cords 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.659
 of benign nodules or polyps of 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.670
 adenomas that should not be overlooked because 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.560
 in the long run they can turn into 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.540
 tumors for this is important 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.100
 diagnosis the first thing you need to do 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.600
 an inspection must always be carried out 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.340
 of the neck 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.290
 there may also be pathologies 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.869
 of the neck they can create 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.200
 the lowering of the voice then must 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.340
 use optical fibers o 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.099
 introducing them from the corporal therefore fibers 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.659
 optical origin or through the 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.959
 nose to get to view the 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.549
 this vocal cords of course 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.439
 instrumentation must be connected with 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.030
 a video recording apparatus for 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.920
 to then be able to analyze well the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.990
 movement of the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.330
 therapies go to medical therapy 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.240
 rehabilitation therapy therapy 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.230
 surgical in micro-lingo scopia that is 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.670
 introducing a tube into the oral cavity then 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.959
 using microstructures in the case 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.520
 of the car they remove is known that 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.290
 in the case of polyps the bulls are removed 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.060
 well the case of edema of the vocal cords 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.890
 the vocal cords are regularized 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.810
 in the case of less training you can 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.310
 listen to laryngeal segments 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.530
 for example the vocal cords then yes 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.209
 he can speak the same in the case of 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.600
 malignant tumors can be removed 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.680
 large portions of the larynx 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.440
 simplifying the function but 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.840
 however respecting the result from 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.730
 phonatory point of view next to 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.670
 there is medical and surgical therapies 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.739
 speech therapy is indicated in all cases in 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.069
 which there are functional and in disturbances 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.380
 cases where there are nodules in the post 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.970
 operation to prevent them from returning to the 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.180
 cases of cancer of the range when it is 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.319
 need to compensate for what is missing if 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.630
 I remove a vocal cord I must 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.160
 compensate for this by using the muscles 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.630
 contralateral and then in cases where 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.299
 tumor operations are performed 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.870
 malignant to make the patient talk again 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:37.489
 now as he speaks after the prayer he speaks 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.209
 for a long time and vehicles and it is only solved 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.209
 found difficulty
