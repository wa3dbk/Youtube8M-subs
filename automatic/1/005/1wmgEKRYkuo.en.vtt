00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.520 
used to look like that lovely white one
over<00:01:49.530> there<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.689> it's<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:51.780> rolled<00:01:52.110> over<00:01:52.259> its

rebalance<00:01:53.009> itself<00:01:53.280> there<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> when<00:01:57.270> did<00:01:57.360> that

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
rebalance itself there so when did that

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.340 
rebalance itself there so when did that
turn<00:01:57.719> over<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.079> reckon<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.530> would<00:01:59.009> assume

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.980 
let's mix it in in there for over 300
years<00:02:25.220> this<00:02:26.220> high<00:02:26.370> waters<00:02:27.030> 300<00:02:27.480> years<00:02:27.660> old<00:02:27.780> as

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
years this high waters 300 years old as

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:36.580 
years this high waters 300 years old as
well<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:34.200> lake<00:02:34.410> first<00:02:34.770> formed<00:02:35.250> back<00:02:35.490> in<00:02:35.570> 1973

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
well the lake first formed back in 1973

the<00:02:37.590> Tasman<00:02:38.040> glacier<00:02:38.070> has<00:02:38.760> retreated<00:02:38.960> seven

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
kilometers and is moving back fast it

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.690 
kilometers and is moving back fast it
grows<00:02:42.810> around<00:02:43.050> 80<00:02:43.380> meters<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.860> year<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.430> if<00:02:44.490> a

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
grows around 80 meters a year so if a

grows around 80 meters a year so if a
statement<00:02:45.120> 18<00:02:45.510> easy<00:02:45.690> here<00:02:45.990> but<00:02:46.170> since<00:02:46.380> it

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
statement 18 easy here but since it

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.200

year old what we see on top of the water

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.770 
year old what we see on top of the water
is<00:03:03.810> just<00:03:04.140> 10%<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.130> iceberg<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:06.210> other<00:03:06.330> 90%

is just 10% of the iceberg the other 90%

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.050 
is just 10% of the iceberg the other 90%
is<00:03:07.290> below<00:03:07.830> cuz<00:03:08.130> once<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.520> is<00:03:08.610> sitting<00:03:08.940> on<00:03:09.000> top

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.550 
is below cuz once it is sitting on top
and<00:03:09.360> since<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.690> water<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.170> summit<00:03:10.500> is

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560

that 10% and what happens here and also
the<00:03:16.770> wooden<00:03:16.980> line<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.250> can<00:03:17.400> see<00:03:17.550> where<00:03:17.700> the

retreat<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.030> little<00:04:55.090> what<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.330> means<00:04:56.600> is<00:04:56.840> that

retreat a little what that means is that

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.260 
retreat a little what that means is that
