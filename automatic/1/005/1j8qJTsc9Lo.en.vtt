00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.440
 We talk about cars with lots of fun 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.440
 Welcome to the Rotthaus 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.490
 hello and welcome from the 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.740
 beautiful Tuscany normally 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.200
 Guarantee for nice weather almost super 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.370
 weather but today unfortunately raining so one 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.840
 little is never so much 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.160
 that's why it blew me inside 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.900
 here where usually the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.610
 I have a press conference 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.200
 now even the collared superb 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.129
 namely the third generation in the 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.800
 June as a limousine comes on the market 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:36.540
 very briefly what the story came in 2001 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.850
 you on the market the first superb 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.130
 limousine the mother built by 2008 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.800
 In 2008 , the second generation came on 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.120
 the market in 2009 then even as a combo and 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.320
 We all know Germany is one 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.930
 Land of 750,000 vehicles ran up 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.520
 dato from the band of generation 1 and 2 and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.120
 As I said from June comes the sedan 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.890
 in the market and then follows the quasi 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.910
 third generation and it has 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.890
 truly in itself 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.600
 Attention it follows a declaration of love 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.309
 and for a good reason, the new one 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.709
 skoda superb is in my opinion 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.119
 currently the best affordable new car 

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:09.569
 I drove in recent years 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.429
 am 

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:13.530
 the new skoda superb is on again 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:15.149
 prove that the brand rightly the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.619
 registration statistics ball importer 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.990
 leading and probably continue 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.700
 Skoda will be on place 1 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.439
 octavia after shop in color 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.060
 made attractive with the fast new 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.590
 brought to market and now 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.139
 to top it all off, the skoda superb 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.700
 and without exaggeration one can do this 

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:31.770
 vehicle with higher priced brands like 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.389
 compare audi bmw mercedes benz 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.639
 not only at skoda 

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:37.529
 haptics the optics the technology is not right 

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:39.929
 also the space and above all 

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:43.289
 still the price directly from market start there 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:47.069
 it's the small 1.4 tsi with 125 ps to 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.729
 base price held fixed 24 1590 euro 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.709
 the smallest diesel costs at least 26 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.069
 1490 euro that would be the 1 6 tdi with 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:58.709
 120 ps of the currently largest diesel there 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:01.709
 are two liter tdi with 150 ps will be off 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:03.810
 28 1190 euro priced in and the 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:06.359
 most expensive skoda superb of the launches 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.550
 currently at 33,000 990 euros 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.380
 and then it has 220 ps 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.450
 two liter turbo gasoline engine under the hood 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.880
 this is then in the best case within 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.130
 from 7 seconds from 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.140
 on 100 km h the slowest manages the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.310
 still sprinting in 10.9 seconds 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.410
 but you want with such a sedan 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.980
 you have to be fast at all times 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.960
 the optional 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.850
 sporty or comfortable the 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.250
 selection option also offers the dcc 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.200
 an adaptive chassis which is now for 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.630
 First time a skoda moves in superb 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.030
 and this option i would pull the 19 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.830
 Euros are well spent on a sports program 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.050
 Do not let the curves be as long as they are not 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.540
 are too close to robbers in comfort mode 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.220
 BÃ¶gel the now slightly longer sedan 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.380
 even the bumps of the bad 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.880
 lanes italy a great way 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.840
 feeling and if I tell you now 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.310
 I here on the great 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.560
 winding roads partly 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.360
 locals have caught up with me 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.950
 but similar or the new skoda superb 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.050
 It shows up after business he has 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.370
 corners and edges and you can get up 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.230
 the first look also not full 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.730
 Everywhere there is something to discover 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.500
 There are these in the headlights 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.970
 small light guide the view and 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.680
 shadow edges stretch the limousine 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.640
 tremendous and give her this new one 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.140
 athletic touch 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.090
 the taillights are available 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.280
 new photo and still recognize 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.070
 At first glance this is a skoda 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.810
 sorry skoda tradition committed 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.240
 technically it was upgraded 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.740
 but without bowing in the price arc 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.510
 For example, there is the optional 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.520
 adaptive cruise control including traffic jam 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.350
 assistant this system is then also in 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.910
 the situation completely up to 0 km / h 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.800
 to slow down and again 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.330
 to accelerate independently on the 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.980
 Wunschschliste can of course also the 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.710
 totwinkel warner the track maintenance assistant 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.480
 the parkassistent and so on 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.000
 There is also an option for infotainment 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.770
 Android car apple cable and so on 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.390
 You can choose from the own app 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.830
 songs, for example the new route 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.540
 send in the car if that 's him 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.370
 I would like to have a small point of criticism 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.230
 I found at the front there is no 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.180
 LED headlight is personal to me 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.770
 that the light of the future but only in 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.750
 quotes 10 and headlights 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.150
 with an optional adaptive high beam 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.190
 probably wanted or has or had to 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.200
 one at some point then the expensive ones 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.670
 Group brother is not even more the water 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.270
 tapping place is in the smallest 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.120
 hut 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.940
 you did her a great long but 486 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.220
 without mirrors 186 wide and 1 46 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.440
 flat the wheelbase is two whole 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.480
 meter 84 he has the same 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.140
 wheelbase like for example a short vwt 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.640
 6 or even the upcoming vbc 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.479
 enough space felt at the front 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.160
 more space behind 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.760
 flown since my business class 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.350
 So also a domestic one 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.780
 hatch there is no larger 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.070
 Beinfreiheit now lie the sitting position 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.110
 missing after skoda superb for 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.000
 perfect mobile home reception 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.710
 There you could dance tango really much 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.780
 space provides the suitcase, space travels the 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.090
 Skoda superb his flap on properly 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.980
 your hero as well as promises 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.570
 loading volume of 6125 liters are 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.990
 disposal and works the back 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.790
 sit around we are up to 1760 liters 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.650
 the tailgate to slam the camera door 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.450
 it's easier than pressing 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.730
 which can be opened purely electrically 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.530
 or close comes to the conclusion i 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.420
 I have the best car mobile today 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.520
 the m coupe in the price list shown 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.620
 point the skoda guys then we have 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.880
 yet said little joke the place 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.410

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.450

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.860
 my own seriously meant ones 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.370
 Do not think for yourself here 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.740

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.630
 I love the skoda superb

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.230

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.910
 front back trunk and so on 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.860
 I'm always just a bit outlining 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.660

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.820
 interested as the vehicle in detail

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.720

 when it's called voice over cars and that 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.480
