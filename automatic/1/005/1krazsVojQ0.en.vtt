00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
 if you sometimes do small 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.870
 ears at home be it 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.850
 musical evenings or fuilu parties 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.010
 the game nights these times it's 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.210
 interesting enough to do 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.540
 well maybe you use your 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.400
 mac to put the movie the match or 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.360
 just to put the music but 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.340
 that said you may have noticed 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.570
 that if you do not have speakers it's 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.130
 a bit nil because the music of the mcs 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.710
 not going great shape when you put it 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.109
 at most we do not hear specifically 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.890
 all we know is pretty awkward so is 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.300
 today what we will do is 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.410
 we will unclamp the volume of the tray 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.179
 what does that mean well 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.830
 simply means that hand when 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.140
 we are at the limit we will still be able to 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.550
 increase the volume to hear well 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.040
 the sound of the match movie 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.300
 or just music so before 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.040
 to continue I imagine you'll have 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.050
 understood that actually apple but a limit 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.430
 when in fact the speakers of the MC 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.629
 allow to go even stronger 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.399
 why are they doing that's all 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.140
 simply to respect limits in 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.199
 public health, that is to say 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.789
 that it is very bad to hear sound 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.530
 very strong for the ears is enough 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.690
 bad it brings tinnitus and kind 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.160
 of problem there and I think too but 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.660
 without certainty that maybe it brings 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.430
 some problems for the components 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.290
 of the computer that are next to 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.689
 baffles it's not very good to have 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.340
 sound thoroughly since we have the docu sound 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.840
 to have waves like that very powerful 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.100
 next to two components that can 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.020
 to be quite fragile 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.729
 it's not the top and so that's why 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.770
 respect these rules in countries where 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.920
 apple sells his products his mac 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.119
 they must comply with these rules and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.509
 so that's why we have 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.130
 limitations 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.420
 to go beyond this limit we will 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.369
 use a small application that 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.450
 is called boom that you find on the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.710
 mac app store so that means when 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.479
 even that apple is not totally 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.220
 against what we will do today 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.479
 since otherwise the application would not 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.979
 not available on the mac app store 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.680
 then you see that she is paying 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.850
 but a demo version that exists that 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.960
 free that you can use 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.759
 for seven days 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.070
 so that's it if you do not want to pay 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.240
 six euros for a small application 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.790
 you can go to the version 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.990
 demo anyway the two links get 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.610
 found in the physics of video 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.560
 whether it's the full version and 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.620
 paying or the limited version but 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.000
 Free 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.740
 once you download and 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.060
 installed the little app you me 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.370
 you will find in the menu bar 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.470
 a little icon that looks like that and 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.990
 which will allow us to play with the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.120
 extra volume if you want so 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.090
 that is to say here if I increase again 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.400
 my maximum volume and well I get to that 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.710
 and here I will be able to overtake my 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.120
 maximum volume very simply 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.620
 as you see here I have a little 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.320
 sound of a friend of mine called lobby 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.210
 who did a remix of calvin harris is 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.630
 so I'm going to start this music with 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.490
 the maximum volume is perfect and I 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.710
 will gradually increase further 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.440
 volume with the boom app and you 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:39.730
 will see that the result is rather nice 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:42.270
 this part my coming is at maximum and 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.270
 I will increase 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.420
 we will leave I came now 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.230
 wants him not changed me 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.560
 I still really like a volume 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.560
 additional 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.580
 so here we really see that the 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.270
 volume changes with this slider and that's 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.550
 rather nice 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.230
 so here in this case if I had done 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.060
 express to put a little system to me 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.650
 so that the volume is not too loud 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.090
 to be heard anyway but good 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.050
 it can get really strong and for 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.420
 evenings as I told you 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.770
 it's really nice but it's not 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.900
 not everything since the boom app 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.910
 lets do other things and if 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.350
 for example I click here on the small 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.580
 arrow 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.680
 well you see what I can play 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.630
 with equalizers then what is it 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.190
 that an equalizer is a system that will 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.950
 allow you to actually for example to 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.500
 put more bass or more buses or 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.810
 put more forward voice etc and so 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.790
 here I have an equalizer list so 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.920
 as I read the treble backs that 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.180
 it is sweeter higher we have for 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.460
 different styles of music for example 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.560
 dubstep of the jazz electronics of the 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.390
 rock that kind of stuff and so it's going 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.610
 to really allow us to give a 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.350
 stuff in addition to our sense we can 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.340
 also create our own equalizer 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.740
 for those who know each other a little 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.799
 so little here is to play with the 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.140
 low and on the other side here we go 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.250
 play with treble like that what is 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.020
 nice enough too is that we can 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.640
 access to all and very equalizer 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.320
 easily by simply doing a 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.330
 right click on the poum icon 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.610
 just here here are here the 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.620
 equalizers so it's really nice 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.690
 and if I created and myself 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.000
 equalizers and will just put here to 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.830
 to separate them from those who are already there by 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.230
 default we also have a third 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.000
 features in boom that will us 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.550
 actually allow to increase the volume 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.560
 for some files only to for 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.850
 videos or music then by 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.770
 example here I have a music I can the 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.320
 slip is simply from in the 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.600
 window right here and then I'm going 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.640
 choose the volume I want for my 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.830
 basic music that will be that so the 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.840
 maximum volume of the mac is here we have the 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.370
 maximum boom volume simply 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.680
 once you have chosen it is 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.150
 can click here on amplifies and so 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.980
 skilfully priced the volume of my 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.870
 music meaning that I need to 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.729
 amplify the volume of all my mac 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.159
 so in fact it's going to allow us to 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.389
 it's just for one music 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.189
 only personally I find that 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.529
 the quality of the music becomes 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:23.169
 completely rotten i will make you 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:25.900
 listen to that so we'll go see that in 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.599
 the records here boom and here i'm going 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.879
 just make a little preview of the sound 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:33.659
 and here we hear that quality is 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:33.659
 absolutely disgusting 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:38.589
 So that's all for this little girl 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.969
 tip that I propose is that we 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:42.759
 leaves in music 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.349
 just like that for those who love it 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.069
 powerful that I have listened to you that is 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.020
 well this one 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.789
 so it was done by forgetting it's a 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.169
 remix you find to read in the 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.180
 description of the video if you like it 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.099
 for principles etc. and otherwise 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.719
 do not hesitate alexander who hinders a 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.159
 little comment or anything I 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:58.449
 tell you very soon if this kind of 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.370
 videos please do not hesitate either 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.360
 to subscribe is 100% match j 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.370
 love this match represents 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.520
 I tell you very soon hi to 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.520
 all 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.100
 last little thing or will 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.050
 may have noticed I have a little voice 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.580
 broken I really do not apologize for this 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.910
 that it must not be super nice to 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.250
 listen 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.460
 but hey I have a good reason to 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.460
 it 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.480
