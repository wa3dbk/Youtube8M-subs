00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
couple of months ago we recorded a

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.870 
couple of months ago we recorded a
similar<00:00:15.660> video<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.650> video<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.190> was

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
similar video and in that video I was

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.480 
similar video and in that video I was
showing<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.240> how<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.600> encrypt<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.920> folder

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
showing you how you can encrypt a folder

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.429 
showing you how you can encrypt a folder
so<00:00:21.000> what<00:00:21.270> would<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.020> do<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.289> have

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
so what would you have to do is you have

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.890 
so what would you have to do is you have
to<00:00:22.590> enter<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.279> password<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:24.269> gain<00:00:24.390> access<00:00:24.689> to

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
to enter in a password to gain access to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.839 
to enter in a password to gain access to
whatever's<00:00:25.410> inside<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.920> folder<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
whatever's inside that folder the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.910 
whatever's inside that folder the
downside<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.570> was<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.019> every<00:00:28.590> single

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
downside to it was that every single

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.919 
downside to it was that every single
time<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.130> wanted<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.670> add<00:00:29.880> anything<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.779> it

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
time you wanted to add anything to it

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.510 
time you wanted to add anything to it
you'd<00:00:31.230> have<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.529> go<00:00:31.650> through<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.279> whole

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you'd have to go through and this whole

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:41.000 
you'd have to go through and this whole
lengthy<00:00:32.940> process<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:39.079> reinventing<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.590> if

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
lengthy process of reinventing so if

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.680 
lengthy process of reinventing so if
you're<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> new<00:00:41.430> user<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.270> might<00:00:42.420> want<00:00:42.600> to

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
you're a new user just you might want to

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.540 
you're a new user just you might want to
rehearse<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> couple<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.829> times<00:00:44.040> maybe

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
rehearse this a couple of times maybe

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.580 
rehearse this a couple of times maybe
take<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> note<00:00:45.090> or<00:00:45.239> two<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:45.960> otherwise<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.350> think

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
take a note or two but otherwise I think

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.660 
take a note or two but otherwise I think
you're<00:00:46.680> going<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.860> find<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.129> pretty<00:00:47.160> simple

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
you're going to find it's pretty simple

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.389 
you're going to find it's pretty simple
so<00:00:47.940> how<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.539> hide<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.410> folder<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.070> Mac
