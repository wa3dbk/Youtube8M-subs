00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 so let's start immediately to do the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.450
 our video editing we import the first ones 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.820
 media project add clip 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.490
 now I go fishing from the external drive 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.740
 rather than not external 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:24.600
 I'm going to fish here are the multimedia files 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:28.230
 which is like this and tells me that 25fps 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.720
 then tell me your project not 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.739
 corresponds to the properties of the clip you 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.899
 that these profiles your profile 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.239
 your project is adapted to 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.020
 clip property is fine refresh 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.870
 profile also because it cannot be 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.600
 comfortable we can tell him no 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.510
 ok see me by double clicking i see 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.320
 where is the cursor the duration of the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.719
 clip useless things in short you see 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.539
 dragging there is this little situation 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.000
 nice of the cursor than of the cursor 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.400
 of the clip that does not move following the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.950
 mouse but hesitates here and there 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.470
 this is one of the reasons one of the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.330
 main reasons why I do 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.170
 video editing with multiple tools 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.229
 professionals usually anyway I said 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.950
 now I can scroll the clip I can 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.180
 put it in play you and ours 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.270
 we care about safety and maiori 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.720
 contact and then I can clearly 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.220
 import the other clips a little amount 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.390
 of chilli po at random 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:40.400
 here they are good well well then 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.400
 we also add this clip 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.840
 and then we put a transition between two 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.820
 clip because the scene change maybe wants 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.149
 a transition because if like not races 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.530
 you like a nice look you see a 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:58.920
 moment that flooded pleasure pleasure 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.869
 anna sono vedete there is some small 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.060
 imperfection 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.070
 but all in all it is one of the things 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.829
 best on the market 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.390
 then the fade many can do 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.130
 the mistake I am making in this 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.930
 moment 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.730
 see the problem is that we can 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.080
 put the fade 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.890
 clearly there are other names too 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.489
 unintuitive that are other effects 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:29.069
 with the video2 track video3 la 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:33.450
 fade from video 1 to video one not 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:36.180
 we can do something that remains of us 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.340
 stucco because you say how why 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.209
 yes to make us fade 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.519
 we have to bring the first clip from one 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.709
 part is the second clip on the other side 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.820
 on two separate tracks 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.750
 see what time the 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.150
 we can fade clearly 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.489
 let's say overlap them a little more or a little 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.890
 less to adjust the duration e 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.840
 the intensity of the fade you see 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:09.299
 so too pleased indeed to mention that 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.620
 have it 10 detail however we see of 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.250
 adjust this transition a little 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.340
 otherwise that video tutorial would be 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:20.880
 then we select the point where 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.920
 we want them to come and play 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.130
 fade and then clearly this 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.470
 dissolve this as yellow 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.489
 see is the duration of the fade 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:36.810
 of the duration of the transition we will 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:39.239
 we must limit to the duration of the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.090
 change of the clip we see a little 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.850
 dragging as it would come and there 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.030
 we immediately notice something quite 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.550
 disconcerting that the transition comes 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.320
 made on the contrary that is 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.610
 there is this scene scene of the track 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:59.440
 video 1 and then there is the scene of the track 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:03.020
 video 2 that just the video track two 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.680
 enter the timeline is overlapped 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.090
 overlaps the video track 1 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.180
 then there is the fade done 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.450
 but normally in the wrong order e 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.200
 then you see how to do it 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.330
 this thing we select reverse I don't 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.330
 I understood why to do the right thing 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:26.210
 I have to do reverse does not want to be one 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:31.660
 criticism but it is a question that needs to be asked 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:34.610
 at this point, here we are, perfect 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.870
 perfect now the perfect fade 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.790
 let's see it because it is one 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.460
 satisfaction pleases a festival us 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.110
 we did a bit of a poo job 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.720
 of dog 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.570
 we can also put we can also 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.020
 commit a little more and do this 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.020
 what is here 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.690
 ps is perfect water now I consider myself 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.260
 satisfied with my fade is a 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.470
 not said to be clearly there will be 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.760
 always some small lake during the 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.940
 playback 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.330
 but the exported result at least does not have 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.330
 these problems
