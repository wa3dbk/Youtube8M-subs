00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.410 
dragon breath when you think wait a
minute<00:02:09.679> this<00:02:10.039> could<00:02:10.250> be<00:02:10.340> fun<00:02:10.610> this<00:02:11.120> could<00:02:11.300> be

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
minute this could be fun this could be

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.559 
minute this could be fun this could be
like<00:02:11.660> Star<00:02:12.110> Fox<00:02:12.459> only<00:02:13.459> star<00:02:13.849> dragon

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
like Star Fox only star dragon

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.290 
like Star Fox only star dragon
I<00:02:14.599> guess<00:02:15.230> cloud<00:02:15.560> dragon<00:02:16.040> since<00:02:16.400> dragons<00:02:16.940> can't

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
I guess cloud dragon since dragons can't

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.809 
I guess cloud dragon since dragons can't
fly<00:02:17.629> in<00:02:17.690> space<00:02:17.840> point<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:19.040> could<00:02:19.790> be

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
fly in space point is this could be

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.790 
fly in space point is this could be
cloud<00:02:20.120> dragon<00:02:20.690> then<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.170> couple<00:02:21.379> minutes<00:02:21.560> later

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
cloud dragon then a couple minutes later

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.330 
cloud dragon then a couple minutes later
oh<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:23.239> know<00:02:23.330> what<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.660> is<00:02:23.690> it's<00:02:24.730> Superman<00:02:25.730> 64

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
oh you know what it is it's Superman 64

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.410 
oh you know what it is it's Superman 64
2014

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.930 

all<00:02:31.420> right<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:31.990> how<00:02:32.620> do<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.800> explain<00:02:33.070> this

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
all right so how do I explain this

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.530 
all right so how do I explain this
I<00:02:33.970> guess<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.710> is<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> collection<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.910> like

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
I guess this is a collection of like

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.370 
I guess this is a collection of like
five<00:02:38.170> games<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:39.160> one<00:02:39.370> Island<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.900> it's<00:02:41.080> so

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
five games on one Island and it's so

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.080 
five games on one Island and it's so
much<00:02:41.620> worse<00:02:41.830> than<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.220> sounds<00:02:42.550> because<00:02:42.670> almost

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
much worse than it sounds because almost

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.760 
much worse than it sounds because almost
every<00:02:43.420> goddamn<00:02:43.870> game<00:02:44.170> involves<00:02:44.590> flying

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
every goddamn game involves flying

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.890 
every goddamn game involves flying
through<00:02:45.220> rings<00:02:45.250> there's<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.940> race<00:02:46.210> where<00:02:46.870> you

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
through rings there's a race where you

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.600 
through rings there's a race where you
fly<00:02:47.230> through<00:02:47.440> rings<00:02:47.770> there's<00:02:48.220> game<00:02:48.400> we<00:02:48.520> have

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
fly through rings there's game we have

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.400 
fly through rings there's game we have
to<00:02:48.670> pick<00:02:48.910> up<00:02:49.030> sheep<00:02:49.300> but<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.930> also<00:02:50.050> have<00:02:50.290> to

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
to pick up sheep but you also have to

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
fly through rings in fact there are so

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.540 
fly through rings in fact there are so
few<00:02:52.090> differences<00:02:53.020> between<00:02:53.200> these<00:02:53.500> games<00:02:53.830> but

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
few differences between these games but

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.100 
few differences between these games but
honestly<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:55.030> can't<00:02:55.690> tell<00:02:55.840> them<00:02:56.020> apart

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
honestly I can't tell them apart

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.870 
honestly I can't tell them apart
seriously<00:02:57.100> there's<00:02:57.280> there's<00:02:57.670> shooting

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
seriously there's there's shooting

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.650 
seriously there's there's shooting
Vikings

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
Vikings

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.360 
Vikings
there's<00:02:58.900> picking<00:02:59.230> up<00:02:59.350> sheep<00:02:59.650> and<00:03:00.250> then

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
there's picking up sheep and then

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.100 
there's picking up sheep and then
there's<00:03:00.550> all<00:03:00.700> these<00:03:01.110> indistinguishable

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
there's all these indistinguishable

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.350 
there's all these indistinguishable
flight<00:03:02.380> missions<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:02.950> guess<00:03:03.310> what<00:03:03.580> they<00:03:04.180> all

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
flight missions and guess what they all

flight missions and guess what they all
involve<00:03:04.780> flying<00:03:05.170> through<00:03:05.500> rings<00:03:05.730> it's<00:03:06.730> like

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
involve flying through rings it's like

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.670 
involve flying through rings it's like
pilot<00:03:07.420> wings<00:03:07.570> evil<00:03:08.110> twin<00:03:08.550> few<00:03:09.550> wings<00:03:09.820> yeah<00:03:10.680> and
