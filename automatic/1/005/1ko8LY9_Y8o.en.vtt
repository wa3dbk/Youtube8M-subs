00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello everyone is welcome 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.040
 for a new video a new focus 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.410
 on call of duty modern warfare 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.120
 today we start weapons with the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.190
 kf5 the first submachine gun that we 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.330
 unlock and that is a very good 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.559
 submachine gun I 'll tell you all 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.389
 these features now but 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.070
 before I started I wanted to clarify 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.220
 that the damage to the door and so the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.390
 damage is in damage range and not 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.800
 linear as I had told you in 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.029
 a previous video but hey you go 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.220
 immediately understand when I'm going 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.619
 you present that then the damage the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.349
 door and you have to know that the kf5 between 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.200
 0 and 13 meters will do 33 damage in will 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.180
 22 between 13 and 21 meters and 18 damage to 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.620
 above 21 meters which has a range 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.100
 still relatively good for a 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.210
 submachine gun 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.680
 the damage is not really 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.090
 extraordinary but if you have 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.600
 noticed when you select the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.059
 submachine gun 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.649
 you have a small indication that you 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.780
 says that the first five balls will make 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.010
 more damage and this is the case they 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.870
 do more damage but it increases 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.600
 also slightly the second door 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.690
 and therefore to mount the damage to 35 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.780
 between 0 and 13 meters to 33 between 13 and 24 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.070
 m and 25 above the 24 m what is 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.359
 very very good since in the end you 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.430
 you can kill between three and four 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.020
 bullets instead of between four and six 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.290
 balls which is pretty good 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.880
 four bullets to kill at very long 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.560
 distance it's really excellent on 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.420
 this submachine gun and that's why 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.759
 you will have to benefit from the five 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.200
 first charger bullets the soul the 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.310
 more often than not then the five 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.299
 first balls it's like I like it 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.560
 say the first five balls of the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.930
 loader and not the first five 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.580
 Vaud balls burst you are 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.960
 pulling 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.729
 so it will have to reload very very 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.280
 often then the cadence of this army 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.810
 of 780 bullet per minute which is average 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.240
 for a machine gun it's okay 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.350
 remains that's still average and the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.579
 reload time that's where it's 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.869
 becomes very interesting since as 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.340
 I just told you he'll have to 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.600
 recharge very often to benefit 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.920
 the first five balls and 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.899
 happily this machine gun and that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.460
 which recharges as quickly as possible 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.040
 so I put you the five times of 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.240
 reloading on the screen and I you 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.200
 explain to what and what they 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.270
 therefore correspond the reloading 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.930
 classic to a second 55 so they 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.070
 have their load 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.000
 when you have big balls left 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.219
 chargers that you leave the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.110
 reloading do it all the way 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.149
 that there is more classic reloading 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.799
 canceled is the classic reload 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.079
 but when you cancel it ie 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.310
 that as soon as you have the charger that 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.970
 is engaged in the army you run 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.500
 or you 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.930
 you make a dash to cancel their 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.490
 loading in this case it will not last 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.070
 only one second what is really 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.510
 extremely fast then there is the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.770
 fast reload the one where you pressed 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.600
 twice on the reload key 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.470
 so that will be faster of course 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.940
 at one second 30 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.410
 you can also cancel their 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.350
 fast loading it starts to become 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.970
 a little complicated start you can 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.430
 also canceled the quick reload that 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.870
 will make you 08 seconds so it's still 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.700
 faster at this time but hey 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.200
 you swing a loader on the side 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.990
 so as to have looters so you 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.130
 use this one there last the most 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.690
 long is the empty reload it's 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.040
 this one you do not have any more ball 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.480
 in your charger that you have to re 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.959
 room and the ball after recharging 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.700
 so this one he's at a second 95 he 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.350
 is really extremely long and I will 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.760
 really advise not to cancel their 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.110
 loading when you're on 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.140
 this one especially because you spend 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.000
 of a second 95 a second that's when 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.950
 even a good is still good 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.600
 very practical does not want it's even 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.040
 maybe at 0 80 seconds I remember 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.180
 more exactly which one learns if it 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.920
 takes the quick reload or the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.970
 classic but good reload very 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.170
 fast I advise anyway 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.240
 cancel it on this weapon because you 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.680
 will not gain much time so then 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.300
 at the level of time to aim for you are 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.230
 at 0.2 second like all the 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.730
 machine guns all machine guns 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.590
 are harrah's are at 0 2 seconds for 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.450
 aim with the least 45% of the grip 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.640
 ergo as usual who will you pass 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.709
 so at 0.12 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.970
 then at the iphone you will 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.310
 10% bonus or the chats you 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.260
 will kill in one less ball 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.850
 at a certain distance for example to 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.959
 33 damage distance if you put 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.130
 a ball is hot that you 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.260
 will allow you in three balls instead 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.060
 of 4 it is always practical at the level 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.400
 time to go out and put tears 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.350
 you will go out laeremans 0 33 seconds and 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.000
 you would arrange it 11020 it's the times 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.400
 to go out and put away the fastest 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.570
 of the game almost without counting the wines of 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.430
 main weapons at least I do not count 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.390
 the secondary weapons of course but 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.830
 it's really extremely time 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.570
 fast so if you want to use 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.160
 this weapon in secondary weapons with 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.090
 with the asset that allows you to put 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.040
 two main weapons 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.840
 it's really a very, very good 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.450
 solution since you're going to take it out 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.799
 extremely quickly then as 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.000
 usually the machine guns speed of 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.080
 100% race that and nothing 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.760
 of extraordinary in all the call of 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.810
 duty that's how you see it 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.290
 gameplay age just died in my 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.169
 series by a camper watts excuse me 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.609
 I digress a little bit we will resume 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.560
 let's take a step back now their priest 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.880
 recoil beyond the caf not worry too much 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.880
 too bad so it makes me think a little 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.920
 at the back of 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.630
 of a 45 ump or something like that 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.430
 in the old call of duty it's not 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.230
 a decline that I particularly appreciate 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.660
 but it is definitely manageable 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.670
 can handle it fairly easily 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.680
 original viewers is him by cons a 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.150
 little bit annoying I find especially the 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.050
 two balls that just knew on the side 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.610
 the problem is that as soon as you 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.140
 move the viewfinder down a little 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.760
 it's all in front of you 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.590
 prevents from aiming properly and 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.420
 unfortunately for me can put a 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.460
 red dot that helps me not necessarily advised 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.140
 so well I stay with the viewfinder 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.270
 of origin anyway even if he appreciates 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.620
 not particularly good after that it's 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.940
 very very subjective 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.400
 as an opinion therefore that everyone does a 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.050
 little what he wants and then at the level 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.760
 variants and that's where it's going 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.990
 become interesting since at the level 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.930
 variants the best variants 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.150
 for the kf5 will be labrecque nec which is 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.820
 an elite that gives you +32 pace of 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.650
 shot and less precision then this one 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.300
 it's really for short maps 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.470
 reach it's great you're going to shoot 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.820
 extremely fast 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.010
 unfortunately you can not put 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.390
 of accessories on or very little 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.650
 accessories you're still going 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.910
 to be able to put laser sights or 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.640
 things like that but you 're not going through 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.940
 example power m a rgo handle or 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.990
 another quick shot or 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.490
 improved unloaders you are not going 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.810
 to be able to put all that but it remains 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.430
 still a very very good a very 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.510
 very good variant and the second that 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.860
 I can advise you who she is 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.930
 totally reverse this 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.880
 it decreases the rate of fire of 2 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.260
 for you increase the door etc 3 so 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.270
 it is the spanair who is also an elite 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.530
 and this one is really good for 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.660
 long range shots since suddenly 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.980
 you will be able to bar this reduce 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.840
 this rate of fire to be still 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.370
 to be more specific and she will you 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.780
 you increase your reach for 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.320
 to do even more damage to 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.430
 from further so that's it for this kf5 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.110
 I think we went around this 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.640
 submachine gun in the end what can I 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.960
 to say is that reload 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.630
 that's if I can give you some advice 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.740
 recharge recharge and recharge yourself 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.940
 will need to recharge all the time 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.980
 with this submachine gun and you have 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.600
 need anyway you will need 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.700
 to use the first five balls that 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.470
 are extremely powerful compared to 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.730
 remains and that's really what makes the 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.140
 very great strength of this submachine gun 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.520
 because without these first five bullets 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.420
 she is really very average 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.580
 even weak the same one so weak 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.750
 nothing even if its reach is good enough 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.690
 to say that it is true that it becomes 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.010
 still pretty weak and his five 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.570
 first balls are really going really 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.460
 help you kill your enemies 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.020
 so on this month I'll leave you there 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.550
 on it I hope you have spent a 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.930
 good video you had a good focus 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.160
 and I will like you like 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.300
 usually a good day and a 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.040
 good evening and then we will end up 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.570
 next time for the others 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.740
 focus so I'm going to chain the focus 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.300
 on the machine guns there now 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.800
 like that you'll be able to do everything 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:07:15.920
 to have ciao 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:07:15.920
