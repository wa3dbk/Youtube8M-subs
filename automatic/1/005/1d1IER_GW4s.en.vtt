00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 And, well folks, I'm from the party. 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.620
 the books and today I'm here to tell 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.809
 to share with you a super thing 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.410
 cool, I'm going back when I started 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:25.769
 law 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:27.660
 So let's go there and talk about this. 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.609
 come back a few years ago for a while 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.349
 that I was still on my feet and did not know 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.719
 that lot of printed word 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.610
 a sheet meaning at that time did not 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.800
 had no contact with the book because 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.350
 My parents never read and never talk about 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.960
 read to me the most I knew was the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.780
 But in reality she was going to 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.480
 looking at the illustrations looking at the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.500
 and I thought I understood more 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.079
 I did not understand anything 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.149
 until one day a lunch went to school 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.440
 selling a briefcase of books 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.820
 fairy tale 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.730
 I remember that I and the other children 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.680
 how they are fascinated with the way the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.750
 guy comes days stories for us and 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.150
 ethical story super common know of 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.310
 Cinderella's white Pinocchio snow but 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.990
 that day everybody went home 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.180
 begging for the parents so that they 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.430
 bought the books as if life 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.530
 depended on whether it was a case of 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.140
 death dictating I lost my parents end up 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.990
 buying and from there I started to read 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.229
 very well that the book of a hundred lactic 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.570
 ten pages half the illustration and still 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.700
 It was coming down in history for me, but I 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.619
 it was not even the law speaks 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.540
 Lasting is what makes you fat because 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.180
 that's what really matters 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.470
 and that's how I started to taste 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.380
 by reading 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.150
 He passed the age of 23 and my school 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.310
 decided that it is a project where students 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.049
 like that sort of thing, they'd kill class to 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.729
 stay in the library and the teacher will 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.470
 choose a book for each student and 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.509
 then discuss with everyone what 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.180
 I had found the book and I ended up in 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.969
 every time that this club of 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.620
 book and type of shakespeare with 16 to 9 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.870
 years old did not give 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.970
 understood nothing is more the key and would sell 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.700
 also goals of sight does not understand anything 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.170
 Until today I did not understand the lie 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.660
 games I have 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.490
 I hope that I understand, and mine. 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.990
 family came to realize this my 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.090
 interest in books and began to 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.220
 encourage more and more rather than 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.050
 videogame board game 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.540
 my birthday gift went to 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.530
 be harry potter's books that are very 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.660
 more cool, right? 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.850
 this agent to think would be much more 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.440
 difficult to do today because 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.870
 there are few parents who encourage 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.490
 reading and many that I know there we go 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.590
 Cell full of full application 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.600
 play in the child's hand and does not even care 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.070
 If that does not add something to 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.170
 her life and something that is 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.240
 happening now I think it's cool, it's cool 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.580
 who is not doing a campaign that 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.950
 encourages children to read encourage 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.990
 everybody there instead of toy 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.760
 character from the 11th of 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.520
 February the teeth of the happy mclanche 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.380
 ceron books and I think the attitude 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.480
 cool because not every child has 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.520
 chance to have the same contact I 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.680
 had with bugs at her school me 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.140
 do not have a reading club or parents do not 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.580
 They make damn sure that she has read and 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.080
 in this first contact that they can 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.570
 end up discovering that I do not know 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.130
 The half hour lost in the books is very 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.860
 cooler than staying five hours in the 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.140
 front of tv playing video game wii owners 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.239
 He sent me three participant in SAAE 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.730
 ear and hedonism sent three gifts 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.440
 to show you and show you 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.360
 I'm here in my hand 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.610
 the dan was from the book 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.830
 I do not know the first book is a 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.560
 adaptation of the book 21 leagues underwater 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.020
 of the old Julio who accompanies me knows 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.760
 I love Jules Verne, I already told you here 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.560
 in the channel I would go another complex of this 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.720
 book I found a very cool movie that did not 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.660
 chose to adapt this mother to the child 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.790
 Because it's a really cool work , it's incredible. 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.590
 It's amazing who likes movies. 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.990
 science fiction fiction 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.700
 scientist will love the books of Julius 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.220
 Verne I point the second book to me 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.380
 sent it's my bugs and the time it 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.420
 tell the story of a boy telling the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.310
 history animals he had 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.230
 third book calls inventors and 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.300
 Brazilian artists and will speak 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.580
 little about the artists' environment 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.650
 brazilians like oscar niemayer villa 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.209
 wolves and the dumont saints is well 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.220
 interesting that you can learn more 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.530
 about them in a simple way 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.299
 way and that every child 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.130
 adult can understand that people 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.560
 When you get the toast you take 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.570
 a photo you your little cousin with 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.060
