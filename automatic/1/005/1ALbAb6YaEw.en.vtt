00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
a foundation i look for something that's

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.359 
a foundation i look for something that's
really<00:00:21.720> light<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.380> really<00:00:22.710> natural<00:00:23.160> with

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
really light and really natural with

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.790 
really light and really natural with
good<00:00:24.029> coverage<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.689> doesn't<00:00:25.410> feel<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:25.650> heavy

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
good coverage but doesn't feel so heavy

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.710 
good coverage but doesn't feel so heavy
on<00:00:25.920> my<00:00:26.070> skin<00:00:26.310> I've<00:00:26.849> got<00:00:27.060> two<00:00:27.210> different<00:00:27.359> skin

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
on my skin I've got two different skin

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.800 
on my skin I've got two different skin
tones<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.349> my<00:00:28.470> cheek<00:00:28.769> color<00:00:29.330> is<00:00:30.330> different<00:00:30.539> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
tones so my cheek color is different to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.939 
tones so my cheek color is different to
my<00:00:30.900> under<00:00:31.080> eye<00:00:31.109> color<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.619> find<00:00:31.859> it

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
my under eye color and I find it

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.319 
my under eye color and I find it
difficult<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.309> match<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.700> two<00:00:32.820> up<00:00:32.910> sometimes

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
difficult to match the two up sometimes

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.330 
difficult to match the two up sometimes
when<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.899> wear<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> full<00:00:34.350> coverage<00:00:34.649> foundation<00:00:34.710> I

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
when I wear a full coverage foundation I

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.069 
when I wear a full coverage foundation I
feel<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:35.730> my<00:00:35.940> skin<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.239> can't<00:00:36.600> breathe<00:00:36.840> I

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
feel like my skin just can't breathe I

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.020 
feel like my skin just can't breathe I
do<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.739> compromise<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.219> little<00:00:38.370> bit<00:00:38.640> over

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
do have to compromise a little bit over

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.900 
do have to compromise a little bit over
coverage<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.930> am<00:00:40.829> still<00:00:41.070> searching<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
coverage I am still searching for the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.540 
coverage I am still searching for the
Holy<00:00:42.000> Grail<00:00:42.270> foundation<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.559> think<00:00:44.399> it's

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
Holy Grail foundation so I think it's

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.950 
Holy Grail foundation so I think it's
just<00:00:44.610> really<00:00:44.879> hard<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.210> find<00:00:45.450> one<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.660> ticks

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
just really hard to find one that ticks

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.580 
just really hard to find one that ticks
all<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> boxes<00:00:46.550> there's<00:00:47.550> an<00:00:47.640> applicator<00:00:48.059> I

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
all the boxes there's an applicator I

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.060 
all the boxes there's an applicator I
wasn't<00:00:49.590> expecting<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:51.260> it's<00:00:52.260> very<00:00:52.440> fluid<00:00:52.949> as

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
wasn't expecting that it's very fluid as

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.610 
wasn't expecting that it's very fluid as
well<00:00:53.870> not<00:00:54.870> sure<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.289> would<00:00:55.379> cover

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
well not sure if it would cover

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.830 
well not sure if it would cover
everything<00:00:56.010> though<00:00:56.280> yeah<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.879> has<00:00:57.149> really

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
everything though yeah it has really

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.590 
everything though yeah it has really
given<00:00:58.620> me<00:00:58.920> an<00:00:59.160> even<00:00:59.550> coverage<00:00:59.730> across<00:01:00.090> my<00:01:00.359> face

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
given me an even coverage across my face

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.420 
given me an even coverage across my face
I'm<00:01:01.140> really<00:01:01.440> surprised<00:01:01.739> with<00:01:01.890> how<00:01:02.010> natural

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
I'm really surprised with how natural

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.039 
I'm really surprised with how natural
this<00:01:02.820> looks<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.449> heard<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.719> thought<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
this looks I heard I thought that

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.990 
this looks I heard I thought that
something<00:01:04.320> with<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.250> liquidy<00:01:05.700> would<00:01:05.909> have

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
something with this liquidy would have

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.600 
something with this liquidy would have
had<00:01:06.119> much<00:01:06.390> less<00:01:06.630> coverage<00:01:06.950> feels<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:08.310> much

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
had much less coverage feels really much

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.840 
had much less coverage feels really much
more<00:01:09.570> blades<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.530> easily<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.189> well<00:01:11.430> it's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
more blades really easily as well it's

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.210 
more blades really easily as well it's
much<00:01:12.630> less<00:01:12.930> heavy<00:01:13.200> than<00:01:13.290> foundations<00:01:14.100> I've

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
much less heavy than foundations I've

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.450 
much less heavy than foundations I've
used<00:01:14.400> before<00:01:15.049> without<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.110> cakey<00:01:16.740> kind<00:01:17.400> of

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
definitely a very buildable foundation

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.920 
definitely a very buildable foundation
yeah<00:01:25.950> he's<00:01:26.280> building<00:01:26.640> easily<00:01:27.090> without<00:01:27.299> taking

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
yeah he's building easily without taking

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.020 
yeah he's building easily without taking
into<00:01:28.080> any<00:01:28.590> creases<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.189> shouldn't<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.820> there

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
into any creases that shouldn't be there

into any creases that shouldn't be there
I<00:01:30.329> was<00:01:30.689> surprised<00:01:31.049> by<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.259> texture<00:01:31.710> I've

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
I was surprised by the texture I've

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.130 
I was surprised by the texture I've
always<00:01:32.250> avoided<00:01:32.460> liquid<00:01:33.119> foundations<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
always avoided liquid foundations and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.350 
always avoided liquid foundations and
printer<00:01:34.380> don't<00:01:34.530> even<00:01:34.799> make<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.159> lot<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
printer don't even make up a lot but it

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.600 
printer don't even make up a lot but it
has<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> kind<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.200> velvety<00:01:37.680> silky<00:01:37.979> feel<00:01:38.400> about

with powdery finish it's natural it's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.910 
with powdery finish it's natural it's
lightweight<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.350> gives<00:01:43.560> me<00:01:43.620> the<00:01:43.740> perfect

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
