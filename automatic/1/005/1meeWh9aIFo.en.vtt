00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.769
 tree tomato exports in 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.500
 2003 were 570 tons per value 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.840
 more than one million dollars 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:23.510
 main destinations were netherlands 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.130
 sweden germany and france- 71 % of 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.000
 these exports comes from 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:32.870
 cundinamarca the 22 9% of Bogota district 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.750
 capital 33 percent antioquia the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.049
 2% of the huila and the rest of the valley of the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.000
 cauca in boyacá exports are 

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:42.799
 growing fact that has motivated a 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.750
 process of genetic improvement that occurs 

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:48.140
 from the laboratory with the process 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.930
 disinfection and fermentation that culminates 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.909
 in the oven after 24 hours and that is 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.280
 moved to the greenhouse where it starts 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.370
 its sowing 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.449
 when we enter the greenhouse here 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.160
 I would say marked three areas 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.310
 where our seeds are going to continue their 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.970
 process the first is the area of 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.420
 germination 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.790
 the second is the area of growth the 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.790
 third the area of capacho and dispatch 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.649
 in the germination area is the place 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.630
 where we sow the seed for 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.610
 that germinates and that's where we already 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.500
 We determine your percentage where 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.840
 we determine the quality of the seedlings 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.359
 and where we started the process 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.869
 the germination of the seeds we follow 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:50.689
 with the tray filling step the 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.869
 tray that we use for the 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.740
 type of seed is called the tray of 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.270
 germinated now of 200 alveoli 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.570
 We fill them with peat without 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:09.810
 and compact it only by moving 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.550
 so that it fills the tray the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.590
 planting develops on turbid 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.330
 Imported moistened that grinds well 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.269
 to avoid germination problems 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.190
 on the trays opening holes 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.190
 with a perforator created in the sena 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.440
 after this process the tray is covered and 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.360
 is taken to the germinating banks in 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.870
 where the seeds are covered until 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.629
 germinate 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.420
 in the case of tomato it's going to 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.060
 Stay 15 to 18 days covered with 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.180
 this black plastic what is the objective 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.890
 of this black plastic give it the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.920
 germination condition to the seed 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.790
 What is it 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.860
 high relative humidity good temperature 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.860
 and diffuse light 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.960
 when the seed has germinated and has 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:09.100
 reached a height between 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.200
 two to three centimeters goes to the 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.860
 next area which is the area of 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.860
 increase 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.710
 i 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.170
 this is the area of ​​growth here the 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.390
 plants then begin to receive 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.260
 fertilization another irrigation system that 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.280
 it is already the risk by microaspersion 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.080
 Y 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:45.620
 grow to free sun exposure up 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:50.510
 when they are 8 to 10 centimeters and 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:53.900
 a well-defined root development and 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.380
 there already started the process of enka 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.380
 past 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.680
 the last step known as hooded 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.780
 consists of taking the seedlings and 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.700
 sow them in black bags with 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.480
 holes to allow its proper 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.430
 breathing 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.530
 the bags are filled with substrate 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.870
 black earth and husk previously 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.350
 certified laboratory when and 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:22.160
 we have the bag ready then with its 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.710
 open hole so that the roots do not 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.550
 double we take the plant that has already 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.230
 grown up and that has well developed 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.830
 its roots 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:40.020
 and we put it in the bag 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:42.169
 looking that is not below or by 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.650
 under the sown surface so 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:49.320
 deep and to the plant within 60 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.990
 days will be ready for the 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.900
 boyacá farmers take it to the 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.930
 field and can make their improvement and 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.450
 can increase productivity in the 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.110
 field of exportable fruit trees 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.110
 promising 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.350
 the tree tomato is a fruit of the 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.260
 moderate caloric value is a source of 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.980
 vitamin b6 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.680
 and he is rich in iron and potassium under 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.970
 in calories and high in fiber contains 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.630
 other vitamins like b6 pyridoxine 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.370
 necessary for proper functioning 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.370
 of the nervous system 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.550
 today in this way we do find the 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.500
 different artisanal uses of totumo and 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.620
 its important social impact in 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.630
 córdoba we learned that Barranquilla is 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.670
 the capital where 60 is formed by 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.740
 hundred of the people who make in 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.300
 Colombian airlines watching over 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.050
 the security of this system of 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.090
 transport 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.039
 we got to know the experience of 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.409
 produce organic fertilizers that improve the 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.430
 production of unpolluted lands 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.040
 the environment 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.780
 and that in Boyacá the 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.910
 genetic improvement of tomato 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.870
 tree as a fundamental part in the 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:15.890
 upward export of this fruit 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.890
 we do it like this
