00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:09.969
 good in the tutorial I come to bring 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.589
 a solution to a problem that usually 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:16.780
 happen to several the problem is the 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:20.500
 following 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:23.040
 that we enter a game as we open a 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.040
 Program 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.120
 and 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.860
 what 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:37.100
 when opening in the program for example 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.100
 we open a photoshop open 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:46.550
 something that can be a bread and any 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.770
 thing but that does not say with a message that 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.290
 stopped working for example here the 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.290
 mind of an example of a game 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.519
 I hope we open it 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.230
 good here is the game and says 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:15.550
 reid and from there it stopped working more 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.210
 but it's a racing game I suppose already 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.240
 I was left without even a car and I did not play 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.290
 but what the internet like to 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.860
 explain what kind of mistakes something 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.960
 Well, it stopped working for a reason 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.130
 that stopped working is by a point of 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.979
 excel is an application 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.979
 that can be assured if the whole is not 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.740
 it's not allowed on your windows let's say 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.810
 they are not allowed now I will teach you 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.080
 how so that it does not appear to come back from 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.360
 right that usually happens in the counter 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.990
 It usually happens in the world 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.880
 It is usually in several programs 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.659
 how 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.470
 law of fact in the world that you 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:13.640
 will show an image about one is like 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.720
 I should leave the error that came to me 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.640
 two but with the very silver it is done by 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.110
 a week the darling the games of 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.350
 back but I got this error and good 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:32.380
 end with a tutorial 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:37.340
 this is the error as we say very 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.950
 there and when it's running it reaches 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.260
 the part of the account so that you do not 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.390
 we are not going to say main left 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.070
 work for reasons this is the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.910
 same 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:53.960
 ankara we have another one for example that 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:57.140
 has come out that says save a launcher 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:01.400
 has stopped working is also the reason 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.740
 we have to solve the first thing that 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.900
 we have to do to fix that 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.420
 and so that we do not make the message 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.420
 demonstrated the following first let's go to 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.360
 in the team 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.360
 we give second click on the equipment 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.360
 properties 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.520
 advanced system configuration 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.080
 we close the window of this one 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:38.830
 now we put with 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.830
 the performance puts very configuration 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.300
 once inside this is not and options 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.850
 of performance 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.530
 we go to the part that says prevention 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.459
 of data execution 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.819
 once done that as they have here 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:00.660
 the very silver of the world - the man the 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.810
 launcher h the one of kevin is the counter and 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:08.700
 the insect to work well 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:12.360
 well this usually I have many 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.019
 times because I tried tried and if 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.350
 I 'm going to take it off but 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.350
 selecting and removing 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.600
 well that I like to see how it is done for 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.600
 that you see 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:38.119
 military is very good silver once 

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:40.610
 done this we put if it is not here not 

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:43.380
 figure here we add if or if 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:47.030
 it has to be an excel point 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.030
 for that we have to go here 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.550
 we put that equipment where it should 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.980
 they should be the game game I do not 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.860
 I have the games but show one as 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:02.580
 it was called as it should thing 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.580
 add 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.030
 for once 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.800
 anything after and we put this and 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.860
 we put open once added no 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.510
 appears here and will open normally 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.500
 which they are not aggregated and are in conformity and 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.670
 It's just because they do not need 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:29.580
 its correct configuration 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.580
 already already well short added from elsewhere 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.880
 look good once added that is already 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:39.430
 put to apply to accept and well there 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.230
 they should play quietly without any 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.150
 problem is not going to come back to 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:47.590
 the whole shit messages 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:51.630
 and good 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:54.030
 I suppose this would give you help 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.840
 well this was all thank you very much 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.840
 the video returns
