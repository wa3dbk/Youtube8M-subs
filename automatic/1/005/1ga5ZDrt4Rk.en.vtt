00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
incredibly easy to evade just evade them

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.170 
incredibly easy to evade just evade them
and<00:01:56.350> then<00:01:56.470> run<00:01:56.680> up<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.190> start<00:01:57.430> smacking<00:01:58.060> on

and then run up to and start smacking on

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.770 
and then run up to and start smacking on
them<00:01:59.520> you<00:02:00.520> can<00:02:00.759> keep<00:02:01.000> your<00:02:01.150> distance<00:02:01.330> and<00:02:01.630> use

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
them you can keep your distance and use

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.850 
them you can keep your distance and use
your<00:02:01.900> cross<00:02:02.110> like<00:02:02.320> this<00:02:02.350> but<00:02:02.650> it'll<00:02:02.830> take

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
your cross like this but it'll take

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.430 
your cross like this but it'll take
forever<00:02:03.280> so<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:04.119> find<00:02:04.540> it<00:02:04.690> best<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:05.020> run<00:02:05.229> up<00:02:05.320> to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
forever so I find it best to run up to

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.630 
forever so I find it best to run up to
him<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.590> use<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:05.740> bunch<00:02:05.980> of<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.190> late<00:02:06.310> attacks

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
him and use a bunch of the late attacks

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.710 
him and use a bunch of the late attacks
on<00:02:06.820> them<00:02:06.940> when<00:02:07.030> he's<00:02:07.180> on<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:07.390> ground<00:02:07.540> like

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
on them when he's on the ground like

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.900 
on them when he's on the ground like
that<00:02:10.680> you<00:02:11.680> can<00:02:11.830> use<00:02:11.950> your<00:02:12.100> magic<00:02:12.459> here<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.790> guy

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
that you can use your magic here the guy

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.940 
that you can use your magic here the guy
do<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.120> does<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.510> lot<00:02:13.810> more<00:02:13.989> damage<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.739> not

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
do it does a lot more damage it's not

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.920 
do it does a lot more damage it's not
necessary<00:02:15.550> but<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:16.090> just<00:02:16.269> speeds<00:02:16.600> up<00:02:16.780> this

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
necessary but it just speeds up this

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.270 
necessary but it just speeds up this
process

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.550 

we<00:02:21.940> also<00:02:22.120> have<00:02:22.390> retribution<00:02:22.810> which<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.350> in<00:02:23.470> the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
we also have retribution which is in the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.949 
we also have retribution which is in the
bottom<00:02:23.980> left<00:02:24.190> corner<00:02:24.450> doing<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.569> bar<00:02:25.840> is

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
bottom left corner doing that bar is

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.430 
bottom left corner doing that bar is
full<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.380> just<00:02:26.650> unreached<00:02:27.069> unleashes<00:02:28.410> like<00:02:29.410> a

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
full it just unreached unleashes like a

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.940 
full it just unreached unleashes like a
barrage<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:30.010> attacks<00:02:31.470> it's<00:02:32.470> still<00:02:32.709> you

barrage of attacks it's still you

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.250 
barrage of attacks it's still you
controlling<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.760> but<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.390> just<00:02:34.420> increases<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
controlling it but it just increases the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.220 
controlling it but it just increases the
damage<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.709> your<00:02:35.890> attacks<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.520> speed<00:02:37.230> just

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
damage of your attacks and speed just

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.760 
damage of your attacks and speed just
buy<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.530> ton<00:02:39.690> we<00:02:40.690> don't<00:02:41.110> use<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.410> here<00:02:41.680> because

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
buy a ton we don't use it here because

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.260 
buy a ton we don't use it here because
it's<00:02:41.980> not<00:02:42.220> really<00:02:42.520> worth<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.030> really<00:02:43.180> want

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
it's not really worth it you really want

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.320 
it's not really worth it you really want
to<00:02:43.480> save<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:43.660> for<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.900> later<00:02:44.200> flights<00:02:44.500> because

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
to save it for the later flights because

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:53.850 
to save it for the later flights because
it<00:02:46.330> does<00:02:46.810> take<00:02:47.110> some<00:02:47.260> time<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.590> recharge<00:02:52.860> so

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
it does take some time to recharge so

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.410 
it does take some time to recharge so
you<00:02:53.920> don't<00:02:54.310> want<00:02:54.519> to<00:02:54.580> get<00:02:54.700> caught<00:02:54.940> without<00:02:55.060> at
