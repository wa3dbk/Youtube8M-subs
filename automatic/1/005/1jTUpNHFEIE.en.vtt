00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.680
 translated to spirou if a christmas mod 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.750
 I take it and as you can see the first thing 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.279
 what changes here is the environment of 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.470
 some biomes as you can see then now 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.140
 instead of raining here in this language what 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.600
 What it does is snow, you see, it's not like 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.950
 white is very pale the flame this that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.930
 the truth is that it did not have to be like that 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.030
 it has to be green and we are going to enter a 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.489

 brings skates that already saved obviously 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.190

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.960
 right click as the clue was made 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.730

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.940

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.720
 by can be placed in any 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.080

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.490
 there of different colors 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.020
 Star obviously I think only 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.670
 you can place to you can not also be 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.290
 place on top of the leaves of any 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.020
 Then let's decorate if the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.200
 tree on top with stars 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.070
 pretty clear and without enough with 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.070
 very much 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.890
 as if they were shining almost 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.330
 forget in the page clue what is it 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.800
 most important so let's see 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.710
 quickly on the track who activates and 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.050
 built all the way down in the basement 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.270
 let's go down come and here is how 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.550
 put for six the decoration a bit here 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.350
 we enter treated is here are the 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.910
 changes and here are the skates to a 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.140
 please skates let's get 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.060
 quickly 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.710
 you can not eat with control and here 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.890
 they are with webber they are quite realistic 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.320
 the one that you can tell me how fast 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.590
 if you 're not on the ice it's not going 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.630
 how you consume goals is not very slow but 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.540
 once you put yourself on the ice and bat 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.330
 fast, no more, very fast, I had 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.430
 the idea of placing one less ceiling 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.520
 then cover all this from the block 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.840
 all this block is worth and jump how 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.850
 would that be I think cancer is a 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.799
 Very, very, very crazy speed 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.080
 and nothing else as you can see it is 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.770
 quite a few groups of this pool was what 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.330
 than practicing in dance on ice and 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.470
 nothing to hope you like this way 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.760
 the truth is that it is very interesting 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.760
 let's remove the skates 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.909
 and this mode is already in case it was very 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.009
 easily deflated as is 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:39.319
 say by conicyt automatic action and 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.659
 then you enter the folder a lot and 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:44.180
 you put the heart point of the mod that is 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.770
 inside the winrar is worth in the folder mos 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.349
 and you have already been correctly 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:52.150
 nut and nothing else do not vote them question what 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.150
 you want luck and until next time
