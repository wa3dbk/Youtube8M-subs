00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
now I normally don't do this step

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.450 
now I normally don't do this step
because<00:00:09.570> my<00:00:09.870> lashes<00:00:10.050> curl<00:00:10.440> naturally<00:00:10.650> but<00:00:11.370> if

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
because my lashes curl naturally but if

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.950 
because my lashes curl naturally but if
your<00:00:11.580> lashes<00:00:11.910> tend<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.210> point<00:00:12.390> down<00:00:12.630> or<00:00:12.900> if

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
your lashes tend to point down or if

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.270 
your lashes tend to point down or if
they<00:00:13.050> don't<00:00:13.260> have<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> curl<00:00:13.680> you<00:00:13.890> really<00:00:14.130> do

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
they don't have a curl you really do

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.850 
they don't have a curl you really do
need<00:00:14.430> to<00:00:14.580> do<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:14.880> step<00:00:15.740> something<00:00:16.740> which

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
need to do this step something which

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.290 
need to do this step something which
makes<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.250> easier<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.580> hide<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.000> fact<00:00:18.210> that

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
makes it easier to hide the fact that

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.790 
makes it easier to hide the fact that
you're<00:00:18.480> wearing<00:00:18.600> false<00:00:18.930> lashes<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.590> apply

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
lashes as possible this hides the lash

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
bottom now the problem with these is

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.950

that<00:01:56.460> they<00:01:56.700> tend<00:01:56.970> to<00:01:57.000> be<00:01:57.119> white<00:01:57.330> at<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:57.570> bottom

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
that they tend to be white at the bottom

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.480 
that they tend to be white at the bottom
and<00:01:58.080> this<00:01:58.200> will<00:01:58.350> obviously<00:01:58.439> contrast<00:01:59.280> your

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and this will obviously contrast your

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.550 
and this will obviously contrast your
natural<00:01:59.880> lashes<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.479> will<00:02:00.630> show<00:02:00.810> up<00:02:00.990> so

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
natural lashes and it will show up so

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.139 
natural lashes and it will show up so
you<00:02:01.649> need<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.890> take<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.220> liquid<00:02:02.549> eyeliner<00:02:02.670> and

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
you need to take a liquid eyeliner and

fill<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.869> bottom<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.560> looks<00:02:04.710> a

another reason this happens is because

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.190 
another reason this happens is because
the<00:02:42.579> lash<00:02:42.760> line<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.239> false<00:02:43.450> lash<00:02:43.689> is<00:02:43.959> too

the lash line of the false lash is too

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.929 
the lash line of the false lash is too
thick<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:45.129> means<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.549> isn't<00:02:45.639> very

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
thick so it means that it isn't very

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.640 
thick so it means that it isn't very
pliable<00:02:46.150> can't<00:02:46.840> really<00:02:47.049> move<00:02:47.200> with<00:02:47.260> your<00:02:47.469> eyes

pliable can't really move with your eyes
and<00:02:47.919> this<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.040> just<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.489> sign<00:02:48.730> of<00:02:48.879> bad<00:02:49.090> false

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
and this is just the sign of bad false

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.179 
and this is just the sign of bad false
eyelashes<00:02:50.049> so<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.680> need<00:02:50.829> to<00:02:50.919> go<00:02:51.069> with

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
eyelashes so you need to go with

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:52.709 
eyelashes so you need to go with
something<00:02:51.250> which<00:02:51.609> is<00:02:51.760> quite<00:02:51.909> pliable<00:02:52.510> and

that<00:02:52.840> will<00:02:52.959> move<00:02:53.139> with<00:02:53.290> your<00:02:53.379> natural<00:02:53.500> eye

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829
