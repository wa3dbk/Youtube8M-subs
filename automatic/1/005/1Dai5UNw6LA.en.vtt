00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
are apparently also entering communities

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.310 
are apparently also entering communities
that<00:01:56.909> typically<00:01:57.270> are<00:01:57.479> not<00:01:57.630> well<00:01:57.840> served<00:01:58.049> by

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
that typically are not well served by

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.780 
that typically are not well served by
grocery<00:01:58.680> stores<00:01:58.950> why<00:01:59.399> are<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.579> choosing

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
grocery stores why are you choosing

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.810 
grocery stores why are you choosing
those<00:02:00.060> locations<00:02:00.979> well<00:02:01.979> we're<00:02:02.189> small

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
those locations well we're small

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.719 
those locations well we're small
independent<00:02:03.420> company<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.590> we<00:02:05.369> feel<00:02:05.579> there's

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
independent company and we feel there's

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.160 
independent company and we feel there's
a<00:02:05.759> lot<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.909> niches<00:02:06.149> within<00:02:06.479> his<00:02:06.719> neighborhood

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
a lot of niches within his neighborhood

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.589 
a lot of niches within his neighborhood
so<00:02:07.320> where<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.619> big<00:02:07.829> guys<00:02:08.069> may<00:02:08.910> not<00:02:09.149> want<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.450> go

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
so where the big guys may not want to go

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.020 
so where the big guys may not want to go
for<00:02:09.899> various<00:02:10.289> reasons<00:02:10.349> because<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.940> know

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
for various reasons because you know

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.760 
for various reasons because you know
it's<00:02:12.270> it's<00:02:12.540> harder<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.110> get

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
it's it's harder to get

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.680 
it's it's harder to get
land<00:02:14.220> together<00:02:14.460> assembly<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.330> within<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
land together assembly and within the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.690 
land together assembly and within the
city<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.830> it's<00:02:16.980> easier<00:02:17.280> for<00:02:17.310> them<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.550> just

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
city and it's easier for them to just

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.160 
city and it's easier for them to just
maybe<00:02:18.060> go<00:02:18.180> out<00:02:18.210> in<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.420> outskirts<00:02:19.020> and

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
maybe go out in the outskirts and

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.050 
maybe go out in the outskirts and
develop<00:02:20.010> because<00:02:20.130> there's<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.490> big<00:02:20.640> formula<00:02:20.910> in

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
develop because there's a big formula in

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.860 
develop because there's a big formula in
there<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:22.230> at<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> same<00:02:23.190> time<00:02:23.690> we<00:02:24.690> believe

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
there and at the same time we believe

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.340 
there and at the same time we believe
that<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:26.430> know<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:27.150> cities<00:02:27.450> are<00:02:27.480> where<00:02:27.600> its

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
that you know the cities are where its

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.960 
that you know the cities are where its
all<00:02:28.440> started<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:28.920> believe<00:02:29.160> someday<00:02:29.430> it's

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
all started and I believe someday it's

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.460 
all started and I believe someday it's
all<00:02:30.090> going<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.450> come<00:02:30.510> back<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.930> way<00:02:31.020> there's

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
all going to come back that way there's

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.780 
all going to come back that way there's
a<00:02:31.560> lot<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:31.800> people<00:02:32.040> within<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.400> city<00:02:32.610> that

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
a lot of people within the city that

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.510 
a lot of people within the city that
need<00:02:33.030> good<00:02:33.660> fresh<00:02:34.050> produce<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.710> meats<00:02:35.130> and

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
need good fresh produce and meats and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.880 
need good fresh produce and meats and
you<00:02:36.450> know<00:02:36.540> we<00:02:36.720> we've<00:02:37.140> kind<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.500> hit<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.680> niche

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
you know we we've kind of hit a niche

you know we we've kind of hit a niche
there<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.310> think<00:02:38.520> city<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:38.970> Philadelphia
