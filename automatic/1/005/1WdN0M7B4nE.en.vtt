Photoshop so let's start by opening up
Photoshop<00:00:12.870> here<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:14.269> then<00:00:15.269> we're<00:00:15.540> going<00:00:15.690> to

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
Photoshop here and then we're going to

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.570 
Photoshop here and then we're going to
create<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> new<00:00:16.410> file<00:00:17.779> there<00:00:19.220> I'm<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.520> do

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
create a new file there I'm going to do

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.070 
create a new file there I'm going to do
1280<00:00:21.090> by<00:00:21.300> 720<00:00:23.119> so<00:00:24.119> we're<00:00:24.210> not<00:00:24.269> doing<00:00:24.420> full<00:00:24.689> HD

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
1280 by 720 so we're not doing full HD

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.940 
1280 by 720 so we're not doing full HD
here<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.160> do<00:00:26.310> what<00:00:26.550> G<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.000> want

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:42.139 

okay<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:37.969> then<00:00:38.969> we're<00:00:39.360> going<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:40.309> I'm<00:00:41.309> going<00:00:42.059> to

okay so then we're going to I'm going to
bring<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:44.059> this<00:00:45.059> image<00:00:45.480> right<00:00:45.629> here

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.040 

and<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.600> course<00:00:54.840> by<00:00:55.050> holding<00:00:55.410> shift<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:56.040> can

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
and of course by holding shift you can

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.880 
and of course by holding shift you can
retain<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:59.840> ratio<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.990> the<00:01:01.230> picture<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
retain the ratio of the picture you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.670 
retain the ratio of the picture you
don't<00:01:02.040> hold<00:01:02.130> shift<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.610> can<00:01:02.670> do<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.720> what<00:01:04.650> I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
don't hold shift you can do that what I

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.470 
don't hold shift you can do that what I
like<00:01:04.890> call<00:01:05.100> shift<00:01:05.430> because<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.730> like<00:01:05.910> ratios<00:01:06.300> to

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
like call shift because I like ratios to

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.890 
like call shift because I like ratios to
say<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> same<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> there<00:01:08.670> I've<00:01:08.850> got<00:01:08.880> my<00:01:09.330> image

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
say the same so there I've got my image

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.969 
say the same so there I've got my image
kind<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.470> put<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.400> where<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.550> want<00:01:11.820> it

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.530 
going to create the title and the
buttons<00:01:26.009> what<00:01:26.640> will<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:26.970> buttons<00:01:27.270> are<00:01:27.420> not

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
buttons what will be buttons are not

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:37.160 
buttons what will be buttons are not
buttons<00:01:27.900> yet<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.380> help<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.460> buttons<00:01:35.660> okay<00:01:36.660> so

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
now I select off that and create the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.650 
now I select off that and create the
options<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.710> there<00:01:49.950> those<00:01:50.190> are<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:51.420> what

options so there those are and then what

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
options so there those are and then what
you<00:01:51.750> need<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.530> make<00:01:52.710> these<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.380> they<00:01:55.530> can

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
you need to do to make these so they can

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.580 
you need to do to make these so they can
be<00:01:55.770> turned<00:01:55.950> into<00:01:56.070> buttons<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:57.110> go<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.289> this

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
be turned into buttons is go like this

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.690 
be turned into buttons is go like this
layer<00:01:59.630> smart<00:02:00.630> objects<00:02:01.140> convert<00:02:01.679> to<00:02:02.369> smart

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
layer smart objects convert to smart

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.590 
layer smart objects convert to smart
object<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.590> now<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.069> a<00:02:05.100> smart<00:02:05.399> object<00:02:05.600> go

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
object and now that is a smart object go

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.540 
object and now that is a smart object go
to<00:02:06.660> this<00:02:06.869> layer<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.410> the<00:02:07.500> same<00:02:07.679> thing<00:02:13.040> same<00:02:14.040> you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
to this layer do the same thing same you

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.370 
to this layer do the same thing same you
layer<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.690> don't<00:02:15.720> need<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.050> do<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
layer you don't need to do it on the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.340 
layer you don't need to do it on the
title<00:02:16.680> though<00:02:16.800> obviously<00:02:17.040> because<00:02:18.350> title

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
title though obviously because title

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.990 
title though obviously because title
will<00:02:19.440> not<00:02:19.560> be<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.740> button<00:02:20.069> unless<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.819> want<00:02:20.970> to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
will not be a button unless you want to

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.960 
will not be a button unless you want to
travel<00:02:21.300> be<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.420> button<00:02:21.720> then<00:02:22.110> go<00:02:22.860> ahead<00:02:25.970> so

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
travel be a button then go ahead so

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.650 
travel be a button then go ahead so
there's<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:29.670> can<00:02:29.880> always<00:02:30.030> do<00:02:30.420> some

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
there's that you can always do some

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.449 
there's that you can always do some
other<00:02:30.810> cool<00:02:31.170> stuff<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.830> know<00:02:31.980> whatever<00:02:32.190> you

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
other cool stuff you know whatever you

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.030 
other cool stuff you know whatever you
do<00:02:33.000> in<00:02:33.150> Photoshop<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:33.780> can<00:02:33.959> do<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.260> this<00:02:34.410> title

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
do in Photoshop you can do to this title

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.000 
do in Photoshop you can do to this title
so<00:02:35.630> maybe<00:02:36.630> I'll<00:02:36.840> make<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.050> new<00:02:37.260> layer<00:02:37.440> here

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
so maybe I'll make a new layer here

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.610 
so maybe I'll make a new layer here
control-shift-n<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.870> shortcut<00:02:40.170> for<00:02:40.470> that

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
control-shift-n just a shortcut for that

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:50.440 
control-shift-n just a shortcut for that
by<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.800> way<00:02:41.780> which<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:43.140> use<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.470> lot<00:02:47.930> maybe<00:02:48.930> I'll

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
by the way which I use a lot maybe I'll

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.690 
by the way which I use a lot maybe I'll
add<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.510> line<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.530> goes<00:02:52.709> across<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.580> of

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
add a line that goes across and of

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.440 
add a line that goes across and of
course<00:02:53.910> just<00:02:54.750> like<00:02:55.910> aspect<00:02:56.910> ratios<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.330> can

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
course just like aspect ratios you can

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.390 
course just like aspect ratios you can
hold<00:02:57.630> shift<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.200> locks<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.860> line<00:02:59.069> to

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
hold shift and that locks the line to

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.900 
hold shift and that locks the line to
being<00:02:59.610> straight<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:01.640> your<00:03:02.640> new<00:03:02.730> different

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
being straight and your new different

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.360 
being straight and your new different
angles<00:03:03.300> but

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
angles but

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:32.760 
angles but
our<00:03:05.620> common<00:03:06.620> angles

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.770 

okay<00:03:33.770> well<00:03:34.099> I<00:03:34.400> don't<00:03:35.090> really<00:03:35.180> like<00:03:35.270> that<00:03:35.540> but

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
okay well I don't really like that but

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:44.259 
okay well I don't really like that but
let's<00:03:35.959> go<00:03:36.140> with<00:03:36.260> that<00:03:40.629> save<00:03:41.629> as<00:03:42.849> and<00:03:43.849> save<00:03:44.120> it

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
let's go with that save as and save it
