00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.630

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.910
 spoken hehehe hope you like it I am 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.530
 angeleri and here they are going to have a lot 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:22.340
 time we start with the tutorial 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.470
 I am applying the base and base of 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.670
 makeup I 'm applying myself 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.790
 base in cream of dry land very good that 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.520
 cover you do not know how much you know is 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.950
 perfect you apply with super little 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.980
 what do you have to match for 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.150
 match the skin you remove the ones from 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.600
 they close the poles sorry 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.540
 this granites or some imperfection of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.100
 have this gross and subsequently 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.720
 I applied a little concealer on the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.410
 part of the eyecup only to give 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.780
 illumination 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.670
 if I use very little correctors 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.180
 This cream because I usually 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.280
 correct with with powders like this I correct with 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.920
 dust and I still have a lot more 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.450
 sealed the makeup and then I can 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.579
 blur more 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.560
 or accentuate more depending on what I'm going to 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.450
 do if this powder that I applied in the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.759
 bottom part is so that at the moment 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.950
 who is doing the shadows or in this 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.860
 case as they are already beginning to see the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.079
 If I charge the polvito, I will not 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.479
 go to stain the makeup of the part 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.539
 from below yes because later it looks dark 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.780
 gray and you do not see father though then 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.159
 to take care of these little details this as 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.479
 good here with a little bit of dust 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.100
 translucent is loose so we start 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.619
 with eyebrows on the eyebrow I'm 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.950
 doing with only with dust with a 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.210
 shadow dark coffee yes and depending 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.640
 of the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.650
 of the hair tone or in this case of 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.970
 a wig or the effect that you want 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.700
 give let's apply the eyebrow tone if 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.909
 I dared like that a little more 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.770
 brusque plus this one 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:09.140
 eyebrow marked 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.849
 a more dramatic stronger effect 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:17.010
 apply a little pink on the part of the 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:20.540
 Bone of the nose good in the center 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.849
 of the eyes and only to blur 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.849
 the hardness of my face to give a little 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.489
 more than softness and at this moment 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.370
 We are applying brown shadow 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.830
 shadow coffee is a 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.340
 the shadow 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.990
 de mack is in brown tone and right now I'm 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.990
 applying the black tone 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.700
 the coffee shade is called express express 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:58.150
 of brand the black tone is pro-makeup 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:03:01.340
 of the black swan range and later 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.350
 continued with the outline if this 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.420
 eyeliner I loved it enough 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.630
 because you go is a brush like 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.880
 we can see and again I think more 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.920
 straight that with a liquid eyeliner 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.170
 I still find the part easier 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.630
 super super super fast and it 's 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.370
 wordpress and here we are applying a 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.770
 little bit more black in the corners 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.750
 to give a little more depth and 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.520
 intensify the tuxedo 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.200
 here what I 'm doing is applying 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:34.850
 one of the same shadows that 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.110
 Handles but palette classic makeup 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.140
 follow the tone that is like golden brown 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.870
 bronze I cited I applied it to blur 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.810
 the shades the clear and the coffee that I 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.390
 I applied so that no mark is seen 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.310
 Now here I am making the outline 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.040
 from the bottom and I always leave 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.560
 one a strip I do not know about three 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.170
 millimeters so to speak and medellin me 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.030
 out of the eye to enlarge it because 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.670
 as I do not put huge eyelashes and 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.770
 more if to make the eye big and so 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.850
 we can do that or they can do it 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.640
 the people who have the eye very 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.440
 little one is never delineated inside 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.150
 because if they put eyeliner inside 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.850
 they are not going to deepen and you are going to see the 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.440
 much smaller eye ok so what 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.650
 take into account girls and in any case 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.590
 our youngest and girls or so this that 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.940
 have little eyes like kids 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.980
 that have small eyes as I can 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.110
 make my good eye bigger by delineating 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.620
 the outside and apart applying in the 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.840
 water line white eyeliner or ivory 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.450
 so to enlarge here I am applying 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.820
 in the 10 kilos of eyelash those eyelashes 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.640
 I made them good 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.890
 not literal but I bought several tabs 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.410
 several pairs and splicing I think they are like 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.680
 three or four if you go and to give a 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:54.340
 much more intense effect on the eye the 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:58.110
 makeup is going on with the blush 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.190
 frame with a base quote some plastic 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.770
 before I did it with a 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.160
 napkin I put it linear and about that 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.380
 this to the contour if it is a contour 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.940
 a little darker our base 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.690
 natural 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.360
 to tune the cheekbones here frame the 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.310
 nose 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.699
 with a shadow also as a cinnamon type 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:24.030
 and I apply the pink blush as well as 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:27.930
 to give more sweetness the face of 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.810
 of man that we have this we continue with 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.460
 the lips 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.230
 if the lips a nude tone delineates a 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.750
 little out of my lips to give 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:43.260
 a little more than 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:45.529
 of meatiness if already the last details 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.569
 and what 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:49.819
 as you can see 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:53.899
 all the stripes that we mark all the 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:55.580
 intensity I obscure the lashes all 

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:59.389
 it fades and in the end already with the 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:02.479
 little ball already in poses and very pretty I hope 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:04.159
