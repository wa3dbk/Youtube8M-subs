 mexico a boy lays in his own 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.080
 Blood on a pickup was wearing a black one 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.250
 military boots pressure is on the face 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.730

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.560
 The presentation of corruption torture 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:37.290
 and violence against children encounters in mexico 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.210
 on violent resistance in munich is running 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.720

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.960
 He tells the story of a family 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.910
 which I have in a violent spiral device 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.280
 reached him via skype and he got us 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.870
 more about it said mexico are yes 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.730
 used to see the consequences 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.980
 the moment itself and the people who take it 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.440
 provoke that we do not perceive 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.690
 I also think it's important to say where and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.159
 how tortured and murdered is the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.500
 People who do that are not monsters 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.130
 or fantasized but real 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.810
 People 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.490
 sometimes young people are also 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.799
 kids doing that sounds like one 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.210
 exaggeration a child as a co - founder of 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.210
 torture it is like that 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:55.219
 how much of escalante personally 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:56.360
 reflected in this film the film 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.380
 also gives my view on mine 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.640
 hometown again 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.679
 I have near my city 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.799
 shot from my house to the scene 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.329
 It was only ten minutes 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.689
 the film shows how i like my city 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.689
 perceive 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.940
 after the german premiere 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.860
 spectator reactions not in such a 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.280
 Show length because it was safe five 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.020
 minutes has always seen just like his 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.940
 has been tortured cruelly 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.560
 wise and I think you have to 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.930
 do not show that I ran out 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.610
 the brutality and the reality in 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.130
 Many scenes have many scenes 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.320
 but scares the majority of the 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.800
 spectator has the movie at the end 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.800
 watched 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:06.420
 it was just one for me 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:09.460
 description currently in mexico and 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.990
 and the violence that got so stuck 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.860
 has to meet in the country 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.750
 There he liked it 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.060
 and I think I do not see it either 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.950
 really pleasant but I find you 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.960
 should know what happens so what 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:27.080
 happens with the truth 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.080
 to become 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.380
 it is understandable that the people in 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.660
 europe on these scenes of violence 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.940
 sensitive and believe it 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.830
 makes fun of showing brutality to me 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.790
 but our Mexico is 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.790
 everyday reality 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.299
 it was also a mexican in the cinema 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.900
 It is quite hard but describes 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.900
 an aspect of life mexico 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.859
 last is table third around this one 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.079
 film portrays an aspect of mexico 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.060
 but of course Mexico still belongs 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.599
 much more than just this problem came 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:14.750
 you 're even better in trotha mansory 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:16.549
 Realist if you have the problem in this 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.090
 movie there is also a love story 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:23.060
 between a 17-year-old recruit and 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.680
 a twelve-year-old schoolgirl, too 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.680
 this story ends badly 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.810
 one of the spectators at latin america 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.910
 connoisseur dieter kronzucker 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.770
 For example, about catastrophes 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.300
 or about misfortune or about war 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.590
 Reports on TV 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.960
 then you really leave that 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.210
 Realistic things out of this is one 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.820
 a pact with the audience man, so to speak 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.960
 do not want too much for him then there is 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.660
 the second category of crime film 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.310
 one suspects the audience more 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.729
 but since we also know that the match 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.840
 is played here but you can see completely 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:14.960
 clearly that it is a reflection of reality 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.690
 and the scared people they want 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:23.840
 this discomfort of this discomfort 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:26.270
 not so strange these learn 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.130
 cases on some spectators looks like that 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.050
 you can feel the emotions of the 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.560
 Director and the love for his 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.560
 fatherland
