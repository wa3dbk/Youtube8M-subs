00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
stuff about the campaign which i think

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.300

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
to do as of right now I don't think

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.000 
to do as of right now I don't think
they're<00:02:37.840> related<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.230> zombies<00:02:38.620> in<00:02:38.740> any<00:02:38.890> way

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
means dombey's are gonna play into this

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.930

dr.<00:05:14.230> selenium<00:05:14.560> teaser<00:05:14.860> storyline<00:05:15.400> I<00:05:15.430> had<00:05:15.790> no

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
dr. selenium teaser storyline I had no

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.660 
dr. selenium teaser storyline I had no
idea<00:05:16.050> but<00:05:17.050> I<00:05:17.290> do<00:05:17.380> think<00:05:17.770> it's<00:05:17.980> very<00:05:18.100> fishy<00:05:18.430> that

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
idea but I do think it's very fishy that

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.550 
idea but I do think it's very fishy that
they're<00:05:18.850> very<00:05:19.270> very<00:05:19.630> similar<00:05:19.930> and<00:05:20.140> I<00:05:20.260> wonder

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
they're very very similar and I wonder

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.470 
they're very very similar and I wonder
if<00:05:20.650> the<00:05:20.740> campaign<00:05:21.220> is<00:05:21.640> going<00:05:21.850> to<00:05:21.970> play<00:05:22.150> off<00:05:22.420> of

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
if the campaign is going to play off of

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.320 
if the campaign is going to play off of
the<00:05:23.050> zombies<00:05:23.440> storyline<00:05:23.590> previously<00:05:24.340> that's

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
the zombies storyline previously that's

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.900 
the zombies storyline previously that's
my<00:05:25.570> thought<00:05:25.780> right<00:05:26.020> now<00:05:26.050> that's<00:05:26.380> my<00:05:26.530> theory<00:05:26.910> so

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
my thought right now that's my theory so

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.340 
my thought right now that's my theory so
we'll<00:05:28.030> see<00:05:28.180> how<00:05:28.210> that<00:05:28.270> goes<00:05:28.450> but<00:05:28.930> i'm<00:05:29.110> going<00:05:29.260> to

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
we'll see how that goes but i'm going to

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.780 
we'll see how that goes but i'm going to
