00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.290 
to be going over overlook it set up a
bit<00:02:38.960> differently<00:02:39.320> it's<00:02:39.680> sort<00:02:39.830> of<00:02:39.920> like<00:02:40.010> a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
bit differently it's sort of like a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.040 
bit differently it's sort of like a
backwards<00:02:41.300> s<00:02:42.610> depending<00:02:43.610> on<00:02:43.720> which<00:02:44.720> side<00:02:44.750> you

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
backwards s depending on which side you

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.880 
backwards s depending on which side you
spot<00:02:45.320> on<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:46.390> there's<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.540> one<00:02:48.440> main<00:02:48.650> route

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
spot on and there's a one main route

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:57.520 
spot on and there's a one main route
that<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.160> like<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.490> take<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:56.120> from<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.020> start<00:02:57.290> I

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
that I like to take and from the start I

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.000 
that I like to take and from the start I
will<00:02:58.070> show<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.310> where<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:59.020> flag<00:03:00.020> is<00:03:00.050> on<00:03:00.560> your

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
will show you where the flag is on your

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.520 
will show you where the flag is on your
team<00:03:01.090> that's<00:03:02.090> right<00:03:02.360> here<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:04.459> like<00:03:04.730> to

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
team that's right here and I like to

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.220 
team that's right here and I like to

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
there you go you just capture the flag

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.539 
there you go you just capture the flag
and<00:03:42.269> you<00:03:42.540> just<00:03:42.689> run<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.019> route<00:03:43.140> again<00:03:43.549> right

the bridge run straight through the

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.559 
the bridge run straight through the
middle<00:03:50.639> right<00:03:51.629> into<00:03:51.959> their<00:03:52.139> base<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:53.569> you've

good<00:03:59.670> team<00:03:59.700> they're<00:04:00.689> going<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.989> be<00:04:01.109> able<00:04:01.200> to

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
good team they're going to be able to

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.500 
good team they're going to be able to
defend<00:04:02.329> against<00:04:03.329> this<00:04:03.599> but<00:04:04.349> it's<00:04:05.310> it's<00:04:05.700> only

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
defend against this but it's it's only

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.970 
defend against this but it's it's only
six<00:04:06.840> people<00:04:07.290> in<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.680> match<00:04:08.329> so<00:04:09.769> you're<00:04:10.769> pretty

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
six people in a match so you're pretty

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.649 
six people in a match so you're pretty
much<00:04:11.099> going<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.609> have<00:04:11.909> your<00:04:12.239> teammates

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
much going to have your teammates

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.649 
much going to have your teammates
covering<00:04:13.109> you<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.379> whole<00:04:13.560> time<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.659> someone

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.740 

I'm<00:04:26.510> a<00:04:26.660> horrible<00:04:26.900> shot<00:04:27.350> with<00:04:27.560> this<00:04:27.680> right<00:04:27.950> now

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
I'm a horrible shot with this right now

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.020 
I'm a horrible shot with this right now
and<00:04:29.750> I'm<00:04:30.500> waiting<00:04:30.800> for<00:04:30.980> their<00:04:31.280> flag<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.730> spawn

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
and I'm waiting for their flag to spawn

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.660 
and I'm waiting for their flag to spawn
in<00:04:32.210> which<00:04:32.540> you<00:04:32.690> just<00:04:32.720> did<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.520> run<00:04:34.520> upstairs

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
in which you just did I run upstairs

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.470 
in which you just did I run upstairs
grab<00:04:35.240> some<00:04:35.510> more<00:04:35.630> ammo<00:04:36.020> jump<00:04:36.920> over<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:38.240> guy

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
grab some more ammo jump over the guy

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.220

and<00:04:39.310> jump<00:04:40.310> over<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.670> bridge<00:04:40.910> run<00:04:41.570> straight

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
and jump over the bridge run straight

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.470 
and jump over the bridge run straight
through<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.740> middle<00:04:45.340> and<00:04:46.340> right<00:04:46.940> into<00:04:47.210> my

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
through the middle and right into my

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.680 
through the middle and right into my
base<00:04:47.690> capturing<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:48.470> flag<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:50.120> that<00:04:50.180> was

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
base capturing the flag and that was

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.510 
base capturing the flag and that was
over<00:04:51.430> look<00:04:52.430> for<00:04:52.730> you<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:54.650> next<00:04:54.680> map<00:04:55.100> we<00:04:55.340> have

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
over look for you the next map we have

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.410 
over look for you the next map we have
for<00:04:55.790> you<00:04:56.000> is<00:04:56.180> vigor<00:04:56.650> now<00:04:57.650> this<00:04:57.950> map<00:04:58.250> it<00:04:58.520> is<00:04:59.180> a

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
for you is vigor now this map it is a

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.640 
for you is vigor now this map it is a
multi-level<00:05:00.350> map<00:05:00.560> it's<00:05:00.890> got<00:05:02.890> two<00:05:03.890> tiers<00:05:04.220> and

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
multi-level map it's got two tiers and

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.250 
multi-level map it's got two tiers and
warp<00:05:06.650> pads<00:05:07.010> so<00:05:07.550> it's<00:05:08.450> a<00:05:08.600> bit<00:05:08.750> tricky<00:05:08.900> to<00:05:09.080> get

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
warp pads so it's a bit tricky to get

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.570 
warp pads so it's a bit tricky to get
around<00:05:09.470> this<00:05:09.620> one<00:05:09.800> if<00:05:09.920> you<00:05:10.040> don't<00:05:10.220> know<00:05:10.340> where

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
around this one if you don't know where

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.270 
around this one if you don't know where
you're<00:05:10.760> going<00:05:10.910> to<00:05:10.970> be<00:05:11.030> going<00:05:11.360> on<00:05:11.860> this<00:05:12.860> one<00:05:13.070> I

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
you're going to be going on this one I

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.480 
you're going to be going on this one I
like<00:05:13.580> to<00:05:13.730> start<00:05:13.970> off<00:05:14.920> running<00:05:15.920> straight<00:05:16.190> right
