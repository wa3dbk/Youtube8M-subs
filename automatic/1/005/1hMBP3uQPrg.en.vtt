00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.759
 games and gap team very championships 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.699
 and then the simple gf1 team 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:15.929
 ii 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.929
 that's a little polar shit the match that was the least febrile 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.109
 his victory is the same 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.710
 the good thing for the om and he takes himself for one of his important for the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.820
 trust that all cases have you been mean 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.210
 e 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.290
 to do this 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.430
 asterix on another date 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.990
 it had made better informed arrows by provence pvp fans 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.190
 the bce pays on exile 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.350
 with this budget right now 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.800
 we are about not to have touched that this problem will be a crime 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.140
 For the young 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.780
 alvarez made strong to make seizures 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.740
 I think both teams will have 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.300
 his niche currently 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.910
 even if she 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.670
 the Parisian saddler who fired the first 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.230
 we answered euros middle of the art or at least in the first twenty 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.360
 minutes 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.950
 and then that match 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.010
 e felt that he could and could also be feverish 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.050
 behind which colin we have a little supported some actions put on sale 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.160
 blow for blow 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.830
 and it is true that it has been played little by little 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.350
 an action that succeeds% and the other that should not and often it's happening 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.560
 there and so we 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.380
 the rousseau at home but maybe that's because the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.430
 match for us 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.430
 we played a match imposed something else at home 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.410
 and then yesterday and then here and over time Russia gets to do 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.220
 to doubt this team 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.580
 which was well in place 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.670
 and to get to do that 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.670
 these arrivals of stars but in the end we finally arrive 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.320
 nevertheless very very beefy him 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.930
 we made a full match I think yesterday this afternoon we expect 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.910
 see 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.050
 so we have to keep working or three years we did a good friendly match 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.340

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.650
 % and already that the graduates pete reminding what had not been private 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.650

 very important victory 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.380
 against a team 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.729
 indeed this year 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.609
 through the city 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.609
 yes but that's why not as if they had gone to see him 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.599

 we're not very good at it yet 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:27.599
 expanding 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.569

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:39.859
 house that that it's very important that proves there 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.189
 we solicit the city of defense 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.519
 I myself entered the court 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.299
 they were no less decisive 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.009

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.219
 believe 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.039
 for a team renowned for its jubilee
