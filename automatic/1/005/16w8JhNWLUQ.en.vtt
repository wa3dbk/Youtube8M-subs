gauge<00:02:21.920> not<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.819> go<00:02:22.970> gauge<00:02:23.240> here<00:02:24.190> if<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.610> was<00:02:25.760> to

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
gauge not the go gauge here if I was to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.570 
gauge not the go gauge here if I was to
use<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.270> go<00:02:26.510> gauge<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:27.020> know<00:02:27.140> for<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.650> fact<00:02:27.709> that

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
use this go gauge I know for a fact that

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.640 
use this go gauge I know for a fact that
I<00:02:28.910> would<00:02:29.450> be<00:02:29.480> cutting<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:30.170> much<00:02:31.040> deeper<00:02:32.650> chamber

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
I would be cutting a much deeper chamber

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.760 
I would be cutting a much deeper chamber
than<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:34.190> need<00:02:34.459> for<00:02:34.730> this<00:02:35.150> particular<00:02:35.510> brass<00:02:37.630> so

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
than I need for this particular brass so

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.190 
than I need for this particular brass so
what<00:02:39.770> happens<00:02:40.130> here<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.520> if<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:41.450> notice<00:02:41.660> there

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
what happens here is if you notice there

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.490 
what happens here is if you notice there
are<00:02:42.440> four<00:02:42.920> indexing<00:02:43.670> marks<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:45.050> can<00:02:45.260> use

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
are four indexing marks that you can use

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:58.860 
are four indexing marks that you can use
on<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.950> body<00:02:47.920> for<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.450> let<00:02:50.450> me<00:02:50.570> pan<00:02:51.050> in<00:02:51.320> here

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.229 

now<00:02:59.870> you<00:02:59.930> can<00:03:00.320> see<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.890> micrometer<00:03:03.970> powder<00:03:04.970> on

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
now you can see the micrometer powder on

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.830 
now you can see the micrometer powder on
there<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.720> yes<00:03:06.560> that's<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:07.070> think<00:03:07.430> the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
there and yes that's the think the

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.509 
there and yes that's the think the
twenty<00:03:08.840> is<00:03:08.959> set<00:03:09.200> on<00:03:09.380> it<00:03:09.560> but<00:03:09.920> I'm<00:03:10.040> only<00:03:10.190> doing

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
twenty is set on it but I'm only doing

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.759 
twenty is set on it but I'm only doing
this<00:03:10.640> for<00:03:10.700> marking<00:03:11.239> purposes<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.290> let's<00:03:12.590> say

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
this for marking purposes so let's say

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.710 
this for marking purposes so let's say
that's<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.730> depth<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.060> would<00:03:14.269> have<00:03:14.390> said<00:03:14.600> it

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
that's the depth you would have said it

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.539 
that's the depth you would have said it
at<00:03:14.980> again<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:17.150> shoulder<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.370> reamer<00:03:19.370> is

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
at again the shoulder of the reamer is

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.910 
at again the shoulder of the reamer is
shallower<00:03:20.480> then<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.880> shoulder<00:03:23.299> on<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.540> brass

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
shallower then the shoulder on the brass

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.380 
shallower then the shoulder on the brass
probably<00:03:24.920> about<00:03:25.130> thirty<00:03:25.610> thousands<00:03:26.209> there

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
probably about thirty thousands there

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.340 
probably about thirty thousands there
and<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:27.709> this<00:03:28.010> would<00:03:28.190> be<00:03:28.220> on<00:03:28.750> you<00:03:29.750> would<00:03:29.900> put

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
and so this would be on you would put

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.880 
and so this would be on you would put
your<00:03:31.180> micrometer<00:03:32.709> ring<00:03:34.630> collar<00:03:35.630> on<00:03:35.930> that<00:03:36.709> one

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
your micrometer ring collar on that one

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.800 
your micrometer ring collar on that one
there<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.280> go<00:03:37.760> ahead<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:38.239> would<00:03:38.390> lock<00:03:38.600> it

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
there and go ahead and you would lock it

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.780 
there and go ahead and you would lock it
down<00:03:38.989> with<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:41.600> lock<00:03:41.930> down<00:03:42.170> collar<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:43.610> would

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
down with a lock down collar that would

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.020 
down with a lock down collar that would
not<00:03:44.060> move<00:03:44.329> from<00:03:44.570> there<00:03:44.829> now<00:03:45.829> let's<00:03:46.280> say<00:03:46.489> you<00:03:46.549> go

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
not move from there now let's say you go

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.590 
not move from there now let's say you go
ahead<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:47.390> take<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:48.220> reamer<00:03:49.220> as<00:03:49.340> far<00:03:49.640> as<00:03:50.000> it

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
ahead and take that reamer as far as it

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.319 
ahead and take that reamer as far as it
goes<00:03:50.630> where<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.440> barrel<00:03:52.040> this<00:03:52.850> butts<00:03:53.180> up

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
goes where the barrel this butts up

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:54.640 
goes where the barrel this butts up
against<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.750> bearing<00:03:54.049> you<00:03:54.140> can<00:03:54.200> no<00:03:54.440> longer

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
against the bearing you can no longer

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.500 
against the bearing you can no longer
cut<00:03:55.010> at<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:55.700> point<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.120> will<00:03:56.269> clean

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
cut at that point you will clean

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.080 
cut at that point you will clean
everything<00:03:56.780> very<00:03:57.200> well<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:57.799> go<00:03:58.519> ahead<00:03:58.820> and

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
everything very well and go ahead and

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.390 
everything very well and go ahead and
use<00:03:59.120> your<00:03:59.540> brass<00:04:00.019> which<00:04:00.769> is<00:04:00.920> what<00:04:01.070> you<00:04:01.130> use<00:04:01.190> it

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
use your brass which is what you use it

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.380 
use your brass which is what you use it
for<00:04:01.519> your<00:04:01.579> go<00:04:01.790> gauge<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.630> take<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.840> measurement

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
for your go gauge to take a measurement

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.580 
for your go gauge to take a measurement
for<00:04:05.390> that<00:04:05.660> final<00:04:05.989> headspace<00:04:07.360> you'll<00:04:08.360> know

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
for that final headspace you'll know

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.530 
for that final headspace you'll know
20,000<00:04:09.590> 30,000<00:04:10.280> 40,000<00:04:11.030> at<00:04:11.180> that<00:04:11.329> time

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
20,000 30,000 40,000 at that time

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.920 
20,000 30,000 40,000 at that time
whatever<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:12.109> is<00:04:12.290> you<00:04:12.980> would<00:04:13.160> unlock<00:04:14.000> this

collar right here by turning it
counterclockwise<00:04:20.720> a<00:04:21.289> little<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:21.830> you<00:04:21.950> would

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
counterclockwise a little and you would

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.339 
counterclockwise a little and you would
back<00:04:22.400> this<00:04:22.700> ring<00:04:23.000> down<00:04:23.210> however<00:04:23.840> many

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
back this ring down however many

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.190 
back this ring down however many
thousands<00:04:25.099> you<00:04:25.640> needed

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
thousands you needed

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.350 
thousands you needed
for<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.770> depth<00:04:27.070> of<00:04:27.250> cut<00:04:27.490> for<00:04:27.760> a<00:04:27.790> finished<00:04:28.150> cut

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
for the depth of cut for a finished cut

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.470 
for the depth of cut for a finished cut
it<00:04:28.600> works<00:04:29.050> perfectly<00:04:29.910> every<00:04:30.910> single<00:04:30.940> time

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
it works perfectly every single time

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.050 
it works perfectly every single time
I've<00:04:31.690> used<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:32.200> like<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.340> said<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.580> know<00:04:33.700> that<00:04:33.850> a

I'll<00:05:04.600> show<00:05:04.900> you<00:05:04.960> what<00:05:05.230> I<00:05:05.260> mean<00:05:05.470> here<00:05:05.710> in<00:05:05.830> second

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
I'll show you what I mean here in second

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.310 
I'll show you what I mean here in second
I'll<00:05:06.250> set<00:05:06.460> it<00:05:06.490> up<00:05:06.610> on<00:05:06.790> my<00:05:06.970> lady<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:07.900> way<00:05:08.020> I<00:05:08.050> used

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
I'll set it up on my lady the way I used

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.910 
I'll set it up on my lady the way I used
to<00:05:08.440> do<00:05:08.590> it<00:05:08.910> this<00:05:09.910> is<00:05:09.970> way<00:05:10.720> more<00:05:10.750> accurate<00:05:11.200> and

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
to do it this is way more accurate and

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.160 
to do it this is way more accurate and
it<00:05:12.010> takes<00:05:12.220> all<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.490> guesswork<00:05:12.610> out<00:05:13.210> of<00:05:13.270> how

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
it takes all the guesswork out of how

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.430 
it takes all the guesswork out of how
deep<00:05:14.440> am<00:05:14.650> I<00:05:14.770> gonna<00:05:14.920> cut<00:05:15.220> that<00:05:15.400> chamber<00:05:15.880> so<00:05:16.510> one

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
deep am I gonna cut that chamber so one

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.950 
deep am I gonna cut that chamber so one
of<00:05:17.470> those<00:05:17.680> things<00:05:17.980> that<00:05:18.070> we<00:05:18.880> sometimes<00:05:19.750> took

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
of those things that we sometimes took

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.340 
of those things that we sometimes took
the<00:05:20.080> chamber<00:05:20.410> too<00:05:20.560> deep<00:05:20.800> now<00:05:21.340> we<00:05:21.400> gotta<00:05:21.730> go<00:05:21.940> and

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
the chamber too deep now we gotta go and

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.580 
the chamber too deep now we gotta go and
make<00:05:23.350> cuts<00:05:23.680> in<00:05:24.460> other<00:05:25.390> places<00:05:25.750> on<00:05:26.020> that<00:05:26.050> barrel

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
make cuts in other places on that barrel

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.440 
make cuts in other places on that barrel
to<00:05:27.070> adjust<00:05:27.460> for<00:05:27.610> that<00:05:27.670> if<00:05:27.940> you<00:05:28.030> want<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.300> look

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
to adjust for that if you want to look

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.740 
to adjust for that if you want to look
to<00:05:28.510> be<00:05:29.160> this<00:05:30.160> like<00:05:30.490> I<00:05:30.520> said<00:05:30.820> we'll<00:05:31.000> take<00:05:31.240> all

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
to be this like I said we'll take all

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.890 
to be this like I said we'll take all
the<00:05:31.810> guesswork<00:05:32.380> out<00:05:32.710> of<00:05:33.370> how<00:05:33.940> deep<00:05:34.180> to<00:05:34.210> make<00:05:34.540> my

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
the guesswork out of how deep to make my

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.080 
the guesswork out of how deep to make my
chamber<00:05:35.320> be<00:05:35.560> 2<00:05:35.740> cards<00:05:36.070> basically<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:36.700> initial

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
chamber be 2 cards basically the initial

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.030 
chamber be 2 cards basically the initial
cut<00:05:37.270> like<00:05:37.420> I<00:05:37.540> told<00:05:37.750> you<00:05:37.960> by<00:05:38.410> setting<00:05:38.800> up<00:05:38.860> the

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
cut like I told you by setting up the

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.510 
cut like I told you by setting up the
brass<00:05:39.280> a<00:05:39.960> little<00:05:40.960> further<00:05:41.170> ahead<00:05:41.440> then<00:05:42.340> the

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
brass a little further ahead then the

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.760 
brass a little further ahead then the
reamer<00:05:42.850> is<00:05:43.030> the<00:05:43.600> shoulder<00:05:43.990> on<00:05:44.080> this<00:05:44.200> brass<00:05:44.500> is

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
reamer is the shoulder on this brass is

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.140 
reamer is the shoulder on this brass is
a<00:05:44.800> head<00:05:45.040> of<00:05:45.160> the<00:05:45.250> shoulder<00:05:45.640> on<00:05:45.730> this<00:05:45.880> right

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
a head of the shoulder on this right

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.100 
a head of the shoulder on this right
here<00:05:46.300> on<00:05:46.450> the<00:05:46.570> reamer

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
here on the reamer

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.310 
here on the reamer
so<00:05:47.670> you<00:05:48.670> make<00:05:48.880> that<00:05:48.910> cut<00:05:49.330> several<00:05:50.110> cuts

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
so you make that cut several cuts

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.680 
so you make that cut several cuts
however<00:05:50.590> you<00:05:50.830> do<00:05:50.980> it<00:05:51.010> if<00:05:51.190> you've<00:05:51.310> got<00:05:51.520> a

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
however you do it if you've got a

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.080 
however you do it if you've got a
pressurized<00:05:52.740> system<00:05:53.740> flushing<00:05:54.460> system<00:05:54.640> well

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
pressurized system flushing system well

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.760 
pressurized system flushing system well
you<00:05:55.360> know<00:05:55.480> it's<00:05:55.870> only<00:05:56.050> gonna<00:05:56.200> be<00:05:56.350> one<00:05:56.560> or<00:05:56.620> two

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
you know it's only gonna be one or two

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.290 
you know it's only gonna be one or two
cutting<00:05:57.130> and<00:05:57.460> you're<00:05:57.610> gonna<00:05:57.760> be<00:05:57.910> there<00:05:58.090> if

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
cutting and you're gonna be there if

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.570 
cutting and you're gonna be there if
you've<00:05:58.810> got<00:05:59.050> the<00:05:59.230> old-style<00:05:59.560> where<00:06:00.310> you're

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
you've got the old-style where you're

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.860 
you've got the old-style where you're
constantly<00:06:00.970> taking<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:01.420> reamer<00:06:01.630> out

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
constantly taking the reamer out

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.110 
constantly taking the reamer out
cleaning<00:06:02.410> it<00:06:02.530> cleaning<00:06:02.830> the<00:06:03.160> bore<00:06:03.430> I<00:06:03.700> mean<00:06:04.030> the

chamber however as you clean it and

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.040 
chamber however as you clean it and
continue<00:06:08.140> to<00:06:08.260> cut<00:06:08.470> well<00:06:08.650> that's<00:06:08.890> your<00:06:09.400> method

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
continue to cut well that's your method

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.900 
continue to cut well that's your method
the<00:06:11.050> thing<00:06:11.260> is<00:06:11.470> that<00:06:11.680> at<00:06:11.770> the<00:06:11.890> end<00:06:12.070> once<00:06:12.670> this
