transformer<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:29.300> played<00:03:29.510> as<00:03:29.690> vortex<00:03:30.260> didn't

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
transformer I played as vortex didn't

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.190

seem to need any any major challenge but

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.199 
seem to need any any major challenge but
I<00:03:33.350> think<00:03:33.739> it's<00:03:33.860> because<00:03:34.040> when<00:03:34.850> we're<00:03:35.030> locked

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
I think it's because when we're locked

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.090 
I think it's because when we're locked
in<00:03:35.390> is<00:03:35.600> when<00:03:36.019> grimlocks<00:03:36.380> in<00:03:36.530> his<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.980> know

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
Dino state he's he's much more powerful

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.630 
Dino state he's he's much more powerful
he<00:03:41.209> can<00:03:41.239> do<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.450> lot<00:03:41.630> more<00:03:41.660> damage<00:03:42.019> so<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:43.549> know

Cybertron fall of Cybertron after the
war<00:06:13.530> of<00:06:13.740> cybertron<00:06:13.919> that's<00:06:14.460> right<00:06:14.669> so<00:06:15.060> it<00:06:15.180> is<00:06:15.300> a

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
war of cybertron that's right so it is a

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.300 
war of cybertron that's right so it is a
sequel<00:06:15.810> right<00:06:16.020> it's<00:06:16.200> definitely<00:06:16.740> a<00:06:16.770> sequel

and<00:06:17.580> as<00:06:17.970> I<00:06:18.120> said<00:06:18.180> like<00:06:18.450> it's<00:06:18.750> it<00:06:19.110> starts<00:06:19.560> in<00:06:19.770> a

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
and as I said like it's it starts in a

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.760 
and as I said like it's it starts in a
very<00:06:20.130> desperate<00:06:20.640> time<00:06:20.940> so<00:06:21.930> I<00:06:21.960> think<00:06:22.110> it's

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
very desperate time so I think it's

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.830 
very desperate time so I think it's
going<00:06:22.890> to<00:06:22.980> make<00:06:23.190> for<00:06:23.250> a<00:06:23.490> good<00:06:23.730> backdrop<00:06:24.510> that

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
going to make for a good backdrop that

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.110 
going to make for a good backdrop that
that<00:06:25.260> the<00:06:25.740> final<00:06:26.340> days<00:06:26.520> of<00:06:26.550> that<00:06:26.820> struggle

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
that the final days of that struggle

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.120 
that the final days of that struggle
between<00:06:27.630> the<00:06:27.930> Autobots<00:06:28.290> and<00:06:28.350> Decepticons<00:06:28.470> on
