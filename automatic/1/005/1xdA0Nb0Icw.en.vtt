at redstone but luckily I managed to

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.370 
at redstone but luckily I managed to
piece<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.330> bad<00:00:18.570> boy<00:00:18.779> together<00:00:18.990> there's<00:00:19.350> a

little<00:00:19.590> bit<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.770> redstone<00:00:19.949> there<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.520> I've

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
little bit of redstone there that I've

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.519 
little bit of redstone there that I've
done<00:00:20.850> there's<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.900> little<00:00:22.140> bit<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.320> redstone

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
done there's a little bit of redstone

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.080 
done there's a little bit of redstone
around<00:00:22.980> here<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.580> basically<00:00:23.850> my

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
around here it's basically my

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.269 
around here it's basically my
enchantment<00:00:24.570> room<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.619> ever<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:25.980> slightly

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
enchantment room but ever so slightly

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.269 
enchantment room but ever so slightly
altered<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.630> Toby<00:00:28.140> has<00:00:28.439> copy<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.920> paste<00:00:29.099> that

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
altered so Toby has copy and paste that

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.710 
altered so Toby has copy and paste that
this<00:00:29.490> thing<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:29.910> essentially<00:00:30.269> what<00:00:30.390> happens

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
this thing so essentially what happens

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.310 
this thing so essentially what happens
is<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.710> walk<00:00:32.669> down<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:32.969> corridor<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:34.079> step

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
is you walk down this corridor you step

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.840 
is you walk down this corridor you step
on<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> pressure<00:00:34.620> plate<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.370> get<00:00:35.489> trapped

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
on the pressure plate you get trapped

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.150 
on the pressure plate you get trapped
and<00:00:36.180> then<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> trout<00:00:36.890> essentially<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.010> what

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and then the trout essentially is what

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.900 
and then the trout essentially is what
happens

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
happens

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.200 
happens
so<00:00:39.690> Toby<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.440> just<00:00:40.980> copied<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.550> pasted<00:00:42.000> this

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
so Toby I just copied and pasted this

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.139 
so Toby I just copied and pasted this
into<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> sapling<00:00:43.680> world

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
into the sapling world

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.450 
into the sapling world
we've<00:00:45.149> been<00:00:45.329> evolved<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.989> corn<00:00:46.320> land<00:00:46.530> where

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
we've been evolved to a corn land where

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.340 
we've been evolved to a corn land where
there's<00:00:47.610> some<00:00:47.730> saplings<00:00:48.000> we've<00:00:48.809> we've<00:00:49.170> got<00:00:49.320> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
there's some saplings we've we've got a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.979 
there's some saplings we've we've got a
sign<00:00:49.649> all<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.190> way<00:00:50.309> up<00:00:50.430> there<00:00:50.820> which<00:00:51.660> says

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
sign all the way up there which says

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.930 
sign all the way up there which says

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
going to time before the sign of us has

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.040 
going to time before the sign of us has
meeting<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> little<00:00:58.980> wood<00:00:59.070> if<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.570> always<00:01:00.840> it
