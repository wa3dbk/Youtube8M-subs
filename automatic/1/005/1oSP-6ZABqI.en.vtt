00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
launch on this coaster is a lot more

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.180

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.680 
is almost a milder launch the second one
is<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:46.160> they<00:02:46.280> can<00:02:46.520> propel<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.120> up<00:02:47.210> to<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.480> top

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
is so they can propel it up to the top

you really come up out of your seat fire
chaser<00:03:29.120> Express<00:03:29.480> has<00:03:30.020> a<00:03:30.050> few<00:03:30.590> more<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:31.100> fire

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
chaser Express has a few more and fire

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.730 
chaser Express has a few more and fire
chaser<00:03:32.090> Express<00:03:32.150> also<00:03:32.630> has<00:03:32.959> a<00:03:32.990> backwards

chaser Express also has a backwards

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.380 
chaser Express also has a backwards
airtime<00:03:34.160> Hill<00:03:34.340> which<00:03:34.520> is<00:03:34.700> kind<00:03:34.940> of<00:03:35.000> cool

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
airtime Hill which is kind of cool

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.020 
airtime Hill which is kind of cool
so<00:03:35.720> for<00:03:36.050> having<00:03:36.320> more<00:03:36.590> airtime<00:03:37.160> Hills<00:03:37.430> fire

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030
