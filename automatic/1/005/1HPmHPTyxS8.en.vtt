00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.070 
the way to here you can do what I call a
quarter<00:00:26.220> turn<00:00:26.550> or<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.029> go<00:00:27.210> out<00:00:27.330> after<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.840> I'm

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
quarter turn or you go out after and I'm

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.980 
quarter turn or you go out after and I'm
gonna<00:00:28.320> call<00:00:28.529> doesn't<00:00:28.830> matter<00:00:29.660> but<00:00:30.660> anyways

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
gonna call doesn't matter but anyways

gonna call doesn't matter but anyways
what<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.260> do<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.890> do<00:00:32.040> tiny<00:00:32.340> circle<00:00:32.910> so

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
what you do is you do tiny circle so

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.880 
what you do is you do tiny circle so
like<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.100> instead<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.059> here<00:00:37.309> you<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.899> 12<00:00:39.899> all

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
like that instead of here you do 12 all

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.950 
like that instead of here you do 12 all
right<00:00:41.040> what<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.489> does<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.210> keeps<00:00:42.600> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
right what that does is it keeps it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.290 
right what that does is it keeps it
keeps<00:00:43.290> your<00:00:43.530> your<00:00:44.340> streamline<00:00:45.000> more

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
keeps your your streamline more

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.900 
keeps your your streamline more
consonant<00:00:46.020> if<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.710> go<00:00:46.860> if<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.219> go<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:47.610> this

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
consonant if you go if you go like this

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.389 
consonant if you go if you go like this
then<00:00:48.780> that's<00:00:49.230> more<00:00:49.500> water<00:00:49.770> hitting<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.370> on

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
then that's more water hitting you on

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.090 
then that's more water hitting you on
your<00:00:50.730> arms<00:00:51.210> however<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.440> go<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.770> this

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
your arms however if you go like this

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.689 
your arms however if you go like this
that's<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.030> lot<00:00:54.239> less<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.840> water<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.289> roll<00:00:55.699> and

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
that's a lot less the water can roll and

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.029 
that's a lot less the water can roll and
it<00:00:57.090> interrupts<00:00:57.660> them<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.109> interrupts<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
it interrupts them it interrupts the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.830 
it interrupts them it interrupts the
flow<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.280> water<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.760> lot<00:01:00.000> less<00:01:00.239> around<00:01:00.570> your

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
flow of water a lot less around your

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.110 
flow of water a lot less around your
body<00:01:01.020> also<00:01:01.980> what<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.250> want<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.579> sure<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.940> do

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
like like you're like you're diving a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.219 
like like you're like you're diving a
little<00:01:49.049> bit<00:01:49.140> deeper<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> water<00:01:51.229> between

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
little bit deeper on the water between

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.889 
little bit deeper on the water between
strokes<00:01:53.119> um<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.710> recommend<00:01:55.710> watching<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.460> lot<00:01:56.640> of

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
strokes um I recommend watching a lot of

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.120 
strokes um I recommend watching a lot of
underwater<00:01:58.579> cams<00:01:59.579> for<00:02:00.799> breaststroke<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.920> that

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
underwater cams for breaststroke is that

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.590 
underwater cams for breaststroke is that
