00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
and he loved it a lot but I find I guess

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:52.620 
and he loved it a lot but I find I guess
um<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:49.110> yeah<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.560> know<00:02:50.820> they<00:02:51.820> really<00:02:52.180> aren't

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
um but yeah you know they really aren't

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.770 
um but yeah you know they really aren't
the<00:02:53.020> best<00:02:53.560> toy<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.190> get<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:54.640> know<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.360> kind<00:02:55.570> of

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
the best toy to get I know the kind of

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.699 
the best toy to get I know the kind of
old<00:02:56.050> but<00:02:56.880> if<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:58.300> were<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.820> invent<00:03:00.820> a<00:03:01.000> new<00:03:01.320> one<00:03:02.320> I

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
old but if I were to invent a new one I

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.350 
old but if I were to invent a new one I
probably<00:03:03.580> do<00:03:04.239> a<00:03:04.270> better<00:03:04.750> voice<00:03:05.110> recognition

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
probably do a better voice recognition

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.360 
probably do a better voice recognition
maybe<00:03:07.360> I<00:03:07.510> could<00:03:08.140> be<00:03:08.290> able<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.590> do<00:03:08.739> flips<00:03:09.130> and

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
maybe I could be able to do flips and

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.760 
maybe I could be able to do flips and
tricks<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.970> stuff<00:03:10.320> that's<00:03:11.320> just<00:03:11.590> what<00:03:11.739> I

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
tricks and stuff that's just what I

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.640 
tricks and stuff that's just what I
personally<00:03:12.190> would<00:03:12.670> do<00:03:12.850> but<00:03:13.510> there<00:03:14.380> you<00:03:14.620> have

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
personally would do but there you have

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.190 
personally would do but there you have
it

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
it

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.770 
it
what<00:03:17.200> happened<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.709> me<00:03:17.860> was<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.630> played<00:03:19.630> with
