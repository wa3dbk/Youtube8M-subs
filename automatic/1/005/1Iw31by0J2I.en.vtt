00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
you're the locust and you're trying to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.529 
you're the locust and you're trying to
kill<00:00:56.340> them<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.789> they<00:00:56.940> were<00:00:57.000> trying<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.329> get<00:00:57.449> at

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.450 
kill them and they were trying to get at
you<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.899> mean<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> first<00:00:58.800> waves<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.280> much

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
you I mean in the first waves it's much

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.799 
you I mean in the first waves it's much
it's<00:00:59.670> really<00:00:59.879> easy<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.390> doing<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.690> by

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
it's really easy but doing it by

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.720 
it's really easy but doing it by
yourself<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.289> probably<00:01:01.680> harder<00:01:02.399> than<00:01:02.430> doing

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
yourself is probably harder than doing

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.299 
yourself is probably harder than doing
it<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:03.090> friends<00:01:03.329> or<00:01:03.629> mean<00:01:04.530> yeah<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.070> harder

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it with friends or mean yeah it's harder

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.980 
it with friends or mean yeah it's harder
than<00:01:05.369> doing<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.119> with<00:01:06.240> friends<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.810> better

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
than doing it with friends it's better

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.690 
than doing it with friends it's better
to<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.320> with<00:01:07.470> trying<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.979> say<00:01:10.460> I'm<00:01:11.460> just

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
to do it with trying to say I'm just

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.539 
to do it with trying to say I'm just
it's<00:01:12.240> confusing<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.869> um<00:01:13.220> let's<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.400> go<00:01:14.520> with

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
it's confusing but um let's just go with

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.120 
it's confusing but um let's just go with
your<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.540> locust<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.170> its<00:01:16.350> reversal

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
them in there China hold on so these

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.319 
them in there China hold on so these

first<00:01:32.149> wave<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.720> it<00:01:33.619> tells<00:01:33.799> me<00:01:33.890> how<00:01:33.950> long<00:01:34.219> you

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
first wave and it tells me how long you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.749 
first wave and it tells me how long you
can<00:01:34.369> cling<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.270> that's<00:01:35.990> where<00:01:36.560> I'm<00:01:36.770> at<00:01:36.979> 40

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
can cling so that's where I'm at 40

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.210 
can cling so that's where I'm at 40
seconds<00:01:38.689> and<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:39.200> usually<00:01:39.409> get<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.770> minute<00:01:40.039> and

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
if you kill people you'll get a time

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
enough kills I will eventually unlock

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.360 
enough kills I will eventually unlock
that<00:02:15.000> area<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.900> i<00:02:16.380> will<00:02:16.590> get<00:02:16.710> new<00:02:16.950> characters

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
that area and i will get new characters

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.920 
that area and i will get new characters
and<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.730> goes<00:02:17.850> on<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.180> on<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.570> gets<00:02:18.660> harder

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
and it goes on and on and it gets harder

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.560 
and it goes on and on and it gets harder
and<00:02:19.020> harder<00:02:19.110> as<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.470> go<00:02:19.740> but<00:02:20.400> there<00:02:21.000> are<00:02:21.180> 12

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
and harder as you go but there are 12

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.140 
and harder as you go but there are 12
waves<00:02:21.930> but<00:02:22.350> i'm<00:02:22.740> not<00:02:22.920> sure<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.160> exact<00:02:23.730> concept

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
waves but i'm not sure the exact concept

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.740 
waves but i'm not sure the exact concept
core<00:02:24.450> but<00:02:24.660> i<00:02:24.720> think<00:02:25.020> there<00:02:25.170> are<00:02:25.260> 12<00:02:25.620> waves<00:02:25.980> and

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
core but i think there are 12 waves and

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.950 
core but i think there are 12 waves and
something<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:29.310> yeah<00:02:29.850> I've<00:02:30.600> been<00:02:30.780> playing

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
know how long I've been recording it's

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.470 
know how long I've been recording it's
not<00:03:30.160> exactly<00:03:30.670> how<00:03:30.910> long<00:03:31.030> I've<00:03:31.240> been<00:03:31.270> recording

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
not exactly how long I've been recording

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.050 
not exactly how long I've been recording
because<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:32.080> have<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.320> wait<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:33.610> as<00:03:33.910> soon

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
because I have to wait and and as soon

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.060 
because I have to wait and and as soon
as<00:03:34.210> I<00:03:34.300> started<00:03:34.660> will<00:03:34.780> give<00:03:34.930> me<00:03:35.050> oh<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.290> don't

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
as I started will give me oh I don't

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.490 
as I started will give me oh I don't
know<00:03:36.250> it's<00:03:36.610> confusing<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:37.690> got<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.930> new<00:03:38.140> wave

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
know it's confusing so I got a new wave

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.200 
know it's confusing so I got a new wave
of<00:03:38.530> characters<00:03:39.460> that<00:03:39.580> I<00:03:39.640> can<00:03:39.820> use<00:03:39.850> there's<00:03:40.180> a

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
of characters that I can use there's a

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.550 
of characters that I can use there's a
Cantus<00:03:40.630> there's<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:40.930> blood<00:03:41.140> mountain<00:03:41.290> and

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
Cantus there's a blood mountain and

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.170 
Cantus there's a blood mountain and
there's<00:03:41.890> a<00:03:41.950> mauler<00:03:42.160> out<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.580> this<00:03:42.730> way<00:03:42.970> of<00:03:43.090> the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
there's a mauler out of this way of the

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.610 
there's a mauler out of this way of the
Cantus<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.840> blood<00:03:44.050> mount<00:03:44.260> they're

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
Cantus and the blood mount they're

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.680 
Cantus and the blood mount they're
probably<00:03:45.190> my<00:03:45.550> favorite<00:03:45.910> because<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:46.510> mauler

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
probably my favorite because the mauler

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.930 
probably my favorite because the mauler
just<00:03:47.020> so<00:03:47.170> slow<00:03:47.470> but<00:03:47.740> he's<00:03:47.920> very<00:03:48.010> strong<00:03:48.640> and

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
just so slow but he's very strong and

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.180 
just so slow but he's very strong and
has<00:03:49.420> a<00:03:49.450> big<00:03:49.660> shield<00:03:49.870> so<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.590> mean<00:03:50.770> that's<00:03:50.890> good

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
has a big shield so I mean that's good

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.340 
has a big shield so I mean that's good
against<00:03:51.490> in<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.180> higher<00:03:52.360> waves<00:03:52.600> as<00:03:52.930> long<00:03:53.200> as

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
against in the higher waves as long as

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.620 
against in the higher waves as long as
you<00:03:53.440> have<00:03:53.590> one<00:03:53.890> or<00:03:54.220> two<00:03:54.460> if<00:03:54.730> depending<00:03:55.210> on<00:03:55.480> how

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
you have one or two if depending on how

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.870 
you have one or two if depending on how
you<00:03:55.690> guys<00:03:55.900> play<00:03:55.960> so<00:03:56.920> I'm<00:03:57.130> just<00:03:57.340> gonna<00:03:57.460> I<00:03:57.700> did

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
not pick this guy I wanted to be the

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.810 
not pick this guy I wanted to be the
blood<00:03:59.140> mountain<00:03:59.290> but<00:03:59.620> ok<00:03:59.980> I'll<00:04:00.010> be<00:04:00.490> the<00:04:00.580> stamp

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
blood mountain but ok I'll be the stamp

blood mountain but ok I'll be the stamp
for<00:04:00.940> now<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.900> characters<00:04:05.290> play<00:04:05.470> as<00:04:05.620> normal<00:04:06.070> as

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
for now the characters play as normal as

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.980 
for now the characters play as normal as
you<00:04:06.520> can<00:04:06.640> see<00:04:06.730> their<00:04:06.880> names<00:04:07.060> are<00:04:07.240> stranded

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
you can see their names are stranded

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.750 
you can see their names are stranded
which<00:04:08.590> means<00:04:08.830> they're<00:04:08.980> stranded<00:04:09.280> here<00:04:09.640> and

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
which means they're stranded here and

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.950 
which means they're stranded here and
what<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.030> locusts<00:04:10.330> trying<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.600> take<00:04:10.690> them<00:04:10.810> out

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
what the locusts trying to take them out

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.920 
what the locusts trying to take them out
so<00:04:11.320> I<00:04:11.350> mean<00:04:11.530> it's<00:04:11.710> kind<00:04:11.890> of<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:12.010> cool<00:04:12.220> story<00:04:12.930> face

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.230 
don't worry going we're gonna suck oh oh
oh<00:05:15.850> what<00:05:16.120> no<00:05:16.510> no<00:05:16.840> no<00:05:17.170> no<00:05:17.650> over<00:05:17.860> Toulouse<00:05:18.240> I'll

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
oh what no no no no over Toulouse I'll

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.790 
oh what no no no no over Toulouse I'll
get<00:05:19.480> him<00:05:20.130> some<00:05:21.130> okay<00:05:22.060> well<00:05:22.440> whatever<00:05:23.440> it's

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
get him some okay well whatever it's

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.350 
get him some okay well whatever it's
much<00:05:24.130> harder<00:05:24.310> doing<00:05:24.610> it<00:05:24.700> on<00:05:24.790> your<00:05:24.820> own<00:05:24.970> so<00:05:25.210> it's

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
much harder doing it on your own so it's

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.910 
much harder doing it on your own so it's
probably<00:05:25.540> better<00:05:25.960> if<00:05:26.050> you<00:05:26.230> do<00:05:26.380> it<00:05:26.410> on<00:05:26.680> your<00:05:26.710> own

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
probably better if you do it on your own

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.260 
probably better if you do it on your own
because<00:05:27.160> if<00:05:27.340> you<00:05:27.430> want<00:05:27.610> to<00:05:27.700> challenge<00:05:27.910> then

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
because if you want to challenge then

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.830 
because if you want to challenge then
that's<00:05:28.420> how<00:05:28.570> it<00:05:28.690> goes<00:05:28.870> but<00:05:29.260> um<00:05:30.630> as<00:05:31.630> you<00:05:31.690> could

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
that's how it goes but um as you could

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.040 
that's how it goes but um as you could
say<00:05:31.960> I<00:05:31.990> tried<00:05:32.380> my<00:05:32.500> best<00:05:32.530> no<00:05:33.310> not<00:05:33.670> really<00:05:33.850> but<00:05:34.690> I

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
say I tried my best no not really but I

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.820 
say I tried my best no not really but I
did<00:05:35.620> what<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.220> could<00:05:36.430> and<00:05:37.080> so<00:05:38.080> this<00:05:38.440> was<00:05:38.680> pretty

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
did what I could and so this was pretty

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.290 
did what I could and so this was pretty
much<00:05:38.950> beast<00:05:39.220> mode<00:05:39.400> beast<00:05:39.430> mode<00:05:39.670> is<00:05:39.910> just<00:05:40.150> an
