00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
everything I've done everything like

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.109 
everything I've done everything like
that<00:01:34.530> why'd<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.220> would<00:01:35.549> normally<00:01:35.700> deal<00:01:36.090> with

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that why'd you would normally deal with

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.420 
that why'd you would normally deal with
with<00:01:36.509> new<00:01:36.810> cubes<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.680> I've<00:01:37.740> done<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.009> and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
with new cubes and I've done that and

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.700 
with new cubes and I've done that and
the<00:01:38.909> tension<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.930> think<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> perfect

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the tension I think this is the perfect

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.160 
the tension I think this is the perfect
tension<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.509> thinking<00:01:42.840> get

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
tension for it and I don't thinking get

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.679 
tension for it and I don't thinking get
any<00:01:43.320> better<00:01:43.590> cuz<00:01:44.399> i<00:01:44.729> did<00:01:45.090> tighten<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.509> quite<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
any better cuz i did tighten it quite a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.080 
any better cuz i did tighten it quite a
bit<00:01:45.780> because<00:01:46.049> when<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.470> tighten<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.040> when<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.790> did

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
bit because when I tighten it when I did

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.730 
bit because when I tighten it when I did
tighten<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.479> still<00:01:48.750> fell<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.110> loose<00:01:49.409> side

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
tighten that still fell but loose side

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.580 
tighten that still fell but loose side
tighten<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.310> more<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.000> yet<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.079> attorneys

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
tighten it more and yet the attorneys

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.889 
tighten it more and yet the attorneys
use<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.250> same<00:01:53.520> flimsy<00:01:54.119> kind<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.450> feel<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.689> it

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
use the same flimsy kind of feel to it

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.550 
use the same flimsy kind of feel to it
and<00:01:55.170> yeah<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.130> corner-cutting<00:01:57.290> as<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.409> can

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
and yeah so corner-cutting as you can

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.889 
and yeah so corner-cutting as you can
see<00:01:58.740> my<00:01:58.890> tension<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.369> about<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.240> it

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
see my tension is about that and it

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.230 
see my tension is about that and it
still<00:02:01.140> feels<00:02:01.380> really<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:02.009> quick<00:02:02.369> it's

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
still feels really really quick it's

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.850 
still feels really really quick it's
quite<00:02:03.450> tight<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:04.020> tell<00:02:04.259> compare<00:02:04.680> this

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
quite tight you can tell compare this

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.789 
quite tight you can tell compare this
one<00:02:05.070> which<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:05.909> about<00:02:06.299> right<00:02:06.509> as<00:02:06.659> well<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
one which is about right as well and

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.609 
one which is about right as well and
yeah<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:09.360> corner<00:02:09.629> cutting<00:02:09.840> doesn't<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:10.590> not

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
yeah the corner cutting doesn't it's not

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.260 
yeah the corner cutting doesn't it's not
that<00:02:10.890> great<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.370> really<00:02:11.849> really<00:02:12.060> bad<00:02:12.209> this

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
that great it's really really bad this

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.200 
that great it's really really bad this
is<00:02:12.540> a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
is a

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.090 
is a
not<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.510> great<00:02:13.750> upgrade<00:02:14.170> from<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.470> thing<00:02:14.680> it

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
not that great upgrade from the thing it

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.890 
not that great upgrade from the thing it
should<00:02:15.280> be<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.400> better<00:02:15.700> or<00:02:16.000> stays<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.720> same

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
should be a better or stays the same

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.230 
should be a better or stays the same
retain<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.350> same<00:02:17.530> color<00:02:17.770> coding<00:02:18.100> ability<00:02:18.670> as

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
retain the same color coding ability as

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.740 
retain the same color coding ability as
the<00:02:19.420> v1<00:02:19.840> which<00:02:20.020> this<00:02:20.230> one<00:02:20.410> is<00:02:20.530> amazing<00:02:21.750> this

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
the v1 which this one is amazing this

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.840 
the v1 which this one is amazing this
one<00:02:22.960> it<00:02:23.110> just<00:02:23.140> doesn't<00:02:23.710> cut<00:02:23.890> well<00:02:24.130> it<00:02:24.460> doesn't

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
one it just doesn't cut well it doesn't

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.820 
one it just doesn't cut well it doesn't
cut<00:02:24.970> there<00:02:25.210> but<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.570> v1<00:02:25.870> does<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.350> cut<00:02:26.620> some<00:02:26.740> up

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
cut there but the v1 does it cut some up

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.100 
cut there but the v1 does it cut some up
there<00:02:26.860> that's<00:02:27.310> about<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.540> also<00:02:28.780> have

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
there that's about it and you also have

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.690 
there that's about it and you also have
to<00:02:29.170> force<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.620> through<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:29.890> without<00:02:30.220> forcing

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
to force it through it without forcing

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.690 
to force it through it without forcing
it<00:02:30.880> probably<00:02:31.120> cuts<00:02:31.270> about<00:02:31.450> there<00:02:32.430> if<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.580> want

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
it probably cuts about there if you want

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.250 
it probably cuts about there if you want
to<00:02:33.790> force<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.090> there<00:02:34.240> yet<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.600> really<00:02:34.930> faucet

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
to force it there yet the really faucet

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.390 
to force it there yet the really faucet
redress<00:02:35.590> doesn't<00:02:36.070> reverse<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:39.040> corner

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
redress doesn't reverse so corner

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.310 
redress doesn't reverse so corner
cutting<00:02:39.610> is<00:02:39.880> not<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.540> it's<00:02:40.810> not<00:02:40.990> improve

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
cutting is not that and it's not improve

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.800 
cutting is not that and it's not improve
it<00:02:41.500> or<00:02:41.530> it's<00:02:41.860> still<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.330> snow<00:02:43.330> it's<00:02:43.540> not<00:02:43.690> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
it or it's still the snow it's not the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.540 
it or it's still the snow it's not the
same<00:02:43.990> I<00:02:44.140> mean<00:02:44.320> it's<00:02:44.440> not<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.130> great<00:02:45.160> the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
same I mean it's not that great the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.450 
same I mean it's not that great the
corner<00:02:45.820> cuttings<00:02:46.090> been<00:02:46.770> was<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.920> word<00:02:48.100> I

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
corner cuttings been was the word I

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.160 
corner cuttings been was the word I
don't<00:02:49.270> know<00:02:49.360> what<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.570> word<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:49.750> but<00:02:49.900> it's

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
don't know what the word is but it's

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.410 
don't know what the word is but it's
been<00:02:50.320> dropped<00:02:50.590> down<00:02:50.650> like<00:02:51.130> it's<00:02:51.850> been<00:02:52.000> graded

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
been dropped down like it's been graded

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.970 
been dropped down like it's been graded
down<00:02:52.630> from<00:02:52.840> this<00:02:52.990> this<00:02:53.230> one<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:53.800> much

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
down from this this one is so much

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.010 
down from this this one is so much
better<00:02:54.160> corner<00:02:54.550> cutting<00:02:54.760> this<00:02:55.000> one<00:02:55.180> lockups

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
better corner cutting this one lockups

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.670 
better corner cutting this one lockups
yes<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.740> does<00:02:57.700> occur<00:02:58.030> lockups<00:02:58.480> I'm<00:02:59.350> trying<00:02:59.560> to

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
yes I does occur lockups I'm trying to

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.110 
yes I does occur lockups I'm trying to
get<00:02:59.770> this<00:02:59.830> I'm<00:03:00.310> trying<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.640> get<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.850> perfect

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
get this I'm trying to get the perfect

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.960 
get this I'm trying to get the perfect
tension<00:03:01.600> with<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.990> doesn't<00:03:02.560> is<00:03:03.490> still<00:03:03.820> King

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
tension with it doesn't is still King

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.540 
tension with it doesn't is still King
corner<00:03:04.270> cut<00:03:04.480> in<00:03:04.630> still<00:03:05.290> pretty<00:03:05.860> good<00:03:06.070> but<00:03:06.340> I

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
corner cut in still pretty good but I

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.040 
corner cut in still pretty good but I
think<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:06.970> is<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.150> best<00:03:07.510> tension<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.020> can

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
think this is the best tension you can

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.440 
think this is the best tension you can
get<00:03:08.380> because<00:03:08.830> this<00:03:09.130> cube<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.670> just<00:03:09.940> not<00:03:10.300> that

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
get because this cube is just not that

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.020 
get because this cube is just not that
great<00:03:10.920> lockups<00:03:11.920> does<00:03:12.070> happen<00:03:12.280> when<00:03:12.520> I<00:03:12.550> do<00:03:12.670> some

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
great lockups does happen when I do some

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.250 
great lockups does happen when I do some
self<00:03:13.300> it's<00:03:13.480> good<00:03:13.660> random<00:03:14.590> scramble<00:03:14.980> here<00:03:15.100> see

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
self it's good random scramble here see

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.540 
self it's good random scramble here see
see<00:03:17.260> that's<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.740> thing<00:03:17.770> about<00:03:17.950> this<00:03:18.340> it

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
see that's the thing about this it

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.890 
see that's the thing about this it
doesn't<00:03:18.700> corner<00:03:19.120> cut<00:03:19.300> well<00:03:19.480> that's<00:03:19.720> why<00:03:19.840> it

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
doesn't corner cut well that's why it

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.610 
doesn't corner cut well that's why it
occurs<00:03:20.440> on<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.710> lock<00:03:20.890> up<00:03:21.070> some<00:03:21.220> new<00:03:21.310> leg<00:03:22.620> so

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
occurs on to lock up some new leg so

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:35.460 
occurs on to lock up some new leg so
let's<00:03:23.830> do<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:23.980> quick<00:03:24.190> soul<00:03:33.810> yeah<00:03:34.810> it's<00:03:35.050> not<00:03:35.200> it's

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
let's do a quick soul yeah it's not it's

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.160 
let's do a quick soul yeah it's not it's
not<00:03:35.530> as<00:03:35.770> easy<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.220> control<00:03:36.610> as<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:37.000> v1<00:03:37.420> I<00:03:37.660> can

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
not as easy to control as the v1 I can

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.810 
not as easy to control as the v1 I can
say<00:03:38.380> that<00:03:39.150> but<00:03:40.150> yeah<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:41.440> mechanism<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.550> won't

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
say that but yeah so mechanism I won't

greatest too much of out there and I
think<00:04:44.260> then<00:04:44.440> then<00:04:44.680> will<00:04:44.800> be<00:04:44.830> better<00:04:45.070> than<00:04:45.280> this

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
think then then will be better than this

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.080 
think then then will be better than this
one<00:04:45.640> so<00:04:46.710> quickly<00:04:47.710> get<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.010> v1<00:04:48.550> if<00:04:48.670> you<00:04:48.760> want<00:04:48.970> to

before it goes out of stock and yeah so
my<00:04:53.020> overall<00:04:53.200> opinion<00:04:53.470> this<00:04:54.190> I<00:04:54.550> don't<00:04:54.820> think

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
my overall opinion this I don't think

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.310 
my overall opinion this I don't think

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
this cube it's not the greatest cube out

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.020 
this cube it's not the greatest cube out
