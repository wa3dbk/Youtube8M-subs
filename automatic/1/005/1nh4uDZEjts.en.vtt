00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
at the picture of the kid on the box and

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.459 
at the picture of the kid on the box and
look<00:00:38.790> how<00:00:38.910> big<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.930> double<00:00:40.260> loop

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
look how big this is it's a double loop

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.830 
look how big this is it's a double loop
it<00:00:40.739> shows<00:00:41.100> mercy<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.850> around<00:00:42.270> again<00:00:42.420> that's

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
it shows mercy and around again that's
