00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.149
 que 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.059
 you knew what bed is the combination between 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.799
 a camel and a flat this only 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.420
 carried out through civilization 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.970
 because it 's quite id and security of 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.250
 those two and well they had some things 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.410
 very similar to the camel had the 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.339
 short ears and long legs with 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.259
 good size but did not have any humps 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:33.320
 light or free that basically is the 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.140
 union between a lion and a tigress and 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.020
 these animals are giants are in fact 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.120
 the biggest cats that exist and they 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.910
 they behave quite sociably 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.490
 like the lions but they like to swim 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.400
 like the tigers but this is the 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.150
 revolution between a male tiger and a 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.500
 girl is less spectacular than what 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.180
 it would be free and therefore it occurs 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.540
 another to talk about is a reduction between 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.540
 polar bear and the others basically this 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.730
 to them it's because the polar bears 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.430
 because already almost very full in their 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.360
 areas are going down and are with 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.340
 the things from before but for the end this 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.830
 only happened twice in the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.340
 history and basically that captivity in 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.240
 a website and it's the mix between a 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.670
 bottlenose dolphin and a fake 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.760
 sure and basically scrambled zebra 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.860
 with a ricky is not a cable and 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.930
 usually they come out brown with stripes 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.230
 be the zebras this is not the break 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.840
 between a donkey or an ass with a city 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.090
 and very famous destination lately that is 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.640
 called tomb that occurred here 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.010
 mexico and good here I leave your photos 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.220
 so they can see how nice I read it for 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.020
 that's a pretty weird mix between what 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.270
 that it would be a leopard and a hare 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.100
 when this crossing was made he was criticized 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.990
 rather than the truth to me 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.179
 any hybrid that is made of 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.550
 artificial way should not be made 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.390
 but good the fact is that this one gave by 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.819
 was 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.370
 deserved in his dad his dad said that 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.130
 I really liked what it was to climb and 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.650
 swim thank you very much for watching me and
