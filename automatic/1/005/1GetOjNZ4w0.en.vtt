with butter and now they talked today
about<00:00:35.719> battery<00:00:36.719> life<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.320> battery<00:00:37.800> life<00:00:38.010> is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
about battery life and battery life is

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.740 
about battery life and battery life is
probably<00:00:38.670> one<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> biggest<00:00:39.210> things<00:00:39.540> that

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
probably one of the biggest things that

was very much welcome so basically what
this<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:48.149> new<00:00:49.340> system<00:00:50.340> called<00:00:50.629> Volta

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
this this new system called Volta

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.490 
this this new system called Volta
project<00:00:53.280> Volta<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> allow<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
project Volta is is to allow you to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.619 
project Volta is is to allow you to
basically<00:00:55.739> control<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.699> different<00:00:57.120> aspects

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
basically control the different aspects

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.619 
basically control the different aspects
of<00:00:57.780> your<00:00:57.930> device<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:59.190> control<00:00:59.940> battery<00:01:00.329> like

your<00:01:08.909> cellular<00:01:09.299> radio<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.720> pulling<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.229> data

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
your cellular radio is pulling for data

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.560 
your cellular radio is pulling for data
maybe<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.159> keep<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.729> from<00:01:11.880> searching<00:01:12.360> for

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
maybe you can keep it from searching for

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.990 
maybe you can keep it from searching for
LTE<00:01:12.869> if<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:14.010> an<00:01:14.130> LT<00:01:14.400> carrier<00:01:14.820> that

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
LTE if you have an LT carrier that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.830 
LTE if you have an LT carrier that
doesn't<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.360> coverage<00:01:15.659> there<00:01:15.900> sprint<00:01:17.840> you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
doesn't have coverage there sprint you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.630 
doesn't have coverage there sprint you
know<00:01:18.960> checking<00:01:19.590> your<00:01:19.860> bluetooth<00:01:20.340> radio

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
know checking your bluetooth radio

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.149 
know checking your bluetooth radio
you're<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.750> know<00:01:21.840> cutting<00:01:22.140> off<00:01:22.320> gps<00:01:22.619> or

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
you're you know cutting off gps or

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.850 
you're you know cutting off gps or
limiting<00:01:23.610> how<00:01:23.909> high<00:01:24.210> intensity<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.110> GPS<00:01:25.590> is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
limiting how high intensity the GPS is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.620 
limiting how high intensity the GPS is
polling<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.610> was<00:01:26.729> kind<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.060> cool<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.509> them<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
polling it was kind of cool for them to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.120 
polling it was kind of cool for them to
see<00:01:27.930> them<00:01:28.110> go<00:01:28.290> into<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.890> lot<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:31.130> respective

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
see them go into a lot of the respective

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.780 
see them go into a lot of the respective
parts<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:33.350> project<00:01:34.350> Volta<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.009> i<00:01:35.040> hope<00:01:35.369> i'm

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
parts of project Volta so i hope i'm

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.420 
parts of project Volta so i hope i'm
hoping<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.390> Volta<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.530> successful<00:01:38.070> as

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
hoping that Volta is as successful as

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.550 
hoping that Volta is as successful as
butter<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.990> know<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.140> really<00:01:40.380> don't

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
section down below battery life is

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.069 
section down below battery life is
important<00:02:47.610> but<00:02:48.329> I<00:02:48.390> think<00:02:48.690> there's<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.900> lot<00:02:49.019> of

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
important but I think there's a lot of

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.390 
important but I think there's a lot of
other<00:02:49.290> things<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.680> are<00:02:49.769> changing<00:02:49.950> as<00:02:50.250> well

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
other things that are changing as well

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.069 
other things that are changing as well
you<00:02:51.120> guys<00:02:51.299> know<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:51.540> I'm<00:02:51.690> we're<00:02:51.930> currently

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079

charger<00:02:55.170> really<00:02:55.349> makes<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.620> difference<00:02:55.650> I

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
charger really makes a difference I

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.589 
charger really makes a difference I
think<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.489> difference<00:02:56.880> between<00:02:57.209> maybe<00:02:57.360> some

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
think a difference between maybe some

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.300 
think a difference between maybe some

technology<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.239> faster<00:03:00.720> charging<00:03:00.959> could

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
technology and faster charging could

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.199 
technology and faster charging could
really<00:03:01.739> make<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.010> battery<00:03:02.340> real<00:03:02.459> thing<00:03:03.060> a

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
really make the battery real thing a
