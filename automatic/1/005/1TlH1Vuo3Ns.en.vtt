00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:05.009
 none of the other animals the excellent position with eight points was the test 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.480
 Where are you from? 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.480
 we will appeal 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.789
 one can also say in beijing 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.850
 sometimes I feel a void of consuming them the mount of itaipu 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.870
 is this what you record for ten days today not being in the form 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.870
 clever purpose but not even the jumper 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.100
 Mancini said he 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.550
 here already cited and have already sold more than 20 thousand civilians 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.670
 I hope you're not here, it's 20,000 people who bought it if I let it go 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.730
 pnbl 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.730
 Hi there's a sick aunt signed below with signatures 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.410
 the ministry 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.560
 for the first time more explicit in the riverside miners should be expected 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.900
 more potent 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.460
 but not with what has to cement 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.460
 to the costs previously seen here 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.880
 those who tried to rape are nothing was done 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 I think the wasps that of the reference date 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.800
 what they do not know if they have 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.450
 What do you feel period? 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.700
 the support given to people and many of these people accompany the 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.150
 or what do you think of bike paths 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.150
 it is a gift that has its power 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.790
 in sequence 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.020
 space is very special only who passes through it only who goes through it 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.680
 every pruned tree and power 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.520
 and can become dependent risk 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.370
 It's very normal, it's very good. 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.590
 depending on the results 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.550
 of affection 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.620
 somehow these children have been growing 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.840
 completely and gives me a lot of strength to continue working on abstracting 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 on the 13th of this month those who have 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.069
 It was typical my family came here. 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.219
 it's the left side 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.219
 roger federer 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:34.369
 5 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.109
 number two 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.599
 Why do we have to want to beat him? 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.709
 since 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.779
 everything he has done at the helm 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:52.089
 I don `t what 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:53.500
 but I can not 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.509
 win warner 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:56.959
 richter's arbix 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:57.869
 he 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:59.389
 Julinho 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.059
 moreover if the eu needs more emphasis 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:05.429
 it's a ballad well seen on the reef too it anything 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.099
 I think it goes to meet many gifts in thorn 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.649
 Only those who already signed up would face 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:13.899
 I know a lot 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.999
 of one of the songs refer to them 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:18.999
 are excellent tracks and do not need 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:21.559
 the animosity 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:23.979
 not sending condolences 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:27.369
 he will arrive this month asking me who is from the decade 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:30.859
 although the neighbor of his residence was serious 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.449
 alive 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.639
 rodrigues is also suspect it would be simoncelli 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.929
 I do not think anybody created 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:40.929
 But I think collective Brazil wrote the Bible. 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:45.279
 those who have experienced 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:48.279
 the highest of them but the goal is that these teenage parents 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.189
 and the special guests 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:56.019
 james hinchcliffe river 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.019
 whatever we want 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.669
 the entrance of more attention and love 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.169
 for its turn more 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:12.549
 space shuttle sim 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.549
 the result is heavy 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:33.059
 the absence of him afroreggae 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.910
 We will show our mistakes and take the turn but not be surprised at the 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:44.699
 data before 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.919
 already their presence at the final party so hard 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:48.590
 is that in that
