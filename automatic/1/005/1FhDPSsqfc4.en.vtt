00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now that I have lost everything to you

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You say you want to start something new

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And it's breaking my heart that you are leaving

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Baby I'm greving

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But if you wanna leave, take good care

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Ohh baby, baby, it's a wild world

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's hard to get by just upon a smile

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Ohh baby, baby, it's a wild world

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'll always remember you like a child, girl

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You know, I've seen a lot of what the world can do

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and it's breaking my heart in two
