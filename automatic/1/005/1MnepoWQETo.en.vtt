you what I mean and the best thing to do
with<00:00:23.850> vibrato<00:00:24.240> practice<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.140> practice

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
with vibrato practice is to practice

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.050 
with vibrato practice is to practice
this<00:00:25.800> with<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> scale<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.670> want<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.910> do<00:00:26.970> this

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
in on just the vibrato okay so let's

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.470 
in on just the vibrato okay so let's
just<00:00:36.390> demonstrate<00:00:36.870> with<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:38.180> G<00:00:39.180> Major<00:00:39.390> scale

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480

guys<00:01:49.920> playing<00:01:50.189> 12<00:01:50.670> I'm<00:01:51.329> just<00:01:51.630> doing<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
guys playing 12 I'm just doing the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.370 
guys playing 12 I'm just doing the
vibrato<00:01:52.710> instead<00:01:53.250> okay<00:01:53.960> remember<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> key<00:01:55.229> is

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
vibrato instead okay remember the key is

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.480 
vibrato instead okay remember the key is
to<00:01:55.619> move<00:01:56.039> your<00:01:56.610> arm<00:01:56.939> down<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:57.630> your<00:01:57.719> forearm

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
to move your arm down here your forearm

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.669 
to move your arm down here your forearm
okay<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.700> because<00:02:00.329> that's<00:02:00.810> moving<00:02:01.259> your

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
okay and because that's moving your

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.499 
okay and because that's moving your
vibrato<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:02.520> fingers<00:02:02.909> are<00:02:03.090> going<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.359> move

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
vibrato your fingers are going to move

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.709 
vibrato your fingers are going to move
in<00:02:03.780> turn<00:02:04.020> okay<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.219> okay<00:02:06.179> but<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
in turn okay just like this okay but the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.350 
in turn okay just like this okay but the
reason<00:02:06.840> why<00:02:07.020> we<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.380> waves<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:08.209> because<00:02:09.209> we

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
reason why we do the waves is because we

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.210 
reason why we do the waves is because we
want<00:02:09.569> from<00:02:09.840> top<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.170> bottom<00:02:10.379> from<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
want from top to bottom from the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.830 
want from top to bottom from the
beginning<00:02:11.519> of<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> note<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> end<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
beginning of the note to the end of the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.289 
beginning of the note to the end of the
note<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.200> bravado<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.769> be<00:02:13.950> consistent<00:02:14.910> okay

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
note the bravado to be consistent okay

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:22.100 
note the bravado to be consistent okay
so<00:02:16.049> we<00:02:16.230> don't<00:02:16.379> I<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.530> have<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.739> sporadic<00:02:21.110> real

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
so we don't I just have a sporadic real

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.770 
so we don't I just have a sporadic real
consisting<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:22.890> really<00:02:23.280> really<00:02:23.400> slow<00:02:26.660> we<00:02:27.660> can

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
consisting is really really slow we can

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.059 
consisting is really really slow we can
do<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:28.140> each<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.410> every<00:02:28.500> knows<00:02:28.739> when

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
do that for each and every knows when

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.700 
do that for each and every knows when
that's<00:02:29.250> not

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.730 

I

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.100 

me<00:02:38.880> I'd<00:02:39.880> actually<00:02:40.060> don't<00:02:40.420> play<00:02:40.720> like<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.990> very

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
me I'd actually don't play like the very

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.320 
me I'd actually don't play like the very
last<00:02:41.440> normally<00:02:41.980> but<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.190> could<00:02:42.430> it's<00:02:43.270> a

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
last normally but you could it's a

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.540 
last normally but you could it's a
little<00:02:43.510> harder<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.720> do<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:44.050> okay<00:02:44.770> so<00:02:44.830> see<00:02:45.520> I

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
little harder to do that okay so see I

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.510 
little harder to do that okay so see I
but<00:02:45.850> everything<00:02:46.150> sounds<00:02:46.360> consistent<00:02:47.290> ok<00:02:47.590> so

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
but everything sounds consistent ok so

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.190 
but everything sounds consistent ok so
that's<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.790> case<00:02:48.910> I<00:02:49.090> would<00:02:49.240> go<00:02:49.390> you're<00:02:50.050> doing

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
that's the case I would go you're doing

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.690 
that's the case I would go you're doing
a<00:02:50.230> G<00:02:50.380> Major<00:02:50.560> scale<00:02:50.680> go<00:02:51.190> all<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.370> way<00:02:51.400> up<00:02:51.520> you

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
a G Major scale go all the way up you

00:02:51.700 --> 00:03:15.950 
a G Major scale go all the way up you
know<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.060> e<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.660> e2

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.960 

yes<00:03:16.110> i'm<00:03:17.040> using<00:03:17.250> my<00:03:17.280> fourth<00:03:17.550> fingers<00:03:17.850> too

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
yes i'm using my fourth fingers too

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.400 
yes i'm using my fourth fingers too
that's<00:03:18.120> really<00:03:18.300> important<00:03:18.720> that's<00:03:19.290> probably

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
that's really important that's probably

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.410 
that's really important that's probably
the<00:03:19.590> hardest<00:03:19.860> one<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.040> do<00:03:20.250> we've<00:03:21.000> brought<00:03:21.270> up

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
the hardest one to do we've brought up

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.750 
the hardest one to do we've brought up
but<00:03:21.570> even<00:03:22.380> if<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.590> can't<00:03:22.830> do<00:03:22.950> as<00:03:23.100> well<00:03:23.340> still

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
but even if you can't do as well still

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.090 
but even if you can't do as well still
try<00:03:24.240> because<00:03:25.110> you'll<00:03:25.260> eventually<00:03:25.620> start<00:03:26.040> to

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
try because you'll eventually start to

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.650 
try because you'll eventually start to
develop<00:03:26.250> those<00:03:26.550> muscles<00:03:27.000> in<00:03:27.120> those<00:03:27.270> fingers

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
develop those muscles in those fingers

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.650 
develop those muscles in those fingers
okay<00:03:28.520> great<00:03:29.520> so<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:29.790> would<00:03:30.030> do<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.180> every

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
okay great so I would do that every

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.930 
okay great so I would do that every
single<00:03:30.870> day<00:03:31.140> um<00:03:31.470> as<00:03:32.430> much<00:03:32.610> as<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.820> possibly

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
single day um as much as you possibly

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.030 
single day um as much as you possibly
can<00:03:33.330> before<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.720> practice<00:03:34.200> because

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
can before you practice because

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.350 
can before you practice because
eventually<00:03:35.460> over<00:03:35.790> time<00:03:35.820> you're<00:03:36.210> going<00:03:36.240> to

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
eventually over time you're going to

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.610 
eventually over time you're going to
start<00:03:36.630> building<00:03:36.930> those<00:03:37.020> muscles<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:37.590> I

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
start building those muscles and I

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.470 
start building those muscles and I
consistency<00:03:38.220> okay<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:39.000> where<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.240> start

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
consistency okay to where you start

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.480 
consistency okay to where you start
doing<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.750> faster<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.440> same<00:03:40.680> concept<00:03:41.340> it's

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
doing it faster that same concept it's

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.560 
doing it faster that same concept it's
going<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.670> sound<00:03:41.790> just<00:03:42.000> like<00:03:42.060> real<00:03:42.330> Giver

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
going to sound just like real Giver

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.780 
going to sound just like real Giver
Bravo

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:59.500 

I

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.869 

okay<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.469> know<00:04:01.590> that's<00:04:02.129> it's<00:04:02.670> going<00:04:02.819> to

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
okay so you know that's it's going to

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.270 
okay so you know that's it's going to
stem<00:04:03.180> from<00:04:03.420> doing<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.900> slow<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.590> building<00:04:05.189> the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
stem from doing it slow and building the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.890 
stem from doing it slow and building the
consistency<00:04:05.909> though<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.239> very<00:04:06.840> very

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
consistency though so very very

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.050 
consistency though so very very
important<00:04:07.349> to<00:04:07.409> do<00:04:07.469> that<00:04:07.730> if<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.819> have<00:04:08.909> any

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
important to do that if you have any

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.580 
important to do that if you have any
