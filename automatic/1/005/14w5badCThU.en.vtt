that last row it's going to be four and
a<00:00:56.760> half<00:00:56.789> inches<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.510> we're<00:00:58.050> gonna<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.379> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
a half inches so we're gonna have to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.590 
a half inches so we're gonna have to
knit<00:00:58.770> every<00:00:58.980> row<00:00:59.250> for<00:01:00.180> four<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> half

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
knit every row for four and a half

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.100 
knit every row for four and a half
inches<00:01:02.180> we're<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.329> gonna<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.570> knitting<00:01:03.899> for

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
inches we're just gonna be knitting for

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.620 
inches we're just gonna be knitting for
a<00:01:04.140> while<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.610> way<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.850> will<00:01:06.299> measure

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
a while and the way you will measure

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.510 
a while and the way you will measure
your<00:01:06.990> four<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> half<00:01:07.409> inches<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:10.490> what<00:01:11.490> I

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
your four and a half inches is what I

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.640 
your four and a half inches is what I
like<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.330> I'll<00:01:12.479> come<00:01:12.750> across<00:01:13.170> until<00:01:13.590> I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
like to do is I'll come across until I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.140 
like to do is I'll come across until I
get<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.189> middle<00:01:14.509> of<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:16.340> row<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.729> I'll

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
get to the middle of this row and I'll

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.510 
get to the middle of this row and I'll
put<00:01:18.360> another<00:01:18.450> marker<00:01:19.110> there<00:01:19.369> because<00:01:20.369> I'd

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
put another marker there because I'd

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.280 
put another marker there because I'd
rather<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> marker<00:01:21.450> at<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.990> middle

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
rather have the marker at the middle

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.060 
rather have the marker at the middle
instead<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:23.009> at<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.189> edge<00:01:24.920> because<00:01:25.920> it's

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
instead of at the edge because it's

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.210 
instead of at the edge because it's
easier<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.580> measure<00:01:27.439> from<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.619> middle<00:01:28.860> than

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
easier to measure from the middle than

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.420 
easier to measure from the middle than
it<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.490> from<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> edge<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:31.040> think<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
it is from on the edge I think it's a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.980 
it is from on the edge I think it's a
more<00:01:32.579> accurate<00:01:32.790> measurement<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:33.750> that's

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
more accurate measurement but that's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.679 
more accurate measurement but that's
just<00:01:34.290> me<00:01:37.460> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.670> keep<00:01:38.820> your<00:01:39.000> marker<00:01:39.450> at<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
just me you can keep your marker at the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.090 
just me you can keep your marker at the
edge<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.140> want<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:42.649> guess<00:01:43.649> I'm<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:43.950> a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
edge if you want I guess I'm just a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.980 
edge if you want I guess I'm just a
little<00:01:44.220> bit<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.670> rebel<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.420> not<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.840> much

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
little bit of a rebel it's not that much

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:54.649 
little bit of a rebel it's not that much
less<00:01:46.310> all<00:01:47.310> right<00:01:51.560> almost<00:01:52.560> at<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> middle<00:01:53.659> okay

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
less all right almost at the middle okay

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.780 
less all right almost at the middle okay
here<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:55.020> go<00:01:55.049> here's<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.740> middle<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.490> here's

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
here we go here's the middle and here's

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.130 
here we go here's the middle and here's
where<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.060> want<00:01:57.210> my<00:01:57.329> marker<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.810> be<00:01:57.930> because

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
where I want my marker to be because

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.780 
where I want my marker to be because
it'll<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.409> easier<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.920> measure<00:01:59.810> at<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.790> yeah

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
it'll be easier to measure at that yeah

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.190 
it'll be easier to measure at that yeah
take<00:02:03.659> my<00:02:03.810> marker<00:02:04.049> at<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:06.090> red<00:02:06.360> before<00:02:06.810> so

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
take my marker at the red before so

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.389 
take my marker at the red before so
don't<00:02:07.290> put<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.590> over<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.829> air<00:02:07.920> put<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.250> this

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
don't put it over the air put it on this

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.820 
don't put it over the air put it on this
one<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.209> Left<00:02:10.200> needle<00:02:10.349> because<00:02:10.590> that's

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
one on the Left needle because that's

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.070 
one on the Left needle because that's
the<00:02:11.009> way<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.220> worked<00:02:11.550> before

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
the way you worked before

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
the way you worked before
I<00:02:14.080> have<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.200> be<00:02:15.290> real<00:02:15.470> careful<00:02:15.710> with<00:02:16.010> these

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
I have to be real careful with these

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.680 
I have to be real careful with these
little<00:02:16.370> plastic<00:02:16.550> markers<00:02:16.910> I've<00:02:17.210> broken<00:02:17.510> them

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
little plastic markers I've broken them

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.500 
little plastic markers I've broken them
before<00:02:18.080> because<00:02:18.320> it<00:02:18.440> squeeze<00:02:18.650> them<00:02:18.800> too<00:02:18.980> hard

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
before because it squeeze them too hard

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.120 
before because it squeeze them too hard
there<00:02:20.510> we<00:02:20.750> go<00:02:20.900> now<00:02:21.320> that'll<00:02:21.620> be<00:02:21.650> easy<00:02:21.890> to

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
there we go now that'll be easy to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.940 
there we go now that'll be easy to
measure<00:02:22.340> from<00:02:23.140> let's<00:02:24.140> see<00:02:24.260> after<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.620> finished

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950

and I'm ready to work the next day and

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:15.879 
and I'm ready to work the next day and
so<00:06:13.879> there's<00:06:14.120> our<00:06:14.330> marker<00:06:14.840> so<00:06:15.289> we've<00:06:15.470> only<00:06:15.620> done

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
so there's our marker so we've only done

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.710 
so there's our marker so we've only done
like<00:06:16.310> probably<00:06:16.819> a<00:06:16.939> quarter<00:06:17.120> of<00:06:17.360> an<00:06:17.419> inch<00:06:17.509> I

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
like probably a quarter of an inch I

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.709 
like probably a quarter of an inch I
