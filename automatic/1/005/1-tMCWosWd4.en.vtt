00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.960
 There are some who claim that he has a gift 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:11.770
 God 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.350
 others say that the pact with the 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.300
 demon 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:20.970
 and some more credible that is a ghost 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.430
 the only sure thing is that where it exists 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.670
 some evidence of the paranormal he 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.060
 will be there 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.810
 ladies and gentlemen then it remains 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.720
 for you 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.510
 the journalist and researcher of 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.670
 paranormal phenomena because they 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.289
 dark for them 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.289
 because he is brown 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.670
 several photographs circulate on the internet 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.810
 of alleged ghostly beings caught 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.100
 on screens or television monitors 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.750
 supposedly according to the versions 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.350
 the televisions are off and there 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.880
 faces of these beings more appear 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.920
 there, however, it is very difficult 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.780
 check many times if you 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.330
 it's about real photos if they're not gimmicked 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.160
 because there is not even access to 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.140
 interview people since these 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.540
 photos are copying each other 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.850
 they are sharing and suddenly they leave 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.430
 different names different owners or 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.690
 different places where supposedly 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.190
 they were taken besides we already know that 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.830
 many of the things that circulate in 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.380
 internet is sometimes about tricks 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.410
 or montages this time I'm going to 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.080
 present a photograph a photograph 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.400
 that was taken in the city of umÃ¡n 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.520
 Yucatan Mexico This photo was taken in 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.110
 the first of November of the year 2003 is 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.210
 a case that I could investigate directly 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.100
 which I can assure you is a 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.540
 real case in fact that's always 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.270
 important in an investigation when 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.549
 have a picture speak 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.109
 witnesses go to the exact place where they 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.440
 took the photo to be able to discover 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.360
 some other factors that may 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.220
 enrich in this investigation 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.830
 as I was telling you this is about this 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.709
 photograph this girl that is there is the 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.349
 neighbor of the friend who lives in that in 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.060
 that house she was posing the first 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.799
 November next to the television they 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.049
 they assure that it was off and suddenly 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.410
 there as you can see is observed in a way 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.660
 clearly clear a girl a girl 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.209
 with arms almost they are almost 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.780
 clutching the foreground a dress 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.090
 blue a ribbon between yellow and white and 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.000
 this photograph is real I'm going to 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.489
 explain why in the first place it was 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.860
 taken as I was telling you in November of 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.110
 2003 and at that time there were no 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.450
 digital cameras was taken with a 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.250
 amateur camera thing to be 110 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.930
 mm ie those in 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.970
 which you had to send to reveal the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.610
 roll and the next day they gave you 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.560
 the pictures is to say we could have 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.989
 access to the negative to see the photograph 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.450
 exact and there believe me that is discarded in 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.960
 a greater measure a possible trick a 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.180
 possible 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.240
 because because having the negative because 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.130
 it is practically impossible to achieve 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.720
 edition as now could be done with 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.700
 modern cameras with cameras 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.700
 digital and so on and some of the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.710
 program that is now circulating a lot 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.810
 what is the oscar then logically neither 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.270
 even it exists at the time so 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.130
 it is easier to rule out certain 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.540
 situations according to the interviews 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.630
 what can you do with the owners of that 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.840
 house the father of the young girl the one of the girl 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.790
 who took the photograph that lives already 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.340
 He says that they did not know anything 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.140
 they according to them have been there 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.880
 living for many years and never 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.950
 nothing had happened to them dad 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.470
 considers that because it is day of the dead to 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.230
 the best the spirit of the girl appeared 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.240
 just at that moment since there is a data 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.690
 very interesting we did various tests 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.420
 to confirm and try to verify if 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.970
 it would not be about any person 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.400
 girl who was standing in front of the 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.810
 television regardless of which 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.160
 witnesses assured us that there was no 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.100
 no other girl that if only 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.140
 there was the young girl who took the picture and 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.890
 the person that appears in the image in 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.380
 foreground 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.000
 of red blouse regardless of that 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.500
 we did several tests I put several of 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.330
 my school one of my collaborators 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.400
 in front of the television we take several 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.440
 photographs with a similar camera and the 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.510
 moment to reveal them because it does not appear with 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.610
 that sharpness is not even reached 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.160
 see in the reflection of television 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.270
 we had to put it in a 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.669
 chair 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.990
 more or less and upload it as a meter and a half 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.700
 so that more or less would be seen in the 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.800
 part of below some experts from 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.620
 photograph to which they were shown the 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.840
 picture tell me what to make a silhouette 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.090
 appear in front of the television or in 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.800
 the screen as it looks would have to 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.020
 be practically on the roof this 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.180
 person because of how concave this 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.100
 television and also for the sharpness that 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.740
 have if they had needed a game of 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.320
 professional parasols lights and so on 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.690
 which obviously is also discarded 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.640
 for now I can assure you that 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.260
 this photograph is real because I could 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.450
 investigate I had it in my hands I had 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.220
 access to the negative and good this is a 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.440
 more mystery that is hovering in the 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.440
 world of paranormal phenomena
