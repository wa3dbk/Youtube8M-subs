a big booklet telling you how to use the

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.080 
a big booklet telling you how to use the

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
case it just simply gives you the link

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.480 
case it just simply gives you the link
so<00:04:58.300> very<00:04:58.510> simplistic<00:04:59.140> I<00:04:59.230> like<00:04:59.440> that<00:04:59.650> and<00:04:59.890> so

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
so very simplistic I like that and so

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.770 
so very simplistic I like that and so
there's<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.880> case<00:05:01.120> right<00:05:01.330> there<00:05:01.390> so<00:05:01.690> I'm

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
there's the case right there so I'm

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.960 
there's the case right there so I'm
going<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:01.930> take<00:05:02.170> out<00:05:02.350> this<00:05:03.160> plastic<00:05:03.700> that<00:05:03.850> they

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
going to take out this plastic that they

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.480 
going to take out this plastic that they
have<00:05:04.120> inside<00:05:04.450> of<00:05:04.600> it<00:05:04.720> as<00:05:04.980> you<00:05:05.980> can<00:05:06.070> see<00:05:06.280> there

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
have inside of it as you can see there

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.300 
have inside of it as you can see there
and<00:05:07.170> that's<00:05:08.170> pretty<00:05:08.560> much<00:05:08.680> the<00:05:08.800> case<00:05:09.070> right

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
and that's pretty much the case right

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.860 
and that's pretty much the case right
there<00:05:09.370> so<00:05:09.700> as<00:05:09.790> you<00:05:09.880> can<00:05:09.940> see<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.330> back<00:05:10.570> of<00:05:10.780> it

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
there so as you can see the back of it

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.530 
there so as you can see the back of it
as<00:05:11.460> transparent<00:05:12.460> part<00:05:12.670> of<00:05:12.820> its<00:05:12.940> transparent

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.490 
and I really liked the fact that they
had<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:31.240> little<00:05:31.480> flap<00:05:31.720> right<00:05:31.990> there<00:05:32.169> to<00:05:32.320> cover

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
had the little flap right there to cover

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.580 
had the little flap right there to cover
up<00:05:32.680> your<00:05:32.710> USB<00:05:33.250> port<00:05:33.580> and<00:05:34.050> but<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.169> problem<00:05:35.470> was

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
up your USB port and but the problem was

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.560 
up your USB port and but the problem was
I<00:05:35.650> didn't<00:05:35.980> like<00:05:36.100> how<00:05:36.340> thick<00:05:36.790> the<00:05:36.970> case<00:05:37.150> was<00:05:37.390> now

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
I didn't like how thick the case was now

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.960 
I didn't like how thick the case was now
bulky<00:05:38.080> it<00:05:38.140> was<00:05:38.320> and<00:05:38.560> so<00:05:39.070> as<00:05:39.340> you<00:05:39.430> can<00:05:39.520> see<00:05:39.760> this

bulky it was and so as you can see this

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.670 
bulky it was and so as you can see this
solo<00:05:40.510> vu<00:05:40.690> case<00:05:40.930> brings<00:05:41.650> style<00:05:42.870> non<00:05:43.870> bulkiness

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
solo vu case brings style non bulkiness

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.219 
solo vu case brings style non bulkiness
is<00:05:44.890> I<00:05:45.400> know<00:05:45.940> it's<00:05:46.090> a<00:05:46.180> strange<00:05:46.720> word<00:05:46.930> to<00:05:47.050> use<00:05:47.200> but

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
it also brings a protection that some of

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.670 
it also brings a protection that some of
the<00:05:51.550> more<00:05:51.700> bulkier<00:05:52.180> cases<00:05:52.570> do<00:05:52.750> with<00:05:52.990> the

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
the more bulkier cases do with the

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.650 
the more bulkier cases do with the
covering<00:05:54.070> of<00:05:54.130> the<00:05:54.190> USB<00:05:54.610> port<00:05:54.640> in<00:05:55.060> this<00:05:55.450> case

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
covering of the USB port in this case

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.510 
covering of the USB port in this case
really<00:05:56.080> just<00:05:56.290> does<00:05:56.440> feel<00:05:56.650> super<00:05:57.010> nice<00:05:57.190> so<00:05:57.400> as
