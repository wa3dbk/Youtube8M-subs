00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.769
 Hello, everyone says guide funk 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.889
 show you how to enable replays 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.619
 in the game world of warships so far this 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.900
 functionality is tested because it is not 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.210
 turns on in the usual way inside 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.850
 client as in other games from the company 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.130
 wargaming but to turn them on manually 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.210
 won't take long 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.330
 repeat after me and you will succeed 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.079
 at first 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.300
 close the game then find the root 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.390
 folder with the game installed file 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.660
 preference xml for greater preservation 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.500
 customer save and separate original 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.390
 This file then open the file lying 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.090
 in the root folder using notepad 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.199
 through the right mouse button by selecting the menu 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.899
 open with the file find this one 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.449
 line she is practically in 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.369
 the very end of the file 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.810
 put these two lines in front of her 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.450
 by the way if all this time 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.610
 copy with screen text 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.909
 stop can open the video description 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.960
 and copy text from there in general to 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.490
 in the end we get this text 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.409
 save the file and all the replays are included 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.320
 now after each of your played 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.079
 combat in the root folder with replays will be 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.200
 save your battles 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.240
 to view the battle recorded file 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.090
 drag it to the game launch label 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.700
 root folder replay management 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.759
 happens through the commands shown on 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.009
 screen and specified in the video description when 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.860
 Do not forget that after each 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.689
 game updates have a risk that replay with 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.840
 old versions will no longer be 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.869
 because clients play especially 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.509
 epic fights better to record video through 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.060
 bandicam fraps or whatever you will be there 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.860
 Any google will tell you how 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:11.140
 use these programs 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:13.510
 and now you and you tell me 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.940
 do you want your fight to see 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.790
 hundreds and maybe even thousands of people 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.970
 if yes then I have a good one for you 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.700
 news heading here so fight i 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.800
 showing fights from other players to 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.740
 you need to get into this rubric 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.110
 after a beautiful fight, save a screenshot and 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.860
 post battle statistics through a button 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.920
 print screen 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.430
 then my group vkontakte offer 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.350
 news 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.530
 which you need to attach the archive with 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.230
 screenshots and fight replay if it is to me 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.900
 like it will enter the heading where all 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.330
 will see your cool game but to 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.450
 facilitate my selection process and so I 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.060
 noticed exactly your fight write text 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.730
 what exactly happened there and even better 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.090
 write how much experience and frags you got 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.640
 for this fight in principle you can 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.640
 assess whether your fight will be able to get into this 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.739
 I need a heading and let's bend over 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.010
 which in the final statistics you will be given 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.280
 over two thousand net experiences per battle but 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.410
 In principle, this is not the only criterion 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.489
 the final decision will always be me on 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.070
 which will affect 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.590
 what I saw in battle as well as the presence of 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.170
 free time if the rubric is 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.019
 popular except the word nagibator 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.140
 perhaps the author of the replays will still be 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.090
 come valuable gaming gifts in general 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.100
 you can finish the water part 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.670
 Thank you for watching 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.799
 successful fights and 7 feet under the keel bye 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.900
 until 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.660
 if you like a video like it 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.170
 subscribe to the channel as a sign of support 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.330
 see my guides and streams on the game 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.760
 In addition, in my VKontakte group there is 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.700
 a lot of interesting things because 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.340
 a subscription will also be helpful considering 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.200
 the fact that I release content almost 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.200
 every day for bored will not work
