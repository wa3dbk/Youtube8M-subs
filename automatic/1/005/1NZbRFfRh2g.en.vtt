we<00:01:39.660> call<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.870> doughnut<00:01:40.230> is<00:01:40.290> when<00:01:40.410> you<00:01:40.500> spin<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
we call a doughnut is when you spin the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.770

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
rear wheels and drive the car round in a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.420

and the front wheels steered into

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.430 
and the front wheels steered into
opposite<00:01:48.030> lock<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.690> you<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.900> make<00:01:48.990> very<00:01:49.260> very

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440
