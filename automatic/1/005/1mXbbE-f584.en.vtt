different career about weapons and
enemies<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.390> other<00:00:58.020> than<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.200> it's

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
enemies but other than that it's

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.560 
enemies but other than that it's
basically<00:00:58.920> don't<00:00:59.130> visit<00:00:59.310> my<00:00:59.579> nearest<00:00:59.790> just

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
basically don't visit my nearest just

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.870 
basically don't visit my nearest just
it's<00:01:01.290> a<00:01:01.920> bit<00:01:02.070> askew<00:01:02.220> but<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.579> one<00:01:02.700> of<00:01:02.730> those

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
it's a bit askew but it's one of those

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.359 
it's a bit askew but it's one of those
cases<00:01:03.180> where<00:01:03.619> even<00:01:04.619> though<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.829> looks<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
cases where even though it looks and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.099 
cases where even though it looks and
feels<00:01:05.610> exactly<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.299> zombies<00:01:06.780> am<00:01:06.929> i<00:01:07.049> nervous

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:07.109 
feels exactly like zombies am i nervous

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:09.260 
feels exactly like zombies am i nervous
the<00:01:07.679> formula<00:01:08.219> just<00:01:08.429> doesn't<00:01:08.850> work<00:01:08.999> as<00:01:09.240> well

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the formula just doesn't work as well

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
the formula just doesn't work as well
this<00:01:09.539> time<00:01:09.780> around<00:01:09.929> and<00:01:10.679> what's<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.039> very<00:01:11.219> odd

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
this time around and what's a very odd

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.249 
this time around and what's a very odd
thing<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.789> see<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.179> but<00:01:12.479> unfortunately<00:01:13.229> that

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
thing to see it but unfortunately that

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.109 
thing to see it but unfortunately that
is<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.679> way<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.829> is<00:01:14.069> it's<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.579> of<00:01:14.609> those<00:01:14.789> where

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
is the way it is it's one of those where

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.809 
is the way it is it's one of those where
you<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.079> play<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.289> this<00:01:17.249> time<00:01:17.310> it

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:17.819 
you just have to play it this time it

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:19.129 
you just have to play it this time it
actually<00:01:17.850> you've<00:01:18.420> got<00:01:18.569> these<00:01:18.689> little<00:01:18.840> help

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:19.139 
actually you've got these little help

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:21.020 
actually you've got these little help
symbols<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.740> come<00:01:19.950> up<00:01:20.039> with<00:01:20.249> basically<00:01:20.399> sure

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
symbols that come up with basically sure

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.239 
symbols that come up with basically sure
where<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> victims<00:01:21.810> are<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:22.439> kind<00:01:23.159> of

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:23.249 
where the victims are so you can kind of

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.459 
where the victims are so you can kind of
pretty<00:01:23.429> much<00:01:23.609> know<00:01:24.090> exactly<00:01:24.600> where<00:01:24.749> go<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> its

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
pretty much know exactly where go to its

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.770 
pretty much know exactly where go to its
its<00:01:26.429> instead<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.909> map<00:01:27.119> because<00:01:27.389> now<00:01:27.719> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
its instead of the map because now the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.260 
its instead of the map because now the
maps<00:01:28.079> actually<00:01:28.499> been<00:01:28.619> removed<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:30.090> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
maps actually been removed so if you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.330 
maps actually been removed so if you
think<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:31.289> if<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.499> use<00:01:31.679> them<00:01:31.920> up<00:01:32.039> a<00:01:32.069> lot

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
think like what if you use them up a lot

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.859 
think like what if you use them up a lot
then<00:01:32.609> unfortunately<00:01:32.939> that's<00:01:33.479> not<00:01:33.600> there

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
then unfortunately that's not there

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.139 
then unfortunately that's not there
anymore<00:01:33.899> and<00:01:34.490> now<00:01:35.490> you've<00:01:35.700> actually<00:01:35.880> got

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
anymore and now you've actually got

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.950 
anymore and now you've actually got
infinite<00:01:36.539> ammo<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:36.899> well<00:01:37.079> because<00:01:37.469> you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
infinite ammo as well because you

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.600 
infinite ammo as well because you
you<00:01:38.290> start<00:01:38.620> with<00:01:38.740> this<00:01:38.799> cross<00:01:39.040> sport<00:01:39.370> then

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
you start with this cross sport then

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.070 
you start with this cross sport then
that's<00:01:39.940> your<00:01:40.030> basic<00:01:40.330> weapon<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:40.960> you've

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
that's your basic weapon and you've

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.590 
that's your basic weapon and you've
always<00:01:41.650> got<00:01:41.799> a<00:01:41.830> more<00:01:42.070> fridge<00:01:42.280> so<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.000> kind<00:01:43.540> of

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
always got a more fridge so it kind of

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.910 
always got a more fridge so it kind of
makes<00:01:43.750> a<00:01:43.869> game<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.049> little<00:01:44.229> bit<00:01:44.320> easier<00:01:44.770> as<00:01:44.890> well

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
makes a game a little bit easier as well

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.310 
makes a game a little bit easier as well
so<00:01:45.640> it's<00:01:46.090> just<00:01:46.360> quite<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.810> lot<00:01:47.020> of<00:01:47.110> things

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
so it's just quite a lot of things

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.280 
so it's just quite a lot of things
basically<00:01:47.800> that<00:01:48.550> well<00:01:49.420> let<00:01:49.810> me<00:01:49.930> came<00:01:50.050> down<00:01:50.260> a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
basically that well let me came down a

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.660 
basically that well let me came down a
little<00:01:50.500> bit<00:01:50.680> and<00:01:50.860> but<00:01:51.190> make<00:01:51.400> a<00:01:51.430> bit

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
little bit and but make a bit

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.359 
little bit and but make a bit
disappointed<00:01:52.680> graphically<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.710> game<00:01:53.860> is

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
disappointed graphically the game is

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.130 
disappointed graphically the game is
probably<00:01:54.790> an<00:01:55.030> improvement<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.540> be<00:01:55.690> fair<00:01:55.930> the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
probably an improvement to be fair the

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.899 
probably an improvement to be fair the
surroundings<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.250> likes<00:01:57.490> do<00:01:57.700> look

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
surroundings and the likes do look

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.060 
surroundings and the likes do look
better<00:01:58.090> than<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.420> last<00:01:58.450> one<00:01:58.869> what<00:01:59.440> music<00:01:59.619> wise

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
better than the last one what music wise

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.950 
better than the last one what music wise
I<00:02:00.399> also<00:02:00.700> don't<00:02:00.940> think<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.240> music's<00:02:01.630> anything

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
I also don't think the music's anything

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.840 
I also don't think the music's anything
is<00:02:02.080> specialist<00:02:02.530> what<00:02:02.680> it<00:02:02.770> used<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.009> be<00:02:03.070> so<00:02:03.640> I'm

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
is specialist what it used to be so I'm

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.040 
is specialist what it used to be so I'm
just<00:02:03.970> going<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.180> shut<00:02:04.270> up<00:02:04.390> for<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.540> few<00:02:04.659> seconds

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
just going to shut up for a few seconds

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:49.629 
just going to shut up for a few seconds
and<00:02:05.110> my<00:02:05.229> god<00:02:05.380> was<00:02:05.560> not

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.589 

so<00:02:50.639> there<00:02:50.760> we<00:02:50.819> go<00:02:50.849> then<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.359> was<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.510> little

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
so there we go then that was a little

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.440 
so there we go then that was a little
bit<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> music<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.499> as<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:52.859> can<00:02:53.010> see<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:53.879> if

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
bit the music and as you can see it's if

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.000 
bit the music and as you can see it's if
you've<00:02:54.629> ever<00:02:54.749> played<00:02:54.930> zombies<00:02:55.379> again<00:02:55.590> you

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
you've ever played zombies again you

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.619 
you've ever played zombies again you
basically<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.939> have<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.209> little<00:02:57.389> werewolf

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
basically you have this little werewolf

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.690 
basically you have this little werewolf
type<00:02:58.079> thing<00:02:58.379> now<00:02:58.650> you've<00:02:58.859> turn<00:02:59.250> into<00:02:59.459> depth

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
type thing now you've turn into depth

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.920 
type thing now you've turn into depth
and<00:02:59.909> you<00:02:59.969> can<00:03:00.120> actually<00:03:00.269> use<00:03:00.569> inside

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
and you can actually use inside

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.899 
and you can actually use inside
knowledge<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.680> that's<00:03:02.280> pretty<00:03:02.519> cool<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.879> be

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
knowledge so that's pretty cool to be

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.970 
knowledge so that's pretty cool to be
fair<00:03:03.180> but<00:03:03.810> that's<00:03:04.079> pretty<00:03:04.469> much<00:03:04.590> everything

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
fair but that's pretty much everything

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.379 
fair but that's pretty much everything
there<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.129> to<00:03:05.250> see<00:03:05.280> about<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:05.670> game<00:03:05.849> it's<00:03:06.150> a

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
there is to see about the game it's a

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.720 
there is to see about the game it's a
standard<00:03:06.900> sequel<00:03:07.349> but<00:03:07.500> not<00:03:07.920> really<00:03:08.340> exactly

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730
