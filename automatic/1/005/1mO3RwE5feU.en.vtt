00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.500
 really great fresh and fruity 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.180
 dressing 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.550
 I have this myself for the first time today 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.710
 Tried and I'm totally excited 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.710
 So please, please, make this salad 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.899
 necessarily after paying attention to the fathers please 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.300
 be sure that the sheep's 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.840
 or goat's milk is that you see behind 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.520
 it 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.260
 Please do not go crazy 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.930
 I have it in the last food 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.300
 deception said all the ingredients you find 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.760
 again under the video in the infobox 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.190
 or indeed here I now count yet 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.699
 Let's get started so let's get started 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.960
 I use walnut oil and white 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.940
 balsamic vinegar for the dressing because 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.890
 best in the taste 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.890
 I'm beautiful now 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.560
 said gell so first we dice 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.630
 our fathers in bite size 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.390
 So, depending on how big yours are 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.240
 would like to and would give that to one with 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.460
 Baking paper designed small baking sheet 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.990
 nice next to each other so we one 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.170
 to achieve a nice tan 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.060
 at 220 degrees, the fathers go for dice 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.369
 About 10 minutes in the oven 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.619
 that's wonderful from time to time 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.390
 These ten minutes we can wonderful 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.460
 preparing our salad 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.770
 in the purchase country had nuclear arms today 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.869
 So please melon if you like that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.310
 imitate want to look in the country of purchase 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.500
 These melons are great 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.570
 especially for the people who do not like it 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.310
 Cores in their food have me 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.350
 personally that does not matter but 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.299
 I think there are enough people there 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.579
 out there who just do not like it 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.200
 so much kernels in the food cut now yes 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.869
 I of course also got the pulp in it 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.000
 bite-sized cubes just like you 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.799
 want that and give it into one 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.170
 pretty glass bowl just looks 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.509
 more beautiful than plastic you can find 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.719
 Of course, every vessel will take what you 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.719
 like 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.090
 so that's the first and then devote 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.340
 Eat the peppermint either you 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.079
 Buys mint at Kaufland is also available 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.389
 fresh herbs quite a lot 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.010
 I have mine today from the garden and 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.989
 I'll show you now how I like the little ones 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.359
 I take such a stalk and 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.030
 strip the leaves down the 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:42.159
 is relatively fast and easy the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.260
 remaining leaves simply from 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.030
 stems and this one had strict can 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.099
 then in the biomÃ¼ll I use 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.560
 not only the remaining leaves 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.079
 I tuber now simply a 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.969
 small packet together and cut 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.069
 the whole thing with a really sharp 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.629
 knife small the knife what I use 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.760
 I also link you again below 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.340
 the video I already have at least 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.620
 five years and i love this knife 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.659
 I have more from this series and 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.849
 I am really keen for a very long time 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.099
 then we come to the dressing 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.500
 while our fathers dice in the oven before 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.900
 tan I show you now 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.609
 how easy and delicious the dressing is 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.169
 I have the juice of a half here 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.120
 taken lime 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.280
 you can also have the juice of a whole 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.530
 take lime for me has it with you 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.239
 Half lime made perfect sense 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.359
 also sufficient and I give to it 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.519
 just three tablespoons of walnut oil so 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.500
 You would not have to race in one too 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.049
 but stir together extra 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.120
 just give it to us yes we want 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.060
 Do not do more work than must be 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.229
 then a tablespoon of white 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.629
 balsamic vinegar please really here 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:48.400
 be economical because it is vinegar and 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.949
 otherwise it will be impossible for you to be angry 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.470
 we do not want that, so 123 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:56.079
 should the ratio for oil were then 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.239
 I add two tablespoons of honey to it 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.609
 that simply rounds the taste in 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.799
 my eyes off perfectly with the straight 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.269
 browned grilled dads and dice 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.759
 Now I have everything beautiful 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.340
 mess everything up again 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:11.109
 stir and now the should 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.930
 time to be reached where your fathers 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:17.380
 dice are grilled nicely which I give 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.239
 now just indiscriminately over yes 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.680
 few left over into the slide 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.300
 I probably have those here 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.490
 I just gave it over the top 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.320
 I always feel good when I do it all 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.570
 is hacked very small but gives 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.229
 just a nice rustic picture of 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.440
 the salad 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.720
 you can 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.740
 put the salad in the fridge and 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.690
 then shortly before serving rausholen or 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.720
 So the best variant in my eyes 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.980
 is when you put the melons cold 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.350
 So the salad with the melons 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.600
 is cold and the warm father is to 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.280
 Of course it is probably one 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.800
 bit difficult i did earlier 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.810
 everything is done and then it is 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.780
 so eaten that was so lovely 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.970
 refreshing so please make the salad 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.170
 after and if you liked it 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.270
 I would be glad if you think so 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.520
 subscribed and then we'll see each other 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.120
 at the next recipe video again until 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.120
 bye bye
