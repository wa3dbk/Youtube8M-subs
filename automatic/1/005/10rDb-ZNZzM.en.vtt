00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.569
 dear gaming friends my name is 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.120
 reputable and now there is again a 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.410
 small summary to gamescom 2013 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.780
 like maybe one or the other 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.260
 I've been in since monday 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.330
 Cologne 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.029
 for the need for speed event afterwards 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.460
 tuesday at construction and from wednesday for 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.740
 electronic arts in the community lounge 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.420
 generally I have already in the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.519
 first gamescom video a little something 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.410
 to the individual consoles said to the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.309
 playing stations where I was and 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.620
 Today I want another one 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.079
 little a little critical look 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.820
 throw back in the background you see 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.290
 Meanwhile a few tens mainly 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.149
 of course shot in the community 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.820
 lounge here for example that bioware 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.379
 team that met with fans with 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.510
 which one could exchange for 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.969
 coming dragon age or maybe 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.410
 also about the mass effect universe 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.469
 beyond that, of course, for me 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.469
 Battlefield 4 is a big issue, though 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.020
 also xbox one and playstation 4 should 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.930
 in the end, not too short the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.990
 Gamescom Award 2013 for the best 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.659
 nextgen console went to the playstation 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.000
 4 with a short lead the xbox 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.640
 Man has beaten at the fair itself 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.070
 I felt the microsoft stood for that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.770
 somehow as an adult and as a gamer 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.950
 more mature there was a lot 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.960
 allusive station 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.939
 you could try the lot of top titles 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.580
 but nevertheless I am after 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.799
 the best sure that both consoles the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.049
 claims of us players full and 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.689
 be quite fair if you do not like that 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.450
 or such a pc gamer since and on the 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.100
 newest graphics card will put in the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.920
 For example, there were the best games 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.110
 destiny to see from activision that 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.380
 best pc game was battlefield 4 that 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.649
 best sports fifa 14 and who wonders 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.479
 the best roleplaying game was elder scrolls 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.220
 online for me but also maybe one 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.590
 very little bit because again 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.840
 three only in the business area held up 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.710
 had and you in the public area 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.850
 only to win a t shirt 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.979
 ever did elder scrolls 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.979
 online not just friends with that 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.569
 future financing model namely 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.790
 besides that you will buy the game 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.920
 still a monthly fee of 12 eur 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.470
 990 due 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.730
 and microtransactions , it should also be 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.770
 meanwhile play in the game 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.870
 if that is the right way then his 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.690
 dare to inspire fans now completely 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.610
 just to doubt it 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.950
 next to the missing date released 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.670
 xbox when does everything have one in front of me 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.730
 annoyed and that 340,000 trade fair visitors 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.010
 had to quasi his legs in the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.230
 floor until they finally stand up 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.780
 demo could play that are 23 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.220
 percent more than we will do in 2012 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.580
 Visitors counted and should 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.760
 allegedly nearly 29,000 600 trade visitors 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.459
 of which probably 18,000 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.860
 players were like me and another 5,000 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.900
 teenagers and 5000 wildcards came to 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.360
 that also meant the trade visitor day 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.890
 was not a decent to 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.620
 game and no ordinary 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.780
 Reporting for you as possible 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.180
 But can it be that gamer 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.080
 and fans for several hours on the way 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.299
 to go to Cologne 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.430
 several hours at the entrance snake 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.080
 and then another four or five 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.600
 hours have to wait around one 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.640
 To play a 15-minute demo I think 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.100
 that's the biggest trouble for those 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.019
 normal fans did not really come to me 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.000
 thing who did not have the luck like me 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.920
 to play in the community lounge 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.350
 had any vip pass or something 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.170
 he had a hell of a lot to do with it 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.820
 wait to wait and again 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.989
 waiting 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.570
 It was a very nice one for me 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.150
 gamescom 2013 but also a lot 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.359
 exhausting with the performances at rock 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.459
 Do it with a lot of youtube 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.989
 of friends and fans was of course the 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.150
 still working for electronic arts 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.310
 foreground what I was also very happy 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.290
 has that just because with the team 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.930
 could belong and just stop 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.670
 Thanks a lot to uwe marohn the 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.250
 me the complete gamescom as 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.500
 cameraman has accompanied and pretty much 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.530
 every single one we are currently in 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.630
 Capturing video has captured it was accurate 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.489
 this work the gamescom somehow 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.170
 This time to something special or too 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.120
 have done something else and that 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.340
 I had also wanted exactly so 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.440
 not just from games to report or 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.479
 not only fanatic but to make 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.669
 really in the middle of the concrete goal 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.500
 to be the fair and the whole thing again 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.080
 from a 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.880
 extended perspective to experience 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.620
 end it was then I think this mix 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.590
 Just go down to the 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.770
 hall games allude meet people and 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.330
 then back up again 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.760
 Conduct interviewing things 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.650
 cut things for you on the spot 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.820
 that gamescom easy to one 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.980
 Highlight made for me 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.750
 the most common ask me on the 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.660
 gamescom but also now afterwards 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.830
 was was actually which game has 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.240
 I liked the most or which one 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.650
 console you will definitely be 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.330
 buy and I can say easy now 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.580
 of the games actually has me 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.010
 did the most 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.810
 then we have the awards for 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.970
 best console game and best next 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.100
 Gamer cleared up and lost 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.380
 it was just such a game with me 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.120
 I would have least expected 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.520
 say something and then what with me 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.440
 play totally excited because it 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.150
 somehow such a mixture was already one 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.980
 a little out of call of duty because that is 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.080
 yes, the roots of respawn entertainment 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.330
 but just a very cool mix 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.000
 somehow with themes of halo crysis 3 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.340
 the titans that are missing from the sky and so on 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.040
 So I have to say that will get me in the 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.500
 multiplayer in any case soon 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.440
 Of course I find myself simply 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.919
 which is really interesting is which 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.020
 your gamescom 2013 has been highlight 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.130
 was it a particular game or was it? 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.890
 that you might be the new playstation 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.169
 4 could try it was one 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.580
 meet with a popular youtube or 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.440
 maybe just that you are with 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.810
 have met with you guys 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.210
 otherwise I always gamble that for 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.770
 most of us the gamescom 2013 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.330
 a real highlight was i have 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.229
 really nobody did not hit 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
 was enthusiastic 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:03.490
 because we did not have fun 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.650
 all really fix and after days 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.270
 done so we had so much to do 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.160
 we walked so much i believe 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.410
 Everyone has the plate feet everyone was 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.630
 sweaty ko the dark circles were from 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.340
 It went deeper day by day, but still it went 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.669
 there simply with an enthusiasm the 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.340
 fun to describe the bad 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.020
 I would be easy for 2014, however 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.970
 wish the organizers the 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.370
 publishes a new system 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.650
 would come up with it completely 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.229
 just the fans 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.620
 the players are not the normal gamer 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.820
 more so much snake have to stand 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.979
 I could just go now 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.169
 Enjoy a few days of rest 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:42.270
 last pictures from the gamescom of 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:44.759
 electronic arts from the community lounge 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.740
 from the rocket books on the we 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:49.259
 just things in the crowd fired 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.030
 have and I hope this little one 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:53.759
 collage with pictures of the 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.410
 gamescom 2013 has pleased you again 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.750
 I say in any case, very warm 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:01.370
 has been watching you for it until next 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.370
 year and skin in
