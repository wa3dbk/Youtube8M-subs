00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.990
 it's him 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.700
 it was you who was shot probably 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.040
 museum will 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.040
 the loiret 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.510
 st 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.300
 I saw that you had horizon that a 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.210
 little different or not around 5-6 years old I 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.100
 wanted to discover from inside this 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.060
 universe and then I do not have the game it's 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.850
 not let go of the piece 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.140
 I made rugby by chance I fell 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.880
 on the rugby stand in my city 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.530
 if I was slower than the others 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.720
 so it's inevitably the coach 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.050
 said come come I came and then that 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.050
 pleased me 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.510
 wrongly 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.960
 and what's actually to make the thumb 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.590
 this collision between each members 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.200
 of team it actually happens already the good ones 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.030
 results it helps 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.260
 it goes through an atmosphere I think 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.110
 that they maintained by the cloakroom 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.390
 by the players executives we will say and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.720
 then a spirit that reigns in this 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.250
 team 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.510
 they did things together in 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.580
 outside the field we find ourselves for 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.040
 eat find to do things 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.650
 so it goes beyond the scope of the job what 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.930
 it's not really an essay for me 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.600
 I found a group that evolved 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.790
 obviously but who nevertheless knew 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.840
 to rely on these principles there it is 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.720
 to there I think that's what makes 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.040
 what not to lose in any case on 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.470
 on the next seasons because 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.440
 that's the strength of the word 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.030
 and almost a calf Ã  la plancha with 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.680
 from small vegetables to rock and to the last 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.730
 moment but that in a paste amic I 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.730
 wish you a good appetite thank you 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:05.850
 and my cooking for me I 'm created that 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.610
 this is it happens but he must with 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.370
 them since the eyes it's even a 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.330
 coming months we will say how 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.500
 often I start with full 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.430
 of intentions and then after that's the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.459
 sometimes result that is enough 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.459
 surprising 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.450
 but from a 10-15 finally how do you see 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.599
 so I think we each have our 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.080
 project in line of sight more or less 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.310
 concrete let's say now the big 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.680
 question is do I 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.640
 succeed my career really is it 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.440
 I will have the means to do what 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.530
 I want and do I'll 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.530
 arrive 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.950
 it is necessary that we guess both flavors and 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.520
 different fellering 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.459
 here I wanted to go back to each one a 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.750
 little cap 1 gentlemen is that you 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.239
 go eat it with his series that does not 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.010
 cheating on the faith 65 finds out who 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.050
 will be the closest to the flavors will go into 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.050
 final for the 2nd the second challenge 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:22.670
 violent fighting 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.400
 I am 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.430
 oddly 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.430
 but 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.600
 in a center ie6 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.600
 his modesty feels very bad 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:03.489
 you know I'm not good 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.430
 in which case it will be very good that 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:21.799
 can approach servers here 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:21.799

 with a light cream and strawberries 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.340
 you have a minute 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.760
 good if I say it's the laden way 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.760
 publico

 valet 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.140
 the cross 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.279
 I wanted to be gallant and 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:04.210
 kindness but I think it's true 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:07.599
 by boat if the facts are there dupouy 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.270
 until the overflow of the state is here 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.400
 still watching the Mikado 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.080
 play grandparents gifts and 16th 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.520

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.800
 nuggets 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.499

 consolation prize will take two places 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:25.810
 we just saw two against biarritz 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:28.379
 I hope that consoled parliament I have very 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.379
 quick 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:30.689
 at 

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:40.379
 if it is of course the gifts and sweets 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.550

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.890

 who is very friendly who has been 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.460
 curious to discover a little our 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.400
 universe when one has the opportunity to 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.370
 meet a supporter like that in 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.130
 outside atx standard context or sport 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.480
 we 'll just be a little bit more 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.730
 account of what people expect 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.690
 so gives a real encounter a real 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.370
 time of sharing 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.370
 and then usability 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:16.689
 okay 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.689
