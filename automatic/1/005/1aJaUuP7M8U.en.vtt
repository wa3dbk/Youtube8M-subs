00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
then as you can see I've already set my

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.700 
then as you can see I've already set my
similarity<00:01:44.369> at<00:01:44.460> 193<00:01:44.909> my<00:01:45.299> blends<00:01:45.540> at<00:01:45.720> 80<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.140> my

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
similarity at 193 my blends at 80 and my

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.819 
similarity at 193 my blends at 80 and my
spill<00:01:46.920> reductions<00:01:47.369> at<00:01:47.490> 50<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.380> totally

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
spill reductions at 50 and this totally

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.590 
spill reductions at 50 and this totally
gets<00:01:50.009> rid<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.250> whatever's<00:01:50.610> behind<00:01:50.759> me<00:01:51.090> so

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
gets rid of whatever's behind me so

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.139 
gets rid of whatever's behind me so
that's<00:01:51.750> really<00:01:51.960> cool<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:53.430> lighting<00:01:53.790> also

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
that's really cool the lighting also

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.359 
that's really cool the lighting also
helps<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.750> see<00:01:54.869> here<00:01:55.110> make<00:01:55.799> makes<00:01:56.189> me

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
helps as you can see here make makes me

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.179 
helps as you can see here make makes me
nice<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:56.939> bright<00:01:57.299> brings<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.500> color<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.009> me

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
nice and bright brings the color and me

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.109 
nice and bright brings the color and me
out<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.549> not<00:01:59.670> green<00:02:00.200> with<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.320> lights<00:02:01.530> on

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
out that's not green with the lights on

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.200 
out that's not green with the lights on
it<00:02:03.119> does<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.780> when<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> lights<00:02:04.170> off<00:02:05.210> I'm

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
it does that and when the lights off I'm

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.280 
it does that and when the lights off I'm
not<00:02:06.450> going<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.719> up<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.930> shut<00:02:07.079> them<00:02:07.200> off

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
not going to get up and shut them off

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.410 
not going to get up and shut them off
but<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.039> imagine<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.520> without<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
but you can imagine that without the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.089 
but you can imagine that without the
lighting<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:09.840> me<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.319> actually<00:02:10.770> starts<00:02:11.069> to

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
lighting on me and actually starts to

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.400 
lighting on me and actually starts to
take<00:02:11.310> some<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.670> color<00:02:11.790> out<00:02:12.120> of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
take some of the color out of

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.830 
take some of the color out of
my<00:02:13.920> clothes<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.760> my<00:02:14.820> face<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.570> stuff<00:02:15.720> like

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
my clothes and my face and stuff like

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.210 
my clothes and my face and stuff like
that<00:02:16.050> because<00:02:16.200> it's<00:02:16.470> really<00:02:16.620> hard<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.040> tell

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
that because it's really hard to tell

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.010 
that because it's really hard to tell
what's<00:02:17.550> what

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
what's what

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
this is where you're going to have to be

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.270 
this is where you're going to have to be
messing<00:03:10.230> with<00:03:10.380> your<00:03:10.620> blend<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.160> your

messing with your blend and your

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.820 
messing with your blend and your
similarity<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:11.970> lot<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:13.200> try<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.470> get<00:03:13.650> rid<00:03:13.800> of

similarity a lot to try to get rid of

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.640 
similarity a lot to try to get rid of
that<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.810> let's<00:03:15.930> go<00:03:16.050> ahead<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.200> take<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:16.380> up<00:03:16.500> to

100 as you can see the t-rex is
completely<00:03:19.410> gone<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:19.860> we<00:03:20.040> went<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.280> little<00:03:20.310> bit

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
completely gone so we went a little bit

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.360 
completely gone so we went a little bit
too<00:03:20.940> far<00:03:21.270> with<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.500> similarity<00:03:23.070> so<00:03:23.220> let's

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
too far with the similarity so let's

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.520 
too far with the similarity so let's
just<00:03:23.550> set<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.790> at<00:03:23.880> 50<00:03:24.240> and<00:03:24.270> let's<00:03:24.510> see<00:03:24.720> where

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
just set it at 50 and let's see where

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.530 
just set it at 50 and let's see where
that<00:03:25.560> gets<00:03:25.890> us<00:03:28.190> okay<00:03:29.190> as<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:30.180> can<00:03:30.300> see<00:03:30.420> the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
that gets us okay as you can see the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.390

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
that's how you're going to chroma key

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.330 
that's how you're going to chroma key
stuff<00:03:52.170> in<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:52.440> out<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.620> guys<00:03:52.770> this<00:03:52.980> works<00:03:53.190> for

stuff in and out the guys this works for
any<00:03:53.520> color<00:03:53.790> just<00:03:54.060> not<00:03:54.300> green-screen<00:03:55.040> if<00:03:56.040> you

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
any color just not green-screen if you

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.800 
any color just not green-screen if you
guys<00:03:56.400> know<00:03:56.610> my<00:03:56.760> stream<00:03:57.090> let's<00:03:57.450> go<00:03:57.570> ahead<00:03:57.630> and

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
guys know my stream let's go ahead and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.699 
guys know my stream let's go ahead and
bring<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.080> up<00:03:58.200> right<00:03:58.380> here<00:03:58.700> actually<00:04:00.320> on<00:04:01.320> my

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
bring it up right here actually on my

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.170 
bring it up right here actually on my
stream<00:04:02.160> here<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:03.600> Aurora<00:04:04.020> sign<00:04:04.640> actually<00:04:05.640> has

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
stream here the Aurora sign actually has

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.590 
stream here the Aurora sign actually has
I<00:04:06.930> think<00:04:07.500> it's<00:04:07.620> white<00:04:08.160> color<00:04:08.520> not<00:04:09.209> white<00:04:09.450> I

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
I think it's white color not white I

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.960 
I think it's white color not white I
think<00:04:09.780> it's<00:04:09.870> blue<00:04:10.140> behind<00:04:10.410> it<00:04:10.740> actually<00:04:11.130> so

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
think it's blue behind it actually so

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.940 
think it's blue behind it actually so
the<00:04:12.090> like<00:04:12.240> this<00:04:12.600> whole<00:04:12.840> area<00:04:13.320> back<00:04:13.500> here<00:04:13.560> is

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
the like this whole area back here is

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.949 
the like this whole area back here is
actually<00:04:14.250> all<00:04:14.400> blue<00:04:14.730> but<00:04:15.330> what<00:04:15.450> I<00:04:15.480> did<00:04:15.750> was<00:04:15.930> I

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
actually all blue but what I did was I

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.080 
actually all blue but what I did was I
chroma<00:04:16.350> keyed<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.799> out<00:04:16.980> currently<00:04:17.760> keep<00:04:17.910> that

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
chroma keyed it out currently keep that

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.330 
chroma keyed it out currently keep that
blue<00:04:18.330> completely<00:04:18.900> out<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:19.830> you<00:04:19.920> see<00:04:20.220> the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
blue completely out so you see the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.340 
blue completely out so you see the
yellow<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.820> purple<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.390> little<00:04:21.690> bit<00:04:22.109> of<00:04:22.200> hint

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
yellow the purple a little bit of hint

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.890 
yellow the purple a little bit of hint
of<00:04:22.470> green<00:04:22.770> in<00:04:22.919> there<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.850> white<00:04:24.060> so

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
of green in there and the white so

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.200 
of green in there and the white so
there's<00:04:25.080> it<00:04:25.410> could<00:04:25.470> work<00:04:25.800> with<00:04:26.040> any<00:04:26.310> color

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
there's it could work with any color

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.439 
there's it could work with any color
just<00:04:27.419> green-screen<00:04:28.020> is<00:04:29.030> definitely<00:04:30.030> more

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
just green-screen is definitely more

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.559 
just green-screen is definitely more
useful<00:04:31.319> for<00:04:31.500> videos<00:04:31.830> but<00:04:32.699> anything<00:04:33.210> picture

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
useful for videos but anything picture

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.090 
useful for videos but anything picture
wise<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:33.990> can<00:04:34.020> pretty<00:04:34.319> much<00:04:34.410> get<00:04:34.710> rid<00:04:34.860> of<00:04:34.889> it

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
wise you can pretty much get rid of it

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.339 
wise you can pretty much get rid of it
