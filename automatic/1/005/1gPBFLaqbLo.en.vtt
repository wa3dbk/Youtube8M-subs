00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:06.240
 JÃ¶rn Walter I've been at the beginning of the XXI I've been pretty cool stunts myself 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.240
 I do not have a Mike Westerwald Ellwanger machine running 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.639
 finally we are not really much it is the Hesse not crowded 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.049
 are spread 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.240
 That's why I thought about it 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.400
 but sometimes it is thin there are many people now 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.400
 the search for expected but just had no 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.299
 Maybe I'll explain you in another video how to do that 

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:31.460
 doing with the buddy was playing on a hammer Schiesser 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.390
 but now I have it all 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.680
 so Dr 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.680
 like that from the new mode 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.190
 dpa that is 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.400
 for him there 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.420
 this is you my area now 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.520
 what would my friend have written 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.480
 no matter at this year at Asus, private gave the promise 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.580
 here will be 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.700
 his stuff come Soderling not my friend released the server 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.920
 burned tree 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.550
 and you have 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.550
 So I go now to eliminate the others changed 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.890
 In this country I am here 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.770
 Care is here 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.270
 You are acting and it is still unclear 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.530
 as I said it has cracks 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.159
 stranded now 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.159
 and already stranded writes and is at the end 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.359
 Likewise 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.369
 Anyway, Woolley is going down a lot, some are not yet generated 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.610
 and again way no matter 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.980
 at least that's how he looks around 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.630
 Hattersheim on 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.630
 that's how it looks on 1 overall 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.340
 beside Dr himself from the Main Kreft 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.790
 Jens Lehmann's online game the problem is unfortunately only the himself is 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.080
 Now finally online and it will be as far as possible 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.690
 I 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.919
 how long does a person lengthen? 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.650
 Mischa is on the server to build a wear 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.209
 But I had to be open to myself, but I had to be one of you 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.079
 types 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.629
 That was just us 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.029
 chance 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:27.029
 that had risen is all burning after taking off 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.959
 and so on 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.439
 No matter now back to my Sarwar 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.970
 So Mainzer was very likely 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.099
 Do not run all day so if it's good 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.899
 Fischer and so Arp 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.899
 no idea percent 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:47.919
 yes 12 o'clock 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.509
 Environmental issues are ongoing 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:55.369
 &amp; Cie yes I do not have a bad percent with all too well known managers 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:57.169
 If I believe it will be nothing 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:58.770
 it can not be that we do that 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.719
 so far was to 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.489
 Kick brings 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.749
 I'm looking for a good looking game with 16 he is looking good 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:07.499
 also one 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:09.359
 St 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.339
 Corey 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:14.129
 King really everything from no matter very relaxed has no Christmas carols 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.549
 Can write 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.419
 next to or Siska misses 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.419
 he himself becomes one 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.379
 it will not affect the VP 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.029
 and destined to be like Wenzel's table and dyed but now too general 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:36.149
 Not 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:39.149
 the Serb has 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.309
 So he will not 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.779
 be active all the time 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:47.779
 the food agreed here 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.370
 In any case, content is always 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.370
 what did it matter 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.459
 individually again Single Player Franken costs 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:03.069
 as I said it is shameful there is 1 1 he is not now 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.239
 leash 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.679
 and if you keep writing on the Zeller like they already do in the 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:08.899
 Comments 

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:10.029
 around 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:14.039
 I was there and then beheaded after that write your name 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:19.549
 Rage will release Change of the White Lists to inform 50 Latvian Precht 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.629
 with the DTM for majorities 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:27.080
 if that too over the top, he'll still be running to the grave 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.550
 do so in the Orber work 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.350
 on 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.570
 Speaking of editing how can with SAP is not like that 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.409
 beautiful world youth 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:38.849
 around 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.969
 in any case 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.969
 that's what already 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.400
 then skin he forgot recklessly and can still write a letter also in Abu 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.939
 Dhabi leave 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.469
