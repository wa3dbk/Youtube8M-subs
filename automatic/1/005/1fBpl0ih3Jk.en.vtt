00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
like maybe two or three weeks ago and

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.100 
like maybe two or three weeks ago and
I'm<00:03:48.150> just<00:03:48.180> barely<00:03:48.540> getting<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:49.080> it<00:03:49.640> but<00:03:50.640> uh

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
I'm just barely getting to it but uh

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.360 
I'm just barely getting to it but uh
yeah<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.140> bought<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.560> season<00:03:52.740> pass<00:03:52.920> and

hopefully<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.880> last<00:03:53.910> DLC<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.600> comes<00:03:54.900> out<00:03:55.050> is

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
hopefully the last DLC that comes out is

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.540 
hopefully the last DLC that comes out is
really<00:03:55.350> nice<00:03:55.650> because<00:03:55.860> I<00:03:56.010> didn't<00:03:56.340> think<00:03:56.400> the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
really nice because I didn't think the

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.390 
really nice because I didn't think the
Phoenix<00:03:56.910> Rising<00:03:57.390> was<00:03:57.660> all<00:03:57.780> that<00:03:58.020> good<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.530> mean

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
Phoenix Rising was all that good I mean

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.950 
Phoenix Rising was all that good I mean
the<00:03:59.520> Horde<00:03:59.730> command<00:04:00.090> fact<00:04:00.300> that<00:04:00.480> was<00:04:00.600> great

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
the Horde command fact that was great

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.160 
the Horde command fact that was great
the<00:04:01.460> what<00:04:02.460> was<00:04:02.550> at<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.730> ROM<00:04:02.910> shadow<00:04:03.240> that<00:04:04.020> was

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
the what was at the ROM shadow that was

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.660 
the what was at the ROM shadow that was
all<00:04:04.290> right<00:04:04.440> I<00:04:04.650> liked<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.040> for<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.250> campaign

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670

all right I liked it for the campaign
and<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:05.910> characters<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:07.110> chocolate

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
and the characters and the chocolate

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.220
