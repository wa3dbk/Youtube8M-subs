00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
hey everyone quick question why do

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.650 
hey everyone quick question why do
society's<00:00:06.870> consuming<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.770> most<00:00:08.069> meat<00:00:08.660> and

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
society's consuming the most meat and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.390 
society's consuming the most meat and
dairy<00:00:10.110> have<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.650> highest<00:00:10.980> levels<00:00:11.280> of

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
dairy have the highest levels of

dairy have the highest levels of
osteoporosis<00:00:12.080> isn't<00:00:13.080> calcium<00:00:13.559> supposed<00:00:13.860> to

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
osteoporosis isn't calcium supposed to

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.709 
osteoporosis isn't calcium supposed to
be<00:00:14.070> good<00:00:14.219> for<00:00:14.429> us<00:00:14.549> drink<00:00:14.969> our<00:00:15.120> milk<00:00:15.330> get<00:00:15.599> our

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
be good for us drink our milk get our

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.410 
be good for us drink our milk get our
calcium<00:00:16.010> that's<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.220> we're<00:00:17.400> told<00:00:17.609> but<00:00:17.940> that

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
calcium that's what we're told but that

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.760 
calcium that's what we're told but that
couldn't<00:00:18.660> be<00:00:18.720> further<00:00:18.810> from<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.380> truth<00:00:19.410> so

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
couldn't be further from the truth so

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.300 
couldn't be further from the truth so
today<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.039> want<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.279> talk<00:00:20.430> about<00:00:21.320> pH<00:00:22.320> pH<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
today I want to talk about pH pH in the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.730 
today I want to talk about pH pH in the
body<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:24.650> why<00:00:25.650> eating<00:00:25.980> acidic<00:00:26.519> foods<00:00:26.820> causes

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
body and why eating acidic foods causes

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.800 
body and why eating acidic foods causes
your<00:00:28.740> bones<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.220> deteriorate<00:00:29.849> over<00:00:29.880> time<00:00:30.420> and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
your bones to deteriorate over time and

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.089 
your bones to deteriorate over time and
cause<00:00:30.990> symptoms<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:31.650> osteoporosis

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
cause symptoms like osteoporosis

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.850 
cause symptoms like osteoporosis
arthritis<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.690> forth

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
arthritis and so forth

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.270 
arthritis and so forth
basically<00:00:35.820> your<00:00:36.270> pH<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.079> your<00:00:37.200> body<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.829> always

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
basically your pH in your body is always

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.369 
basically your pH in your body is always
between<00:00:38.700> seven<00:00:39.149> point<00:00:39.360> three<00:00:39.450> five<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:39.989> seven

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
between seven point three five and seven

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.340 
between seven point three five and seven
point<00:00:40.680> four<00:00:40.920> five<00:00:41.390> slightly<00:00:42.390> alkaline<00:00:42.750> pH

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
point four five slightly alkaline pH

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.910 
point four five slightly alkaline pH
scale<00:00:43.620> ranges<00:00:44.040> from<00:00:44.160> 1<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.850> 14<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.800> when<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
scale ranges from 1 to 14 so when you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.330 
scale ranges from 1 to 14 so when you
eat<00:00:47.160> highly<00:00:48.059> acidic<00:00:48.329> foods<00:00:48.780> like<00:00:49.170> meat<00:00:49.680> dairy

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
eat highly acidic foods like meat dairy

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.310 
eat highly acidic foods like meat dairy
processed<00:00:51.270> foods<00:00:51.600> coffee<00:00:52.460> things<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.640> that

those are those are lower on the on the
ph<00:00:57.989> scale<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.680> anywhere<00:00:59.039> from<00:00:59.280> 1<00:01:00.149> 3<00:01:00.840> 4<00:01:01.260> 5

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
ph scale you know anywhere from 1 3 4 5

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.160 
ph scale you know anywhere from 1 3 4 5
depending<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.699> food<00:01:03.080> when<00:01:04.080> you

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
depending on the on the food when you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.070 
depending on the on the food when you
eat<00:01:04.700> alkaline<00:01:05.700> foods<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.420> fruits<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
eat alkaline foods like fruits and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.899 
eat alkaline foods like fruits and
vegetables<00:01:07.710> that's<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.670> higher<00:01:08.880> on

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
vegetables that's going to be higher on

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.870 
vegetables that's going to be higher on
the<00:01:09.180> ph<00:01:09.450> scale<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:11.250> middle<00:01:11.490> range<00:01:11.700> is

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
the ph scale the middle range is

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.000 
the ph scale the middle range is
obviously<00:01:12.210> 7<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.170> our<00:01:13.380> blood<00:01:13.650> remains

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
obviously 7 so our blood remains

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.160 
obviously 7 so our blood remains
slightly<00:01:14.520> alkaline<00:01:14.900> 7.35<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> 7.45<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> when

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
slightly alkaline 7.35 to 7.45 so when

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.499 
slightly alkaline 7.35 to 7.45 so when
we<00:01:19.320> eat<00:01:19.500> acidic<00:01:19.979> foods<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.490> happens<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.060> our

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
we eat acidic foods what happens is our

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.539 
we eat acidic foods what happens is our
body<00:01:21.780> has<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.409> remain<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.920> range<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
body has to remain in that range the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.560 
body has to remain in that range the
7.35<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> 7.45<00:01:25.409> range<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.159> when<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.820> eat<00:01:27.030> acidic

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
7.35 to 7.45 range so when we eat acidic

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.230 
7.35 to 7.45 range so when we eat acidic
foods<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:28.020> meat<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.290> dairy<00:01:28.710> our<00:01:29.490> body<00:01:29.820> has

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
foods like meat and dairy our body has

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.210 
foods like meat and dairy our body has
to<00:01:30.509> overcompensate<00:01:31.110> what<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.650> does<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.070> it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
to overcompensate what that does is it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.100 
to overcompensate what that does is it
strips<00:01:32.520> healthy<00:01:32.939> minerals<00:01:33.180> from<00:01:33.600> our<00:01:33.810> body

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
strips healthy minerals from our body

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.910 
strips healthy minerals from our body
like<00:01:34.920> calcium<00:01:35.509> to<00:01:36.509> keep<00:01:36.840> our<00:01:37.110> pH<00:01:37.409> levels<00:01:37.829> in

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
like calcium to keep our pH levels in

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.910 
like calcium to keep our pH levels in
check<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.369> over<00:01:38.670> time<00:01:39.170> when<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.259> eat<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> highly

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
check so over time when you eat a highly

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.149 
check so over time when you eat a highly
acidic<00:01:41.220> diet<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:42.030> meat<00:01:42.960> dairy<00:01:43.380> processed

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
acidic diet of meat dairy processed

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.370 
acidic diet of meat dairy processed
foods<00:01:44.460> your<00:01:45.119> body<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.689> constantly

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
foods your body is just constantly

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.230 
foods your body is just constantly
stripping<00:01:46.860> healthy<00:01:47.490> minerals<00:01:47.909> from<00:01:48.030> your

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
stripping healthy minerals from your

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.020 
stripping healthy minerals from your
body<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:49.439> you're<00:01:49.590> basically<00:01:50.009> pissing<00:01:50.880> your

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
body and you're basically pissing your

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.440 
body and you're basically pissing your
bones<00:01:51.270> away<00:01:51.659> over<00:01:52.079> time<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:53.189> few<00:01:53.640> years<00:01:53.880> ago<00:01:54.060> I

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
bones away over time a few years ago I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.480 
bones away over time a few years ago I
saw<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> great<00:01:55.079> video<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.560> YouTube<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.369> I'll
