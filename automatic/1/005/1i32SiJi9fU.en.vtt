other parts that head busted is it's
missing<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.929> switch<00:00:10.190> that's<00:00:11.190> what<00:00:11.549> it<00:00:11.639> looks

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
missing a switch that's what it looks

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.180 
missing a switch that's what it looks
like<00:00:11.879> inside<00:00:12.299> there<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.500> lately<00:00:13.799> I've

like inside there so lately I've
actually<00:00:14.549> been<00:00:14.879> jumping<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> connection

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
actually been jumping the connection

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.230 
actually been jumping the connection
across<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:17.070> was<00:00:17.190> turret<00:00:17.519> arrow<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.910> also<00:00:18.119> get

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
across it was turret arrow and also get

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.439 
across it was turret arrow and also get
it<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> start<00:00:18.689> but<00:00:19.350> today<00:00:19.590> I've<00:00:19.920> got<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.100> new

it to start but today I've got a new

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.490 
it to start but today I've got a new
switch<00:00:21.449> group<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:21.930> want<00:00:22.019> to<00:00:22.140> see<00:00:22.260> what<00:00:22.410> it

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
switch group and I want to see what it

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.160 
switch group and I want to see what it
takes<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.740> put<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.330> okay<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.759 
takes to put it on okay so this is the
new<00:00:25.439> switch<00:00:26.900> it's<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.109> part<00:00:28.380> that's<00:00:28.590> busted

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
new switch it's this part that's busted

off of ebay and it looks nice is looking
at<00:00:39.210> what<00:00:39.329> type<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.539> parts<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:39.870> these<00:00:40.050> two

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
at what type of parts so these two

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.350 
at what type of parts so these two
connections<00:00:41.610> here<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.090> really

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
connections here going to be really

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.389 
connections here going to be really
simple<00:00:42.600> they<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:42.840> go<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> brake<00:00:44.129> lever

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
simple they just go to the brake lever

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.250 
simple they just go to the brake lever
to<00:00:44.910> make<00:00:45.059> sure<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> brake<00:00:45.450> lights<00:00:45.780> come<00:00:46.230> on

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
to make sure the brake lights come on

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.660 
to make sure the brake lights come on
and<00:00:46.620> make<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:49.340> there<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.430> go<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.449> then

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
and make it so there you go and then

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.130 
and make it so there you go and then
this<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> main

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
this one is going to be the main

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.290 
this one is going to be the main
connector<00:00:55.789> that<00:00:56.789> we're<00:00:56.879> going<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.210> to

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
connector that we're going to have to

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.840 
connector that we're going to have to
hunt<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.719> there<00:00:57.899> there's<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.670> fasten<00:00:59.670> down

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
hunt in there there's a fasten down

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.240 
hunt in there there's a fasten down
thing<00:01:00.510> I'll<00:01:01.289> show<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.530> where<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.769> is<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
thing I'll show you where that is in a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.040 
thing I'll show you where that is in a
second<00:01:04.190> okay<00:01:05.190> so<00:01:05.250> back<00:01:05.640> at<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> switch<00:01:06.120> if<00:01:06.420> we

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
second okay so back at the switch if we

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.230 
second okay so back at the switch if we
look<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.530> right<00:01:08.810> here<00:01:10.220> right<00:01:11.220> here<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:12.180> is

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
look in right here right here this is

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.150 
look in right here right here this is
the<00:01:12.480> connector<00:01:13.080> those<00:01:13.650> two<00:01:13.860> little

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
the connector those two little

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.590 
the connector those two little
connectors<00:01:14.550> we<00:01:14.700> were<00:01:14.820> looking<00:01:15.120> at<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.450> those

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
connectors we were looking at so those

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.350 
connectors we were looking at so those
will<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.960> unplug<00:01:16.910> attaching<00:01:17.910> to<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> right

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
will just unplug attaching to the right

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.170 
will just unplug attaching to the right
brake<00:01:18.540> handlebar<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.490> look<00:01:20.520> down

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
brake handlebar and then if we look down

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.300 
brake handlebar and then if we look down
inside<00:01:21.570> here<00:01:22.440> you'll<00:01:22.620> see<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> connector

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
inside here you'll see the connector

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.550 
inside here you'll see the connector
we're<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.550> to<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.760> to<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:24.960> one

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
we're going to have to get to that one

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.520 
we're going to have to get to that one
now<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:27.090> may<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.480> to<00:01:27.630> end<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:27.900> taking<00:01:28.140> off<00:01:28.410> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
now I may have to end up taking off the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.930 
now I may have to end up taking off the
fairings<00:01:28.830> in<00:01:28.980> tank<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.460> we'll<00:01:29.580> see<00:01:29.700> how<00:01:29.730> far

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
fairings in tank but we'll see how far

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.540 
fairings in tank but we'll see how far
we<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.210> get<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:31.100> weaseling<00:01:32.100> something<00:01:32.430> down

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
we can get just weaseling something down

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.870 
we can get just weaseling something down
in<00:01:32.700> there<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:34.190> that<00:01:35.190> connector<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
in there but that is that connector and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.270 
in there but that is that connector and
then<00:01:35.970> downstream<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.260> within<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
then downstream with that so within the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.370 
then downstream with that so within the
two<00:01:38.430> underneath<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> tank<00:01:39.270> area<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.840> where

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
two underneath the tank area is where

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.490 
two underneath the tank area is where
that<00:01:40.860> connection<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.120> going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.330> be<00:01:42.440> okay<00:01:43.440> so

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that connection is going to be okay so

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.620 
that connection is going to be okay so
here's<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.280> Allen<00:01:44.610> ratchet<00:01:44.880> used<00:01:45.150> it<00:01:45.390> was<00:01:45.510> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
here's the Allen ratchet used it was a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.080 
here's the Allen ratchet used it was a
six<00:01:45.930> sixteen<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.400> good<00:01:47.520> news<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:47.910> I

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
six sixteen and the good news is that I

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.510 
six sixteen and the good news is that I
was<00:01:48.360> able<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.690> get<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.080> out<00:01:49.260> so<00:01:49.560> far<00:01:49.980> we'll<00:01:50.310> see

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
was able to get it out so far we'll see

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.040 
was able to get it out so far we'll see
how<00:01:50.760> much<00:01:50.970> farther<00:01:51.240> we<00:01:51.360> can<00:01:51.540> make<00:01:51.660> without

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
how much farther we can make without

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.200 
how much farther we can make without
having<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.650> pull<00:01:53.580> apart<00:01:53.700> everything<00:01:54.260> there<00:01:55.260> is

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
having to pull apart everything there is

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.850 
having to pull apart everything there is
the<00:01:57.210> Allen<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.140> see<00:01:58.260> I've<00:01:58.380> loosened<00:01:58.590> up

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the Allen you can see I've loosened up

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.060 
the Allen you can see I've loosened up
the<00:01:59.550> way<00:01:59.760> it<00:02:00.000> was<00:02:00.260> move<00:02:01.260> the<00:02:01.410> handle<00:02:01.710> bar<00:02:01.830> so

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
the way it was move the handle bar so

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.250 
the way it was move the handle bar so
ahead

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.010 

and<00:02:05.380> then<00:02:06.010> I<00:02:06.340> hand<00:02:06.730> can<00:02:06.880> fit<00:02:07.030> right<00:02:07.060> up<00:02:07.360> here

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
and then I hand can fit right up here

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.050 
and then I hand can fit right up here
and<00:02:08.490> I<00:02:09.490> can<00:02:09.700> access<00:02:09.940> with<00:02:10.930> the<00:02:11.050> L<00:02:11.200> down<00:02:11.470> I<00:02:11.500> can

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
and I can access with the L down I can

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.120 
and I can access with the L down I can
we<00:02:13.060> can<00:02:13.090> torque<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.570> open<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.050> I've<00:02:14.830> gotten

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
we can torque it open so I've gotten

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.030 
we can torque it open so I've gotten
that<00:02:15.250> loose<00:02:15.550> so<00:02:16.360> next<00:02:16.570> I'm<00:02:17.020> going<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.500> pull

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
that loose so next I'm going to pull

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.520 
that loose so next I'm going to pull
that<00:02:18.070> out<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.780> we'll<00:02:19.780> see<00:02:19.960> if<00:02:20.140> there's<00:02:20.320> any

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
that out and we'll see if there's any

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.440 
that out and we'll see if there's any
slack<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.220> connectors<00:02:21.640> just<00:02:21.880> downstream<00:02:22.360> of

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
slack the connectors just downstream of

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.940 
slack the connectors just downstream of
that<00:02:22.600> fitting<00:02:23.020> if<00:02:23.170> there's<00:02:23.350> any<00:02:23.500> slack<00:02:23.740> I'll

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
that fitting if there's any slack I'll

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.200 
that fitting if there's any slack I'll
pull<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.130> forward<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.580> where<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.730> can<00:02:24.910> see<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.060> if

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
pull it forward to where I can see it if

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.340 
pull it forward to where I can see it if
there's<00:02:25.390> not<00:02:25.510> I'll<00:02:25.780> still<00:02:26.020> have<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.200> remove

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
there's not I'll still have to remove

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.070 
there's not I'll still have to remove
the<00:02:26.500> tank<00:02:26.650> experience<00:02:27.780> okay

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
the tank experience okay

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.800 
the tank experience okay
just<00:02:29.800> buy<00:02:29.980> some<00:02:30.160> wiggling<00:02:30.490> in<00:02:30.640> there<00:02:30.880> got<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
just buy some wiggling in there got the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.850 
just buy some wiggling in there got the
connector<00:02:32.260> off<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:34.720> can<00:02:34.840> see<00:02:34.990> this<00:02:35.140> one<00:02:35.410> this

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
connector off you can see this one this

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.320 
connector off you can see this one this
presses<00:02:36.580> down<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:37.090> release<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.720> okay<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:39.010> next

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
presses down to release it okay so next

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.940 
presses down to release it okay so next
we're<00:02:40.330> going<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.480> take<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:41.050> look<00:02:41.410> at<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.710> back

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
we're going to take a look at the back

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.970 
we're going to take a look at the back
of<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.220> bars<00:02:42.510> here<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.780> can<00:02:43.930> see<00:02:44.110> we've

got right here right here so they are
there<00:02:47.410> we've<00:02:48.130> got<00:02:49.410> places<00:02:50.410> for<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.740> Phillips

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
there we've got places for a Phillips

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.530 
there we've got places for a Phillips
head<00:02:51.130> screwdriver<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.640> go<00:02:51.730> in<00:02:51.850> there<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:52.420> we're

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540

going to do that to release the
clamshell<00:02:54.810> okay<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:55.870> here<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.380> took<00:02:56.500> apart<00:02:56.980> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
clamshell okay so here I took apart the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.790 
clamshell okay so here I took apart the
the<00:02:58.420> new<00:02:58.630> piece<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.140> can<00:02:59.260> just<00:02:59.440> see<00:02:59.560> what<00:02:59.680> the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
the new piece you can just see what the

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.100 
the new piece you can just see what the
internals<00:03:00.190> look<00:03:00.340> like<00:03:00.520> this<00:03:01.270> is<00:03:01.480> where<00:03:01.720> the

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
internals look like this is where the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.750 
internals look like this is where the
throttle<00:03:02.320> cable<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.860> going<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.070> come<00:03:03.190> into<00:03:03.370> and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
throttle cable is going to come into and

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.490 
throttle cable is going to come into and
then<00:03:03.850> attach<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.800> throttle<00:03:06.040> tube<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:08.440> is

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
then attach to the throttle tube this is

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.040 
then attach to the throttle tube this is
the<00:03:08.680> on/off<00:03:09.310> switch<00:03:09.850> on<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.360> top<00:03:10.510> this<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.959> the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
the on/off switch on the top this is the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.050 
the on/off switch on the top this is the
ignition<00:03:11.610> button<00:03:13.200> right<00:03:14.200> there<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.940> then

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
ignition button right there and then

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.850 
ignition button right there and then
this<00:03:16.209> tube<00:03:16.630> of<00:03:16.840> course<00:03:17.110> slides<00:03:17.350> down<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.740> the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
this tube of course slides down to the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.630 
this tube of course slides down to the
handlebar<00:03:18.280> or<00:03:18.630> clip-on

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
handlebar or clip-on

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.670 
handlebar or clip-on
okay<00:03:21.640> so<00:03:21.700> I've<00:03:21.940> separated<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.480> top<00:03:22.680> it's

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
okay so I've separated the top it's

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.890 
okay so I've separated the top it's
ready<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.070> move<00:03:24.640> but<00:03:25.360> you<00:03:25.420> have<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.660> take<00:03:25.780> off

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
ready to move but you have to take off

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.390 
ready to move but you have to take off
the<00:03:26.050> bar<00:03:26.260> ends<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.739> course<00:03:26.950> that's<00:03:27.190> what's

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
the bar ends of course that's what's

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.430 
the bar ends of course that's what's
holding<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.880> tube<00:03:28.150> on<00:03:28.450> there<00:03:28.930> so<00:03:29.290> we<00:03:29.380> need

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
holding the tube on there so we need

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.530 
holding the tube on there so we need
another<00:03:29.560> Philips<00:03:30.040> head<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.370> unscrew<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.330> bar

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
another Philips head to unscrew the bar

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.310 
another Philips head to unscrew the bar
end<00:03:32.880> well<00:03:33.880> I'm<00:03:34.150> honestly<00:03:34.600> tell<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.020> I<00:03:35.110> leave

end well I'm honestly tell you I leave
my<00:03:35.500> bar<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:35.739> on<00:03:36.100> because<00:03:36.430> this<00:03:36.550> thing<00:03:36.760> is<00:03:36.790> so

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
my bar and on because this thing is so

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.750 
my bar and on because this thing is so
tight<00:03:37.690> on<00:03:37.900> there<00:03:38.350> it<00:03:39.070> was<00:03:39.280> bending<00:03:39.640> the

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
tight on there it was bending the

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.690 
tight on there it was bending the
screwdriver<00:03:40.239> but<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:41.610> separated<00:03:42.610> the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
screwdriver but I separated the

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.460 
screwdriver but I separated the
clamshells<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.360> you<00:03:43.420> can<00:03:43.540> see<00:03:43.690> how<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:43.959> the
