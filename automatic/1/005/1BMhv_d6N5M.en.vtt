the secret is is twisting the ribbon
sorry<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.930> five<00:01:14.110> mile<00:01:14.320> long<00:01:14.470> I<00:01:14.530> want<00:01:14.830> my<00:01:14.860> tail

to<00:01:15.340> be<00:01:15.870> and<00:01:16.870> I<00:01:17.020> twisted<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.590> I'm<00:01:17.710> going<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:17.890> make

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
to be and I twisted it I'm going to make

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.170 
to be and I twisted it I'm going to make
my<00:01:18.400> first<00:01:18.700> loop<00:01:19.120> and<00:01:19.420> you'll<00:01:19.630> notice<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.680> nice

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
my first loop and you'll notice the nice

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.730 
my first loop and you'll notice the nice
what<00:01:22.180> we<00:01:22.300> call<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.570> right<00:01:22.810> side<00:01:23.140> of<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.440> shiny

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
what we call the right side of the shiny

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.520 
what we call the right side of the shiny
side<00:01:24.100> in<00:01:24.460> this<00:01:24.880> case<00:01:25.150> of<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:25.720> ribbon<00:01:26.110> is<00:01:26.350> on

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
side in this case of the ribbon is on

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.640 
side in this case of the ribbon is on
top<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.490> that's<00:01:28.420> how<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:28.810> want<00:01:29.110> each<00:01:29.200> loop<00:01:29.440> to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
top and that's how you want each loop to

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.480 
top and that's how you want each loop to
be<00:01:29.680> and<00:01:30.430> I'm<00:01:30.580> twisting<00:01:31.090> it<00:01:31.180> again<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.500> making

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
be and I'm twisting it again and making

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.530 
be and I'm twisting it again and making
a<00:01:33.580> second<00:01:33.910> loop<00:01:34.120> twist<00:01:34.870> again<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.970> each<00:01:37.210> time

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
a second loop twist again so each time

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.110 
a second loop twist again so each time
I'm<00:01:37.750> twisting<00:01:38.260> it<00:01:38.410> so<00:01:38.680> that<00:01:38.890> I<00:01:39.100> get<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:42.120> right

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
I'm twisting it so that I get the right

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.890 
I'm twisting it so that I get the right
side<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.720> ribbon<00:01:46.830> on<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:47.980> outside<00:01:48.900> and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
side of the ribbon on the outside and

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.720 
side of the ribbon on the outside and
the<00:01:50.200> wrong<00:01:50.440> side<00:01:50.800> of<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.040> ribbon<00:01:51.310> is<00:01:51.460> on<00:01:51.640> the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
the wrong side of the ribbon is on the

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.870 
the wrong side of the ribbon is on the
inside<00:01:52.240> of<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.540> loop<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:54.460> might<00:01:54.640> want<00:01:54.820> to

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
inside of the loop you might want to

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.700 
inside of the loop you might want to
decide<00:01:55.210> ahead<00:01:55.390> of<00:01:55.570> time<00:01:55.660> how<00:01:56.110> many<00:01:56.170> loops<00:01:56.530> you

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
decide ahead of time how many loops you

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.380 
decide ahead of time how many loops you
want<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.190> want<00:01:57.430> an<00:01:57.550> even<00:01:57.820> number<00:01:58.300> loops<00:02:00.390> so

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
want you want an even number loops so

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:12.970 
want you want an even number loops so
right<00:02:01.660> now<00:02:01.900> I<00:02:01.930> get<00:02:02.260> twelve<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:04.230> let's<00:02:05.230> go<00:02:05.590> four

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.660 

then<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.219> cut<00:02:14.579> off<00:02:14.900> second<00:02:15.900> peel<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:17.310> we're

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
then I cut off second peel and we're

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.360 
then I cut off second peel and we're
done<00:02:17.879> with<00:02:17.939> the<00:02:18.269> ribbon<00:02:18.829> now<00:02:19.829> I'm<00:02:19.980> going<00:02:20.219> to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
done with the ribbon now I'm going to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.759 
done with the ribbon now I'm going to
take<00:02:20.579> the<00:02:20.730> pipe<00:02:20.969> cleaner<00:02:21.329> and<00:02:21.689> put<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.650> up

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
take the pipe cleaner and put it up

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.899 
take the pipe cleaner and put it up
through<00:02:23.659> between<00:02:24.659> my<00:02:25.019> fingers<00:02:25.499> so<00:02:26.249> now<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.459> have

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.220 
times now I'm going to cut it off
because<00:02:43.799> I'm<00:02:44.189> going<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.549> put<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.359> or<00:02:45.810> pretend

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
because I'm going to put this or pretend

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.920 
because I'm going to put this or pretend
I'm<00:02:46.319> going<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.620> put<00:02:46.769> it<00:02:46.859> on<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.069> package<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.900> I

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
I'm going to put it on a package so I

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.720 
I'm going to put it on a package so I
cut<00:02:49.260> those<00:02:49.409> off<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.799> wire<00:02:49.980> cutters<00:02:50.400> never

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
cut those off of the wire cutters never

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.229 
cut those off of the wire cutters never
use<00:02:50.939> scissors<00:02:51.239> always<00:02:51.750> use<00:02:51.900> wire<00:02:52.169> cutters<00:02:53.239> and

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
use scissors always use wire cutters and

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.539 
use scissors always use wire cutters and
at<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:54.989> point<00:02:55.379> I<00:02:55.590> would<00:02:55.889> tie<00:02:56.129> it<00:02:56.189> on<00:02:56.519> a

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
at this point I would tie it on a

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.899 
at this point I would tie it on a
package<00:02:57.150> before<00:02:57.419> fluffing<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.260> bow<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:59.459> I

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
package before fluffing the bow so I

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.059 
package before fluffing the bow so I
don't<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.989> package<00:03:01.409> right<00:03:01.560> now<00:03:01.709> because<00:03:01.889> I

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
don't have a package right now because I

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.199 
don't have a package right now because I
just<00:03:02.219> wanted<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.519> show<00:03:02.609> you<00:03:02.669> how<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:02.909> make<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
just wanted to show you how to make the

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.670 
just wanted to show you how to make the
balls<00:03:03.419> I'm<00:03:03.689> going<00:03:03.719> to<00:03:03.930> show<00:03:04.139> you<00:03:04.169> how<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.409> flip

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
balls I'm going to show you how to flip

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.050 
balls I'm going to show you how to flip
it<00:03:04.859> you<00:03:04.980> just<00:03:05.189> separate<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.969> loop<00:03:11.000> until<00:03:12.000> it

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
it you just separate the loop until it

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.330 
it you just separate the loop until it
looks<00:03:12.389> like<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:12.750> want<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.409> easier<00:03:13.889> when

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
looks like you want this is easier when

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.839 
looks like you want this is easier when
it's<00:03:14.489> sitting<00:03:14.759> on<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> package<00:03:15.629> already

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
it's sitting on a package already

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.809 
it's sitting on a package already
because<00:03:17.849> the<00:03:18.000> package<00:03:18.449> would<00:03:18.689> be<00:03:19.009> flat<00:03:20.009> and

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
because the package would be flat and

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.479 
because the package would be flat and
then<00:03:21.389> you<00:03:21.569> would<00:03:21.750> be<00:03:21.930> fluffing<00:03:22.859> it<00:03:22.979> as<00:03:23.129> you<00:03:23.280> go

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
then you would be fluffing it as you go

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.249 
then you would be fluffing it as you go
and<00:03:23.939> you<00:03:24.120> can<00:03:24.299> decide<00:03:24.659> how<00:03:24.689> long<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.079> want

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:25.259 
and you can decide how long you want

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:33.890 
and you can decide how long you want
your<00:03:25.500> tails<00:03:25.889> to<00:03:26.159> be<00:03:26.720> turn<00:03:27.720> them<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:33.540> you

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
your tails to be turn them on and you

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.899 
your tails to be turn them on and you
can<00:03:34.139> continue<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.280> little<00:03:35.519> bit<00:03:35.639> more

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
can continue a little bit more

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.920 
can continue a little bit more
if<00:03:36.540> you'd<00:03:36.810> like<00:03:37.019> until<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.709> gets<00:03:37.949> to<00:03:38.220> exactly

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
if you'd like until it gets to exactly

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:47.479 
if you'd like until it gets to exactly
what<00:03:39.930> you're<00:03:40.109> looking<00:03:40.139> for<00:03:46.310> when<00:03:47.310> it's

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
what you're looking for when it's

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.219 
what you're looking for when it's
already<00:03:47.909> sitting<00:03:48.150> out<00:03:48.389> of<00:03:48.509> passage<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.959> there

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:52.229 
already sitting out of passage so there

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.040 
already sitting out of passage so there
we<00:03:52.379> have<00:03:52.590> our<00:03:52.620> bowl
