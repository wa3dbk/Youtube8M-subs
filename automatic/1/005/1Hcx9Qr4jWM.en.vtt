00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
like it was others that one player the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.000 
like it was others that one player the
main<00:03:24.420> controller<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.230> either<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.650> first<00:03:25.859> or

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
main controller so either the first or

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.039 
main controller so either the first or
second<00:03:26.340> controller<00:03:26.700> will<00:03:26.970> be<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.389> player<00:03:27.810> who

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
second controller will be the player who

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.530 
second controller will be the player who
can<00:03:28.650> pick<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:28.980> place<00:03:29.220> but<00:03:29.579> you<00:03:30.120> could<00:03:30.269> switch

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
can pick the place but you could switch

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.559 
can pick the place but you could switch
players<00:03:30.840> before<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.500> actually<00:03:32.569> actually

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
players before you actually actually

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.470 
players before you actually actually
play<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:34.950> if<00:03:35.250> let's<00:03:35.910> say<00:03:35.970> you're<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.299> first

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
play so if let's say you're the first

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.580 
play so if let's say you're the first
player<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:37.139> don't<00:03:37.290> want<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.530> be

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
player and you don't want to be

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.170 
player and you don't want to be
quarterback<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:38.340> could<00:03:38.489> switch<00:03:38.700> off<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.060> the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
quarterback you could switch off to the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.729 
quarterback you could switch off to the
receiver<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.750> then<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:39.959> could<00:03:40.230> switch<00:03:40.440> up<00:03:40.620> to

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
receiver and then I could switch up to

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.530 
receiver and then I could switch up to
the<00:03:40.859> quarterback<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.579> so<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.850> gives<00:03:42.000> both

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
the quarterback and so it gives both

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.720 
the quarterback and so it gives both
