00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
oh and by the way I did the registry

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.670 
oh and by the way I did the registry
tweak<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.730> login<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.379> little<00:01:04.559> bit

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
tweak for the login so it's a little bit

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:14.860 
tweak for the login so it's a little bit
faster<00:01:04.920> than<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.339> used<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:06.409> press<00:01:07.409> f12

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.310 

stick<00:01:15.560> diagnostics<00:01:16.370> just<00:01:17.030> because<00:01:17.450> let's

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
stick diagnostics just because let's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:28.760 
stick diagnostics just because let's
just<00:01:18.410> do<00:01:18.650> this<00:01:22.690> little<00:01:23.690> pretty

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:38.720 

it's<00:01:29.430> kind<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.729> nice<00:01:29.909> nice<00:01:30.570> looking

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.450 

checking<00:01:39.480> everything<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.200> guess<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> good

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
checking everything I guess it's a good

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.830 
checking everything I guess it's a good
idea<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.090> anyway<00:01:45.890> but<00:01:47.570> what's<00:01:48.570> funny

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
idea to do this anyway but what's funny

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.930 
idea to do this anyway but what's funny
is<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.110> he<00:01:49.500> says<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.460> press<00:01:50.640> n

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
is that he says you have to press n

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.980 
is that he says you have to press n
instead<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.510> y<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:52.050> no<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.910> freaks<00:01:54.210> out<00:01:54.420> so

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
instead of y for no and it freaks out so

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:07.139 
instead of y for no and it freaks out so
I<00:01:55.970> guess<00:01:56.970> we're<00:01:57.300> going<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.480> wait<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:57.660> this

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:20.670 

okay<00:02:08.149> here<00:02:08.360> it<00:02:08.420> is<00:02:11.410> No

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.199 

we<00:02:21.810> come<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:23.980> anointing<00:02:24.370> has<00:02:24.700> Speaker<00:02:25.150> I
