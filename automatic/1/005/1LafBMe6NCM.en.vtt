different<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> pistol<00:00:53.730> I'm<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:54.420> sure<00:00:54.719> if

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
different to the pistol I'm not sure if

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.860 
different to the pistol I'm not sure if
it<00:00:55.680> has<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> largest<00:00:57.059> spread<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.660> we're<00:00:57.780> going

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
it has the largest spread so we're going

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.420 
it has the largest spread so we're going
to<00:00:57.960> test<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.350> out<00:00:58.410> now<00:00:58.649> by<00:00:58.859> spawning<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
to test that out now by spawning a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.910 
to test that out now by spawning a
couple<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.879> cows<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:01.260> see<00:01:01.469> if<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.770> get<00:01:01.859> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
couple of cows and I see if we can get a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.280 
couple of cows and I see if we can get a
good<00:01:02.039> double<00:01:02.460> kill<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:03.110> was<00:01:04.110> only<00:01:04.229> one<00:01:05.659> nope<00:01:06.659> has

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
good double kill I was only one nope has

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.770 
good double kill I was only one nope has
the<00:01:07.470> same<00:01:07.710> range<00:01:08.010> same

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the same range same

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.289 
the same range same
same<00:01:10.380> range<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.369> pistol<00:01:11.820> doesn't<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
same range that pistol doesn't have a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.859 
same range that pistol doesn't have a
wider<00:01:12.840> spread<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:14.270> bullets<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.450> only<00:01:15.659> shoots

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
wider spread of bullets and only shoots

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.750 
wider spread of bullets and only shoots
one<00:01:16.080> bullet<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.590> pistol<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.580> lot

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
one bullet and the pistol is a lot

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.550 
one bullet and the pistol is a lot
faster<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.420> i'm<00:01:18.479> guessing<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.869> pistol<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
faster so i'm guessing the pistol is a

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.120 
faster so i'm guessing the pistol is a
lot<00:01:19.830> better<00:01:20.040> than<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:22.200> shotgun<00:01:22.740> now

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
lot better than the and the shotgun now

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.580 
lot better than the and the shotgun now
the<00:01:23.250> next<00:01:23.430> gun<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.060> paintball<00:01:24.509> rifle<00:01:26.090> and

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
the next gun is the paintball rifle and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.859 
the next gun is the paintball rifle and
take<00:01:28.590> down<00:01:28.800> cows<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.940> i<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.240> get<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.540> count

and<00:04:46.320> hopefully<00:04:47.070> I<00:04:47.639> know<00:04:48.300> if<00:04:48.419> this<00:04:48.570> would<00:04:48.720> be

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
and hopefully I know if this would be

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.480 
and hopefully I know if this would be
implemented<00:04:50.310> but<00:04:50.490> um<00:04:51.050> if<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:52.259> break<00:04:52.979> or<00:04:53.250> hit

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
implemented but um if you break or hit

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.909 
implemented but um if you break or hit
the<00:04:53.520> with<00:04:54.330> your<00:04:54.479> paintball<00:04:54.840> gun<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.320> lot<00:04:55.800> of

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
the with your paintball gun a lot of

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.189 
the with your paintball gun a lot of
times<00:04:56.160> in<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.430> closet<00:04:56.669> would<00:04:57.090> break<00:04:57.419> so<00:04:58.020> it

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
times in a closet would break so it

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.620 
times in a closet would break so it
would<00:04:58.350> reveal<00:04:58.919> reveal<00:04:59.400> where<00:04:59.940> they<00:05:00.060> are<00:05:00.270> okay

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
would reveal reveal where they are okay

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.990 
would reveal reveal where they are okay
so<00:05:00.690> I<00:05:00.810> have<00:05:01.050> my<00:05:01.320> insta<00:05:01.770> base<00:05:01.979> here<00:05:02.460> and<00:05:02.729> it's

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
so I have my insta base here and it's

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.120 
so I have my insta base here and it's
basically<00:05:03.210> like<00:05:03.600> a<00:05:03.660> box<00:05:04.110> you<00:05:04.320> place<00:05:04.680> it<00:05:04.919> down

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
basically like a box you place it down

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.150 
basically like a box you place it down
and<00:05:05.490> then<00:05:05.639> you<00:05:06.150> hit<00:05:06.539> it<00:05:06.660> and<00:05:06.870> it<00:05:07.470> needs<00:05:07.770> quite<00:05:08.130> a

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
and then you hit it and it needs quite a

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.460 
and then you hit it and it needs quite a
lot<00:05:08.370> of<00:05:08.520> space<00:05:08.970> am<00:05:09.330> a<00:05:09.539> couple<00:05:09.810> of<00:05:09.900> times<00:05:10.199> it

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
lot of space am a couple of times it

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.370 
lot of space am a couple of times it
didn't<00:05:10.770> have<00:05:10.919> enough<00:05:11.130> space<00:05:11.430> for<00:05:11.759> me<00:05:12.020> so<00:05:13.020> it<00:05:13.320> is

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
didn't have enough space for me so it is

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.650 
didn't have enough space for me so it is
fairly<00:05:13.889> big<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.550> there's<00:05:14.789> also<00:05:14.940> an<00:05:15.180> upstairs

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
fairly big and there's also an upstairs

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.020 
fairly big and there's also an upstairs
