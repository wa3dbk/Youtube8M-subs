like<00:01:34.130> right<00:01:34.340> here<00:01:34.870> and<00:01:35.870> this<00:01:35.990> should<00:01:36.200> be

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
like right here and this should be

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.340 
like right here and this should be
sitting<00:01:37.760> on<00:01:38.000> top<00:01:38.270> of<00:01:38.300> it<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:39.110> piece

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
sitting on top of it and this piece

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.630 
sitting on top of it and this piece
should<00:01:39.560> be<00:01:39.710> back<00:01:39.890> on<00:01:40.100> stud<00:01:40.900> but<00:01:42.430> and<00:01:43.430> there's

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
should be back on stud but and there's

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.190 
should be back on stud but and there's
like<00:01:43.910> a<00:01:43.940> little<00:01:44.150> black<00:01:44.420> piece<00:01:44.600> in<00:01:44.780> there<00:01:44.900> but<00:01:45.170> I

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
like a little black piece in there but I

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.290 
like a little black piece in there but I
think<00:01:45.530> it<00:01:45.590> looks<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.800> little<00:01:46.060> weird<00:01:47.060> back<00:01:47.270> then

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
think it looks a little weird back then

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.400 
think it looks a little weird back then
I<00:01:49.510> guess<00:01:50.830> so<00:01:51.830> i<00:01:52.210> moved<00:01:53.210> i<00:01:53.479> moved<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:53.930> up<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.170> stud

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
I guess so i moved i moved it up a stud

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.180 
I guess so i moved i moved it up a stud
or<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:56.900> might<00:01:57.020> have<00:01:57.080> been<00:01:57.260> that<00:01:57.320> my<00:01:57.560> set<00:01:57.800> didn't

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
or it might have been that my set didn't

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.170 
or it might have been that my set didn't
come<00:01:59.000> with<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.180> little<00:01:59.600> black<00:01:59.869> pieces<00:02:00.970> i'm<00:02:01.970> not

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
come with a little black pieces i'm not

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.780

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
sure why I did that I dare if it looked

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.670
