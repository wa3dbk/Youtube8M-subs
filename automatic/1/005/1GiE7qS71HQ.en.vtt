00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Look at the hungry taste buds 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Jump on the toes 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Hate an endless harmony 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Waiting for a moment of resurrection 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Drink a drop of sweet tears 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Sing a transparent rock 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Create a peak of madness 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.500
 Too many compromises in this life 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.500
 This moment is completely broken 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.500
 This time lost the name gender 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.500
 Open your mouth OA~OA 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.000
 No matter who you are, OA~OA 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Life is too short, don't think, don't be afraid to go back. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Now is forever 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 The year of birth OA~OA 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 In the blink of an eye, this day OA~OA 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.500
 Life is too short to go crazy and love to waste 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.500
 And I sing OA~OAOA again. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Look at the hungry taste buds 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Jump on the toes 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Hate an endless harmony 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Waiting for a moment of resurrection 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Drink a drop of sweet tears 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Sing a transparent rock 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Create a peak of madness 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.500
 Too many compromises in this life 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.500
 This moment is completely broken 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.500
 This time lost the name gender 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.500
 Open your mouth OA~OA 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.000
 No matter who you are, OA~OA 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Life is too short, don't think, don't be afraid to go back. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Now is forever 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 The year of birth OA~OA 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 In the blink of an eye, this day OA~OA 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.500
 Life is too short to go crazy and love to waste 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.500
 And I sing OA~OAOA again. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.500
 Too many compromises in this life 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.500
 This moment is completely broken 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.500
 This time lost the name gender 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.500
 Open your mouth OA~OA 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.000
 No matter who you are, OA~OA 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Life is too short, don't think, don't be afraid to go back. 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Now is forever 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 The year of birth OA~OA 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 In the blink of an eye, this day OA~OA 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.500
 Life is too short to go crazy and love to waste 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.500
 And I sing OA~OAOA again. 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 O~AO~A...
