right here we're looking at the si si
recon<00:00:19.580> 10<00:00:19.970> and<00:00:21.610> as<00:00:22.610> you<00:00:22.820> can<00:00:22.940> tell<00:00:23.000> from<00:00:23.270> the

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
recon 10 and as you can tell from the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.660 
recon 10 and as you can tell from the
outline<00:00:23.870> it's<00:00:24.590> really<00:00:24.920> really<00:00:25.130> fat<00:00:25.400> in<00:00:25.580> the

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
outline it's really really fat in the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.040 
outline it's really really fat in the
middle<00:00:25.850> and<00:00:26.530> tapers<00:00:27.530> out<00:00:27.680> really<00:00:28.690> narrow<00:00:29.690> on

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
middle and tapers out really narrow on

middle and tapers out really narrow on
the<00:00:30.170> tips<00:00:30.440> now<00:00:31.369> there's<00:00:31.700> quite<00:00:31.820> a<00:00:31.940> bit<00:00:32.090> of<00:00:32.119> nose

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
the tips now there's quite a bit of nose

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.470 
the tips now there's quite a bit of nose
rocker<00:00:32.900> over<00:00:33.559> here<00:00:33.739> so<00:00:34.010> you<00:00:34.250> can<00:00:35.059> pretty<00:00:35.360> much

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
rocker over here so you can pretty much

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.350 
rocker over here so you can pretty much
take<00:00:35.780> any<00:00:36.080> drop<00:00:36.470> and<00:00:36.739> not<00:00:37.400> have<00:00:37.610> a<00:00:37.640> problem<00:00:39.280> and

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
take any drop and not have a problem and

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.220 
take any drop and not have a problem and
then<00:00:41.360> with<00:00:41.450> the<00:00:41.570> tail<00:00:41.809> this<00:00:42.200> narrow<00:00:44.050> step<00:00:45.050> back

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
then with the tail this narrow step back

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.850 
then with the tail this narrow step back
and<00:00:45.470> this<00:00:46.309> ten<00:00:46.580> six<00:00:46.879> turns<00:00:47.410> very<00:00:48.410> similar<00:00:48.710> to

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
and this ten six turns very similar to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.500 
and this ten six turns very similar to
like<00:00:49.040> what<00:00:49.310> my<00:00:49.400> ninth<00:00:49.640> six<00:00:49.940> would<00:00:50.120> turn<00:00:50.300> like

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
like what my ninth six would turn like

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.500 
like what my ninth six would turn like
I'm<00:00:51.230> running<00:00:51.620> on<00:00:51.770> the<00:00:51.950> bottom<00:00:52.370> here<00:00:52.930> quads<00:00:54.430> so

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
I'm running on the bottom here quads so

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.530 
I'm running on the bottom here quads so
as<00:00:56.510> you<00:00:56.630> can<00:00:56.720> see<00:00:56.780> here<00:00:57.110> I'm<00:00:57.230> running<00:00:57.590> the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
as you can see here I'm running the

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.740 
as you can see here I'm running the
takayama<00:00:59.540> halos<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:01.090> I<00:01:02.090> really<00:01:02.390> like<00:01:02.570> those

takayama halos and I really like those
fins<00:01:03.140> makes<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.860> board<00:01:04.330> real<00:01:05.330> drive-e<00:01:05.840> turns

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
fins makes the board real drive-e turns

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.260 
fins makes the board real drive-e turns
on<00:01:06.830> a<00:01:06.860> dime<00:01:06.950> if<00:01:07.759> you<00:01:07.970> want

sleeo<00:01:08.690> tail<00:01:09.080> can<00:01:09.259> slide<00:01:09.530> out<00:01:09.680> a<00:01:09.710> little<00:01:09.950> bit

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
sleeo tail can slide out a little bit

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.620 
sleeo tail can slide out a little bit
and<00:01:10.869> for<00:01:11.869> a<00:01:11.899> 10-6<00:01:12.290> board<00:01:12.640> this<00:01:13.640> turns

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
and for a 10-6 board this turns

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.520 
and for a 10-6 board this turns
pretty<00:01:16.290> exceptional<00:01:17.390> this<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.539> the<00:01:18.689> TWC<00:01:19.229> see

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
pretty exceptional this is the TWC see

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.090 
pretty exceptional this is the TWC see
construction<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.869> surprisingly<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.320> this

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
construction and surprisingly so this

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.039 
construction and surprisingly so this
board<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.520> really<00:01:23.700> light<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.750> one<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.960> my

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
board is really light it's one of my

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:25.520 
board is really light it's one of my

fairly nicely one thing about all si si
boards<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:44.429> goes<00:01:44.670> for<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.319> stand-up

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.429 
boards and it goes for the stand-up
surfing<00:01:47.460> board<00:01:47.630> in<00:01:48.630> particular<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.409> that

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
surfing board in particular is that

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.130 
surfing board in particular is that
these<00:01:49.799> boards<00:01:50.069> glide<00:01:50.340> really<00:01:51.299> really<00:01:51.509> well<00:01:51.659> it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
these boards glide really really well it

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.899 
these boards glide really really well it
reminded<00:01:52.740> me<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.920> my<00:01:53.009> twelve<00:01:53.549> six<00:01:54.229> bullet<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
reminded me of my twelve six bullet and

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.820 
reminded me of my twelve six bullet and
I<00:01:56.909> was<00:01:57.119> out<00:01:57.270> here<00:01:57.390> paddling<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:58.259> my<00:01:58.530> brother

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
I was out here paddling with my brother

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.330 
I was out here paddling with my brother
and<00:01:59.099> he<00:01:59.759> was<00:01:59.789> on<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> ten<00:02:00.959> footer<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:02.250> was

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and he was on a ten footer and I was

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.710 
and he was on a ten footer and I was
just<00:02:02.490> pulling<00:02:02.670> way<00:02:02.939> ahead<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.209> him<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.569> was

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
just pulling way ahead of him but I was

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.570 
just pulling way ahead of him but I was
cruising<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.319> he's<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.619> man<00:02:04.979> are<00:02:05.490> you

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
cruising and he's like man are you

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.539 
cruising and he's like man are you
paddling<00:02:05.909> hard<00:02:06.179> and<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.390> said<00:02:06.599> no<00:02:07.250> it's<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
paddling hard and I said no it's the

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.699 
paddling hard and I said no it's the
board<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.289> want<00:02:10.440> something<00:02:10.619> that

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
board so if you want something that

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.170 
board so if you want something that
glides<00:02:11.009> really<00:02:11.370> well<00:02:11.519> super<00:02:12.480> stable<00:02:12.890> then

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
glides really well super stable then

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.319 
glides really well super stable then
this<00:02:15.180> could<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.630> board<00:02:15.870> for<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:17.329> recon

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
this could be the board for you recon

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.000 
this could be the board for you recon
has<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.840> gore-tex<00:02:20.359> vent<00:02:21.359> plug<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:22.079> it<00:02:22.410> lets<00:02:22.680> air

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
has a gore-tex vent plug so it lets air

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.840 
has a gore-tex vent plug so it lets air
in<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.819> out<00:02:23.880> but<00:02:24.180> not<00:02:24.329> water<00:02:24.690> that's

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
in and out but not water that's

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.819 
in and out but not water that's
important<00:02:26.850> when<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.900> board<00:02:28.109> gets<00:02:28.260> hotter<00:02:28.470> or

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
important when the board gets hotter or

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.819 
important when the board gets hotter or
colder<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.540> starts<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.720> expand<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.530> contract

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
colder and starts to expand and contract

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.080 
colder and starts to expand and contract
and<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:33.090> handle<00:02:33.480> which<00:02:33.690> has<00:02:33.930> nice<00:02:34.620> kind<00:02:34.950> of

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
and this handle which has nice kind of

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.729 
and this handle which has nice kind of
grip<00:02:36.090> right<00:02:36.299> here<00:02:36.329> it's<00:02:37.109> pretty<00:02:37.290> comfy<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.680> the

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
grip right here it's pretty comfy on the

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.800 
grip right here it's pretty comfy on the
hands<00:02:38.100> easy<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.519> carry<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.450> for<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.660> most

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
hands easy to carry but for the most

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.860 
hands easy to carry but for the most
part<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.200> board<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.470> really<00:02:40.709> light<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.870> it's

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
part the board is really light so it's

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.360 
part the board is really light so it's
easy<00:02:43.079> to<00:02:43.230> throw<00:02:43.350> over<00:02:43.620> your<00:02:43.650> shoulder<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.250> I

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
easy to throw over your shoulder and I

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.979 
easy to throw over your shoulder and I
think<00:02:44.549> even<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:45.019> lighter<00:02:46.019> weight<00:02:46.530> woman<00:02:46.920> or<00:02:47.989> you

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
think even a lighter weight woman or you

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.620 
think even a lighter weight woman or you
know<00:02:49.109> a<00:02:49.230> little<00:02:49.530> bit<00:02:49.680> older<00:02:50.180> teenager<00:02:51.180> could

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
know a little bit older teenager could

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.780 
know a little bit older teenager could
easily<00:02:52.049> carry<00:02:52.380> this<00:02:52.620> thing

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
easily carry this thing

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.289 
easily carry this thing
as<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.510> can<00:02:55.629> see<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.959> bottom<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:58.030> Finn

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
as you can see on the bottom the Finn

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.929 
as you can see on the bottom the Finn
box<00:02:58.629> setup<00:02:59.109> is<00:02:59.379> really<00:03:00.189> set<00:03:00.459> up<00:03:00.549> for<00:03:00.579> a<00:03:00.730> quad

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
box setup is really set up for a quad

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.270 
box setup is really set up for a quad
you<00:03:01.450> can<00:03:01.599> run<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.810> thruster<00:03:02.290> setup<00:03:02.650> because<00:03:02.859> it

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
you can run a thruster setup because it

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.429 
you can run a thruster setup because it
has<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.640> FCS<00:03:04.060> plug<00:03:04.359> in<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.659> middle<00:03:04.930> but

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
has the FCS plug in the middle but

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.399 
has the FCS plug in the middle but
there's<00:03:05.769> no<00:03:06.299> long<00:03:07.299> box<00:03:07.599> that<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:07.870> can<00:03:08.049> put<00:03:08.260> in

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
there's no long box that you can put in

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.050 
there's no long box that you can put in
that<00:03:08.620> kind<00:03:09.099> of<00:03:09.159> bigger<00:03:09.310> center<00:03:09.670> fit<00:03:09.849> if<00:03:09.939> you

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
that kind of bigger center fit if you

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.020 
that kind of bigger center fit if you
want<00:03:10.239> so<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.170> run<00:03:11.379> this<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:12.099> know<00:03:12.250> quad

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
want so you can run this you know quad

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.690 
want so you can run this you know quad
with<00:03:13.269> a<00:03:13.299> small<00:03:13.569> trailer<00:03:13.870> or<00:03:14.230> as<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:15.189> three<00:03:15.519> Finn

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
with a small trailer or as a three Finn

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.869 
with a small trailer or as a three Finn
but<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.530> think<00:03:17.530> because<00:03:18.189> of<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.340> size<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.760> the

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
but I think because of the size of the

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.879 
but I think because of the size of the
board<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.269> width<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:20.019> seems<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:20.799> be

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
board and the width it seems to be

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.099 
board and the width it seems to be
better<00:03:21.189> off<00:03:21.370> as<00:03:21.579> a<00:03:21.730> quad<00:03:22.000> I've<00:03:22.389> only<00:03:22.810> really

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
better off as a quad I've only really

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.190 
better off as a quad I've only really
tried<00:03:23.379> this<00:03:23.409> board<00:03:23.859> in<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:25.269> know<00:03:25.389> waist<00:03:25.629> to

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
tried this board in you know waist to

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.390 
tried this board in you know waist to
chest<00:03:26.469> high<00:03:26.650> waves<00:03:26.889> and<00:03:27.189> it<00:03:27.250> works

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
chest high waves and it works

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.420 
chest high waves and it works
exceptionally<00:03:27.760> well<00:03:28.030> in<00:03:28.420> that<00:03:28.629> I<00:03:29.220> tried<00:03:30.220> it<00:03:30.340> in

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
exceptionally well in that I tried it in

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.240 
exceptionally well in that I tried it in
really<00:03:30.790> hard<00:03:31.239> storming<00:03:32.200> conditions<00:03:32.620> on<00:03:33.069> a

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
really hard storming conditions on a

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.699 
really hard storming conditions on a
bigger<00:03:33.489> swell<00:03:33.790> like<00:03:33.970> overhead<00:03:34.389> and<00:03:34.629> I<00:03:34.930> had

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
bigger swell like overhead and I had

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.339 
bigger swell like overhead and I had
some<00:03:35.889> problems<00:03:36.900> trying<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.959> figure<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.230> out

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
some problems trying to figure it out

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.649 
some problems trying to figure it out
this<00:03:38.889> is<00:03:38.919> pretty<00:03:39.639> much<00:03:39.849> the<00:03:40.000> only<00:03:40.030> board<00:03:40.510> I

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
this is pretty much the only board I

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.750 
this is pretty much the only board I
ride<00:03:40.870> it's<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.290> quad<00:03:41.620> I'm<00:03:41.829> normally<00:03:42.459> riding<00:03:42.700> a

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
ride it's a quad I'm normally riding a

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.250 
ride it's a quad I'm normally riding a
three<00:03:42.939> fins<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.359> I<00:03:43.389> push<00:03:43.629> hard<00:03:43.900> on<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.079> tail

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
three fins and I push hard on the tail

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.240 
three fins and I push hard on the tail
so<00:03:45.389> keeping<00:03:46.389> that<00:03:46.510> in<00:03:46.629> mind<00:03:47.129> this<00:03:48.129> board<00:03:48.459> is

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
so keeping that in mind this board is

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.750 
so keeping that in mind this board is
pretty<00:03:51.250> exceptional<00:03:51.639> for<00:03:52.030> its<00:03:52.120> size<00:03:52.299> and

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
pretty exceptional for its size and

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:12.890 
pretty exceptional for its size and
that's<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:55.000> Recon

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.959
