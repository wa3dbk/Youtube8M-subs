the view I guess of the village and he's

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.899 
the view I guess of the village and he's
probably<00:01:36.570> thinking<00:01:36.780> why<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:38.070> air<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
probably thinking why is the air and the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.580 
probably thinking why is the air and the
whole<00:01:39.090> environment<00:01:39.299> purple<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
whole environment purple and that is a
