a<00:02:53.630> ton

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
a ton

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.259 
a ton
yes<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.829> regular<00:02:55.130> big<00:02:55.310> slice<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.030> that's

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
yes the regular big slice and that's

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.210 
yes the regular big slice and that's
just<00:02:56.510> like<00:02:56.810> daunting

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
just like daunting

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.830 
just like daunting
this<00:03:00.210> is<00:03:00.450> going<00:03:00.780> in<00:03:00.930> deeper<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:03.060> the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
this is going in deeper and it is the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.430 
this is going in deeper and it is the
biggest<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.620> think<00:03:05.430> week<00:03:06.030> pizza<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:07.230> you've

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
biggest I think week pizza that you've

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.320 
biggest I think week pizza that you've
ever<00:03:07.680> seen<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.040> your<00:03:08.070> whole<00:03:08.190> life<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:09.150> we

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
ever seen in your whole life and we

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.570 
ever seen in your whole life and we
tried<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.600> eat<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.170> lot<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.530> pizza<00:03:10.920> that's

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
tried to eat it so a lot of pizza that's

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.160 
tried to eat it so a lot of pizza that's
my<00:03:11.970> first<00:03:12.180> thought<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.630> challenge<00:03:13.020> when

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
my first thought of the challenge when

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.630 
my first thought of the challenge when
you<00:03:13.440> brought<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.770> out

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
you brought it out

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.690 
you brought it out
and<00:03:16.270> then<00:03:16.920> halfway<00:03:17.920> through<00:03:18.130> my<00:03:18.250> first<00:03:18.280> slice

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
and then halfway through my first slice

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.250 
and then halfway through my first slice
I<00:03:19.000> realized<00:03:19.360> how<00:03:19.480> thick<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.870> dough<00:03:20.050> is

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
I realized how thick the dough is

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.530 
I realized how thick the dough is
getting<00:03:20.460> that<00:03:21.460> was<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.760> big<00:03:21.940> thing<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.360> got

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
getting that was the big thing I got

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.180 
getting that was the big thing I got
through<00:03:22.930> up<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.140> like<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.530> crust<00:03:23.770> on<00:03:23.950> first

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
through up to like the crust on first

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.890 
through up to like the crust on first
one<00:03:24.370> was<00:03:24.520> like<00:03:24.610> I'm<00:03:24.760> gonna<00:03:24.910> have<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.090> tackle<00:03:26.850> so

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
one was like I'm gonna have to tackle so

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.220 
one was like I'm gonna have to tackle so
dense<00:03:30.150> strategy<00:03:31.150> was<00:03:31.300> basically<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:31.840> eat<00:03:31.990> as

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
dense strategy was basically to eat as

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.710 
dense strategy was basically to eat as
fast<00:03:32.770> as<00:03:33.070> you<00:03:33.220> possibly<00:03:33.250> could<00:03:36.210> test<00:03:37.210> and<00:03:37.510> not

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
fast as you possibly could test and not

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.390 
fast as you possibly could test and not
think<00:03:38.080> don't<00:03:38.440> think<00:03:38.680> about<00:03:38.920> what<00:03:39.100> your<00:03:39.250> point

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
think don't think about what your point

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.730 
think don't think about what your point
is<00:03:39.610> because<00:03:40.270> it's<00:03:40.480> like<00:03:40.810> feeding<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.410> small

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
is because it's like feeding a small

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:51.449 
is because it's like feeding a small
child<00:03:45.660> over<00:03:46.660> an<00:03:46.870> hour<00:03:48.600> done<00:03:49.860> you<00:03:50.860> can't<00:03:51.130> get<00:03:51.340> up

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
child over an hour done you can't get up
