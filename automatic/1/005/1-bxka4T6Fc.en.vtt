his<00:01:50.310> physique<00:01:50.759> tells<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.390> little<00:01:51.540> bit<00:01:51.630> about

his physique tells a little bit about

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.819 
his physique tells a little bit about
that<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:53.100> bottom<00:01:53.399> line<00:01:53.520> was<00:01:53.759> when<00:01:54.180> he<00:01:54.329> fought

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
that the bottom line was when he fought

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.399 
that the bottom line was when he fought
Alistair<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.420> look<00:01:57.570> at<00:01:57.780> him<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:57.960> look<00:01:58.140> at

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
Alistair you can look at him and look at

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.810 
Alistair you can look at him and look at
the<00:01:58.500> difference<00:01:58.530> between<00:01:58.860> two<00:01:59.219> heavyweights

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
the difference between two heavyweights

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.929 
the difference between two heavyweights
and<00:02:00.149> they<00:02:00.210> weighed<00:02:00.600> about<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.110> same<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:02.219> it

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
and they weighed about the same but it

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.789 
and they weighed about the same but it
was<00:02:03.000> such<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> big<00:02:04.110> difference<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.590> then<00:02:04.680> when

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
was such a big difference and then when

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.160 
was such a big difference and then when
they<00:02:04.890> got<00:02:05.070> grata<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.790> know<00:02:05.880> when<00:02:06.030> I

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
they got grata you know when I

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.859 
they got grata you know when I
collided<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.880> difference<00:02:08.240> in<00:02:08.360> power<00:02:08.539> was

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
collided the difference in power was

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.320 
collided the difference in power was
just<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.619> said<00:02:10.520> there's<00:02:10.729> no<00:02:10.880> way<00:02:11.030> we're<00:02:11.239> gonna

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
just I said there's no way we're gonna

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.610 
just I said there's no way we're gonna
have<00:02:11.510> we<00:02:11.810> got<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.020> do<00:02:12.110> something<00:02:12.140> about<00:02:12.410> this

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
have we got to do something about this

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.199 
have we got to do something about this
so<00:02:12.800> that's<00:02:13.040> when<00:02:13.220> he<00:02:13.400> dedicated<00:02:13.849> himself<00:02:13.970> I

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
so that's when he dedicated himself I

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.390 
so that's when he dedicated himself I
got<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.420> put<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.630> all<00:02:14.810> on<00:02:14.840> fabricio<00:02:15.380> he<00:02:16.130> never

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
got to put this all on fabricio he never

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.920 
got to put this all on fabricio he never
liked<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.700> lift<00:02:16.910> weights<00:02:17.060> but<00:02:17.450> after<00:02:17.810> that

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
liked to lift weights but after that

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.260 
liked to lift weights but after that
fight<00:02:18.170> he<00:02:18.890> came<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.400> me<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.640> said<00:02:19.730> listen<00:02:20.000> I

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
performance and they put it gave us

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.449 
performance and they put it gave us
three<00:02:30.200> months<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.500> say<00:02:30.709> okay<00:02:30.980> let's<00:02:31.220> see<00:02:31.340> what

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
big difference I think that was that

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.920 
big difference I think that was that
there<00:04:08.630> was<00:04:08.780> key<00:04:08.989> is<00:04:09.049> that<00:04:10.239> when<00:04:11.239> I<00:04:11.269> started

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
there was key is that when I started

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.470 
there was key is that when I started
doing<00:04:12.079> jiu-jitsu

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
doing jiu-jitsu

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.460 
doing jiu-jitsu
a<00:04:14.819> lot<00:04:15.819> of<00:04:15.849> guys<00:04:16.060> that<00:04:16.090> were<00:04:16.449> not<00:04:16.900> as<00:04:17.079> strong<00:04:17.320> as

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
a lot of guys that were not as strong as

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.710 
a lot of guys that were not as strong as
me<00:04:17.650> they<00:04:18.370> were<00:04:18.430> submitting<00:04:19.150> me<00:04:19.299> getting<00:04:19.600> me<00:04:19.660> in

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
me they were submitting me getting me in

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.170 
me they were submitting me getting me in
position<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.260> I've<00:04:20.440> said<00:04:20.769> man<00:04:21.100> you<00:04:21.430> know<00:04:21.609> so

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
position and I've said man you know so

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.159 
position and I've said man you know so
when<00:04:23.050> I<00:04:23.080> figured<00:04:23.500> if<00:04:23.710> somebody<00:04:24.130> could<00:04:24.370> be<00:04:25.169> like

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
when I figured if somebody could be like

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.640 
when I figured if somebody could be like
at<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.490> level<00:04:27.820> of<00:04:27.970> Fabrizio's<00:04:28.570> jiu-jitsu<00:04:29.229> and

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
at the level of Fabrizio's jiu-jitsu and

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.129 
at the level of Fabrizio's jiu-jitsu and
have<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.190> strength<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:30.790> put<00:04:31.780> both<00:04:31.960> them

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
have the strength and put both them

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.530 
have the strength and put both them
together<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.680> would<00:04:32.830> be<00:04:32.979> you<00:04:33.280> know<00:04:33.540> something

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
together it would be you know something

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.310 
together it would be you know something

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.570 
we just said this is super bowl weekend
and<00:06:29.000> I<00:06:29.630> think<00:06:30.020> there's<00:06:30.620> not<00:06:30.889> one<00:06:31.190> thing<00:06:31.430> on

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
and I think there's not one thing on

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.070 
and I think there's not one thing on
television<00:06:31.820> that's<00:06:32.240> bigger<00:06:32.600> than<00:06:32.690> the<00:06:32.930> Super

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
television that's bigger than the Super

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.590 
television that's bigger than the Super
Bowl<00:06:33.259> so<00:06:33.949> and<00:06:34.400> I<00:06:34.759> think<00:06:34.820> that's<00:06:35.120> American

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 
Bowl so and I think that's American

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.200 
Bowl so and I think that's American
football<00:06:35.990> not<00:06:36.259> suck<00:06:37.070> actually<00:06:37.820> I<00:06:37.850> think<00:06:37.880> the
