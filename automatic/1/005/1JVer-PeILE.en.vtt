 nymph of the sky as such the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.210
 expectations with the arrived and how he walks 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.770
 for the race thank you very much for the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.780
 opportunity na 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.440
 the grace of the horses the two that 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.050
 I've been at this gala 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.570
 pretty good without any mishap 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.390
 as expected normal mare in 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.670
 his case a mare that owed 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.230
 career approach and the shot this 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.640
 they favor him enough is a diego that 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.030
 you can see his stats to masses 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.219
 lost in long shot no and the more 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.049
 she ran away better each this 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.540
 it's a pretty complicated race 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:06.700
 difficult and to have a strong fight that 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.869
 sure he will see it is giving 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.789
 the final meters in the final meters 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.950
 so the race train could 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.890
 favoring the not not sure is going to 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.409
 favor many leagues that do not have 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.569
 where to run other than in the fight and 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.000
 she will come from less to more like 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:25.119
 always now the horse is francisco 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.950
 gray minus goal is considered why it is 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.720
 the best horse from blocks with 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.940
 great expectations and even to run 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.819
 the classic Simon Bolivar comes to this 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.280
 litmus test not for your campaign like 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.259
 it is to face the champion comedian in 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.909
 the classic owner la rinconada as 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.149
 until the horse stops for this classic 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.280
 in 2000 meters on the horse walks 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.369
 spectacular its me I concentrated these 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.739
 last weeks in lengthening my horse 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.420
 preparing it with the lung for this 

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:55.270
 this travel 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.709
 I think this classic is an alcabala 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.899
 that we have to pass necessarily 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.220
 for the bolivar since it is a 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.700
 horse that so many 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.460
 and ask and as your physicist say that the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.790
 long shot is not better its better way 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.760
 to run but the mile and minor shots 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.550
 He is a great horse and he helps you 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.320
 Do what you want to do 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.970
 his limits are put by himself and me 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.490
 I'm sure it's a very career 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.830
 pretty is this competition how do you think 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.440
 that is going to raise the race there 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.120
 some other strategy studied with the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.060
 Jaramillo champion to run on horseback 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.330
 Look at the same rhythm, it 's a race that 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.800
 because of the small quorum of participants 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.600
 have 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.870
 the strategy is very relative is very 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.460
 we do not know how is the approach in 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.840
 difference you get that you already know 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.420
 where are they going to run because they are so many 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.100
 leagues this what we have talked with 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.040
 Jaramillo is in in the game 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.530
 practically decide because we do not know 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.970
 how to use things the meaning are 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.340
 francisco face a horse of the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.520
 quality of comedians on a horse that 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.940
 good is undefeated this year 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.410
 won the classic Simon Bolivar and also 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.330
 the classic president the republic of 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.300
 armed forces this year for me is a 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.220
 great challenge is the first and great challenge of 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.380
 my career is the first that I run a 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.470
 classic grade 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.880
 I think this is a horse 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.520
 spectacular a horse that what has 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.830
 fact 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.230
 it is totally admirable to go back then 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.720
 of all the problems and come back from that 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.820
 way and I just hope a good career my 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.710
 horse with the mind the mind set on 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.260
 the good bolivar the greatest of luck 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.390
