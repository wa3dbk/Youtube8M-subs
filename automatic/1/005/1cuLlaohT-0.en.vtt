00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
a little bit tougher you know I don't

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.010 
a little bit tougher you know I don't
know<00:00:42.670> that<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.059> stairs<00:00:43.330> are<00:00:43.510> any<00:00:43.660> tougher

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
know that the stairs are any tougher

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.510 
know that the stairs are any tougher
they're<00:00:44.170> a<00:00:44.200> little<00:00:44.470> bigger<00:00:44.680> and<00:00:45.100> I<00:00:45.190> don't<00:00:45.250> know

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
they're a little bigger and I don't know

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.060 
they're a little bigger and I don't know
if<00:00:45.640> they<00:00:45.790> handle<00:00:46.210> quite<00:00:46.510> as<00:00:46.720> quick<00:00:47.020> and<00:00:47.260> so<00:00:47.500> it

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
if they handle quite as quick and so it

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.200 
if they handle quite as quick and so it
makes<00:00:48.309> it<00:00:48.460> where<00:00:48.580> you<00:00:48.670> got<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:48.910> be<00:00:49.030> a<00:00:49.059> little

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
makes it where you got to be a little

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.660 
makes it where you got to be a little
more<00:00:49.360> patient<00:00:49.629> and<00:00:50.050> it<00:00:50.410> seems<00:00:50.800> like<00:00:51.010> in<00:00:51.250> these

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
more patient and it seems like in these

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.430 
more patient and it seems like in these
first<00:00:51.910> three<00:00:52.059> rounds<00:00:52.390> a<00:00:52.629> lot<00:00:52.809> of<00:00:52.989> guys<00:00:53.199> have

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
first three rounds a lot of guys have

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.979 
first three rounds a lot of guys have
been<00:00:53.860> trying<00:00:54.460> really<00:00:54.940> hard<00:00:55.120> to<00:00:55.390> go<00:00:55.660> really

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
been trying really hard to go really

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.170 
been trying really hard to go really
fast<00:00:56.200> and<00:00:56.560> sometimes<00:00:57.190> that<00:00:57.550> gets<00:00:57.730> in<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.030> way

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
fast and sometimes that gets in the way

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.200 
fast and sometimes that gets in the way
and<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:59.050> I<00:00:59.500> think<00:00:59.800> as<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.220> week<00:01:00.460> goes<00:01:00.489> guys

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
and so I think as the week goes guys

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.880 
and so I think as the week goes guys
would<00:01:01.450> get<00:01:01.540> settled<00:01:01.870> in<00:01:02.079> more<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.530> you'll<00:01:02.649> see

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
would get settled in more and you'll see

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.400 
would get settled in more and you'll see
more<00:01:03.070> three-second<00:01:03.790> runs<00:01:03.970> but<00:01:04.270> I<00:01:04.630> was<00:01:05.229> glad

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
more three-second runs but I was glad
