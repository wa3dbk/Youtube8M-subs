 Samsung's 2013 Smart TVs offer several new advanced intelligent interactions for voice and gesture commands that make their use more entertaining and unique. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Before using Smart Interactions on your Smart TV, we recommend that you test the environment through your TV to make sure the services are enabled and in good working order. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 In addition, your TV must be connected to the Internet and configured correctly. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 When using advanced intelligent interactions for voice control, we recommend using the Smart Touch Remote that came with your Smart TV. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 New voice command interactions are a great way to search for content and TV programs. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 To begin, press the Voice button on your Smart Touch Remote. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 When Voice Command opens, simply talk to the remote in a natural way, for example by saying "Show Me Action Movies". And recommended titles will appear at the bottom of your screen! 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 You can change the string by saying for example the phrase "Change to the string thirteen". 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 You can also change channels by saying the name of the desired channel. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 The natural language that is part of Smart Hub's advanced intelligent interaction allows you to easily find movies and TV shows, and even search the web. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Say the phrase "Open Web Browser". 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 With Voice-to-Text, click on the address bar and instead of having to select each letter, simply say the name of the desired website, and the application will enter it for you and open the page when you select Done. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Gesture control is also easier with Smart Hub's advanced intelligent interaction. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 There are now many other ways to incorporate Gesture Control into your experience, in addition to basic navigation. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 After verifying that the camera is activated on your TV, slowly shake your hand until the Gesture Control recognizes you. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Easily switch from one Smart Hub screen to another by sliding your hand. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 You can even use two hands for more advanced control of your Smart TV. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 When both hands are recognized, close your palms and enlarge or shrink the image as desired, then release. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Rotate the same image on your screen by closing the palms of both hands again and moving a hand in the direction of the desired rotation, then release. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Use the Voice and Gesture features for advanced smart interaction to help you find new ways to enjoy your Samsung Smart TV.
