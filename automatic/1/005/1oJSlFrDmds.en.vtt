00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
really interesting to me is that there

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.210 
are a lot and a lot of robots you have
the<00:01:33.329> enforcement<00:01:34.020> droid<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> new

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
the enforcement droid like the new

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.219 
the enforcement droid like the new
version<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> ed<00:01:35.880> 209<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.079> these

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
version of the ed 209 you have these

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.289 
version of the ed 209 you have these
drones<00:01:37.740> which<00:01:38.070> looks<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.430> super<00:01:38.970> battle

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
drones which looks like super battle

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.899 
drones which looks like super battle
droids<00:01:39.600> from<00:01:39.780> episode<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.610> think

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
droids from episode one and I think

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.880 
droids from episode one and I think
there's<00:01:42.119> another<00:01:42.869> type<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:44.600> robot<00:01:45.600> um<00:01:46.409> it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
there's another type of robot um it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.160 
there's another type of robot um it
looks<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.700> don't<00:01:47.939> know<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.270> then<00:01:48.750> then

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
looks like it I don't know but then then

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.679 
looks like it I don't know but then then
you<00:01:49.290> finally<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.770> Robocop<00:01:50.250> which<00:01:50.549> looks<00:01:51.299> not

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
you finally have Robocop which looks not

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.990 
you finally have Robocop which looks not
too<00:01:51.990> bad<00:01:52.200> he<00:01:52.470> looks<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.890> think<00:01:53.700> he<00:01:53.759> kind<00:01:53.939> of

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
too bad he looks I think he kind of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.490 
too bad he looks I think he kind of
looks<00:01:54.149> better<00:01:54.299> than<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.570> original<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.350> one

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
looks better than the original but one

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.870 
looks better than the original but one
thing<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.829> really<00:01:55.860> gets<00:01:56.189> me<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.640> head

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
thing that really gets me is the head

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.450 
thing that really gets me is the head
what's<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.689> with<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.079> UM<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.340> barehand<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
what's up with the UM the barehand the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.819 
what's up with the UM the barehand the
single<00:01:59.939> bare<00:02:00.149> hand<00:02:00.450> that's<00:02:01.439> very<00:02:01.710> interesting

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
single bare hand that's very interesting

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.800 
single bare hand that's very interesting
to<00:02:02.219> me<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.210> serve<00:02:03.329> some<00:02:03.600> kind

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
to me it's I know it's serve some kind

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.420 
to me it's I know it's serve some kind
of<00:02:03.840> purpose<00:02:04.079> but<00:02:04.740> another<00:02:05.009> thing<00:02:05.219> that's

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
of purpose but another thing that's

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.700 
of purpose but another thing that's
focusing<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.180> order<00:02:06.570> really<00:02:06.750> emphasizing<00:02:07.590> is

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
focusing on order really emphasizing is

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.969 
focusing on order really emphasizing is
that<00:02:08.209> we<00:02:09.209> get<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.420> see<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.080> face<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.319> Alex

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that we get to see the face of Alex

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.370 
that we get to see the face of Alex
Murphy<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.610> he<00:02:12.569> can<00:02:12.750> have<00:02:13.020> it

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
Murphy and he can have it

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.620 
Murphy and he can have it
on<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.680> off<00:02:13.830> it's<00:02:14.460> like<00:02:14.730> battle<00:02:15.180> mode<00:02:15.360> and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
on and off it's like battle mode and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.570 
on and off it's like battle mode and
friendly<00:02:16.110> mode<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.470> don't<00:02:16.710> know<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.220> seems

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
friendly mode I don't know but it seems

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.880 
friendly mode I don't know but it seems
to<00:02:17.730> make<00:02:17.850> us<00:02:18.060> think<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.650> Murphy<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
to make us think that Murphy the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.320 
to make us think that Murphy the
character<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.250> Alex<00:02:20.640> Murphy<00:02:20.850> could<00:02:21.180> be

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
character of Alex Murphy could be

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.630 
character of Alex Murphy could be
self-aware<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.590> makes<00:02:22.860> us<00:02:23.010> look<00:02:23.040> like<00:02:23.460> it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
self-aware it makes us look like it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.110 
self-aware it makes us look like it
makes<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:23.940> feel<00:02:24.120> like<00:02:24.500> Alex<00:02:25.500> Murphy<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:26.190> still

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
makes it feel like Alex Murphy is still

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.300 
makes it feel like Alex Murphy is still
alive<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.660> mean<00:02:28.080> he<00:02:28.200> knows<00:02:28.470> what's<00:02:28.770> going<00:02:29.040> on<00:02:29.160> he

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
alive I mean he knows what's going on he

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.180 
alive I mean he knows what's going on he
knows<00:02:29.640> what<00:02:29.850> happened<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.360> him<00:02:30.450> he's<00:02:30.870> not<00:02:31.080> dead

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
knows what happened to him he's not dead

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.550 
knows what happened to him he's not dead
unlike<00:02:32.190> in<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:33.210> in<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.570> original<00:02:33.780> Robocop

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
unlike in in in the original Robocop

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.970 
unlike in in in the original Robocop
Alex<00:02:35.010> Murphy<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.430> completely<00:02:36.060> dead<00:02:36.800> but<00:02:37.800> he

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
Alex Murphy is completely dead but he

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.710 
Alex Murphy is completely dead but he
still<00:02:38.160> has<00:02:38.250> memories<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.570> new

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
still has memories but in the new

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.780 
still has memories but in the new
robocop<00:02:40.020> remake<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.740> looks<00:02:40.980> like<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.460> he

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
robocop remake it looks like that he

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.270 
robocop remake it looks like that he
he's<00:02:42.630> kind<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.960> aware<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.290> what<00:02:43.650> happened<00:02:44.130> to

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
he's kind of aware of what happened to

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.000 
he's kind of aware of what happened to
him<00:02:44.490> so<00:02:45.060> it's<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.750> different<00:02:46.230> kind<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.500> tea<00:02:46.710> but

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
him so it's a different kind of tea but

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.280 
him so it's a different kind of tea but
I<00:02:47.070> think<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.520> kind<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.790> interesting<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.630> I'm

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
I think it's kind of interesting and I'm

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.110

Keaton's a character says let's go let's

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.990 
Keaton's a character says let's go let's
see<00:03:07.440> what<00:03:07.620> he<00:03:07.680> looks<00:03:07.860> like<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.070> black<00:03:08.430> for<00:03:08.790> you

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
see what he looks like in black for you

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000 
see what he looks like in black for you
know<00:03:09.090> stealth<00:03:09.420> mode<00:03:09.600> or<00:03:09.810> covert<00:03:10.380> mode<00:03:10.770> right

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
know stealth mode or covert mode right

movie<00:03:20.970> except<00:03:21.690> are<00:03:21.840> taking<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.290> original

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
movie except are taking the original

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.060 
movie except are taking the original
concept<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.730> original<00:03:24.300> Robocop<00:03:24.780> and

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
concept of the original Robocop and

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.650 
concept of the original Robocop and
transforming<00:03:26.070> it<00:03:26.190> into<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:27.240> know<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.570> new

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
transforming it into you know a new

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.990 
transforming it into you know a new
updated<00:03:28.500> version<00:03:29.100> now<00:03:29.580> it<00:03:29.730> looks<00:03:29.880> like

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
updated version now it looks like

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.150 
updated version now it looks like
Robocop<00:03:30.600> is<00:03:30.750> going<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:30.960> be<00:03:31.050> fighting<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.530> lot<00:03:31.860> of

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
Robocop is going to be fighting a lot of

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.270 
Robocop is going to be fighting a lot of
robots<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.210> I<00:03:33.900> think<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.620> main<00:03:34.800> reason<00:03:34.860> why

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
robots and I think the main reason why

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.190 
robots and I think the main reason why
they<00:03:35.430> want<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.640> do<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.120> as<00:03:36.390> opposed<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:37.020> him

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
they want to do that as opposed to him

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.680 
they want to do that as opposed to him
you<00:03:37.890> know<00:03:37.980> fighting<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.490> lot<00:03:38.610> of<00:03:38.760> humans<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.360> to

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
you know fighting a lot of humans is to

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.470 
you know fighting a lot of humans is to
tone<00:03:40.470> down<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:41.100> level<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.520> violence<00:03:41.820> because

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
tone down the level of violence because

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.240 
tone down the level of violence because
if<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.750> keep<00:03:42.990> on<00:03:43.170> having<00:03:43.350> him<00:03:43.620> kill<00:03:43.890> bad<00:03:44.220> guys

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
if you keep on having him kill bad guys

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.060 
if you keep on having him kill bad guys
human<00:03:44.820> bad<00:03:45.000> guys<00:03:45.270> with<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.750> lot<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:46.020> love<00:03:46.800> with<00:03:47.040> a

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.410 
human bad guys with a lot of love with a
lot<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.310> gore<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.880> know<00:03:48.000> what<00:03:48.090> I'm<00:03:48.180> saying

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
lot of gore you know what I'm saying

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.730 
lot of gore you know what I'm saying
that's<00:03:48.810> gonna<00:03:48.959> amount<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.470> an<00:03:49.740> R<00:03:49.920> rating<00:03:50.610> and

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
that's gonna amount to an R rating and

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.930 
that's gonna amount to an R rating and
originally<00:03:52.740> they<00:03:52.770> wanted<00:03:53.130> an<00:03:53.220> R<00:03:53.370> rating<00:03:53.730> but

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
originally they wanted an R rating but

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.330 
originally they wanted an R rating but
they<00:03:54.209> dumbed<00:03:54.570> it<00:03:54.690> down<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.140> pg-13<00:03:55.530> rating

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
they dumbed it down to a pg-13 rating

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.690 
they dumbed it down to a pg-13 rating
and<00:03:56.490> I<00:03:57.209> think<00:03:57.570> that<00:03:58.170> way<00:03:58.560> obviously<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.550> can

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
and I think that way obviously you can

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.610 
and I think that way obviously you can
sell<00:03:59.910> more<00:04:00.030> tickets<00:04:00.090> but<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:01.260> know<00:04:01.380> with<00:04:01.590> the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
sell more tickets but you know with the

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.750 
sell more tickets but you know with the
story<00:04:02.160> uh<00:04:03.230> having<00:04:04.230> rope<00:04:04.500> robocop<00:04:05.220> fight<00:04:05.490> other

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
story uh having rope robocop fight other

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.760 
story uh having rope robocop fight other
robots<00:04:06.360> then<00:04:06.870> obviously<00:04:07.170> it's<00:04:07.590> going<00:04:07.620> to

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
robots then obviously it's going to

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.710 
robots then obviously it's going to
bring<00:04:07.920> bringing<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.520> a<00:04:08.550> pg-13<00:04:08.970> rating

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
bring bringing it to a pg-13 rating

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.620 
bring bringing it to a pg-13 rating
because<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.860> body<00:04:11.250> count<00:04:11.580> will<00:04:12.090> be<00:04:12.240> a<00:04:12.270> lot

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
because the the body count will be a lot

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.430 
because the the body count will be a lot
lower<00:04:12.959> so<00:04:13.950> there<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:14.700> have<00:04:14.880> it<00:04:15.060> um<00:04:15.510> this<00:04:16.230> is

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
lower so there you have it um this is

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.640 
lower so there you have it um this is
this<00:04:16.950> looks<00:04:17.160> really<00:04:17.430> really<00:04:18.020> really<00:04:19.020> exciting

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
this looks really really really exciting

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.580 
this looks really really really exciting
for<00:04:19.830> me<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:20.450> watching<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:21.570> trailer<00:04:22.020> it's<00:04:22.290> it

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
for me I watching that trailer it's it

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.070 
for me I watching that trailer it's it
looks<00:04:22.860> very<00:04:23.250> very<00:04:23.370> different<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.630> like

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
looks very very different and I like

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.480 
looks very very different and I like
that

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
that

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.830 
that
even<00:04:26.699> though<00:04:26.789> they're<00:04:26.970> making<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.330> changes

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
even though they're making the changes

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.210 
even though they're making the changes
it<00:04:28.020> feels<00:04:28.289> like<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.590> changes<00:04:28.949> are<00:04:29.039> going<00:04:29.130> to

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
it feels like the changes are going to

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.010 
it feels like the changes are going to
be<00:04:29.340> justified<00:04:29.910> because<00:04:30.120> it's<00:04:30.479> like<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:30.750> whole

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
be justified because it's like a whole

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.010 
be justified because it's like a whole
