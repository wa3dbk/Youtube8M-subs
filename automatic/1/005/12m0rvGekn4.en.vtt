bit<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.390> spell<00:01:36.720> great<00:01:36.900> visibility<00:01:37.229> and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
bit is the spell great visibility and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.280 
bit is the spell great visibility and
this<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.490> basically<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> five<00:01:39.780> tabs<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.170> you

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
this is basically the five tabs that you

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.249 
this is basically the five tabs that you
can<00:01:40.439> see<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.799> screen<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.689> example<00:01:42.720> you

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
can see on the screen so for example you

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.510 
can see on the screen so for example you
may<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.890> healer<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:46.020> may<00:01:46.229> not<00:01:46.710> care<00:01:46.770> about

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
may be a healer you may not care about

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.899 
may be a healer you may not care about
the<00:01:48.030> cooldowns<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.100> tank<00:01:50.579> healer

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the cooldowns for the tank healer

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.179 
the cooldowns for the tank healer
cooldowns<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.409> can<00:01:52.590> always<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.920> say

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
cooldowns so you can always just say

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.730 
cooldowns so you can always just say
without<00:01:53.369> by<00:01:53.610> doing<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.110> however<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.350> want

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
without by doing that however you want

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.590 
without by doing that however you want
to<00:01:55.890> see<00:01:56.070> tank<00:01:56.369> cooldowns<00:01:56.790> because<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.450> need

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
to see tank cooldowns because you need

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.910 
to see tank cooldowns because you need
to<00:01:57.719> know<00:01:57.840> when<00:01:58.020> they're<00:01:58.200> available<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.710> use

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
to know when they're available to use

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.590 
to know when they're available to use
them<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.820> also<00:01:59.969> want<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.240> see<00:02:00.450> your

worth announcing so they won't show up
this<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:37.020> just<00:02:37.200> basically<00:02:37.620> showing<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:38.850> what

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
this is just basically showing you what

on your ad on so for example if you

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.940 
on your ad on so for example if you
don't<00:02:45.630> care<00:02:45.960> about<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.230> death<00:02:46.500> Knights<00:02:46.650> bone

don't care about the death Knights bone
shield<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.550> just<00:02:47.730> click<00:02:47.880> on<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.300> then

shield you just click on that and then

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.040 
shield you just click on that and then
that<00:02:49.020> won't<00:02:49.170> be<00:02:49.320> shown<00:02:49.500> at<00:02:49.650> all<00:02:49.830> on<00:02:50.070> any<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.820> the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
that won't be shown at all on any of the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.310 
that won't be shown at all on any of the
little<00:02:52.050> frames<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:53.510> then<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:54.750> we<00:02:54.900> go<00:02:54.930> down<00:02:55.080> a

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
little frames and then if we go down a

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.030 
little frames and then if we go down a
bit<00:02:55.620> more<00:02:55.920> we<00:02:56.790> have<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.660> left<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.800> the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
bit more we have to the left of the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.330 
bit more we have to the left of the
class<00:02:59.460> configuration<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:01.440> toggle<00:03:02.100> which

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
class configuration you can toggle which

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.920 
class configuration you can toggle which
groups<00:03:02.640> abilities<00:03:03.210> you<00:03:03.330> want<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.570> have<00:03:03.660> shown

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
groups abilities you want to have shown

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.960 
groups abilities you want to have shown
so<00:03:04.140> for<00:03:04.350> example<00:03:04.440> this<00:03:04.770> might<00:03:04.950> be<00:03:05.100> useful<00:03:05.190> on<00:03:05.550> a

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
so for example this might be useful on a

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.510 
so for example this might be useful on a
fight<00:03:06.720> such<00:03:07.020> as<00:03:07.230> more<00:03:07.710> chalk<00:03:07.980> when<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.280> first

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
fight such as more chalk when it first

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.700 
fight such as more chalk when it first
came<00:03:08.730> out<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.210> if<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.930> did<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.170> 10-man<00:03:10.500> mode

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
came out and if you did the 10-man mode

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.410 
came out and if you did the 10-man mode
on<00:03:10.890> those<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.130> tactic<00:03:11.610> way<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.760> could<00:03:11.910> have<00:03:11.940> two

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
on those a tactic way you could have two

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.480 
on those a tactic way you could have two
healers<00:03:12.750> in<00:03:12.960> each<00:03:13.170> group<00:03:13.380> because<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.370> ba

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
healers in each group because the ba

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.850 
healers in each group because the ba
splits<00:03:14.820> in<00:03:14.940> half<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:16.110> for<00:03:16.260> example<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.620> could

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
splits in half so for example you could

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.520 
splits in half so for example you could
not<00:03:17.130> want<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.460> see<00:03:17.670> group<00:03:18.480> tues<00:03:18.810> abilities

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
not want to see group tues abilities

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.400 
not want to see group tues abilities
because<00:03:20.490> you're<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:20.880> group<00:03:21.090> one<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:22.170> that's

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
because you're in group one that that's

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.990 
because you're in group one that that's
the<00:03:22.620> only<00:03:22.830> kind<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:23.130> reasoning<00:03:23.520> i<00:03:23.610> could<00:03:23.760> see

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
the only kind of reasoning i could see

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.020 
the only kind of reasoning i could see
behind<00:03:24.450> wanting<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.400> see<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.610> certain<00:03:27.000> groups

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
behind wanting to see to certain groups

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.880 
behind wanting to see to certain groups
abilities<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.840> not<00:03:27.990> see<00:03:28.380> certain<00:03:28.620> groups

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
abilities and not see certain groups

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.640 
abilities and not see certain groups
abilities<00:03:29.420> because<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.750> might<00:03:30.870> just<00:03:31.050> be<00:03:31.620> a

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
abilities because it might just be a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.870 
abilities because it might just be a
quality<00:03:32.100> of<00:03:32.130> life<00:03:32.340> thing<00:03:32.580> more<00:03:32.700> than<00:03:32.730> anything

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
quality of life thing more than anything

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.900 
quality of life thing more than anything
so<00:03:33.390> for<00:03:33.570> example<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:34.110> druid<00:03:34.740> who<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.580> on<00:03:35.760> the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
so for example a druid who is on the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.130 
so for example a druid who is on the
other<00:03:36.000> side<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:37.310> wyrmrest<00:03:38.310> temple<00:03:39.060> will<00:03:39.930> not

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
other side of wyrmrest temple will not

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.650 
other side of wyrmrest temple will not
be<00:03:40.740> able<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:41.180> tranquility<00:03:42.180> people<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.570> are

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
be able to tranquility people that are

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.300 
be able to tranquility people that are
on<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.900> other<00:03:42.990> side<00:03:43.110> or<00:03:43.800> something<00:03:44.190> along

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
on the other side or something along

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.790 
on the other side or something along
those<00:03:44.550> lines<00:03:45.380> next<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.500> just<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.800> bulb

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
those lines next is just the the bulb

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.410 
those lines next is just the the bulb
it's<00:03:50.040> choosing<00:03:50.340> when<00:03:50.610> you<00:03:50.790> want<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.180> add-on

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
it's choosing when you want the add-on

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.470 
it's choosing when you want the add-on
to<00:03:51.510> be<00:03:51.690> shown<00:03:52.010> so<00:03:53.010> for<00:03:53.490> example<00:03:53.520> if<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.120> enter

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
to be shown so for example if you enter

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.050 
to be shown so for example if you enter
25<00:03:55.020> man<00:03:55.170> raid<00:03:55.350> finder<00:03:55.560> then<00:03:56.550> you<00:03:56.700> can<00:03:56.850> choose

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
25 man raid finder then you can choose

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.420 
25 man raid finder then you can choose
if<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.270> want<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.630> be<00:03:57.720> shown<00:03:57.870> or<00:03:58.050> not<00:03:58.200> if

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
if you want it to be shown or not if

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.620 
if you want it to be shown or not if
you're<00:03:59.430> just<00:03:59.640> so<00:03:59.880> low<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.120> can<00:04:00.420> choose

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
you're just so low you can choose

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.270 
you're just so low you can choose
whether<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.900> want<00:04:01.020> it<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.230> be<00:04:01.320> on<00:04:01.500> or<00:04:01.650> not<00:04:01.740> it

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
whether you want it to be on or not it

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.250 
whether you want it to be on or not it
it<00:04:02.940> kind<00:04:03.240> of<00:04:03.300> gets<00:04:03.390> in<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.660> way<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:03.810> guess<00:04:04.080> if

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
it kind of gets in the way I guess if

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.510 
it kind of gets in the way I guess if
you<00:04:04.350> saw<00:04:04.560> though<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:04.740> don't<00:04:05.040> really<00:04:05.190> need<00:04:05.370> to

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
you saw though you don't really need to

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.920 
you saw though you don't really need to
know<00:04:05.640> about<00:04:05.790> your<00:04:06.000> own<00:04:06.150> cooldowns<00:04:06.540> as<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.780> can

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
know about your own cooldowns as you can

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.020 
know about your own cooldowns as you can
see<00:04:07.080> them<00:04:07.230> on<00:04:07.260> your<00:04:07.440> bars<00:04:07.710> anyway<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.970> I'd

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
see them on your bars anyway so I'd

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.820 
see them on your bars anyway so I'd
recommend<00:04:09.180> just<00:04:09.600> disabling<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:10.410> light<00:04:10.620> and

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
recommend just disabling so light and

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.090 
recommend just disabling so light and
then<00:04:11.280> you<00:04:11.340> just<00:04:11.490> select<00:04:11.700> which<00:04:12.150> groups

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
then you just select which groups

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.070 
then you just select which groups
affect<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.090> so<00:04:14.120> if<00:04:14.330> you're<00:04:14.450> a<00:04:14.480> 10<00:04:14.690> man<00:04:14.810> guild

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
affect you so if you're a 10 man guild

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.360 
affect you so if you're a 10 man guild
you'll<00:04:15.260> obviously<00:04:15.350> wanted<00:04:15.860> to<00:04:15.950> enable<00:04:16.280> when

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
you'll obviously wanted to enable when

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.460 
you'll obviously wanted to enable when
you<00:04:16.459> in<00:04:16.580> 10<00:04:16.760> man<00:04:16.880> heroic<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.450> 10<00:04:18.170> man<00:04:18.350> normal

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
you in 10 man heroic and 10 man normal

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.220 
you in 10 man heroic and 10 man normal
and<00:04:19.250> possibly<00:04:19.430> 25<00:04:20.180> raid<00:04:20.510> finder<00:04:20.750> as<00:04:21.020> well

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
and possibly 25 raid finder as well

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.100 
and possibly 25 raid finder as well

bar length of how big you on the bars to

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.940 
bar length of how big you on the bars to
be<00:04:37.870> this<00:04:38.870> is<00:04:39.050> just<00:04:39.200> personal<00:04:39.710> preference

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
be this is just personal preference

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.130 
be this is just personal preference
really<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:40.550> mean<00:04:40.760> I'd<00:04:41.390> prefer<00:04:41.600> it<00:04:41.780> if<00:04:41.870> you<00:04:41.960> take

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
really I mean I'd prefer it if you take

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.200 
really I mean I'd prefer it if you take
up<00:04:42.290> less<00:04:42.560> room<00:04:42.680> really<00:04:42.980> just<00:04:43.910> as<00:04:44.000> long<00:04:44.120> as

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
up less room really just as long as

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.000 
up less room really just as long as
you're<00:04:44.300> still<00:04:44.480> able<00:04:44.600> to<00:04:44.810> read<00:04:44.990> them<00:04:45.200> and<00:04:45.860> then
