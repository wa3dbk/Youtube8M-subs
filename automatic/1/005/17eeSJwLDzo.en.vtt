00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
following a chin implant the things that

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.090 
following a chin implant the things that
are<00:00:21.570> unique<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.260> chin<00:00:22.470> implant<00:00:22.500> versus

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
are unique to a chin implant versus

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.340 
are unique to a chin implant versus
other<00:00:23.250> procedures<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.930> want<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.199> cover

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
first week that's very very common you

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.670 
first week that's very very common you
actually<00:00:33.870> feel<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.110> there's<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> foreign

object<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.190> there<00:00:35.280> well<00:00:35.430> because<00:00:35.760> there<00:00:35.940> is

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
object in there well because there is

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.110 
object in there well because there is
one<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:37.140> your<00:00:37.380> brain<00:00:37.620> acclimates<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
one but your brain acclimates to the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.119 
one but your brain acclimates to the
presence<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.050> chin<00:00:40.290> implant<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.800> after

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
presence of this chin implant so after

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.240 
presence of this chin implant so after
about<00:00:41.420> 7-10<00:00:42.420> days<00:00:42.620> rarely<00:00:43.620> thereafter<00:00:44.010> you

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
about 7-10 days rarely thereafter you

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.410 
about 7-10 days rarely thereafter you
really<00:00:44.610> don't<00:00:44.789> feel<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.030> there's<00:00:45.300> an

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
really don't feel like there's an

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.700 
really don't feel like there's an
implant<00:00:45.750> there<00:00:45.930> anymore<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.559> something

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
implant there anymore so it's something

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.330 
implant there anymore so it's something
just<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:48.079> keep<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.260> mind<00:00:49.440> you'll<00:00:49.680> also<00:00:49.860> feel

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
just to keep in mind you'll also feel

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.340 
just to keep in mind you'll also feel
that<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.789> very<00:00:50.940> very<00:00:51.270> tight<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.629> thick<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
that it's very very tight and thick and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.319 
that it's very very tight and thick and
heavy<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.010> that's<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.969> feel<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
heavy and that's you feel like the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.729 
heavy and that's you feel like the
weight<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.840> chin<00:00:55.020> implant<00:00:55.289> again<00:00:55.530> that's

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
weight of the chin implant again that's

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.040 
weight of the chin implant again that's
more<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.699> sensation<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.510> feel<00:00:57.809> for

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
more of a sensation that you feel for

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.660 
more of a sensation that you feel for
the<00:00:58.109> first<00:00:58.350> week<00:00:58.620> partly<00:00:59.160> due<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.340> swelling

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the first week partly due to swelling

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.189 
the first week partly due to swelling
and<00:00:59.969> partly<00:01:00.300> due<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> fact<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.930> there<00:01:01.170> is

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and partly due the fact that there is

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.619 
and partly due the fact that there is
physically<00:01:01.770> something<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:03.210> other

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
physically something there the other

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.590 
physically something there the other
thing<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.049> understand<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.890> your<00:01:05.760> speech<00:01:06.210> can

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
thing to understand is your speech can

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600 
thing to understand is your speech can
be<00:01:06.630> slightly<00:01:07.049> affected<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.860> first<00:01:08.130> seven<00:01:08.580> to

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
be slightly affected the first seven to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.609 
be slightly affected the first seven to
fourteen<00:01:09.090> days<00:01:09.119> even<00:01:09.630> sometimes<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.290> short<00:01:10.530> is

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
fourteen days even sometimes it short is

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.500 
fourteen days even sometimes it short is
three<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.920> five<00:01:11.130> days<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.119> reason<00:01:12.299> for

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
three to five days and the reason for

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.980 
three to five days and the reason for
that<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.990> mentalis<00:01:15.990> muscle

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
that is that the mentalis muscle

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.530 
that is that the mentalis muscle
mentalis<00:01:16.799> muscle<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.340> put<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> implant<00:01:18.060> under

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
mentalis muscle I put the implant under

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.170 
mentalis muscle I put the implant under
the<00:01:18.689> mentalis<00:01:19.200> muscle<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> chin<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.400> when

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the mentalis muscle of the chin and when

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.940 
the mentalis muscle of the chin and when
you<00:01:21.270> put<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.570> when<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> put<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> implant<00:01:22.740> under

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
you put it when I put the implant under

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.410 
you put it when I put the implant under
there<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.100> actually<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.820> go<00:01:23.939> through<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
there I actually have to go through the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
there I actually have to go through the
mentalis<00:01:24.900> muscle<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.770> mentalis<00:01:26.220> muscle

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
mentalis muscle and the mentalis muscle

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.700 
mentalis muscle and the mentalis muscle
I<00:01:26.610> close<00:01:27.000> at<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> end<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.600> procedure<00:01:27.780> but

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
I close at the end of the procedure but

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.469 
I close at the end of the procedure but
the<00:01:28.829> mentalis<00:01:29.250> muscle<00:01:29.250> still<00:01:29.850> hasn't<00:01:30.150> healed

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the mentalis muscle still hasn't healed

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.200 
the mentalis muscle still hasn't healed
so<00:01:30.950> one<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.430> nerves<00:01:32.640> go<00:01:32.850> into<00:01:33.090> them

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
so one of the the nerves go into them

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.789 
so one of the the nerves go into them
into<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> mentalis<00:01:34.229> muscle<00:01:34.229> there's<00:01:34.740> a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
into the mentalis muscle there's a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.770 
into the mentalis muscle there's a
slight<00:01:35.610> dysfunction<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.420> there<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.689> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
slight dysfunction so there can be a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.260

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
some hair here the reason they

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.089 
some hair here the reason they
oftentimes<00:03:10.989> have<00:03:11.260> hair<00:03:11.469> here<00:03:11.709> maybe<00:03:11.919> the

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
oftentimes have hair here maybe the

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.770 
oftentimes have hair here maybe the
obvious<00:03:12.459> reason<00:03:12.819> which<00:03:12.969> is<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.239> fact<00:03:13.449> that<00:03:13.569> it

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
obvious reason which is the fact that it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.899 
obvious reason which is the fact that it
creates<00:03:14.260> more<00:03:14.439> projection<00:03:14.949> and<00:03:15.219> the<00:03:15.280> illusion

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
creates more projection and the illusion

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.170 
creates more projection and the illusion
of<00:03:16.139> of<00:03:17.139> a<00:03:17.439> more<00:03:18.099> prominent<00:03:18.609> chin<00:03:18.819> when<00:03:19.030> there's

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
of of a more prominent chin when there's

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.030 
of of a more prominent chin when there's
a<00:03:19.239> deficient<00:03:19.750> chin<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.169> he<00:03:20.439> asked<00:03:20.680> me<00:03:20.769> should

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
a deficient chin and he asked me should

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.559 
a deficient chin and he asked me should
I<00:03:21.069> go<00:03:21.250> ahead<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.549> shave<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:21.970> all<00:03:22.120> off<00:03:22.329> before

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
I go ahead and shave that all off before

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.960 
I go ahead and shave that all off before
the<00:03:22.930> procedure<00:03:23.109> and<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.590> said<00:03:23.799> no<00:03:23.949> actually<00:03:24.790> if

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
the procedure and I said no actually if

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.580 
the procedure and I said no actually if
you're<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.209> gentleman<00:03:25.689> that<00:03:25.840> has<00:03:26.049> a<00:03:26.079> goatee<00:03:26.379> or

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
you're a gentleman that has a goatee or

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.770 
you're a gentleman that has a goatee or
a<00:03:26.859> beard<00:03:27.250> it's<00:03:27.639> a<00:03:27.759> great<00:03:27.939> idea<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.299> keep<00:03:28.540> the

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
a beard it's a great idea to keep the

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.770 
a beard it's a great idea to keep the
beard<00:03:29.019> or<00:03:29.290> goatee<00:03:30.000> because<00:03:31.000> during<00:03:31.599> the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
beard or goatee because during the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.809 
beard or goatee because during the
healing<00:03:32.109> phase<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.769> will<00:03:32.799> actually<00:03:33.069> distract

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
healing phase it will actually distract

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.659 
healing phase it will actually distract
the<00:03:34.030> viewer<00:03:34.060> from<00:03:34.540> seeing<00:03:35.040> any<00:03:36.040> swelling<00:03:36.430> in

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
the viewer from seeing any swelling in

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.369 
the viewer from seeing any swelling in
that<00:03:36.790> area<00:03:37.060> so<00:03:37.689> that<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.930> makes<00:03:38.049> it<00:03:38.229> a<00:03:38.290> little

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
that area so that it makes it a little

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.849 
that area so that it makes it a little
bit<00:03:38.590> less<00:03:38.879> visible<00:03:39.879> most<00:03:40.629> times<00:03:41.349> in<00:03:41.530> terms<00:03:41.739> of

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
bit less visible most times in terms of

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.349 
bit less visible most times in terms of
recovery<00:03:42.129> it's<00:03:42.400> not<00:03:42.609> significant<00:03:43.269> in<00:03:43.299> terms

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
recovery it's not significant in terms

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.229 
recovery it's not significant in terms
of<00:03:43.599> discomfort<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.290> recovery<00:03:44.979> times<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.430> still

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
of discomfort and recovery times I still

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.939 
of discomfort and recovery times I still
probably<00:03:46.599> would<00:03:46.840> advise<00:03:47.109> in<00:03:47.379> general<00:03:47.709> about<00:03:47.829> a

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
probably would advise in general about a

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.710 
probably would advise in general about a
week<00:03:48.189> off<00:03:48.370> from<00:03:48.579> work<00:03:48.669> so<00:03:49.150> that<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.299> just<00:03:49.599> have

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
week off from work so that you just have

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.319 
week off from work so that you just have
a<00:03:49.750> little<00:03:49.959> bit<00:03:50.139> more<00:03:50.319> casual<00:03:50.769> time<00:03:51.069> not<00:03:51.939> to<00:03:52.180> be

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
a little bit more casual time not to be

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.640 
a little bit more casual time not to be
worried<00:03:52.659> about<00:03:52.750> some<00:03:53.199> of<00:03:53.259> the<00:03:53.319> discomfort

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
worried about some of the discomfort

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.229 
worried about some of the discomfort
level<00:03:53.829> in<00:03:54.159> the<00:03:54.250> first<00:03:54.430> few<00:03:54.609> days<00:03:54.759> in<00:03:54.909> terms<00:03:55.090> of

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
level in the first few days in terms of

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.759 
level in the first few days in terms of
feeling<00:03:55.629> heavy<00:03:55.810> or<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.139> presence<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.620> an

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
feeling heavy or the presence of an

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.189 
feeling heavy or the presence of an
implant<00:03:57.129> beyond<00:03:58.090> that<00:03:58.209> most<00:03:58.599> people<00:03:58.870> I<00:03:58.959> think

00:03:59.189 --> 00:03:59.199 
implant beyond that most people I think

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.080 
implant beyond that most people I think
two<00:03:59.349> weeks<00:03:59.500> off<00:03:59.709> is<00:03:59.889> probably<00:04:00.370> excessive<00:04:00.939> but

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
two weeks off is probably excessive but

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.969 
two weeks off is probably excessive but
obviously<00:04:01.449> I<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:02.049> only<00:04:02.079> thing<00:04:02.319> i<00:04:02.500> can<00:04:02.560> predict

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:02.979 
obviously I the only thing i can predict

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.080 
obviously I the only thing i can predict
about<00:04:03.069> human<00:04:03.459> nature<00:04:03.489> it's<00:04:03.909> it's

about human nature it's it's

unpredictable in other words you may not

days usually seven now I do multiple
skin<00:04:14.049> closures<00:04:14.530> so<00:04:14.709> that<00:04:15.159> incision<00:04:15.489> comes<00:04:15.849> out

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
skin closures so that incision comes out

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.490
