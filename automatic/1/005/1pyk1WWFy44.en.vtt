manufacturers range at the moment it's a
hugely<00:01:48.600> popular<00:01:49.290> trend<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.360> something

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
hugely popular trend so it is something

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.969

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.219 
that a lot of people are getting into I
would<00:01:53.430> suggest<00:01:54.000> actually<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> great

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
would suggest actually this is a great

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.560 
would suggest actually this is a great
shoe<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.500> start<00:01:55.710> off<00:01:55.979> with<00:01:56.189> I'm<00:01:57.119> gonna<00:01:57.360> be

reviewing<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.350> pair<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.100> V<00:01:59.280> Browns<00:01:59.579> fairly

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
reviewing a pair of the V Browns fairly

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.499 
reviewing a pair of the V Browns fairly
soon<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:01.110> would<00:02:01.259> say<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.710> they<00:02:02.399> are

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
soon and I would say that they are

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.600 
soon and I would say that they are
possibly<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:04.350> little<00:02:04.710> extreme<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:05.219> someone

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
possibly a little extreme for someone

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.740 
possibly a little extreme for someone
that<00:02:05.729> hasn't<00:02:05.880> tried<00:02:06.149> barefoot<00:02:06.570> running

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
that hasn't tried barefoot running

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.830 
that hasn't tried barefoot running
before<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:08.039> I'm<00:02:08.459> not<00:02:08.759> actually<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.599> big

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
before on I'm not actually a big

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.110 
before on I'm not actually a big
barefoot<00:02:10.319> runner<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.649> terms<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.120> advocating

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
barefoot runner in terms of advocating

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.750 
barefoot runner in terms of advocating
it<00:02:12.270> but<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.690> do<00:02:12.780> think<00:02:13.080> it's<00:02:13.230> something

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
it but I do think it's something

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.199 
it but I do think it's something
good<00:02:14.030> for<00:02:14.689> training<00:02:14.900> foot<00:02:15.319> muscles<00:02:15.879> so<00:02:16.879> it's

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
good for training foot muscles so it's

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.039 
good for training foot muscles so it's
something<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:17.540> I'm<00:02:17.750> going<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.959> be

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
something that I'm going to be

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.390 
something that I'm going to be
incorporating<00:02:18.680> more<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.010> more<00:02:19.129> in<00:02:19.250> my

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
incorporating more and more in my

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.509 
incorporating more and more in my
training<00:02:20.409> but<00:02:21.409> these<00:02:21.560> are<00:02:21.709> also<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.040> great<00:02:22.310> pair

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
training but these are also a great pair

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.869 
training but these are also a great pair
of<00:02:22.549> shoes<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:23.150> wear<00:02:23.329> when<00:02:24.200> you're<00:02:24.319> not<00:02:24.500> running
