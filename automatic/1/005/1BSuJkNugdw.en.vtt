00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.570
 hello how about friends from youtube and good 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.430
 this video is only computer is 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.550
 informative sorry I just want to give 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.980
 know some points of view that and some 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.230
 solutions to the problem of rock in the 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.150
 motorola how met he just came out 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.460
 it just does not have much just going to stop 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.429
 a month I think and well I think you see this 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.009
 information will be very useful in 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.769
 First of all I bring you the solution to 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.649
 those who can not remove the motorola 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:35.000
 eye here the motorola retains about 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:37.580
 files which makes it good 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.489
 more secure what is the system has 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.710
 more system security good what 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.520
 we would have to do is restore it to 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.450
 the factory data and try the root 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.610
 This information is pulled from Android app 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.560
 andrew pp 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.940
 in one of your on your website and well 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.150
 there says that still users and the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.239
 worked or resolution would also be 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.730
 take out the room master or download the 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.910
 room master on the phone 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.070
 the apec to download download it to 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.500
 phone install it and that would serve as 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.820
 drivers for the phone and this 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.880
 way we could root the motorola 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.470
 good now with the strengths a 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.570
 some people who have commented to me 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.470
 that have already been able to root the motorola 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.259
 I have been told that the superuser does not 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.470
 gives good root access this happened to me 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.380
 just an hour ago in the morning that I 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.620
 like that of the 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.990
 8 in the morning that I get up 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.680
 and it resets my phone to the data of 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.680
 good factory as it was to know how it was 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.580
 to prevent myself and to know the root is 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.580
 It was good but it did not go totally 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.920
 I only stayed what would be the 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.400
 is newly resetted right now is not 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.150
 It has nothing 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.940
 and right now the only thing that I have left 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.619
 was this 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.619
 so I stay the same 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.030
 good 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.640
 so I stay in this way nothing 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.000
 more I stay that but I did not give the root 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.410
 did not give me access or anything like that 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.160
 so what you have to do 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.990
 it's like security is mocked 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.270
 good let's put it so security 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.520
 of the phone and is mocking the only thing that 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.950
 have to do now is root what 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.370
 but not in the same way now cellular 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.690
 is more vulnerable to what the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.740
 root access I just rooted it 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.350
 again with a lock root they can 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.960
 search videos on youtube or another or 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.510
 post 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.300
 and that will help them much trust me I 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.400
 I am already again and can beat me 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:05.110
 speaks truth has worked well for me already 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:08.110
 to see this I uploaded a news and 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.810
 to my youtube profile that a fet 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.940
 sorry that I had removed the root 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.860
 to restore the factory now 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.900
 We verify and as you can see and we 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.180
 has requested the root access we are going to 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.800
 allow and it says that we already have access 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.660
 root to my people this stays 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.080
 loading loading loading and never 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.150
 I was carrying good that would be all I hope 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.250
 have understood me and that I have 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.090
