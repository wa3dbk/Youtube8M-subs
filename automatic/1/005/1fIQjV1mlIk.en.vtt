00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.950
 I the orphan representing with birds 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.710
 now my life does not tell you what I can 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.360
 be a micro 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.590
 now we are 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.590
 the person 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.880
 Even though time passes I'm still 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.860
 this shit lies and exploded that my 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.080
 back do not break failed promises 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.090
 everything that I get is left to you 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.370
 cut and I live in my own karim to 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.380
 where that promise has remained 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.720
 You did when I got under those things 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.910
 too sad but in the past and 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.559
 nothing is reflected in the memory of your 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.989
 lips are the owner of my pillow 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.120
 I have also changed and I am not the same 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.700
 I'm not that kid I used to be 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.650
 friend of the bad company of the rivas 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.110
 with more lives because more companies 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.699
 they did not have a good path raise your hand 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.460
 for what you have wanted the 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.350
 elevated by two by those miserable and 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.690
 you know why you talk about 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.059
 corners all your promises are like 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.860
 modeling promises without promises promise 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.630
 quiet areas are words that are 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.580
 they forget like thorny paths 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.560
 promises without exit promises of 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.020
 plasticine that makes the world change 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.439
 changing up my routine 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.439
 the promises 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.990
 so receipts ahead as my 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.790
 farewell letters words that 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.860
 project by distancing your routine 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.500
 Anar among the roses includes touching 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.780
 promises spines that fly like angels 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.390
 without wings firing confidence but you 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.220
 you run out of bullets manipulate minds by touching 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.500
 the feelings of the heart and on flickr 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.479
 you betrayed by the sergeant called 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.340
 false friends false murderous words 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.830
 they both enjoy promises of 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.630
 plasticine later gives the face better than 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.270
 you do not hide , go find it 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.710
 corners in a roundabout ask for forgiveness to 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.509
 inspiration for the betrayal of your 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.789
 inclusion of the heart without using the reason 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.890
 only as an explosion frame for its 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.560
 action bastard behavior is just one 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.090
 great meditation projection came to 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.910
 think about what people can do 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.920
 just to be unique or better different 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.600
 I laugh the thanks of mind that comes to me 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.310
 from front from between brave with 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.100
 brandy independent thinking 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.019
 tell me what you feel tell me what happens when 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.069
 we are hot out truths like 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.900
 embers 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.969
 nvidia because you are sun in your curtain 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.950
 Well, in the name that you arrive at home 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.510
 your neighbors the water in your pool the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.819
 revolution of your neighborhood but a 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.040
 scenario gives us plasticine promises 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.079
 uncles promises and medical exits in the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.420
 mines are words that are forgotten as 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.219
 thorny paths promises with no way out 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.810
 promises of plasticine to make you 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:39.750
 I also lived changing my routine 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.840
 this link 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.180
 the entrance and when not 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.550
 for which looming I describe as 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.470
 in my letter of farewell gross messages 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.390
 what did you do when three tears fall to 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.879
 two o'clock in the morning these topics will 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.099
 distract orphans from the weight by feeling 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.110
 of the lexicon words that get lost in the 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.540
 deep universe words and words 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.060
 promises and promises that lowered the 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.040
 head in moments of sadness you pray 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.870
 so that death does not come as a surprise and 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.150
 scythe and wrapped taking you 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.980
 as prisoners, I am certain that 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.260
 princess do not exist taking these 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.880
 beers you come and you went three 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.950
 tears then they lack my holes 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.959
 empty between shady roads with my 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.150
 steps I guide myself so that it is already 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.280
 always with my instruments of anything goes 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.170
 if with 'the this comes out not of Wales not 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.420
 I wrap myself in the lies just loose 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.890
 the truth the remedy the life and I give the 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.900
 life for the rap promises 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.360
 of plasticine are words that 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.400
 forget as path of thorns promises 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.230
 no exit promises of plasticine that 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.870
 so the only change changed until 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.030
 my routine promises and sounds promises of 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.280
 full plague all have been very 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.010
 within my truth and when the lie 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.200
 is why is coming I write as 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.180
 my farewell letters promises without 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.160
 promises of plasticine are 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.500
 words that are forgotten as path of 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160
 thorns promises without exit promises of 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.160
 other thin
