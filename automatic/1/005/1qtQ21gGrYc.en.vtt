00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:08.269
 I greet all my subscribers and 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:12.599
 today we will look at the braces procedure 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:17.310
 steering rack on cars VAZ 2110 11 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.070
 12 in principle as for the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.740
 procedures it is similar to viburnum prior 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.769
 Gran one new machines such as 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.369
 nine eight but there is still 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.430
 small differences ie firstly 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.500
 key differences 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:39.360
 this is the key specifically for the helmsman 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.149
 well, and knees in 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.010
 principle also costs 10 rake therefore 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.140
 the key will be exactly the same on nines 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:56.660
 eights key will be different so what 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:58.649
 concerns the location the location of everything 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.800
 engine compartment that is on 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.329
 knees from under the hood tighten the rail 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.119
 not very convenient to shoot 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.590
 battery pad battery 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.830
 of course we only remove the pad after 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.340
 This is not very convenient to put under 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.119
 key input steering rack and pull up 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.720
 its dozens in principle here with 8 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.799
 valve engine as you can see here 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.119
 there is a lot of space that is 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.630
 get to the river 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.600
 no big deal so there i am 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:43.070
 set the lighting to show for 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:46.890
 those who do not know where this place is 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.670
 adjustments so-called god so as not to 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.670
 I know what to call 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:02:09.860
 now try to show I do not know 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:15.400
 as it could be seen that it is now 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:21.170
 let's see everything is perfectly there 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.920
 then take our key here this one 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.390
 by this side 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:31.160
 need to get into the recess of the nut 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:38.560
 which may say so is 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:44.180
 adjusting so again all this 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:56.510
 I will visually try to show although not 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:03:03.560
 sure so it will look when 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:07.220
 got into the recess along the edges do well 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.599
 In principle, one 4 turns can be made on 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.780
 first time and try at all 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:20.930
 the result ie if the rake continues 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:23.120
 pounding then you can tighten this nut yet 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.940
 a little tight do not 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.599
 recommended because then 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.060
 have to put more effort 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.480
 when turning the steering wheel and in some moments 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.799
 it may even stick a little 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.700
 therefore it is necessary to achieve such 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.889
 result to 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:47.150
 and the rake did not knock and the steering wheel did not bite 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:53.720
 In principle, what else to say on this 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:56.030
 problem of course if you have already tightened 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.400
 nut until the end of the river still continues 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:03.420
 knocking something this thing already need 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:09.230
 repair 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:13.920
 on my knees in at run 60 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:19.700
 Now 61000 I pulled up to somewhere 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:27.169
 probably three times the rail somewhere on 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:32.160
 1 4 turns so it was in principle 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:34.500
 Now there is no knock but every 10,000 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.160
 starting 3 to 3 run and have to 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.290
 little by little tighten and and maybe that in 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:45.930
 further, you will either have to change the rail 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:51.060
 either repair and and so basically on 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:55.080
 this is probably all for those who are waiting for the topic 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:58.020
 for disassembly, in principle, show that 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.570
 nothing because I do 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.500
 video reviews 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:07.410
 I put the salon on Avito that is 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.140
 front seats back sofa and trim 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.789
 I want to sell everything in a set if 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.530
 kit it does not sell at least for 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.210
 month then I will scatter it all 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.640
 separately 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.970
 Well, I sold alloy wheels on summer 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:24.330
 seven and a half thousand tires 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.350
 principle is practically nothing 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.380
 exhibited so small things trunk mat 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.870
 guts there door 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:37.280
 glass windows on the glass already 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.770
 called a couple of times until no one came 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.320
 in general, the adjustment of the steering rack 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:48.470
 more precisely suspenders and nuts everything is clear I 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:50.970
 I think wait for new video reviews 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:54.410
 subscribe to channel like and 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.410
 see you in the next videos
