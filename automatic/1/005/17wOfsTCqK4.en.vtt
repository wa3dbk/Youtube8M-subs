00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
of my favorite formations in all the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.440 
of my favorite formations in all the
peoples<00:02:20.250> for<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.460> longest<00:02:20.760> time<00:02:20.880> has<00:02:21.150> always

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
peoples for the longest time has always

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.600 
peoples for the longest time has always
been<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.660> four<00:02:21.960> three<00:02:22.230> one<00:02:22.680> two<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.190> this

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
been the four three one two and this

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.580 
been the four three one two and this
formation<00:02:24.030> almost<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.750> identical<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.500> that

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
formation almost is identical to that

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.200 
formation almost is identical to that
but<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.130> allows<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.700> play<00:02:26.910> with<00:02:27.090> the

but it allows you to play with the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.600 
but it allows you to play with the
