one<00:04:33.030> of<00:04:33.120> my<00:04:33.240> favorite<00:04:33.660> questions<00:04:34.170> I<00:04:34.410> was

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
one of my favorite questions I was

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.530 
one of my favorite questions I was
curious<00:04:35.310> what<00:04:35.730> people<00:04:36.030> thought<00:04:36.210> about<00:04:36.270> the

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
curious what people thought about the

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.030 
curious what people thought about the
photos<00:04:36.840> that<00:04:37.050> I've<00:04:37.140> been<00:04:37.260> posting<00:04:37.710> on<00:04:37.890> the

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
photos that I've been posting on the

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.740 
photos that I've been posting on the
website<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.750> self-portraits<00:04:39.750> and

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
website the self-portraits and

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.090 
website the self-portraits and
surprisingly<00:04:42.750> no<00:04:43.380> one<00:04:43.530> thinks<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.890> should

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
surprisingly no one thinks I should

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.960 
surprisingly no one thinks I should
cover<00:04:44.250> up<00:04:44.430> more<00:04:44.670> in<00:04:44.730> my<00:04:44.850> photos<00:04:45.770> imagine<00:04:46.770> that

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
cover up more in my photos imagine that

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.250 
cover up more in my photos imagine that
most<00:04:47.970> people<00:04:48.360> thought<00:04:48.540> that<00:04:48.600> that<00:04:49.020> it<00:04:49.140> was

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
most people thought that that it was

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.140 
most people thought that that it was
pretty<00:04:49.440> much<00:04:49.590> just<00:04:49.650> right<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:50.460> I'll<00:04:51.000> keep

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
pretty much just right so I'll keep

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.140 
pretty much just right so I'll keep
going<00:04:51.420> with<00:04:51.540> what<00:04:51.570> I've<00:04:51.780> been<00:04:51.900> doing<00:04:53.120> and

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.090 

another<00:04:57.150> thing<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.080> wanted<00:04:58.410> to<00:04:58.470> know<00:04:58.740> is

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
another thing that I wanted to know is

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.030 
another thing that I wanted to know is
if<00:04:59.490> my<00:05:00.150> videos<00:05:00.750> were<00:05:01.200> detailed<00:05:01.800> enough

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
if my videos were detailed enough

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.610 
if my videos were detailed enough
because<00:05:02.610> you<00:05:03.480> know<00:05:03.600> I<00:05:03.870> have<00:05:03.960> such<00:05:04.320> a<00:05:04.440> wide

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
because you know I have such a wide

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.740 
because you know I have such a wide
range<00:05:04.920> of<00:05:05.130> people<00:05:05.490> that<00:05:05.700> view<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.120> videos<00:05:06.480> I

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
range of people that view the videos I

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.740 
range of people that view the videos I
have<00:05:07.020> very<00:05:07.290> novice<00:05:08.160> photographers<00:05:08.850> who<00:05:09.240> who

of<00:05:52.710> sorts<00:05:52.740> you<00:05:53.430> know<00:05:53.490> for<00:05:53.700> lack<00:05:53.820> of<00:05:53.880> a<00:05:54.060> better

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
of sorts you know for lack of a better

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.250 
of sorts you know for lack of a better
term<00:05:54.360> of<00:05:55.160> information<00:05:56.160> on<00:05:56.960> photography<00:05:57.960> and

lighting and

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.000 
lighting and
it<00:06:00.460> would<00:06:00.580> include<00:06:01.390> examples<00:06:01.600> of<00:06:02.140> photographs

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
and then maybe I'm not sure maybe a

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.940 
and then maybe I'm not sure maybe a
lighting<00:06:05.890> diagram<00:06:06.720> and<00:06:07.720> some<00:06:08.170> specifics<00:06:08.710> so

and<00:06:23.140> I<00:06:23.500> wasn't<00:06:23.740> sure<00:06:23.920> if<00:06:24.280> I<00:06:24.430> should<00:06:24.460> do<00:06:24.730> a<00:06:24.760> hard

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
and I wasn't sure if I should do a hard

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.240 
and I wasn't sure if I should do a hard
copy<00:06:25.300> or<00:06:25.510> I<00:06:25.960> should<00:06:26.230> do<00:06:26.380> something<00:06:26.410> electronic

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
copy or I should do something electronic

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.880 
copy or I should do something electronic
like<00:06:27.730> from<00:06:28.210> an<00:06:28.420> e-book<00:06:28.810> or<00:06:29.020> a<00:06:29.680> mobile<00:06:30.520> app<00:06:31.890> it

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:32.890 
like from an e-book or a mobile app it

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.830 
like from an e-book or a mobile app it
looks<00:06:33.130> like<00:06:33.430> it's<00:06:34.030> pretty<00:06:34.120> much<00:06:34.450> half<00:06:34.660> and

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
looks like it's pretty much half and

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.750 
looks like it's pretty much half and
half<00:06:34.990> between<00:06:35.230> hard<00:06:35.650> copy<00:06:35.890> and<00:06:36.070> electronic

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
half between hard copy and electronic

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.450 
half between hard copy and electronic
copy<00:06:36.970> I<00:06:37.360> myself<00:06:38.350> have<00:06:38.770> been<00:06:38.800> leaning<00:06:39.160> more

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
copy I myself have been leaning more

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.660 
copy I myself have been leaning more
towards<00:06:39.850> doing<00:06:40.030> a<00:06:40.240> mobile<00:06:40.600> app<00:06:40.780> because<00:06:41.710> I'd

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:42.670 
towards doing a mobile app because I'd

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.850 
towards doing a mobile app because I'd
be<00:06:42.850> able<00:06:42.970> to<00:06:43.060> update<00:06:43.270> it<00:06:43.660> a<00:06:43.780> lot<00:06:44.080> more<00:06:44.290> easily

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
be able to update it a lot more easily

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.520 
be able to update it a lot more easily
so<00:06:45.820> I've<00:06:46.540> been<00:06:46.660> thinking<00:06:46.720> about<00:06:47.050> doing<00:06:47.260> that

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
so I've been thinking about doing that

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.950 
so I've been thinking about doing that
but<00:06:47.740> that<00:06:48.700> would<00:06:48.820> require<00:06:48.940> my<00:06:49.420> investment<00:06:49.870> in

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
but that would require my investment in

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.410 
but that would require my investment in
a<00:06:50.020> mac<00:06:50.230> and<00:06:50.560> i'm<00:06:51.520> just<00:06:51.820> not<00:06:51.970> sure<00:06:52.030> if<00:06:52.270> I'm<00:06:52.390> ready

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.420 
a mac and i'm just not sure if I'm ready

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.570 
a mac and i'm just not sure if I'm ready
to<00:06:52.780> do<00:06:52.900> that<00:06:52.930> so<00:06:53.440> stay<00:06:53.830> tuned<00:06:54.070> on<00:06:54.190> that<00:06:54.250> topic

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
to do that so stay tuned on that topic

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.650 
to do that so stay tuned on that topic
I'm<00:06:54.790> going<00:06:54.910> to<00:06:54.970> start<00:06:55.150> working<00:06:55.270> on<00:06:55.570> the
