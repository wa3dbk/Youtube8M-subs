00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
word shielding on the back cover yep

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.760 
word shielding on the back cover yep
we'll<00:02:27.720> be<00:02:27.840> showing<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.410> right<00:02:29.130> now<00:02:30.290> it's<00:02:31.290> it

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
we'll be showing that right now it's it

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.180 
we'll be showing that right now it's it
it's<00:02:32.460> kind<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.360> important<00:02:33.900> it's<00:02:34.440> mostly<00:02:34.950> there

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
it's kind of important it's mostly there

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.120 
it's kind of important it's mostly there
I<00:02:35.220> think<00:02:35.580> just<00:02:35.790> for<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.500> think<00:02:37.740> it's<00:02:37.860> a

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
I think just for that the I think it's a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.460 
I think just for that the I think it's a
very<00:02:38.700> important<00:02:39.209> part<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.780> book<00:02:40.020> whoa

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
very important part of the book whoa

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.930 
very important part of the book whoa
let's<00:02:40.950> just<00:02:41.130> say<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.520> good<00:02:41.760> for<00:02:41.910> a

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
let's just say it's a good for a

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.890 
let's just say it's a good for a
presentation<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.750> something<00:02:43.230> but<00:02:43.560> yes<00:02:43.800> yes

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
presentation of something but yes yes

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.060 
presentation of something but yes yes
all<00:02:45.900> right<00:02:46.160> so<00:02:47.160> um<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:48.090> thought<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.170> was<00:02:49.230> very<00:02:49.650> I

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
all right so um I thought it was very I

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.820 
all right so um I thought it was very I
thought<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.910> was<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.350> different<00:02:52.350> ending

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
thought it was a different ending

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.150 
thought it was a different ending
because<00:02:53.040> um<00:02:54.290> it's<00:02:55.290> definitely<00:02:55.920> one<00:02:56.130> you

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
because um it's definitely one you

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.949 
because um it's definitely one you
didn't<00:02:56.459> see<00:02:56.700> coming<00:02:56.730> there<00:02:57.540> were<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.720> lot<00:02:57.930> of

didn't see coming there were a lot of

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.070 
didn't see coming there were a lot of
plot<00:02:58.320> twists<00:02:58.890> do<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.130> agree<00:02:59.340> yeah<00:03:00.120> mm-hmm
