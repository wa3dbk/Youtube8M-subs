we<00:03:18.720> made<00:03:18.900> 1,000<00:03:19.890> GPS<00:03:20.310> in<00:03:21.350> like<00:03:22.350> 10<00:03:22.890> seconds<00:03:23.340> so

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
we made 1,000 GPS in like 10 seconds so

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.759 
we made 1,000 GPS in like 10 seconds so
let's<00:03:25.290> try<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:25.500> out<00:03:26.750> 1,000<00:03:29.000> times<00:03:30.590> let's<00:03:31.590> say

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
let's try this out 1,000 times let's say

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.190 
let's try this out 1,000 times let's say
you<00:03:31.830> can<00:03:32.070> do<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:33.590> 10<00:03:34.590> times<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:35.010> minute<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.640> do

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
you can do this 10 times a minute so do

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:44.810 
you can do this 10 times a minute so do
x<00:03:40.910> so<00:03:41.910> we<00:03:41.940> do<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.239> times<00:03:42.450> 10<00:03:43.700> then<00:03:44.700> we're

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
x so we do that times 10 then we're

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.520 
x so we do that times 10 then we're
going<00:03:44.940> up<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.030> 10,000<00:03:45.660> a<00:03:45.690> minute<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.110> if<00:03:46.320> we<00:03:46.410> do

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
going up to 10,000 a minute and if we do

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.530 
going up to 10,000 a minute and if we do
x<00:03:46.769> 60<00:03:48.050> it's<00:03:49.050> around<00:03:49.320> 600,000<00:03:50.390> now<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:51.420> don't

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
x 60 it's around 600,000 now I don't

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.850

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
minute could be that small orb lower

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.900 
minute could be that small orb lower
than<00:03:54.660> or<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.350> can<00:03:55.500> lower<00:03:55.980> slower<00:03:56.489> you<00:03:56.760> could

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
than or you can lower slower you could

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.030 
than or you can lower slower you could
do<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.060> faster<00:03:57.450> but<00:03:58.050> I'm<00:03:58.530> going<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.709> say<00:03:58.920> it's

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
do it faster but I'm going to say it's

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.580 
do it faster but I'm going to say it's
Ron<00:03:59.220> 550<00:03:59.970> k<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.420> our<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.230> you<00:04:01.320> getting<00:04:01.470> some

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
Ron 550 k and our and you getting some

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.550 
Ron 550 k and our and you getting some
major<00:04:01.800> XP<00:04:02.070> with<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.310> as<00:04:02.430> well<00:04:02.550> so<00:04:03.239> yeah<00:04:04.230> the

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
major XP with it as well so yeah the

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
major XP with it as well so yeah the
reason<00:04:04.709> it's<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:04.980> little<00:04:05.160> higher<00:04:05.280> now<00:04:05.310> is

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
reason it's a little higher now is

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.509 
reason it's a little higher now is
because<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:06.390> all<00:04:06.600> changes<00:04:06.989> right<00:04:07.170> away<00:04:07.430> like<00:04:08.430> I

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
because it all changes right away like I

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.830 
because it all changes right away like I
was<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.700> another<00:04:08.880> example<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.540> used<00:04:09.870> to<00:04:09.959> do<00:04:11.840> it

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
was to another example it used to do it

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.539 
was to another example it used to do it
used<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.140> do<00:04:13.230> where<00:04:13.410> you<00:04:13.440> basically<00:04:13.650> you<00:04:14.430> had

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
used to do where you basically you had

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.030 
used to do where you basically you had
to<00:04:16.669> when<00:04:17.669> you<00:04:17.760> do<00:04:17.850> this<00:04:18.140> then<00:04:19.140> it<00:04:19.290> just<00:04:19.650> do<00:04:19.799> this

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
to when you do this then it just do this

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.890 
to when you do this then it just do this
one<00:04:20.220> then<00:04:20.519> this<00:04:20.580> one<00:04:20.790> then<00:04:21.239> this<00:04:21.269> one<00:04:21.450> but<00:04:21.810> this

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
one then this one then this one but this

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.270 
one then this one then this one but this
list<00:04:22.140> see<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.260> does<00:04:22.350> it<00:04:22.470> right<00:04:22.590> away<00:04:22.710> it's<00:04:23.220> a

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
list see it does it right away it's a

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.469 
list see it does it right away it's a
really<00:04:23.520> fast<00:04:23.789> so<00:04:24.570> that's<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:24.960> reason<00:04:24.990> it's

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
really fast so that's the reason it's

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.149 
really fast so that's the reason it's
it's<00:04:27.479> lot<00:04:27.599> faster<00:04:27.930> now<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.199> a<00:04:28.229> lot<00:04:28.379> more<00:04:28.439> money

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:29.159 
it's lot faster now and a lot more money

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.990 
it's lot faster now and a lot more money
per<00:04:29.490> hour<00:04:29.639> so<00:04:29.939> it's<00:04:30.060> run<00:04:30.240> thousand<00:04:31.129> GPM<00:04:32.129> profit

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
per hour so it's run thousand GPM profit

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.219 
per hour so it's run thousand GPM profit
per<00:04:33.150> minute<00:04:33.360> or<00:04:33.449> which<00:04:33.599> is<00:04:33.719> actually<00:04:33.960> really

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
per minute or which is actually really

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.800 
per minute or which is actually really
good<00:04:34.319> so<00:04:35.069> anyways<00:04:35.610> guys<00:04:35.729> a<00:04:35.789> hundred<00:04:36.389> likes<00:04:36.539> for
