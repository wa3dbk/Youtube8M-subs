 handicrafts expert welcome 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.040
 welcome 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.890
 with the square eye because it's going to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.289
 play a Christmas cushion separately without 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.769
 seams without machine that we do not have 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.410
 good sounds nice and easy clear look 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.689
 let's do a job today thinking about 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.279
 the machine rather the people who do not 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.990
 they have a machine that is this cushion that 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.190
 I'm going to show here here is very good 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.719
 that is made with fabric but with this 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.059
 tape and I'll show it here 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.219
 quickly the isi minds enter by 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.040
 love of new function is called is 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.320
 I already know that with heat sticks is who 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.850
 wonder let's see the materials 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.230
 so they can do it and then you 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.949
 I keep telling what we're going to do then 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.649
 We are going to require red fabric cloth 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.590
 with Christmas motives they are seeing red a 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.829
 Large needle for stamen glue 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.379
 this tape that shows you 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.320
 and the iron in the house is the only thing 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.330
 we are going to need and how are we going to start 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.250
 to make this cushion first what 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.780
 let's do with the red fabric and what 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.130
 I wanted to do with Christmas reasons for 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.509
 that the red cloth you can do with 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.649
 another color too you want 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:21.470
 let's make a square of 45 x 45 and 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.289
 this square here draw you a 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.929
 Grid let's see if we can 15 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.960
 x 15 in the grid and I what I did 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.869
 was to thread a needle with the yarn and 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.149
 using this grid I did the motive 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.100
 of the cat because something I did not tell you is 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.679
 that this cushion is also a board 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.390
 to play the cat has germÃ¡n the 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.549
 bold we will see it little by little 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.950
 there is the video with the detail of 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.950
 how are we doing this sewing 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.530
 which is easy to more like coming in and out 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.140
 to analyze it the mind is a basting 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.960
 although and then here I show you is already 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.030
 basting what would come to be 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.370
 the cat ok you could also do it 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.990
 painted and you want 6 and in the part 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.720
 frontal here I want to show you 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.430
 we are also going to place velcro because 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.320
 all the decorations of our coming 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.700

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.070

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.840
 cat exactly in some meeting that 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.260
 we are already there as we are going to do 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.740
 that we play here and entertain start a 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.050
 we will invite here is important you need 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.820
 five pieces of one and five pieces of the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.510
 another then in the center part 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:35.020
 let's put two pieces ok because 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.210
 is a 99 boxes now how are we going 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.830
 to arm and here is between our tape 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.150
 in arms and here 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.150
 let's open it here 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.280
 to iron 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.780
 griddle 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.060
 fast little iron, let's do 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.030
 an edge cited one centimeter at all 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.250
 this square 9 here is this 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.580
 centimeter an inch for all 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.940
 costs because on this edge we are going to 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.490
 place the diffusion tape or ribbon 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.390
 Bastilla also call him there's no need 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:15.870
 Remove has been bent so here 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.060
 very easy and there we are going to place the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.630
 two other pieces the other two pieces 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.100
 are two rectangles of 30 x 45 these 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.130
 measures that I am giving you are of 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.880
 standard cushions since this is two 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.880
 rectangles that equal and we did the 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.880
 superimposed 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.920
 in this way so if you want a finish 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.409
 that 's because it 's kind on the shovel and not 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.420
 to place the filling in fact I 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.189
 I have a cushion think a cushion that I have 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.609
 in the house that already bored me and I put it 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.870
 inside if you really wanted to spend on 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.790
 cushions for Christmas no more do the 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.859
 lining and they use the ones that they have there and 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.959
 you have quality and in that standard there is no 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.250
 law and how we make visits now you 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.400
 will show good this we already do 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.430
 we make the envelope and the fichitas and we go 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.079
 to use mega the slate we have here 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.169
 with the fabric of Christmas motifs here 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:11.840
 cut or a reason a piece of it 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:13.849
 red size that is the background that 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.590
 we are employing and we are also going to 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.680
 reuse our broadcast tape 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.290
 and in the back we're going to paste 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.300
 bits 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.180
 to cut a piece 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.159
 in all the corners and then what 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.349
 we are going to do is super put our 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:33.419
 pieces apart with the other and with the 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.330
 hot hot iron 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.550
 Of course he does not have water like the iron 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.280
 that connected and that does not have exact water 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.810
 We iron and the piece is like this 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.810
 I want to show you here is very good 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.270
 also the route 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.760
 and then do not cut the velcro 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.590
 if the cushion you hit is the vehicle in 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.120
