actually get the flavor of the garlic
and<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> ginger<00:01:52.560> which<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.190> actually<00:01:53.550> getting

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
and the ginger which is actually getting

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.120 
and the ginger which is actually getting
sorted<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> oil<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:55.020> raw<00:01:55.470> flavor<00:01:55.830> of<00:01:56.010> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
sorted in the oil this raw flavor of the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.790 
sorted in the oil this raw flavor of the
garlic<00:01:56.280> has<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.850> go<00:01:57.000> because<00:01:57.600> if<00:01:57.990> garlic<00:01:58.530> stays

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
garlic has to go because if garlic stays

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.890 
garlic has to go because if garlic stays
raw<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.610> entire<00:02:00.000> gravy<00:02:00.360> will<00:02:00.479> not<00:02:00.690> taste

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
raw in the entire gravy will not taste

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.750 
raw in the entire gravy will not taste
good<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.860> why<00:02:01.979> ginger<00:02:02.340> garlic<00:02:02.490> is

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
good so that is why ginger garlic is

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.520 
good so that is why ginger garlic is
always<00:02:03.060> added<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.510> the<00:02:03.600> beginning<00:02:04.050> where<00:02:04.440> you

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
always added in the beginning where you

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.710 
always added in the beginning where you
can<00:02:04.710> really<00:02:05.070> sort<00:02:05.280> ate<00:02:05.490> well<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.060> oil<00:02:06.090> so

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
can really sort ate well in the oil so

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.320 
can really sort ate well in the oil so
once<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.320> sorted<00:02:07.800> this<00:02:08.069> we<00:02:09.060> will<00:02:09.179> now

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
even if the chicken cooks a little more

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.360 
even if the chicken cooks a little more
it<00:02:38.790> still<00:02:39.210> tastes<00:02:39.690> very<00:02:40.230> good<00:02:40.320> now<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.280> the

it still tastes very good now is the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.100 
it still tastes very good now is the
time<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.790> add<00:02:41.910> in<00:02:42.060> tomatoes<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:45.360> doll<00:02:45.600> so

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
this is masoor dal and toor dhal sautee

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.730 
this is masoor dal and toor dhal sautee
all<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.180> high<00:02:51.450> heat<00:02:51.780> that's<00:02:52.110> very

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
all of this on high heat that's very

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.500 
all of this on high heat that's very
very<00:02:53.100> essential<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:56.580> now<00:02:57.570> we'll<00:02:57.810> add<00:02:57.840> in<00:02:58.080> salt

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
very essential and now we'll add in salt

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.750 
very essential and now we'll add in salt
so<00:03:00.510> after<00:03:01.050> we<00:03:01.230> have<00:03:01.410> sauteed<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:02.250> chicken<00:03:02.640> in

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
so after we have sauteed the chicken in

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.970 
so after we have sauteed the chicken in
the<00:03:02.940> dal<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.540> vegetables<00:03:04.080> together<00:03:04.350> we've

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
added salt and now we have to let all of

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.960 
added salt and now we have to let all of
this<00:03:07.440> cook<00:03:07.709> in<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.950> pressure<00:03:08.070> cooker<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:08.760> how

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
this cook in the pressure cooker so how

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.750 
this cook in the pressure cooker so how
do<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.180> do<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.480> very<00:03:10.230> simple<00:03:10.650> we<00:03:11.130> now<00:03:11.340> add<00:03:11.610> in

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
do you do that very simple we now add in

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:20.570 
do you do that very simple we now add in
water<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:19.200> we<00:03:19.320> let<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.650> cook<00:03:19.920> till<00:03:20.100> about<00:03:20.190> 4

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
water so we let this cook till about 4

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.580 
water so we let this cook till about 4
to<00:03:20.730> 5<00:03:20.760> whistles<00:03:21.300> are<00:03:21.420> given<00:03:21.630> out<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.080> after

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
to 5 whistles are given out and after

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.020 
to 5 whistles are given out and after
that<00:03:22.739> we'll<00:03:22.980> wait<00:03:23.310> for<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.670> pressure<00:03:23.940> to

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
that we'll wait for the pressure to

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.020 
that we'll wait for the pressure to
settle<00:03:24.330> so<00:03:24.930> after<00:03:25.620> 5<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.190> 6<00:03:26.400> whistles<00:03:26.820> I

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
settle so after 5 to 6 whistles I

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.060 
settle so after 5 to 6 whistles I
switched<00:03:27.540> off<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.840> gas<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.320> now<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.530> have<00:03:28.830> let

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
switched off the gas and now I have let

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.039 
switched off the gas and now I have let
the<00:03:29.250> pressure<00:03:29.459> settle<00:03:29.880> down<00:03:30.030> let's<00:03:30.570> open<00:03:30.750> the

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
the pressure settle down let's open the

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.090 
the pressure settle down let's open the
pressure<00:03:31.230> cooker<00:03:33.560> what<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:34.680> can<00:03:34.860> see<00:03:35.070> right

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
pressure cooker what you can see right

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.360 
pressure cooker what you can see right
now<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.870> cooked<00:03:37.110> dal<00:03:37.350> along<00:03:37.830> with<00:03:38.010> all<00:03:38.220> the

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
just blend it once again you could also

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.610 
just blend it once again you could also
do<00:05:24.520> that<00:05:24.550> or<00:05:24.940> you<00:05:25.180> could<00:05:25.330> just<00:05:25.630> whisk<00:05:25.990> it<00:05:26.169> up<00:05:26.320> in

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
do that or you could just whisk it up in

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.650 
do that or you could just whisk it up in
case<00:05:26.950> you<00:05:27.100> feel<00:05:27.340> there's<00:05:27.580> any<00:05:27.820> particle<00:05:28.510> which

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
is not really ground very well so I

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:40.440
