00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
cloud clay is that you can actually

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.319 
cloud clay is that you can actually
attach<00:00:48.840> something<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.219> dry<00:00:50.670> to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
I can take a moldable piece or a piece

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.319 
I can take a moldable piece or a piece
of<00:00:58.590> cloud<00:00:58.770> clay<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.219> hasn't<00:00:59.609> dried<00:00:59.789> yet<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
of cloud clay that hasn't dried yet and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.630 
of cloud clay that hasn't dried yet and
by<00:01:00.870> using<00:01:01.230> water<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.949> my<00:01:02.100> glue<00:01:02.340> I've<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.609> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
by using water as my glue I've got a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.670 
by using water as my glue I've got a
little<00:01:03.000> jar<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> little<00:01:04.110> container<00:01:04.409> of

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
little jar or a little container of

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.800 
little jar or a little container of
water<00:01:04.710> here<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> put<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
water here I'm just going to put this to

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.070 
water here I'm just going to put this to
the<00:01:06.840> back<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.400> I'm<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.060> moisten<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the back so I'm going to moisten the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.289 
the back so I'm going to moisten the
back<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.710> already<00:01:11.100> dry<00:01:11.520> piece<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.090> cloud

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
back of this already dry piece of cloud

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.590 
back of this already dry piece of cloud
clay<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.909> I'll<00:01:14.909> just<00:01:15.060> add<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> little

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
clay here and I'll just add a little

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.090 
clay here and I'll just add a little
ball<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> back<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.189> will<00:01:20.310> stick<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
ball to the back and it will stick and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.010 
ball to the back and it will stick and
the<00:01:23.100> longer<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.610> stays<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.150> more<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.479> attaches

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the longer it stays the more it attaches

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.719 
the longer it stays the more it attaches
so<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> will<00:01:25.619> not<00:01:25.799> pull<00:01:26.130> off<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.610> what

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
so that it will not pull off and what

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.670 
so that it will not pull off and what
this<00:01:26.939> means<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.259> build<00:01:28.530> your

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
this means is that you can build your

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.310 
this means is that you can build your
projects<00:01:29.220> up<00:01:29.430> time<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.630> time<00:01:30.689> again<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.170> can

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
projects up time and time again you can

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.530 
projects up time and time again you can
do<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> little<00:01:31.860> now<00:01:32.100> set<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.880> off<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> side

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
do a little now set it off to the side

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.990 
do a little now set it off to the side
and<00:01:33.720> come<00:01:33.930> back<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.439> work<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.950> later<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and come back and work on it later you

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.219 
and come back and work on it later you
can<00:01:36.180> also<00:01:36.479> attach<00:01:36.990> dry<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.490> dry<00:01:39.180> again<00:01:39.600> by

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
can also attach dry to dry again by

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.300 
can also attach dry to dry again by
using<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.770> magic<00:01:41.009> glue<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.700> we<00:01:41.850> call<00:01:42.119> water

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
using the magic glue that we call water

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.590 
using the magic glue that we call water
when<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.490> finished<00:01:44.880> you'll<00:01:45.090> notice<00:01:45.450> that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
when it's finished you'll notice that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.960 
when it's finished you'll notice that
it's<00:01:45.810> very<00:01:46.020> very<00:01:46.320> flexible<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.610> at<00:01:47.790> this

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
it's very very flexible and it's at this

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.139 
it's very very flexible and it's at this
stage<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.930> either<00:01:49.439> use<00:01:49.970> markers<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
stage that you can either use markers to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.149 
stage that you can either use markers to
color<00:01:51.180> your<00:01:51.540> cloud<00:01:51.840> clay<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.470> use<00:01:52.799> paint

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
color your cloud clay you can use paint

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.730 
color your cloud clay you can use paint
like<00:01:53.549> I've<00:01:53.729> done<00:01:53.970> here<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.079> also<00:01:55.290> use

have inside here a paper mache egg that

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.060 
have inside here a paper mache egg that
I<00:02:54.000> formed<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.540> cloud<00:02:54.810> clay<00:02:55.110> base<00:02:55.350> over<00:02:55.860> and

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
I formed the cloud clay base over and

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.520 
I formed the cloud clay base over and
I've<00:02:56.850> attached<00:02:57.270> inside<00:02:57.630> here<00:02:58.050> some<00:02:58.290> bamboo

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
I've attached inside here some bamboo

his<00:03:01.500> legs<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.160> because<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.520> cloud<00:03:02.760> clay<00:03:03.000> is

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
his legs and because the cloud clay is

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.120 
his legs and because the cloud clay is
so<00:03:03.330> sticky<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:03.960> sticks<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.410> itself<00:03:04.710> so

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
so sticky and it sticks to itself so

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.750 
so sticky and it sticks to itself so
well<00:03:05.490> it<00:03:06.270> will<00:03:06.630> hold<00:03:06.930> those<00:03:07.320> nice<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:08.100> firm
