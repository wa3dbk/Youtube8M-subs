thinking while I was doing this makeup
but<00:04:26.020> this<00:04:26.440> actually<00:04:26.620> does<00:04:27.040> kind<00:04:27.310> of<00:04:27.340> look<00:04:27.490> like

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
but this actually does kind of look like

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.000 
but this actually does kind of look like
the<00:04:27.790> telephone<00:04:28.210> makeup<00:04:28.510> but<00:04:29.080> anyway<00:04:29.410> just

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:51.000 
just going to do some touch-ups and then
you<00:04:44.210> know<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.690> look<00:04:44.810> is<00:04:44.990> complete<00:04:49.810> so

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
you know the look is complete so

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.310 
you know the look is complete so
basically<00:04:52.010> this<00:04:52.580> is<00:04:52.850> what<00:04:52.970> I<00:04:53.390> would<00:04:53.510> do<00:04:53.810> pretty

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
basically this is what I would do pretty

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.560 
basically this is what I would do pretty
much<00:04:54.470> if<00:04:54.920> I<00:04:55.430> wanted<00:04:55.820> to<00:04:56.210> go<00:04:56.870> out<00:04:57.400> somewhere<00:04:58.570> if

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
much if I wanted to go out somewhere if

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.230 
much if I wanted to go out somewhere if
this<00:04:59.780> was<00:04:59.960> like<00:05:00.110> a<00:05:00.140> nighttime<00:05:00.700> event<00:05:01.700> or

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
this was like a nighttime event or

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.310 
this was like a nighttime event or
something<00:05:02.450> um<00:05:04.330> you<00:05:05.330> know<00:05:05.420> it's<00:05:05.600> realizing<00:05:06.020> I

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
something um you know it's realizing I

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.940 
something um you know it's realizing I
was<00:05:06.350> doing<00:05:06.770> this<00:05:06.890> um<00:05:08.140> it<00:05:09.140> kind<00:05:09.500> of<00:05:09.620> looks<00:05:09.830> like

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
was doing this um it kind of looks like

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.610 
was doing this um it kind of looks like
the<00:05:10.310> telephone<00:05:10.820> makeup<00:05:11.270> because<00:05:11.750> i<00:05:11.960> use<00:05:12.260> the

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
the telephone makeup because i use the

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.640 
the telephone makeup because i use the
UM<00:05:13.240> blue<00:05:14.240> eye<00:05:14.270> shadow<00:05:14.390> and<00:05:14.720> really<00:05:15.320> pink
