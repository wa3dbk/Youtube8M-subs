00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
and another thing is still I find a

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.560 
and another thing is still I find a
little<00:04:17.450> bit<00:04:17.660> disappointing<00:04:18.640> is<00:04:19.640> if<00:04:20.330> we<00:04:20.540> open

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
little bit disappointing is if we open

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.030 
little bit disappointing is if we open
up<00:04:20.900> a<00:04:20.930> couple<00:04:21.140> of<00:04:21.290> apps<00:04:21.500> here<00:04:23.350> and<00:04:24.350> go<00:04:24.890> into

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
up a couple of apps here and go into

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.410 
up a couple of apps here and go into
multitasking<00:04:26.320> it's<00:04:27.320> still<00:04:27.620> kind<00:04:27.980> of<00:04:28.040> slow<00:04:28.420> at

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
multitasking it's still kind of slow at

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.900 
multitasking it's still kind of slow at
least<00:04:29.570> when<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:29.840> go<00:04:29.990> back<00:04:30.200> in<00:04:31.040> scrolling<00:04:31.700> I

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
least when you go back in scrolling I

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.270 
least when you go back in scrolling I
really<00:04:32.240> wish<00:04:32.390> that<00:04:32.420> he<00:04:32.720> did<00:04:33.380> speed<00:04:33.890> that<00:04:34.070> up

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
really wish that he did speed that up

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.040 
really wish that he did speed that up
again<00:04:35.410> because<00:04:36.670> it<00:04:37.670> was<00:04:37.820> better<00:04:38.060> in<00:04:38.630> earlier

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
again because it was better in earlier

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:46.570 
again because it was better in earlier
versions<00:04:39.320> why<00:04:40.040> was<00:04:42.160> so<00:04:43.160> slow<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:46.280> looks<00:04:46.460> a

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
versions why was so slow and it looks a

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.290 
versions why was so slow and it looks a
little<00:04:46.700> bit<00:04:46.910> laggy<00:04:47.120> I<00:04:47.300> find<00:04:51.790> you<00:04:52.790> still<00:04:53.060> have
