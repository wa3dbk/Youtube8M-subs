00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Welcome to Modest Tastes Cuisine 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.240
 In this section; In many parts of Anatolia ... 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.920
 we have a traditional recipe 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.960
 "Taps" 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.640
 but first we learn the materials 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.880
 3 eggs 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.960
 2.5 cups of milk 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.200
 2 cups flour 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.360
 1 teaspoon of carbonate 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.080
 and 1 teaspoon of salt 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.680
 fry 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.920
 we are breaking our eggs first 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 We said we have three eggs. 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.960
 add some salt on 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.400
 and flutter 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.360
 That's enough to flap 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.560
 now we are adding cold milk 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.000
 We add flour by adding little by little 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.480
 and carbonate 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.760
 we prepared our dough as a full measure again 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.920
 measure "boza" 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.280
 Let's wait for 5-10 minutes, go to the stove 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.440
 we put the teflon pan into the fire 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.800
 pouring 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.040
 and immediately spread to the pan ... 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.640
 open-backed 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.960
 and in the middle heat we turn the other face on one side red 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.800
 we understand from a bubble 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.800
 we are now turning the other side 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.720
 in the same way after frying 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.480
 Let's see if the other side is red. 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.240
 fried can now transfer to the plate 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:48.120
 in the same way we'll continue to run until the dough is finished 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.000
 now let us pour our last stream 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.160
 up to 10 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.840
 quick movements 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.120
 Let's see, is the back of our last stream cooked? 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.680
 it better be cooked a little more 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.040
 let's put it on the others 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.120
 what we desire; cheese, jam, roasting 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.920
 we can make a very nice way 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.080
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.840
 we shared a beautiful recipe applied in Anatolia for hundreds of years 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.040
 "Taps" 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.280
 I know you will try as soon as possible and you will remember us 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.640
