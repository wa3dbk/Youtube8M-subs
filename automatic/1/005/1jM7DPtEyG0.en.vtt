okay<00:00:04.250> here<00:00:04.819> we<00:00:04.850> are<00:00:05.090> I<00:00:05.750> made<00:00:06.740> some<00:00:06.769> changes<00:00:07.399> in

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
okay here we are I made some changes in

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.839 
okay here we are I made some changes in
this<00:00:08.480> guitar<00:00:11.350> the<00:00:12.350> prototype<00:00:12.940> Black<00:00:13.940> Label<00:00:14.510> I

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
this guitar the prototype Black Label I

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:25.230 
this guitar the prototype Black Label I
wrote<00:00:16.849> it<00:00:17.650> the<00:00:18.650> neck<00:00:19.070> pocket<00:00:19.990> about<00:00:24.010> 0.5

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
wrote it the neck pocket about 0.5

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.880 
wrote it the neck pocket about 0.5
millimeters<00:00:27.340> to<00:00:28.340> get<00:00:28.550> it<00:00:28.850> a<00:00:29.590> little<00:00:30.590> bit

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
millimeters to get it a little bit

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.200 
millimeters to get it a little bit
further<00:00:31.310> down<00:00:32.620> and<00:00:35.920> it<00:00:36.920> will<00:00:37.190> be<00:00:37.340> more<00:00:37.579> easy<00:00:37.880> to

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
further down and it will be more easy to

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.100 
further down and it will be more easy to
do<00:00:38.420> some<00:00:39.140> adjustments<00:00:40.130> on<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.809> bridge<00:00:41.809> here

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
do some adjustments on the bridge here

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:50.830 
do some adjustments on the bridge here
and<00:00:43.870> I<00:00:45.550> think<00:00:46.550> it<00:00:47.590> turned<00:00:48.590> out<00:00:48.800> well<00:00:49.660> very<00:00:50.660> very

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
and I think it turned out well very very

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.430 
and I think it turned out well very very
good<00:00:50.960> I<00:00:51.410> think<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:55.600> this<00:00:56.600> prototype<00:00:57.020> is

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
good I think and this prototype is

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.590 
good I think and this prototype is
pretty<00:00:58.219> much<00:00:58.399> done<00:00:59.120> now<00:00:59.180> I<00:00:59.719> also<00:01:04.479> where<00:01:05.479> you

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
pretty much done now I also where you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.580 
pretty much done now I also where you
can<00:01:05.719> see<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:05.990> battery<00:01:06.829> box<00:01:07.539> for<00:01:08.539> the<00:01:09.939> 9-volt

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
can see the battery box for the 9-volt

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.359 
can see the battery box for the 9-volt
battery<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.889> the<00:01:12.920> EMG<00:01:13.520> pick<00:01:13.969> up<00:01:15.009> it's<00:01:16.009> quite

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
battery to the EMG pick up it's quite

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:24.969 
battery to the EMG pick up it's quite
simple<00:01:16.429> to<00:01:17.349> open<00:01:18.349> this<00:01:18.499> up<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:21.700> simply<00:01:23.979> do

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
simple to open this up and simply do

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:34.539 
simple to open this up and simply do
like<00:01:25.219> that<00:01:26.409> Mary<00:01:27.409> have<00:01:27.679> the<00:01:27.829> battery<00:01:30.549> so<00:01:33.549> it's

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
like that Mary have the battery so it's

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.659 
like that Mary have the battery so it's
much<00:01:34.759> more<00:01:34.789> reasonable<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:37.299> change<00:01:38.299> battery

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:39.669 
much more reasonable to change battery

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:49.030 
much more reasonable to change battery
if<00:01:40.669> needed

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.090 

so<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:52.700> think<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.710> I'm<00:01:55.710> satisfied

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
so I think this is I'm satisfied

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.920 
so I think this is I'm satisfied
satisfied<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:57.330> it<00:01:57.510> is<00:01:57.780> right<00:01:58.140> now<00:01:58.200> i<00:01:59.780> will<00:02:00.780> not

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
satisfied as it is right now i will not

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.430 
satisfied as it is right now i will not
do<00:02:01.200> any<00:02:01.410> more<00:02:01.500> changes<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:07.200> rest

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
do any more changes on it and the rest

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.300 
do any more changes on it and the rest
of<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.800> guitars<00:02:08.210> that<00:02:09.210> will<00:02:09.570> be<00:02:10.310> purchased

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
of the guitars that will be purchased

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.760 
of the guitars that will be purchased
will<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:12.240> exactly<00:02:12.900> like<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.680> one<00:02:15.470> with<00:02:16.470> the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
will be exactly like this one with the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:28.280 
will be exactly like this one with the
battery<00:02:17.520> box<00:02:17.670> there<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.810> back<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:27.290> guess

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
battery box there on the back I guess

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.400 
battery box there on the back I guess
the<00:02:28.980> only<00:02:29.130> difference<00:02:29.870> between<00:02:30.870> this

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
the only difference between this

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:39.850 
the only difference between this
prototype<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:35.120> actual<00:02:37.070> guitar<00:02:38.070> that<00:02:38.910> you

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
prototype and the actual guitar that you

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.559 
prototype and the actual guitar that you
buy<00:02:41.810> is

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
buy is

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:52.209 
buy is
a<00:02:47.769> serial<00:02:48.769> number<00:02:49.189> over<00:02:49.370> there<00:02:50.349> this<00:02:51.349> is<00:02:51.650> the

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:52.219 
a serial number over there this is the

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:59.709 
a serial number over there this is the
first<00:02:52.579> built<00:02:54.489> and<00:02:57.760> then<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.939> will<00:02:59.090> be<00:02:59.329> number

00:02:59.709 --> 00:02:59.719 
first built and then it will be number

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.729 
first built and then it will be number
two<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.319> so<00:03:00.739> on<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.129> on<00:03:02.349> that's<00:03:03.349> down<00:03:03.560> the

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
two and so on and so on that's down the

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:11.140 
two and so on and so on that's down the
difference<00:03:04.099> I<00:03:06.250> believe<00:03:09.549> you<00:03:10.549> can<00:03:10.669> see<00:03:10.909> the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
difference I believe you can see the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:20.229 
difference I believe you can see the
neck<00:03:11.359> pocket<00:03:11.629> there<00:03:15.819> very<00:03:16.819> very<00:03:17.120> good<00:03:18.969> this<00:03:19.969> is

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
neck pocket there very very good this is

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.659 
neck pocket there very very good this is
how<00:03:20.629> it<00:03:20.870> will<00:03:21.079> be<00:03:21.260> on<00:03:21.469> all<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.889> other<00:03:22.069> guitars

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
how it will be on all the other guitars

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:29.649 
how it will be on all the other guitars
to<00:03:24.189> for<00:03:25.189> more<00:03:25.549> easy<00:03:26.530> adjustments<00:03:28.329> on<00:03:29.329> the

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
to for more easy adjustments on the

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:46.390 
to for more easy adjustments on the
bridge<00:03:42.519> yeah<00:03:43.519> this<00:03:44.090> is<00:03:44.299> kind<00:03:44.810> of<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:45.400> little

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
bridge yeah this is kind of a little

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.669 
bridge yeah this is kind of a little
update<00:03:47.650> see<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:48.769> later<00:03:48.949> bye
