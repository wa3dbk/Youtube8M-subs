quiet and subtle things and that stuff
that<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.940> was<00:01:03.090> learning<00:01:03.210> from<00:01:03.360> Nick<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:04.049> how<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
that I was learning from Nick is how to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.010 
that I was learning from Nick is how to
like<00:01:04.530> pull<00:01:04.799> back<00:01:05.040> sometimes<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
like pull back sometimes and it's like a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.429 
like pull back sometimes and it's like a
pacing<00:01:07.350> thing<00:01:07.799> if<00:01:08.399> panel<00:01:08.939> 2<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:12.109> very<00:01:13.109> similar

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
pacing thing if panel 2 is very similar

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.120 
pacing thing if panel 2 is very similar
to<00:01:13.619> panel<00:01:14.429> 1<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.530> probably<00:01:16.799> should<00:01:17.100> be

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
to panel 1 you you probably should be

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.429 
to panel 1 you you probably should be
doing<00:01:17.219> animation<00:01:17.929> because<00:01:18.929> you're<00:01:19.079> trying<00:01:19.289> to

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
doing animation because you're trying to

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.050 
doing animation because you're trying to
express<00:01:19.799> movement<00:01:20.399> what<00:01:20.700> should<00:01:20.939> be

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
express movement what should be

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.969 
express movement what should be
happening<00:01:21.179> between<00:01:21.539> panel<00:01:21.990> 1<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.439> panel<00:01:22.740> 2

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
happening between panel 1 and panel 2

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.469 
happening between panel 1 and panel 2
there<00:01:23.490> should<00:01:23.639> be<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> significant<00:01:24.329> enough

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
there should be a significant enough

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.109 
there should be a significant enough
change<00:01:24.869> between<00:01:25.259> those<00:01:25.409> two<00:01:25.590> panels<00:01:26.039> so<00:01:26.819> that

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
change between those two panels so that

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.109 
change between those two panels so that
the<00:01:27.990> gutter<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.770> white<00:01:29.100> space<00:01:29.459> between<00:01:30.060> each

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the gutter that white space between each

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.859 
the gutter that white space between each
panel<00:01:30.779> is<00:01:31.139> filled<00:01:31.649> up<00:01:31.889> by<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.189> reader's<00:01:32.579> mind

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
panel is filled up by the reader's mind

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.080 
panel is filled up by the reader's mind
to<00:01:33.869> know<00:01:34.049> Nick<00:01:34.109> you<00:01:34.469> know<00:01:34.649> that<00:01:34.920> he<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.850> very
