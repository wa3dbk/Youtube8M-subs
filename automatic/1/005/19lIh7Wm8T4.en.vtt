 Touch iPod shuffle is more forbidden than interviewing. 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.470
 It should be light in weight 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.740
 I was so thin there myself 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.840
 The design was very good. 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.560
 Is not it an assignment? 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.810
 A reporter for pressure 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.810
 end 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.650
 It can be originally a pool. Because I do not have a real 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.420
 I think it's only a function. 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.670
 By trimming the autonomy to the capacity of the fire bytes, 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.810
 Inevitably, 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.159
 There is nothing special about it. 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.120

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.670
 Muscular life 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.650
 The music of the function is forced to grow like that 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.620
 Lee Byeong-rye is proud of his time to die, 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.620
 It's lightweight, and that's why I use it. 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.800
 So.. 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.880
 ... the adaptation to the song also has to be cute and open long open 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.340
 This fund is all i invested in the pkk button 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.120

 jce 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.390
 15 00 by 13 tracks 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.200
 And if there is no market confidence in the solution, 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 80,000 for raising roots. 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.600
 it started. 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.960
 There's a way. 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.439
 It also affects the guess that it was difficult to grow 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.510
 If you take the opportunity, 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.060

 At the house of Mrs. Jeon, within a distance of 50 km per hour, 001120 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.760

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.910

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.209
 I decided not to. 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:36.969
 @ * 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.969
 So, we take over and announce

 InnoMetal also has a battery training in Korea 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.209
