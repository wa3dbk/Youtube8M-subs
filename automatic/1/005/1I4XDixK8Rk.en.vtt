I have real hands-free conversation of

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.800 
I have real hands-free conversation of
crystal<00:01:24.460> clear<00:01:24.580> phone<00:01:24.940> that<00:01:25.360> goes<00:01:25.510> on<00:01:25.690> the

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
crystal clear phone that goes on the

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.280 
crystal clear phone that goes on the
vehicle<00:01:26.200> speakers<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:28.060> manages<00:01:28.600> the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
vehicle speakers it manages the

automatic<00:01:29.830> connection<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:31.600> have<00:01:31.780> also<00:01:32.170> five

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
automatic connection we have also five

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.930 
automatic connection we have also five
protocols<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:34.630> synchronize<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.290> phone<00:01:35.500> book

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
protocols to synchronize the phone book

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.210 
protocols to synchronize the phone book
so<00:01:36.940> once<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.330> have<00:01:37.450> paired<00:01:37.780> your<00:01:38.500> phone<00:01:38.770> with

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
so once you have paired your phone with

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.770 
so once you have paired your phone with
a<00:01:39.250> system<00:01:39.729> all<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.900> contacts<00:01:41.440> are<00:01:41.680> directly

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
a system all the contacts are directly

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.950 
a system all the contacts are directly
copied

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
copied

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.289 
copied
to<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.290> memory<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.130> asteroid<00:01:45.940> smart

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
to the memory of the asteroid smart

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.810 
to the memory of the asteroid smart
which<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.200> very<00:01:47.409> nice<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.860> parrot<00:01:48.549> is<00:01:48.700> they

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
which is very nice and parrot is they

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.870 
which is very nice and parrot is they
only<00:01:48.940> want<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.299> propose<00:01:50.080> five<00:01:50.650> protocols<00:01:51.340> to

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
only want to propose five protocols to

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.649 
only want to propose five protocols to
do<00:01:52.000> this<00:01:52.770> plus<00:01:53.770> we<00:01:54.430> have<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.760> advanced<00:01:55.540> voice

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
do this plus we have the advanced voice

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.740 
do this plus we have the advanced voice
recognition<00:01:56.640> training<00:01:57.640> free<00:01:57.850> meaning<00:01:58.420> that

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
recognition training free meaning that

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.980 
recognition training free meaning that
everybody<00:01:59.409> can<00:01:59.740> say<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.700> name<00:02:00.880> or<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.509> person

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.620 
everybody can say the name or a person
and<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.619> system<00:02:03.009> will<00:02:03.310> recognize<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.420> voice

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
and the system will recognize the voice

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.139 
and the system will recognize the voice
and<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.140> name<00:02:05.290> so<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.130> make<00:02:06.490> you<00:02:06.640> ought<00:02:07.090> to

audio files directly to the device so

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.700 
audio files directly to the device so
it's<00:03:16.870> very<00:03:17.049> complete

it's very complete
it's<00:03:17.830> odd<00:03:18.150> for<00:03:19.150> digital<00:03:19.720> music<00:03:20.730> as<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.760> can

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
it's odd for digital music as you can

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.010 
it's odd for digital music as you can
see<00:03:22.300> you<00:03:22.810> can<00:03:23.020> browse<00:03:23.470> each<00:03:24.420> one<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.690> launch

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
see you can browse each one and launch

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:35.600 
see you can browse each one and launch
the<00:03:27.660> music<00:03:28.660> very<00:03:28.840> easily

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:43.270 

which<00:03:36.240> I<00:03:36.360> answer<00:03:39.560> about<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.950> we<00:03:41.250> have<00:03:41.400> also

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
which I answer about this we have also

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.130 
which I answer about this we have also
applications<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:45.090> this<00:03:45.270> is<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.570> big<00:03:45.750> heat

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
applications and this is the big heat

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.920 
applications and this is the big heat
but<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.160> system<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.820> para<00:03:48.060> tester<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:48.600> smart

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
but this system the para tester it smart

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.010 
but this system the para tester it smart
meaning<00:03:49.920> that's<00:03:51.380> with<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.560> smart<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:53.760> can

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
meaning that's with this smart you can

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.100 
meaning that's with this smart you can
benefit<00:03:55.020> from<00:03:55.850> navigation<00:03:56.850> application<00:03:57.780> but

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
benefit from navigation application but

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.830 
benefit from navigation application but
not<00:03:58.320> only<00:03:58.620> they<00:03:59.100> are<00:03:59.130> also<00:03:59.720> voyage<00:04:00.720> of

applications<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.910> good<00:04:48.060> thing<00:04:48.270> with

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
applications and the good thing with

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.620 
applications and the good thing with
Esther<00:04:49.050> it<00:04:49.200> smart<00:04:49.980> is<00:04:50.550> you<00:04:51.150> can<00:04:51.390> download

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
Esther it smart is you can download

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.280 
Esther it smart is you can download
directly<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.740> application<00:04:53.220> on<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.580> device

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
directly the application on the device

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.070 
directly the application on the device
so<00:04:55.290> it's<00:04:55.470> really<00:04:55.940> useful<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.090> not<00:04:57.870> time

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
so it's really useful and not time

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.260 
so it's really useful and not time
consuming<00:04:58.260> so<00:04:59.360> it's<00:05:00.360> really<00:05:00.780> good<00:05:02.000> about<00:05:03.000> that

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
consuming so it's really good about that

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
consuming so it's really good about that
we<00:05:03.510> have<00:05:03.660> the<00:05:03.900> voice<00:05:04.640> command<00:05:05.640> it<00:05:06.420> works<00:05:06.750> not

but<00:05:20.649> also<00:05:20.889> on<00:05:21.189> smart<00:05:21.550> radius<00:05:21.610> and<00:05:22.269> red<00:05:22.749> radios

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:23.369 
but also on smart radius and red radios

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:26.699 
but also on smart radius and red radios
so<00:05:24.369> it's<00:05:24.519> very<00:05:24.699> complete<00:05:25.259> in<00:05:26.259> terms<00:05:26.559> of
