00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 The Boeing 747. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 I opened the door for long-term trips. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Millions of passengers are transported annually 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 In addition to millions of tons of freight 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 It is considered the most successful aircraft of any size. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 But with fuel prices rising steadily 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 The question is: Can Boeing make the "Queen of the Sky" better? 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Can the Boeing 747 become a typical example of fuel efficiency? 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 The 8-747 is a brand-new aircraft [David Loving, Boeing 7-747 designer and designer] 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 But was built on the bases and rules of building the famous Boeing 747 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 To build a new 747, Boeing took the world's best and largest airframe 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 And added to it the advanced technology used in Dreamliner Dream Flight 787 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 As well as super engines in the 787 aircraft 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Boeing engineers designed very sophisticated suites 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 With curved curves and the edges of slanted wings. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 At a stage of design, 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 We reached a point where we were very concerned about our inability to form the outer cover of the suite 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 To the shapes required in our usual construction processes. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 That is why we have assembled a team that has devised a new technique to form the outer covers of the wings 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 For a Boeing 7-747, the operation was extremely successful. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 With its new and sophisticated wings and engines 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 And a host of other improvements, 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 The 8747 offers the lowest operating costs and high fuel efficiency 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Compared to any other passenger or cargo plane in its class. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 In fact, the 8-747 offers tremendous improvements in fuel consumption 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Compared to the previous model. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 The Boeing 747-8 represents many of the company's major achievements. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 It is the largest commercial aircraft we have produced, 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 The fastest commercial aircraft in the world, 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 And one of the most powerful new aircraft on the market. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 At the same time, we wanted to create a very quiet airplane structure 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 And able to land and take off at the same airports landing and take off from the Boeing 747-400 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 In rebuilding a Boeing 747 for a new era, 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Company engineers have shown that innovation sometimes means finding a way 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 To make the best the best. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 When changing the wing of a plane, 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 You're already building a whole new airplane 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 The result is the next generation of aircraft 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Which sets a new standard for large aircraft that are fuel efficient and reduce noise. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
