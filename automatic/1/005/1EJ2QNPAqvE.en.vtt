00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.889
 this is the epson ecotank newest inkjet 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.210
 Epson printer 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.920
 a special thing about this printer is that 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.049
 that comes with a lot of inc 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.360
 namely enough for 4000 pages 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.360
 black and 6500 lessons in color 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.990
 the ecotank works and not with normal ones 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.850
 ink cartridges woman with ink tanks that 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.440
 on the side of the printer 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.560
 which you can fill after filling out with ink 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.560
 bottles 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.100
 the ecotank comes with 4 separate ones 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.230
 bottles of ink and you have to own the ink tank 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.850
 fill with that in that goes free 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.290
 simple but we had some mess 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.300
 with the blue ink bottle because it was leaking 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.740
 a little followed you need twenty 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.810
 wait for minutes because then the 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:52.660
 tubes filled with which the oath from the 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:54.190
 a tank after the printheads goes according to 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.690
 you can use epson with the supplied ink 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.100
 more than two years of printing 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.260
 if only she would do two years with 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.300
 all that included ink would be more than 14 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.770
 have to make prints per day with 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.780
 surveys we have done before 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.909
 actually it appears that consumers have around 30 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.710
 print pages per month and in that 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.030
 pace can last around thirty years 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.030
 shrink with the eco tank 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.520
 the eco tank is therefore primarily focused on 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.799
 people who print a lot 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.330
 according to epson especially families and small ones 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.900
 Businesses for them is therefore one 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.900
 cheap solution 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.810
 we compared the costs that you incur with 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.700
 the eco tank with the costs it would incur 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.170
 if you would be the best buy inkjet printer 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.299
 and that is one at the moment 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.490
 brother that costs 105 euros 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.369
 and if you do 4000 pages in black 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.430
 and 6500 would give a color you would 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.110
 have lost a total of eleven 175 euros 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.700
 that's a lot more than the three hundred 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.700
 euro that costs the cheapest eco tank 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.360
 according to epson the eco tank is primarily 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.560
 suitable for everyday use 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.689
 that is, printing greetings 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.610
 ticket recipes and for example I like it 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.049
 not for photos that you would put on the wall 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.040
 if we want to hang out there we can 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.479
 find it 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.490
 because the print there are good enough and 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.750
 readable sheets of letters 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.259
 all a bit tighter and what 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.640
 sharper 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:11.829
 the Ecotank there is a two versions 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.419

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:16.599
 also scan and copy and they are 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:18.939
 both equipped with WiFi the L555 has 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.430
 a few extras automatic 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.340
 document input a small screen and 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.709
 a fax 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.660
 the eco tank is a handy and inexpensive 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.310
 solution for those who print a lot 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.750
 so very nice that you do not often the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.370
 cardridges need replacing but that 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.700
 you can go a long way with the ink that 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.700
 is included 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.830
 the print quality is good enough for that 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.660
 everyday use and the prints are 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.010
 many times cheaper than those of others 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.150
 inkjet printers 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.220
