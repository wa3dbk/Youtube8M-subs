00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.430
 Hello everyone, let's go with you today 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:13.410
 consider at least catchy 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:17.520
 snap which is called symmetric 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.340
 the loop fits it in the same way yes 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:27.140
 almost as well as unbalanced 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:31.800
 loop that is, we take somewhere meter half 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:38.940
 fishing line you can use fishing line 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:43.559
 approximately from 0 22 to but 0 3 that is, we take 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:52.079
 meter and a half cutting add up twice 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:59.729
 postponed twice well and start here here 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:01.799
 knit loop under the leash I show 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.049
 once because the rope is thick so 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.979
 need double or triple surgical 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:12.409
 knot of course here with the match everyone did 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:16.799
 loop under the leash then retreat 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:20.479
 Museum something centimeters 10 in fact 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:25.469
 I'm not going to knit a pigtail now 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:27.450
 who wants more stiffness 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.460
 here on this segment that can save 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.090
 pigtail pigtail version is very simple 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.509
 given just like that all tied up and 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.990
 fixed here so I will not now 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.020
 come back pigtail show you doing so 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.950
 10 centimeters knit double 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.950
 surgical unit 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.300
 all node is naturally double here 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.920
 surgically or triple all wetted 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:04.670
 so 10 centimeters we have here 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:08.190
 retreat 30 centimeters knit again 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:13.620
 so in one second here put on 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:17.700
 swivel with this with a clasp on which 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:23.760
 we will keep the feeder all put on 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:28.370
 here swivel clasp knit knot again 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.370
 double or triple surgical 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:42.709
 tied so you know the eyelet under the leash 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.920
 retreated 10 centimeters here 30 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:49.489
 centimeters here this tip we trim 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:03:00.430
 here here here about retreat 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:03:02.719
 15 centimeters and knit a loop under 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.230
 here be a recession dream 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:07.849
 the main line is what we get 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.419
 that's what we cut to like 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:14.449
 comes and here we are pruning 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:17.659
 that is, everything remains the same tip is not 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:21.639
 double as here everywhere we have 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.639

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:30.169
 look here means a loop under 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:35.049
 the leash retreated 10 centimeters yet 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:38.780
 we knit one knot here 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.769
 a swivel with a buckle here 30 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.500
 centimeters about all this is approximate 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:50.409

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:12.069
 rigging is also sensitive 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:22.610
 also common with anglers here 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.610
