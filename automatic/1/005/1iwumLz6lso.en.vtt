Jurassic Park period it's some of the
first<00:00:51.989> tests<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.219> tail<00:00:53.820> moving<00:00:54.149> with<00:00:54.629> the

first tests of the tail moving with the

first tests of the tail moving with the
skin<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:57.829> when<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:59.010> were<00:00:59.269> developing<00:01:00.269> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
skin on it when we were developing the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.080 
skin on it when we were developing the
core<00:01:01.559> technology<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:03.030> know

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
core technology on this you know

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.340 
core technology on this you know
everyone<00:01:03.539> who<00:01:03.629> has<00:01:03.780> traditionally<00:01:04.320> been

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
everyone who has traditionally been

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.160 
everyone who has traditionally been
using<00:01:04.710> rings<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.519> try<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.910> create<00:01:06.090> cores<00:01:07.020> that

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
using rings to try and create cores that

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.109 
using rings to try and create cores that
moved<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.890> sequentially<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.759> we<00:01:08.880> realize

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
moved and sequentially and we realize

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.870 
moved and sequentially and we realize
that<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.479> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.690> be<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:09.899> hard<00:01:10.110> to

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
that it's going to be really hard to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.950 
that it's going to be really hard to
organize<00:01:11.880> all<00:01:12.119> those<00:01:12.300> and<00:01:12.570> make<00:01:12.690> them<00:01:12.810> all

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
organize all those and make them all

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.450 
organize all those and make them all
work<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.530> while<00:01:13.649> I<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:13.860> working<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
work and while I was on working on the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.690 
work and while I was on working on the
Raptor<00:01:15.350> I<00:01:16.350> came<00:01:16.800> up<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.160> idea<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.490> just

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
Raptor I came up with this idea of just

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700 
Raptor I came up with this idea of just
cutting<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.210> continuous<00:01:18.750> spiral<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
cutting in a continuous spiral so that

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.160 
cutting in a continuous spiral so that
it<00:01:19.830> could<00:01:20.100> span<00:01:20.399> expand<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.240> contract<00:01:21.330> but

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
it could span expand and contract but

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.080 
it could span expand and contract but
never<00:01:22.470> lose<00:01:22.799> its<00:01:23.070> shape<00:01:23.310> wouldn't<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:23.909> fall

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
never lose its shape wouldn't just fall

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.149 
never lose its shape wouldn't just fall
apart<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.630> 40<00:01:25.409> different<00:01:25.530> rings<00:01:25.829> on<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.070> they

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
apart with 40 different rings on it they

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.520 
apart with 40 different rings on it they
would<00:01:26.280> all<00:01:26.400> stay<00:01:26.700> integrated<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> itself<00:01:27.689> so

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
would all stay integrated to itself so

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.929 
would all stay integrated to itself so
that's<00:01:28.619> actually<00:01:29.040> me<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.310> they're<00:01:29.460> trying<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
that's actually me if they're trying to

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.810 
that's actually me if they're trying to
pull<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.240> skin<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> tail<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.579> neck

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
pull the skin on so the tail on the neck

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.749 
pull the skin on so the tail on the neck
for<00:01:33.060> both<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.390> Raptors<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.290> t-rex<00:01:34.890> we're

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
for both the Raptors and the t-rex we're

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.120 
for both the Raptors and the t-rex we're
done<00:01:35.970> as<00:01:36.149> a<00:01:36.180> spiral<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.049> then<00:01:37.140> reinforced<00:01:37.799> so

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
done as a spiral and then reinforced so

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.649 
done as a spiral and then reinforced so
that<00:01:38.310> they<00:01:38.399> didn't<00:01:38.670> become<00:01:38.939> too<00:01:39.149> weak<00:01:39.360> but

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
that they didn't become too weak but

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.880 
that they didn't become too weak but
that<00:01:40.530> way<00:01:40.649> we<00:01:40.829> could<00:01:41.009> keep<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.759> shape<00:01:42.229> in<00:01:43.229> it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that way we could keep the shape in it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.889 
that way we could keep the shape in it
in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.490> look<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.060> everything<00:01:45.210> very

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
in the look of everything very

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.069 
in the look of everything very
continuously<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:48.299> trick<00:01:48.509> with<00:01:48.630> these<00:01:48.750> skins

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
continuously the trick with these skins

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.770 
continuously the trick with these skins
is<00:01:49.469> that<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.979> cone<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> perfect<00:01:51.540> cone

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
is that it's a cone it is a perfect cone

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.630 
is that it's a cone it is a perfect cone
and<00:01:52.049> every<00:01:52.619> time<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.920> moved<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.490> kept

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
and every time you moved it it just kept

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.350 
and every time you moved it it just kept
him<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.030> slide<00:01:54.299> off<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.509> get<00:01:56.270> looser<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
him on the slide off and get looser and

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.569 
him on the slide off and get looser and
looser<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.469> we<00:01:58.590> had<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.740> pull<00:01:59.340> them<00:01:59.460> up

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
looser on it so we had to pull them up

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.190 
looser on it so we had to pull them up
and<00:01:59.729> then<00:01:59.880> sew<00:02:00.180> them<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.539> stitch<00:02:00.780> them<00:02:00.810> and

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and then sew them and stitch them and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.319 
and then sew them and stitch them and
glue<00:02:01.289> them<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> hips<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
glue them to the hips and to the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.550 
glue them to the hips and to the
shoulders<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.049> they<00:02:04.140> didn't<00:02:04.350> want<00:02:04.469> to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
shoulders so that they didn't want to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.180 
shoulders so that they didn't want to
work<00:02:04.680> themselves<00:02:04.890> off<00:02:07.640> part<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:10.190> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
work themselves off part the the the the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.400 
work themselves off part the the the the
issues<00:02:11.489> with<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:11.880> well<00:02:12.120> was<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.660> with<00:02:13.290> all

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
issues with it as well was that with all

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.170 
issues with it as well was that with all
the<00:02:13.590> cylinders<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.519> hydraulics<00:02:15.030> in

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
the cylinders and the hydraulics in

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.319 
the cylinders and the hydraulics in
there<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:16.340> trying<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.400> make<00:02:17.579> sure<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.150> as

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
there that trying to make sure that as

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.440 
there that trying to make sure that as
we<00:02:18.390> were<00:02:19.049> moving<00:02:19.230> things<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:20.010> we<00:02:20.100> weren't

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
we were moving things that we weren't

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.380 
we were moving things that we weren't
that<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> core<00:02:21.840> wasn't<00:02:22.430> stripping<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.820> eat

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
that the core wasn't stripping the eat

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.150 
that the core wasn't stripping the eat
any<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.310> hydraulic<00:02:26.310> tubes<00:02:26.580> or

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
any of the hydraulic tubes or

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.460 
any of the hydraulic tubes or
potentiometers<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.400> was<00:02:29.550> then<00:02:30.170> cause<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.200> to

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
potentiometers that was then cause it to

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.180 
potentiometers that was then cause it to
freak<00:02:31.740> out<00:02:32.750> yeah<00:02:33.750> who<00:02:34.260> Tony<00:02:34.500> made<00:02:34.770> everything

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
freak out yeah who Tony made everything

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.050 
freak out yeah who Tony made everything
out<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.730> vacuum<00:02:36.720> bag<00:02:36.930> carbon<00:02:37.440> fiber<00:02:38.060> and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
out of the vacuum bag carbon fiber and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.370 
out of the vacuum bag carbon fiber and
we<00:02:39.180> didn't<00:02:39.330> have<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.540> advantage<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:40.020> complete

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
we didn't have the advantage of complete

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.740 
we didn't have the advantage of complete
3d<00:02:40.770> modeling<00:02:41.190> back<00:02:41.340> then<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:42.030> lot<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.600> this

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
3d modeling back then so a lot of this

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.480 
3d modeling back then so a lot of this
was<00:02:42.960> done<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.350> guesswork<00:02:43.740> as<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.160> what<00:02:44.340> would

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
was done is guesswork as to what would

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.520 
was done is guesswork as to what would
fit<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.480> what<00:02:45.630> looked<00:02:45.810> good<00:02:45.960> from<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.290> front

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
fit so what looked good from the front

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.410 
fit so what looked good from the front
and<00:02:46.740> from<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.070> side<00:02:47.280> suddenly<00:02:47.910> didn't<00:02:48.240> fit

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
and from the side suddenly didn't fit

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.930 
and from the side suddenly didn't fit
from<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.630> top<00:02:48.960> so<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.710> we<00:02:50.010> had<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.310> make

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
from the top so that we had to make

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.140 
from the top so that we had to make
adjustments<00:02:51.060> every<00:02:51.690> step<00:02:51.990> of<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.200> way<00:02:53.150> here's

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
adjustments every step of the way here's

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.200 
adjustments every step of the way here's
the<00:02:54.330> crew<00:02:54.510> pulling<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.080> skin<00:02:55.200> over<00:02:55.500> the

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
the crew pulling on the skin over the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.340 
the crew pulling on the skin over the
the<00:02:57.210> neck<00:02:59.150> you<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.270> see<00:03:00.450> saw<00:03:00.870> back<00:03:01.050> there<00:03:01.260> on

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
the neck you can see saw back there on

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.520 
the neck you can see saw back there on
the<00:03:01.380> tail<00:03:01.710> and<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.400> happened<00:03:02.880> on<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.090> on<00:03:03.300> the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
the tail and it happened on the on the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.150 
the tail and it happened on the on the
on<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:05.070> neck<00:03:05.310> area<00:03:05.550> too<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.450> what<00:03:07.380> firm

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
on the neck area too is that what firm

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.510 
on the neck area too is that what firm
actually<00:03:08.520> shrinks<00:03:08.910> quite<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> lot<00:03:09.450> when<00:03:09.720> you're

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
actually shrinks quite a lot when you're

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.670 
actually shrinks quite a lot when you're
yeah<00:03:11.520> that<00:03:11.820> much<00:03:12.090> foam<00:03:12.480> but<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.260> generally

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
yeah that much foam but it generally

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.120 
yeah that much foam but it generally
it's<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.340> shrinks<00:03:14.790> anyway<00:03:15.120> but<00:03:15.420> on<00:03:15.870> this<00:03:16.800> it's

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
it's it shrinks anyway but on this it's

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.310 
it's it shrinks anyway but on this it's
ranked<00:03:17.460> and<00:03:17.550> quite<00:03:18.300> considerably<00:03:18.780> we'd<00:03:18.990> have

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
ranked and quite considerably we'd have

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.630 
ranked and quite considerably we'd have
to<00:03:19.440> put<00:03:19.590> in<00:03:19.710> like<00:03:19.890> two<00:03:20.130> or<00:03:20.250> three<00:03:20.280> foot

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
to put in like two or three foot

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.460 
to put in like two or three foot
sections<00:03:20.850> of<00:03:21.830> skin<00:03:23.270> back<00:03:24.270> into<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:25.350> the

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
sections of skin back into the to the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.330 
sections of skin back into the to the
basically<00:03:26.400> sculpting<00:03:27.090> areas<00:03:27.510> with<00:03:28.340> these

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
basically sculpting areas with these

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.540 
basically sculpting areas with these
patches<00:03:33.140> tremendously<00:03:34.140> heavy<00:03:34.470> these<00:03:35.280> skins

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
patches tremendously heavy these skins

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.000 
patches tremendously heavy these skins
were<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.870> know<00:03:36.959> two<00:03:37.020> inches<00:03:37.500> thick<00:03:37.739> in<00:03:37.950> a

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
were and you know two inches thick in a

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.800 
were and you know two inches thick in a
lot<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:38.280> places<00:03:38.489> because<00:03:39.060> we<00:03:39.360> haven't<00:03:39.540> we<00:03:39.660> want

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
lot of places because we haven't we want

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.120 
lot of places because we haven't we want
to<00:03:39.900> make<00:03:40.020> sure<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.260> they<00:03:40.410> didn't<00:03:40.680> give<00:03:40.860> away

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
to make sure that they didn't give away

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.610 
to make sure that they didn't give away
the<00:03:41.310> mechanisms<00:03:41.910> inside<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:43.140> that's<00:03:43.230> kind<00:03:43.560> of

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
the mechanisms inside and that's kind of

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.550 
the mechanisms inside and that's kind of
the<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:44.040> wonder<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:45.660> fabrication<00:03:46.410> and

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
the the wonder of the fabrication and

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.380 
the the wonder of the fabrication and
the<00:03:46.650> coring<00:03:47.100> of<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:47.610> an<00:03:47.880> insight<00:03:48.239> you've

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
the coring of it is an insight you've

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.690 
the coring of it is an insight you've
got<00:03:48.570> hard<00:03:48.840> mechanical<00:03:49.380> moves<00:03:49.560> on<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.340> outside

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
got hard mechanical moves on the outside

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.000 
got hard mechanical moves on the outside
it<00:03:50.910> needed<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.180> look<00:03:51.420> like<00:03:51.720> smooth<00:03:52.260> organic

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
it needed to look like smooth organic

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.610 
it needed to look like smooth organic
you<00:03:53.550> know<00:03:53.580> realistic<00:03:54.330> movement<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.290> thicker

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
you know realistic movement so a thicker

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.490 
you know realistic movement so a thicker
skin<00:03:55.830> always<00:03:56.280> helps<00:03:56.550> with<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:56.989> but<00:03:57.989> as<00:03:58.200> we

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
skin always helps with that but as we

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.710 
skin always helps with that but as we
learned<00:03:58.769> later<00:03:59.070> on<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.280> thicker<00:03:59.610> skin<00:03:59.820> takes<00:04:00.600> on

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
learned later on a thicker skin takes on

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.520 
learned later on a thicker skin takes on
more<00:04:00.989> water<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.860> shrinks<00:04:02.489> more<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:03.410> it's<00:04:04.410> just

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
more water it shrinks more and it's just

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.490 
more water it shrinks more and it's just
heavier<00:04:04.980> so<00:04:05.760> with<00:04:06.300> with<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.750> hydraulics<00:04:07.290> it

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
heavier so with with the hydraulics it

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.220 
heavier so with with the hydraulics it
was<00:04:07.650> as<00:04:07.800> much<00:04:07.950> an<00:04:08.130> issue<00:04:08.250> but<00:04:08.750> they<00:04:09.750> finally

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
was as much an issue but they finally

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.340 
was as much an issue but they finally
tuned<00:04:10.530> these<00:04:11.209> aquinnah<00:04:12.209> sores<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.810> what<00:04:13.200> the

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
tuned these aquinnah sores to what the

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.470 
tuned these aquinnah sores to what the
dry<00:04:13.680> weight<00:04:13.890> was<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.430> then<00:04:14.940> like<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.300> t-rex

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
dry weight was and then like the t-rex

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.650 
dry weight was and then like the t-rex
which<00:04:15.959> wasn't<00:04:16.290> supposed<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.620> get<00:04:16.799> wet<00:04:16.980> it's<00:04:17.730> it

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
which wasn't supposed to get wet it's it

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.479 
which wasn't supposed to get wet it's it
took<00:04:18.870> on<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.019> lot<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.320> water<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:19.950> as<00:04:20.250> you<00:04:20.370> can

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
took on a lot of water and as you can

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.850 
took on a lot of water and as you can
see<00:04:20.730> what<00:04:21.350> everyone's<00:04:22.350> doing<00:04:22.500> here<00:04:22.770> is

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
see what everyone's doing here is

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.409 
see what everyone's doing here is
they're<00:04:23.040> taking<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.760> t-rex<00:04:24.060> through<00:04:24.300> its

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
they're taking the the t-rex through its

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.450 
they're taking the the t-rex through its
paces<00:04:24.870> so<00:04:25.050> we<00:04:25.169> would<00:04:25.350> have<00:04:25.470> to<00:04:25.680> see<00:04:25.890> how<00:04:26.040> far<00:04:26.310> it

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
paces so we would have to see how far it

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.400 
paces so we would have to see how far it
would<00:04:26.640> stretch<00:04:27.090> so<00:04:27.720> we<00:04:27.780> move<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:27.990> head<00:04:28.200> all

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
would stretch so we move the head all

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.960 
would stretch so we move the head all
the<00:04:28.590> way<00:04:28.620> up<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:28.980> its<00:04:29.100> floor<00:04:29.340> most<00:04:29.520> position

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
the way up to its floor most position

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.400 
the way up to its floor most position
and<00:04:30.120> you<00:04:30.180> can<00:04:30.300> see<00:04:30.419> that<00:04:30.570> then<00:04:30.720> that<00:04:31.110> skin

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
and you can see that then that skin

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.170 
and you can see that then that skin
needed<00:04:31.650> stretch<00:04:31.980> three<00:04:32.370> four<00:04:32.610> feet<00:04:32.820> in<00:04:33.000> some

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
needed stretch three four feet in some

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.960 
needed stretch three four feet in some
places<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.780> then<00:04:34.460> you<00:04:35.460> know<00:04:35.550> when<00:04:35.729> it<00:04:35.820> goes

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
places and then you know when it goes

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.480 
places and then you know when it goes
bends<00:04:36.240> down<00:04:36.539> it<00:04:36.840> had<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.169> not<00:04:37.530> bunch<00:04:38.039> up<00:04:38.250> and

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
bends down it had to not bunch up and

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.140 
bends down it had to not bunch up and
crinkle<00:04:39.060> in<00:04:39.180> unrealistic<00:04:39.780> ways<00:04:40.140> so

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
crinkle in unrealistic ways so

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.610 
crinkle in unrealistic ways so
finding<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.660> perfect<00:04:42.080> amount<00:04:42.230> of<00:04:42.380> tension

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
finding the perfect amount of tension

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.950 
finding the perfect amount of tension
and<00:04:42.950> stress<00:04:43.010> on<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.790> skin<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.720> wouldn't

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
and stress on the skin that wouldn't

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.390 
and stress on the skin that wouldn't
tear<00:04:45.110> itself<00:04:45.260> apart<00:04:45.380> but<00:04:46.040> that<00:04:46.190> would<00:04:46.280> still

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
tear itself apart but that would still

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.510 
tear itself apart but that would still
look<00:04:46.640> organic<00:04:47.350> was<00:04:48.350> was<00:04:48.920> tricky<00:04:49.220> I'm

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
look organic was was tricky I'm

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.110 
look organic was was tricky I'm
something<00:04:49.820> of<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.120> scale<00:04:51.850> we<00:04:52.850> ended<00:04:53.060> up

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
something of the scale we ended up

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.930 
something of the scale we ended up
having<00:04:53.270> to<00:04:53.360> find<00:04:53.630> you<00:04:54.440> know<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:55.190> different

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
having to find you know the different

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.070 
having to find you know the different
types<00:04:56.180> of<00:04:56.390> nettings

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
types of nettings

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.950 
types of nettings
for<00:04:57.860> use<00:04:58.070> with<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.370> t-rex<00:04:58.880> then<00:04:59.300> we<00:04:59.720> had

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
for use with the t-rex then we had

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.470 
for use with the t-rex then we had
another<00:05:00.280> movies<00:05:01.280> just<00:05:01.940> because<00:05:02.030> of<00:05:02.360> the

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
another movies just because of the

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.270 
another movies just because of the
amount<00:05:02.510> of<00:05:02.900> stretch<00:05:03.320> that<00:05:03.560> they<00:05:03.680> needed<00:05:03.920> to<00:05:04.070> go

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
amount of stretch that they needed to go

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.810 
amount of stretch that they needed to go
through<00:05:04.490> and<00:05:04.700> the<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:06.220> durability<00:05:07.220> of<00:05:07.520> the

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
through and the the durability of the

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.530 
through and the the durability of the
fabric<00:05:08.300> so<00:05:09.140> it<00:05:10.040> was<00:05:10.160> actually<00:05:10.580> quite<00:05:10.700> a<00:05:10.790> loose

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
fabric so it was actually quite a loose

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.260 
fabric so it was actually quite a loose
weave<00:05:11.960> of<00:05:12.760> netting<00:05:13.760> as<00:05:13.850> I<00:05:13.970> recall<00:05:14.330> but<00:05:16.120> it<00:05:17.120> was

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
weave of netting as I recall but it was

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.610 
weave of netting as I recall but it was
just<00:05:18.100> tricky<00:05:19.100> trying<00:05:19.310> to<00:05:19.370> find<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:19.730> correct

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
just tricky trying to find the correct

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.550 
just tricky trying to find the correct
amount<00:05:21.620> of<00:05:22.630> fabric<00:05:23.630> to<00:05:23.750> put<00:05:23.900> in<00:05:24.020> there<00:05:24.230> as<00:05:24.380> well

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
amount of fabric to put in there as well

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.300 
amount of fabric to put in there as well
as<00:05:24.740> the<00:05:24.860> foam

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
as the foam

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.790 
as the foam
yeah<00:05:25.940> everything<00:05:26.840> was<00:05:26.960> so<00:05:27.110> big<00:05:27.350> you<00:05:27.380> you

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
yeah everything was so big you you

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.500 
yeah everything was so big you you
couldn't<00:05:28.130> risk<00:05:28.310> running<00:05:28.670> at<00:05:28.910> three<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:29.300> four

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
couldn't risk running at three and four

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.860 
couldn't risk running at three and four
times<00:05:29.720> and<00:05:30.110> was<00:05:31.210> gallons<00:05:32.210> and<00:05:32.390> gallons<00:05:32.420> and

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
times and was gallons and gallons and

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.780 
times and was gallons and gallons and
gallons<00:05:32.900> of<00:05:33.350> foam<00:05:33.560> so<00:05:34.070> you<00:05:34.190> only<00:05:34.340> had<00:05:34.520> one<00:05:34.700> or

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
gallons of foam so you only had one or

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.860 
gallons of foam so you only had one or
two<00:05:34.880> shots<00:05:35.090> at<00:05:35.390> it<00:05:37.180> it's<00:05:38.180> a<00:05:38.270> testament<00:05:38.660> to<00:05:38.750> the

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
two shots at it it's a testament to the

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.350 
two shots at it it's a testament to the
artistry<00:05:39.230> to<00:05:39.470> is<00:05:39.710> to<00:05:39.920> you<00:05:40.250> know<00:05:40.340> take<00:05:40.880> this

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
artistry to is to you know take this

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.140 
artistry to is to you know take this
amazing<00:05:41.930> sculpture<00:05:42.410> and<00:05:42.620> then<00:05:43.100> cut<00:05:43.370> you<00:05:44.060> know

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
amazing sculpture and then cut you know

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.850 
amazing sculpture and then cut you know
3<00:05:44.450> 1<00:05:44.630> foot<00:05:44.870> sections<00:05:45.290> out<00:05:45.410> of<00:05:45.530> the<00:05:45.590> middle<00:05:45.800> of

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
3 1 foot sections out of the middle of

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.920 
3 1 foot sections out of the middle of
it<00:05:46.040> and<00:05:46.250> then<00:05:46.460> have<00:05:46.670> to<00:05:46.820> refabricate<00:05:47.600> it<00:05:47.720> out

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
it and then have to refabricate it out

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.140 
it and then have to refabricate it out
of<00:05:48.110> foam<00:05:48.380> latex<00:05:48.800> and<00:05:49.100> patch<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.490> back<00:05:49.520> in<00:05:49.880> and

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
of foam latex and patch it back in and

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.580 
of foam latex and patch it back in and
make<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.390> lines<00:05:50.630> work<00:05:50.930> and<00:05:51.170> their<00:05:51.290> wrinkles

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
make the lines work and their wrinkles

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.250 
make the lines work and their wrinkles
work<00:05:51.940> make<00:05:52.940> everything<00:05:53.180> flow<00:05:53.630> again<00:05:53.930> even

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
work make everything flow again even

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.140 
work make everything flow again even
though<00:05:54.410> you've<00:05:54.590> cut<00:05:55.340> a<00:05:55.370> big<00:05:55.550> piece<00:05:55.580> out<00:05:55.940> and<00:05:56.090> it

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
though you've cut a big piece out and it

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.730 
though you've cut a big piece out and it
shrunk<00:05:56.890> make<00:05:57.890> it<00:05:57.980> all<00:05:58.100> look<00:05:58.250> good<00:05:58.460> again
