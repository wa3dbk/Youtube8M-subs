okay<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.460> part<00:00:02.760> 2<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.419> Gina's<00:00:04.319> light<00:00:04.940> that

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
okay this is part 2 of Gina's light that

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.280 
okay this is part 2 of Gina's light that
I<00:00:06.919> was<00:00:07.919> impressed<00:00:08.639> with<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.300> built<00:00:09.719> one<00:00:10.050> and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
I was impressed with so I built one and

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.970 
I was impressed with so I built one and
it<00:00:11.099> all<00:00:11.250> revolves<00:00:11.820> around<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.960> three<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.920> a

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
it all revolves around this three and a

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.650 
it all revolves around this three and a
quarter<00:00:14.219> inch<00:00:14.549> toroid<00:00:15.210> coil<00:00:15.800> that<00:00:17.060> on<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
quarter inch toroid coil that on the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.929 
quarter inch toroid coil that on the
secondary<00:00:19.289> there's<00:00:19.650> enough<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.310> voltage

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
secondary there's enough of a voltage

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.800 
secondary there's enough of a voltage
bump<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.779> light<00:00:22.109> up<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.609> CFL<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.910> has<00:00:24.090> nothing<00:00:24.660> in

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
bump to light up a CFL it has nothing in

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.769 
bump to light up a CFL it has nothing in
it<00:00:24.930> but<00:00:24.960> just<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> bulb<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:27.119> runs<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.570> off

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
it but just the bulb and it runs it off

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.620 
it but just the bulb and it runs it off
of<00:00:28.170> one<00:00:28.500> double-a<00:00:29.099> battery<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.119> half<00:00:30.330> volts

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
of one double-a battery on a half volts

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.080 
of one double-a battery on a half volts
and<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> circuit<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.520> I've<00:00:32.790> got

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
and this is the circuit that I've got

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.729 
and this is the circuit that I've got
right<00:00:33.690> now<00:00:34.250> that<00:00:35.930> there<00:00:36.930> was<00:00:37.050> an<00:00:37.200> error<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
right now that there was an error in the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.709 
right now that there was an error in the
last<00:00:37.770> video<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.430> had<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> connection<00:00:39.629> between

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
last video I had a connection between

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.040 
last video I had a connection between
here<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.350> here<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.120> in<00:00:42.120> my<00:00:42.329> circuit<00:00:42.750> anyway

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
here and here and in my circuit anyway

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.720 
here and here and in my circuit anyway
there's<00:00:43.260> no<00:00:43.410> connection<00:00:43.800> there<00:00:44.040> at<00:00:44.309> all<00:00:44.399> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
there's no connection there at all and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.240 
there's no connection there at all and
it's<00:00:45.719> very<00:00:46.020> very<00:00:46.200> simple<00:00:46.559> it's<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it's very very simple it's just a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.190 
it's very very simple it's just a
one-and-a-half<00:00:47.879> volt<00:00:48.300> battery<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:49.079> an

extra winding like the power take-off
from<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.600> main<00:01:09.810> coil<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:11.010> that's<00:01:11.250> how<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> ended

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
from the main coil so that's how I ended

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.649 
from the main coil so that's how I ended
up<00:01:11.909> now<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.860> got<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> 22<00:01:14.580> ohm<00:01:15.000> resistor

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
up now here I just got a 22 ohm resistor

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.920 
up now here I just got a 22 ohm resistor
and<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.950> transistor<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.700> decided<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.420> use<00:01:18.630> was

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and the transistor I decided to use was

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.520 
and the transistor I decided to use was
a<00:01:18.960> TI<00:01:19.320> P<00:01:19.530> 3<00:01:20.100> or<00:01:20.220> 5<00:01:20.460> v<00:01:20.820> instead<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> 2<00:01:21.840> n<00:01:22.049> 3<00:01:22.350> or

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
a TI P 3 or 5 v instead of the 2 n 3 or

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.120 
a TI P 3 or 5 v instead of the 2 n 3 or
5<00:01:22.740> 5<00:01:23.450> anyway<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.720> worked<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.380> real<00:01:25.650> good<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.100> I

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
5 5 anyway it worked out real good and I

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.649 
5 5 anyway it worked out real good and I
was<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.400> impressed<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.240> put<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.600> a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
was so impressed with it I put it in a

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.520 
was so impressed with it I put it in a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
led very similar to Dewey's led that I'm

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.260 
led very similar to Dewey's led that I'm
just<00:02:18.160> going<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.310> plug<00:02:18.580> in<00:02:18.790> there<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.090> show

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
just going to plug in there and show

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.450 
just going to plug in there and show
that<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.870> on<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.980> side<00:02:21.220> here<00:02:21.760> is<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:23.590> little

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460

the<00:02:32.860> whole<00:02:33.100> circuit<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.850> lot<00:02:34.540> of<00:02:34.660> people<00:02:35.080> when

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
the whole circuit a lot of people when

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.920 
the whole circuit a lot of people when
they<00:02:35.650> build<00:02:35.950> these<00:02:36.100> you'll<00:02:36.400> fees<00:02:36.760> they<00:02:37.480> put<00:02:37.900> a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
they build these you'll fees they put a

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.710 
they build these you'll fees they put a
variable<00:02:38.650> resistor<00:02:39.610> here<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.450> base

variable resistor here in the base

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.710 
variable resistor here in the base
circuit<00:02:41.350> which<00:02:41.680> works<00:02:41.950> just<00:02:42.220> as<00:02:42.370> well<00:02:42.610> but<00:02:43.330> I'm

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
circuit which works just as well but I'm

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.980 
circuit which works just as well but I'm
just<00:02:43.780> doing<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.440> with<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:45.240> 25<00:02:46.240> only<00:02:46.600> a<00:02:46.630> step

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
just doing it with this 25 only a step

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.750 
just doing it with this 25 only a step
but<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.230> can<00:02:47.530> eliminate<00:02:47.800> that<00:02:48.070> if<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.550> want

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
but you can eliminate that if you want

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.190 
but you can eliminate that if you want
to<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.180> put<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.680> 1k<00:02:50.680> pot<00:02:51.100> here<00:02:51.700> with<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.690> small

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
to and put a 1k pot here with a small

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.740 
to and put a 1k pot here with a small
resistor<00:02:53.830> in<00:02:54.010> series<00:02:54.040> with<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.120> that

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
resistor in series with it and that

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.010 
resistor in series with it and that
works<00:02:55.960> too<00:02:56.290> but<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:57.370> is<00:02:57.430> Gina's<00:02:58.060> light<00:02:58.300> in<00:02:58.870> a

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
there is to it folks there's just not

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.360 
there is to it folks there's just not
much<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:15.870> jeana's<00:04:16.870> light<00:04:17.140> it's<00:04:17.680> a<00:04:17.859> very<00:04:18.130> very

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
much to jeana's light it's a very very

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.090 
much to jeana's light it's a very very
simple<00:04:18.880> situation<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:21.489> it's<00:04:21.970> very<00:04:22.240> effective

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
simple situation and it's very effective

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.310 
simple situation and it's very effective
and<00:04:23.190> we<00:04:23.280> turn<00:04:23.550> it<00:04:23.670> on<00:04:23.760> here<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.840> I'll<00:04:25.050> show<00:04:25.290> you

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
and we turn it on here and I'll show you

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:34.730 
and we turn it on here and I'll show you
how<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.710> works

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.880 

and<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:35.400> goes<00:04:35.840> and<00:04:36.840> that's<00:04:37.140> running<00:04:37.440> on<00:04:37.680> one

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
and it goes and that's running on one

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.650 
and it goes and that's running on one
and<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.070> half<00:04:38.280> volts<00:04:39.050> that's<00:04:40.050> it<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:41.060> that<00:04:42.060> this

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
and a half volts that's it and that this

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.830

let<00:05:02.760> me<00:05:02.850> turn<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.150> lights<00:05:03.330> down<00:05:03.570> I'll<00:05:03.780> show<00:05:03.810> ya

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
let me turn the lights down I'll show ya

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.960 
let me turn the lights down I'll show ya
and<00:05:04.470> at<00:05:05.250> 30<00:05:05.520> or<00:05:05.640> 40<00:05:06.000> milliamps<00:05:06.720> this<00:05:06.930> will<00:05:07.140> run

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
and at 30 or 40 milliamps this will run

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.200 
and at 30 or 40 milliamps this will run
for<00:05:08.970> over<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:09.810> day<00:05:10.260> I<00:05:10.650> had<00:05:11.310> this<00:05:11.490> running<00:05:11.910> curve

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
for over a day I had this running curve

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.140 
for over a day I had this running curve
over<00:05:12.810> 36<00:05:13.620> hours<00:05:14.010> and<00:05:14.250> finally<00:05:14.490> turned<00:05:14.850> it<00:05:15.000> off

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
over 36 hours and finally turned it off

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.900 
over 36 hours and finally turned it off
and<00:05:15.540> when<00:05:16.410> you<00:05:16.440> want<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.920> light<00:05:17.100> man<00:05:17.670> the

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
and when you want the light man the

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.350 
and when you want the light man the
light<00:05:18.090> comes<00:05:18.420> right<00:05:18.750> on<00:05:18.780> bright<00:05:19.380> and<00:05:20.120> this<00:05:21.120> is

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
light comes right on bright and this is

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.810 
light comes right on bright and this is
very<00:05:21.750> very<00:05:22.050> effective<00:05:22.500> to<00:05:23.070> be<00:05:23.190> doing<00:05:23.610> this

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
very very effective to be doing this

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.350 
very very effective to be doing this
with<00:05:24.720> a<00:05:24.990> volt<00:05:25.380> and<00:05:25.590> a<00:05:25.680> half<00:05:25.940> I'll<00:05:26.940> turn<00:05:27.210> this

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
with a volt and a half I'll turn this

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.880 
with a volt and a half I'll turn this
all<00:05:27.540> the<00:05:27.630> way<00:05:27.750> off<00:05:27.930> you'll<00:05:28.260> see<00:05:28.470> the<00:05:28.620> amount<00:05:28.860> of

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
all the way off you'll see the amount of

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.570 
all the way off you'll see the amount of
brightness<00:05:29.370> when<00:05:29.520> I<00:05:29.610> turn<00:05:29.850> this<00:05:30.030> up<00:05:30.270> and<00:05:31.280> if<00:05:32.280> it

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
brightness when I turn this up and if it

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.430 
brightness when I turn this up and if it
was<00:05:32.730> the<00:05:32.880> fact<00:05:33.180> that<00:05:33.300> you<00:05:33.540> could<00:05:33.720> do<00:05:33.930> this<00:05:34.140> with

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
was the fact that you could do this with

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.640 
was the fact that you could do this with
a<00:05:34.470> one-and-a-half<00:05:34.890> volt<00:05:35.370> battery<00:05:35.850> and<00:05:36.650> get

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
a one-and-a-half volt battery and get

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.460 
a one-and-a-half volt battery and get
this<00:05:37.950> to<00:05:38.160> run<00:05:38.370> for<00:05:38.790> many<00:05:39.000> hours<00:05:39.270> that<00:05:39.810> really

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
this to run for many hours that really

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.960 
this to run for many hours that really
impressed<00:05:40.860> me<00:05:41.070> and<00:05:41.310> that's<00:05:41.460> why<00:05:41.640> I<00:05:41.670> went<00:05:41.850> ahead

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
impressed me and that's why I went ahead

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.810 
impressed me and that's why I went ahead
and<00:05:42.210> put<00:05:42.360> her<00:05:42.420> in<00:05:42.510> a<00:05:42.570> box<00:05:43.070> now<00:05:44.070> the<00:05:44.130> other<00:05:44.490> part

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
and put her in a box now the other part

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.880 
and put her in a box now the other part
of<00:05:44.940> it<00:05:45.090> is<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.390> LED<00:05:45.570> part<00:05:46.260> here<00:05:46.650> and<00:05:48.740> see<00:05:49.740> the

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
of it is the LED part here and see the

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.640 
of it is the LED part here and see the
little<00:05:50.160> port<00:05:50.490> right<00:05:50.700> there<00:05:50.780> if<00:05:51.780> I<00:05:51.960> plug<00:05:52.320> in<00:05:52.530> the

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
little port right there if I plug in the

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.170 
little port right there if I plug in the
LEDs<00:05:53.250> to<00:05:53.280> that<00:05:53.700> port<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.860> get<00:05:55.860> super<00:05:56.340> bright<00:05:56.580> LED

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
LEDs to that port I get super bright LED

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.710 
LEDs to that port I get super bright LED
light<00:05:57.680> now<00:05:58.680> I<00:05:59.040> can<00:05:59.790> turn<00:06:00.000> this<00:06:00.180> all<00:06:00.420> the<00:06:00.570> way

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
light now I can turn this all the way

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.170 
light now I can turn this all the way
down<00:06:01.020> that<00:06:01.710> rheostat<00:06:02.250> all<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.520> way<00:06:02.610> down<00:06:02.850> here

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
down that rheostat all the way down here

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.870 
down that rheostat all the way down here
and<00:06:03.720> I<00:06:03.840> still<00:06:04.350> have<00:06:04.620> very<00:06:04.920> bright<00:06:05.310> lights<00:06:05.640> now

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
and I still have very bright lights now

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.780 
and I still have very bright lights now
let<00:06:06.030> me<00:06:06.120> compare<00:06:06.570> it<00:06:06.690> to<00:06:06.810> do<00:06:07.020> these<00:06:07.200> lights<00:06:07.790> you

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
let me compare it to do these lights you

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.580 
let me compare it to do these lights you
see<00:06:09.180> that<00:06:09.360> they're<00:06:09.510> almost<00:06:09.630> about<00:06:10.080> the<00:06:10.320> same

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
see that they're almost about the same

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.700 
see that they're almost about the same
now<00:06:11.340> that's<00:06:11.580> only<00:06:11.790> drawn<00:06:12.210> about<00:06:12.480> 20<00:06:12.900> milliamps

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
now that's only drawn about 20 milliamps

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.090 
now that's only drawn about 20 milliamps
to<00:06:14.160> 15<00:06:15.090> to<00:06:15.240> 20<00:06:15.570> milliamps<00:06:16.260> at<00:06:16.350> that<00:06:16.560> brightness

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
to 15 to 20 milliamps at that brightness

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.220 
to 15 to 20 milliamps at that brightness
and<00:06:18.020> that<00:06:19.020> impressed<00:06:19.650> me<00:06:19.800> also<00:06:20.100> with<00:06:20.490> this<00:06:20.670> was

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
and that impressed me also with this was

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.260 
and that impressed me also with this was
because<00:06:22.230> the<00:06:22.260> size<00:06:22.680> of<00:06:22.860> the<00:06:22.980> toroid<00:06:23.820> I<00:06:23.940> believe

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
because the size of the toroid I believe

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.750 
because the size of the toroid I believe
and<00:06:24.660> the<00:06:24.720> way<00:06:24.810> this<00:06:24.960> is<00:06:25.020> set<00:06:25.350> up<00:06:25.410> you<00:06:26.280> get<00:06:26.430> very

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
and the way this is set up you get very

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.660 
and the way this is set up you get very
very<00:06:27.120> efficient<00:06:27.780> resonance<00:06:28.350> on<00:06:28.590> this<00:06:29.190> circuit

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
very efficient resonance on this circuit

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.670 
very efficient resonance on this circuit
and<00:06:29.850> a<00:06:30.420> Joule<00:06:30.630> thief<00:06:30.840> is<00:06:31.110> really<00:06:31.350> self

on<00:06:42.990> and<00:06:43.670> I<00:06:45.140> like<00:06:46.140> this<00:06:46.350> I<00:06:46.560> think<00:06:46.770> this<00:06:46.920> is<00:06:47.070> a

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
on and I like this I think this is a

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.290 
on and I like this I think this is a
great<00:06:47.340> idea

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
great idea

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.610 
great idea

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:04.950 
out and do you recommend this circuit

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:10.040 
out and do you recommend this circuit
and<00:07:05.360> getting<00:07:06.360> this<00:07:06.570> toroid<00:07:08.120> ring<00:07:09.120> ferrite

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
and getting this toroid ring ferrite

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.830
