okay first of all of course you will
need<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.279> neem<00:00:26.490> oil<00:00:26.699> there<00:00:27.359> are<00:00:27.480> many

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
need the neem oil there are many

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.300 
need the neem oil there are many
different<00:00:27.990> types<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.320> neem<00:00:28.529> oil<00:00:28.650> some<00:00:29.039> are

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
different types of neem oil some are

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.429 
different types of neem oil some are
essences<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.300> stuff<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.170> I've

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
essences and stuff like that I've

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.190 
essences and stuff like that I've
noticed<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.669> if<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.180> get<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.540> pure<00:00:33.840> neem

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
noticed but if you can get the pure neem

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.020 
noticed but if you can get the pure neem
oil<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.010> actually<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.579> more<00:00:35.790> powerful

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
oil this is actually a more powerful

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.580 
oil this is actually a more powerful
stuff<00:00:36.660> then<00:00:37.110> you'll<00:00:37.620> need<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:39.050> dish<00:00:40.050> soap<00:00:40.350> or

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
stuff then you'll need a dish soap or

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.819 
stuff then you'll need a dish soap or
dish<00:00:40.890> detergent<00:00:41.250> now<00:00:42.180> they<00:00:43.110> usually<00:00:43.260> say<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
dish detergent now they usually say to

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.240 
dish detergent now they usually say to
use<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.430> mild<00:00:44.760> one<00:00:45.059> or<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.420> bio<00:00:46.170> one<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.739> was<00:00:46.980> lucky

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
use a mild one or a bio one I was lucky

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.840 
use a mild one or a bio one I was lucky
enough<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.460> find<00:00:47.850> something<00:00:48.329> echo<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:49.170> bio<00:00:49.850> it

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
enough to find something echo or bio it

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.720 
enough to find something echo or bio it
says<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.449> derives<00:00:51.750> from<00:00:51.870> plant<00:00:52.469> tissue<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
says it derives from plant tissue and

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.580 
says it derives from plant tissue and
stuff<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:54.840> anyway<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.379> thing<00:00:55.559> is

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
stuff like that but anyway the thing is

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.369 
stuff like that but anyway the thing is
it's<00:00:55.980> much<00:00:56.160> more<00:00:56.460> milder<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.329> non-toxic<00:00:57.899> than

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
it's much more milder and non-toxic than

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.400 
it's much more milder and non-toxic than
your<00:00:58.559> average<00:00:59.270> dishwashing<00:01:00.270> soap<00:01:01.170> or

approximately one liter of water now the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.179 
approximately one liter of water now the
recipe<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.430> with<00:01:23.700> 0.9<00:01:24.540> liters<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:26.040> know

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
recipe is with 0.9 liters but you know

recipe is with 0.9 liters but you know
it's<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.939> matter<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.210> approximating<00:01:28.110> I

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
it's just a matter of approximating I

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.410 
it's just a matter of approximating I
use<00:01:28.439> 1<00:01:28.710> liter<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.310> then<00:01:29.729> you'll<00:01:29.909> need<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
use 1 liter and then you'll need a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.109 
use 1 liter and then you'll need a
tablespoon<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.590> also<00:01:32.280> sometimes<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.970> might

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
and I'll tell you what to do with this

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.440 
and I'll tell you what to do with this
in<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.439> second<00:01:37.829> now<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.700> cold<00:01:38.939> temperatures

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
in a second now in cold temperatures

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.050 
in a second now in cold temperatures
neem<00:01:39.720> oil<00:01:39.900> will<00:01:40.350> get<00:01:40.560> solid<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> to

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
neem oil will get solid and for you to

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.880 
neem oil will get solid and for you to
use<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.600> need<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.930> melt<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.320> somehow<00:01:43.560> and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
use it you need to melt it somehow and

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.130 
use it you need to melt it somehow and
this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.670> where<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.030> little<00:01:45.180> cup<00:01:45.420> comes<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.899> if

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
this is where the little cup comes in if

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.200 
this is where the little cup comes in if
the<00:01:46.470> neem<00:01:46.649> all<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.820> solid

the neem all you have is in a solid

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.020 
the neem all you have is in a solid
state<00:01:48.570> then<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.710> place<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.729> cup

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
state then you can place it in a cup

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.270 
state then you can place it in a cup
with<00:01:51.060> some<00:01:51.450> hot<00:01:51.689> water<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:52.590> let<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.979> sit

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
with some hot water just let it sit

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.179 
with some hot water just let it sit
there<00:01:53.520> for<00:01:53.729> 10<00:01:54.509> minutes<00:01:54.869> 15<00:01:55.049> minutes<00:01:55.590> until<00:01:55.740> it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
there for 10 minutes 15 minutes until it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.800 
there for 10 minutes 15 minutes until it
will<00:01:56.340> melt<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.060> actually<00:01:57.420> use<00:01:57.630> it

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
will melt and you can actually use it

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.770 
will melt and you can actually use it
okay<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.920> think<00:01:59.070> my<00:01:59.369> Nemo<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.939> ready<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.509> use

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
okay so I think my Nemo is ready to use

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.709 
okay so I think my Nemo is ready to use
yeah<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.710> liquid<00:02:01.979> now<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.299> don't<00:02:03.479> know<00:02:03.540> if

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
yeah it's liquid now so I don't know if

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.319 
yeah it's liquid now so I don't know if
I<00:02:03.899> mentioned<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:05.189> water<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.909> bottle

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
I mentioned the water in this bottle

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.020 
I mentioned the water in this bottle
needs<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.869> be<00:02:06.990> pretty<00:02:07.649> warm<00:02:07.920> not<00:02:08.369> hot<00:02:08.429> but

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
needs to be pretty warm not hot but

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.660 
needs to be pretty warm not hot but
pretty

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
pretty

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.480 
pretty
because<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.119> will<00:02:10.240> help<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.780> oil<00:02:11.319> mix<00:02:12.160> better

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
because it will help the oil mix better

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.090 
because it will help the oil mix better
and<00:02:13.000> actually<00:02:13.390> what<00:02:13.569> I<00:02:13.600> like<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.500> do<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.860> not

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
and actually what I like to do is not

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.100 
and actually what I like to do is not
mix<00:02:15.819> everything<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:16.600> bottle

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
mix everything in this bottle

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.730 
mix everything in this bottle
but<00:02:17.590> mix<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.250> in<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:19.000> tiny<00:02:19.600> little<00:02:19.930> cup<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.230> I

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
but mix it in the tiny little cup that I

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.520 
but mix it in the tiny little cup that I
used<00:02:21.190> previously<00:02:21.610> because<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.750> just<00:02:22.959> mixes

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
used previously because it just mixes

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.470 
used previously because it just mixes
better<00:02:23.740> in<00:02:23.950> hot<00:02:24.310> water<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.819> then<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.120> can<00:02:25.300> just

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
better in hot water and then I can just

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.170 
better in hot water and then I can just
dump<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:25.959> into<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.730> bottle<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:27.940> it<00:02:28.120> will

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
dump this into this bottle and it will

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.820 
dump this into this bottle and it will
not<00:02:28.420> actually<00:02:28.660> change<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.320> temperature<00:02:29.740> in

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
not actually change the temperature in

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.220 
not actually change the temperature in
the<00:02:29.950> bottle<00:02:30.220> too<00:02:30.520> much<00:02:30.850> so<00:02:31.630> all<00:02:31.900> righty

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
the bottle too much so all righty

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.770 
the bottle too much so all righty
about<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.070> gloves<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.640> don't<00:02:34.180> have<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.600> wear

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
about the gloves you don't have to wear

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.250 
about the gloves you don't have to wear

I'm a freak of nature and I cannot stand

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
the smell of neem oil which reminds me

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.490 
the smell of neem oil which reminds me
of<00:02:42.459> onions<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.090> if<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.540> get<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.840> smell<00:02:44.290> which

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
is super powerful under my fingernails

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.949 
is super powerful under my fingernails

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
don't have to wear gloves anyway so what

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.009 
don't have to wear gloves anyway so what
you<00:02:53.050> want<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.290> do<00:02:53.440> now<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:54.760> mix<00:02:55.180> into<00:02:55.600> this

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
you want to do now is mix into this

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.580 
you want to do now is mix into this
little<00:02:56.290> cup<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.850> tablespoon<00:02:57.850> of<00:02:58.120> neem<00:02:58.480> oil<00:02:58.630> so

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
little cup a tablespoon of neem oil so

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.400 
little cup a tablespoon of neem oil so
hopefully<00:02:59.890> you<00:02:59.980> can<00:03:00.010> see<00:03:00.190> one<00:03:01.230> tablespoon<00:03:02.230> of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
hopefully you can see one tablespoon of

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.610 
hopefully you can see one tablespoon of
neem<00:03:02.830> oil<00:03:02.980> it's<00:03:03.430> very<00:03:03.489> fluid<00:03:03.910> now<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:05.500> will

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
neem oil it's very fluid now you will

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.530 
neem oil it's very fluid now you will
see<00:03:05.830> that<00:03:06.010> it<00:03:06.190> will<00:03:06.310> really<00:03:06.760> not<00:03:07.030> mix<00:03:07.330> into

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
see that it will really not mix into

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.759 
see that it will really not mix into
water<00:03:08.070> I'll<00:03:09.070> just<00:03:09.310> try<00:03:09.489> to<00:03:09.519> show<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:09.880> here<00:03:10.769> see

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
water I'll just try to show you here see

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.270 
water I'll just try to show you here see
so<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:12.489> is<00:03:12.550> where<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.660> dish<00:03:13.930> soap<00:03:14.680> will<00:03:15.040> come

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
so this is where the dish soap will come

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.970 
so this is where the dish soap will come
in<00:03:15.690> now<00:03:16.690> with<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.959> dish<00:03:17.170> soap<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.650> don't<00:03:17.829> have

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
in now with the dish soap you don't have

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.080 
in now with the dish soap you don't have
to<00:03:18.130> use<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.459> full<00:03:19.230> teaspoon<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:21.519> recipe<00:03:21.910> is

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
to use a full teaspoon the recipe is

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.080 
to use a full teaspoon the recipe is
with<00:03:22.540> half<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.530> teaspoon<00:03:23.799> but<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.940> know

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
with half of a teaspoon but you know

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.030 
with half of a teaspoon but you know
it's<00:03:25.299> approximation<00:03:25.900> here<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:26.500> I'll<00:03:26.680> just<00:03:26.709> try

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
it's approximation here so I'll just try

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.350 
it's approximation here so I'll just try
to<00:03:27.329> pour<00:03:28.329> in<00:03:28.510> just<00:03:28.780> half<00:03:29.709> of<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.090> teaspoon<00:03:31.090> I

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
to pour in just half of it teaspoon I

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.410 
to pour in just half of it teaspoon I
think<00:03:31.930> this<00:03:32.079> is<00:03:32.230> enough<00:03:32.700> okay<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:34.090> you'll<00:03:34.299> see

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
think this is enough okay so you'll see

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.350 
think this is enough okay so you'll see
some<00:03:34.450> magic<00:03:34.750> when<00:03:35.079> you<00:03:35.170> pour<00:03:35.410> this<00:03:35.590> in<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.360> you

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
some magic when you pour this in and you

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.819 
some magic when you pour this in and you
mix<00:03:37.570> it<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:40.390> oil<00:03:40.570> will<00:03:40.900> start<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.380> break<00:03:41.590> down

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
mix it the oil will start to break down

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.360 
mix it the oil will start to break down
and<00:03:42.130> you'll<00:03:42.489> actually<00:03:42.670> have<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.530> solution<00:03:44.530> just

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
and you'll actually have a solution just

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.720 
and you'll actually have a solution just
like<00:03:45.610> this<00:03:46.170> now<00:03:47.170> in<00:03:47.320> hot<00:03:47.560> water<00:03:47.799> it<00:03:48.100> does<00:03:48.370> mix

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
like this now in hot water it does mix

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.640 
like this now in hot water it does mix
better<00:03:50.700> okay<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:51.730> after<00:03:51.940> you<00:03:52.090> mixed<00:03:52.510> it<00:03:52.660> it's

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
better okay so after you mixed it it's

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.100 
better okay so after you mixed it it's
time<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.160> pour<00:03:54.370> everything<00:03:54.579> into<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.900> big

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
time to pour everything into the big

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.979 
time to pour everything into the big
bottle<00:03:56.470> now<00:03:57.459> before<00:03:57.910> we<00:03:58.090> go<00:03:58.269> ahead<00:03:58.299> and<00:03:58.720> pour

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
bottle now before we go ahead and pour

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.289 
bottle now before we go ahead and pour
this<00:03:59.200> in<00:03:59.530> our<00:03:59.799> sprayer<00:04:00.220> bottle<00:04:00.549> I<00:04:00.850> just<00:04:01.209> like

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
this in our sprayer bottle I just like

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.880 
this in our sprayer bottle I just like
to<00:04:01.420> talk<00:04:01.570> a<00:04:01.630> little<00:04:01.840> bit<00:04:01.959> about<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.380> nozzles

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
to talk a little bit about the nozzles

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.100 
to talk a little bit about the nozzles
you<00:04:03.100> should<00:04:03.310> use<00:04:03.519> now<00:04:04.180> there<00:04:04.480> are<00:04:04.600> two<00:04:04.780> types

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
you should use now there are two types

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.199 
you should use now there are two types
of<00:04:05.320> nozzles<00:04:05.620> of<00:04:06.040> spray<00:04:06.370> bottles<00:04:06.760> now<00:04:07.150> the

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
of nozzles of spray bottles now the

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.360 
of nozzles of spray bottles now the
first<00:04:07.480> type<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.840> nozzle<00:04:08.049> is<00:04:08.410> this<00:04:08.829> kind<00:04:09.160> which

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
first type of nozzle is this kind which

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.849 
first type of nozzle is this kind which
has<00:04:09.640> a<00:04:09.670> little<00:04:09.940> cap<00:04:10.269> here<00:04:10.560> probably<00:04:11.560> for

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
has a little cap here probably for

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.280 
has a little cap here probably for
preventing<00:04:12.579> impurities<00:04:13.180> into<00:04:13.750> getting<00:04:13.959> stuck

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
preventing impurities into getting stuck

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.289 
preventing impurities into getting stuck
into<00:04:14.440> this<00:04:14.650> nozzle<00:04:14.890> this<00:04:15.579> will<00:04:15.850> not<00:04:16.030> work

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
into this nozzle this will not work

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.630 
into this nozzle this will not work
because<00:04:16.539> this<00:04:17.500> mixture<00:04:17.830> is<00:04:18.130> just<00:04:18.160> thicker

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
because this mixture is just thicker

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.789 
because this mixture is just thicker
than<00:04:18.910> water<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.359> it<00:04:19.780> will<00:04:19.870> just<00:04:20.049> clog<00:04:20.440> up<00:04:20.620> the

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
than water and it will just clog up the

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.790 
than water and it will just clog up the
whole<00:04:20.950> system<00:04:21.220> what<00:04:21.940> you<00:04:22.060> need<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.390> use<00:04:22.630> is

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
whole system what you need to use is

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.980 
whole system what you need to use is
a<00:04:23.830> sprayer<00:04:24.790> bottle<00:04:25.150> that<00:04:25.270> doesn't<00:04:25.660> have<00:04:25.810> that

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
a sprayer bottle that doesn't have that

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.740 
a sprayer bottle that doesn't have that
little<00:04:26.200> cup<00:04:26.500> on<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:27.460> engine<00:04:27.820> here<00:04:28.270> this<00:04:28.570> will

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
little cup on the engine here this will

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.680 
little cup on the engine here this will
work<00:04:28.930> just<00:04:29.140> great<00:04:29.590> so<00:04:29.830> this<00:04:30.040> is<00:04:30.190> what<00:04:30.340> you<00:04:30.490> need

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
work just great so this is what you need

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.060 
work just great so this is what you need
okay<00:04:31.690> so<00:04:31.750> now<00:04:32.080> it's<00:04:32.380> just<00:04:32.650> a<00:04:32.770> matter<00:04:32.950> of

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
okay so now it's just a matter of

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.820 
okay so now it's just a matter of
pouring<00:04:33.910> this<00:04:34.150> into<00:04:34.480> our<00:04:34.690> sprayer<00:04:35.170> bottle<00:04:35.650> and

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
pouring this into our sprayer bottle and

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.040 
pouring this into our sprayer bottle and
just<00:04:36.190> spray<00:04:36.310> our<00:04:36.580> plants<00:04:37.060> now<00:04:37.480> before<00:04:37.840> you

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
just spray our plants now before you

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.160 
just spray our plants now before you
pour<00:04:38.320> it<00:04:38.500> in<00:04:38.680> just<00:04:39.190> mix<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.730> very<00:04:39.760> well<00:04:40.210> mix<00:04:40.960> it

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
regularly from time to time just to mix

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.080 
regularly from time to time just to mix
everything<00:04:43.720> up<00:04:44.050> because<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:45.160> oil<00:04:45.370> will<00:04:45.400> tend

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
everything up because the oil will tend

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.760 
everything up because the oil will tend
to<00:04:46.300> separate<00:04:46.900> from<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.290> water<00:04:47.440> and

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
to separate from the water and

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.010 
to separate from the water and
everything<00:04:48.220> no<00:04:48.370> matter<00:04:48.400> what<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.030> no<00:04:49.120> so<00:04:49.780> when

you're<00:04:50.140> using<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.620> sprayer<00:04:50.890> when<00:04:51.160> you're

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
you're using the sprayer when you're

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.810 
you're using the sprayer when you're
spraying<00:04:51.730> your<00:04:52.330> kids<00:04:53.040> agitated<00:04:54.040> from<00:04:54.250> time<00:04:54.550> to

spraying your kids agitated from time to

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.030 
spraying your kids agitated from time to
time<00:04:54.850> usually<00:04:55.810> just<00:04:56.230> before<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:56.620> start<00:04:56.890> to

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
time usually just before you start to

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.190 
time usually just before you start to
spray<00:04:57.310> so<00:04:58.180> you<00:04:58.240> make<00:04:58.450> sure<00:04:58.480> that<00:04:58.720> everything

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
spray so you make sure that everything

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.590 
spray so you make sure that everything
is<00:04:59.320> mixed<00:04:59.590> nicely<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.790> you<00:05:00.880> get<00:05:01.090> all<00:05:01.300> the

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
is mixed nicely and you get all the

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.600 
is mixed nicely and you get all the
potential<00:05:02.110> of<00:05:02.230> the<00:05:02.380> oil<00:05:02.500> onto<00:05:02.830> your<00:05:03.160> orchid

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
potential of the oil onto your orchid

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.020 
potential of the oil onto your orchid
now<00:05:04.470> some<00:05:05.470> sources<00:05:05.920> say<00:05:06.430> that<00:05:06.460> it<00:05:06.760> is<00:05:06.910> very

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
now some sources say that it is very

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.210 
now some sources say that it is very
safe<00:05:07.510> for<00:05:07.570> orchids<00:05:08.140> than<00:05:08.380> it<00:05:08.500> is<00:05:08.650> but<00:05:09.010> I<00:05:09.160> would

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
safe for orchids than it is but I would

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.580 
safe for orchids than it is but I would
just<00:05:09.460> like<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.640> mention<00:05:09.940> that<00:05:10.690> if<00:05:11.020> you<00:05:11.080> use<00:05:11.410> it

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
just like to mention that if you use it

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.770 
just like to mention that if you use it
in<00:05:11.710> excess<00:05:12.070> or<00:05:12.310> as<00:05:12.640> a<00:05:12.700> leaf<00:05:13.030> shine<00:05:13.300> or<00:05:13.630> in<00:05:13.750> a

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
in excess or as a leaf shine or in a

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.770 
in excess or as a leaf shine or in a
more<00:05:14.710> concentrated<00:05:15.490> dosage<00:05:15.910> than<00:05:16.120> this<00:05:16.390> it

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
more concentrated dosage than this it

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.170 
more concentrated dosage than this it
can<00:05:16.990> actually<00:05:17.140> suffocate<00:05:17.920> the<00:05:18.730> leaf<00:05:18.940> because

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
can actually suffocate the leaf because

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.600 
can actually suffocate the leaf because
it<00:05:19.540> is<00:05:19.690> an<00:05:19.870> oil<00:05:20.020> so<00:05:20.500> what<00:05:20.830> I<00:05:20.860> intend<00:05:21.280> to<00:05:21.340> do<00:05:21.490> with

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
it is an oil so what I intend to do with

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.240 
it is an oil so what I intend to do with
my<00:05:21.790> cigar<00:05:22.240> kids<00:05:22.510> with<00:05:23.290> my<00:05:23.440> infested<00:05:23.860> orchids

my cigar kids with my infested orchids

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.790 
my cigar kids with my infested orchids
is<00:05:24.400> use<00:05:24.730> it<00:05:24.880> now<00:05:25.030> use<00:05:25.300> it<00:05:25.480> after<00:05:25.930> one<00:05:26.260> week<00:05:26.530> so

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
is use it now use it after one week so

two weeks from then and then just reduce

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.000 
two weeks from then and then just reduce
it<00:05:30.700> regularly<00:05:31.240> once<00:05:31.750> a<00:05:31.900> month<00:05:32.080> in<00:05:32.350> between

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
okay so here are a few of my orchids

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.400 
okay so here are a few of my orchids
already<00:05:41.950> sprayed<00:05:42.280> I've<00:05:42.940> put<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:43.810> mixture<00:05:44.110> in

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
already sprayed I've put the mixture in

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.710 
already sprayed I've put the mixture in
a<00:05:44.440> spray<00:05:44.770> bottle<00:05:44.800> just<00:05:45.460> like<00:05:45.580> this<00:05:45.880> and<00:05:46.210> how<00:05:46.690> I

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
a spray bottle just like this and how I

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.810 
a spray bottle just like this and how I
do<00:05:46.870> things<00:05:47.230> is<00:05:47.470> I<00:05:47.650> try<00:05:47.890> to<00:05:47.950> cover<00:05:48.220> all<00:05:48.550> the

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
do things is I try to cover all the

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.240 
do things is I try to cover all the
surfaces<00:05:49.450> including<00:05:50.350> the<00:05:50.530> underside<00:05:51.040> of<00:05:51.070> the

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
surfaces including the underside of the

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.370 
surfaces including the underside of the
leaf<00:05:51.520> where<00:05:51.940> most<00:05:52.240> bugs<00:05:52.540> are<00:05:52.750> usually<00:05:53.110> hanging

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
leaf where most bugs are usually hanging

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.190 
leaf where most bugs are usually hanging
so<00:05:54.220> they<00:05:54.520> say<00:05:54.850> the<00:05:55.060> mixture<00:05:55.390> is<00:05:55.510> good<00:05:55.750> for<00:05:55.990> 8

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
so they say the mixture is good for 8

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.440 
so they say the mixture is good for 8
hours<00:05:56.620> so<00:05:56.860> try<00:05:57.130> to<00:05:57.190> use<00:05:57.460> it<00:05:57.640> within<00:05:57.820> 8<00:05:58.210> hours

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
hours so try to use it within 8 hours

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.300 
hours so try to use it within 8 hours
because<00:05:58.900> after<00:05:59.320> that<00:05:59.500> it's<00:05:59.710> gonna<00:05:59.860> start<00:06:00.220> to

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
because after that it's gonna start to

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.850 
because after that it's gonna start to
break<00:06:00.580> down<00:06:00.790> and<00:06:01.210> also<00:06:01.480> when<00:06:01.750> you<00:06:01.840> spray<00:06:02.200> just

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
break down and also when you spray just

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.890 
break down and also when you spray just
before<00:06:03.220> you<00:06:03.340> start<00:06:03.640> spraying<00:06:03.940> give<00:06:04.570> it<00:06:04.660> a<00:06:04.690> good

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
before you start spraying give it a good

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.470 
before you start spraying give it a good
shake<00:06:05.230> to<00:06:05.290> mix<00:06:05.620> everything<00:06:05.980> up<00:06:06.480> spray

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
shake to mix everything up spray

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.930 
shake to mix everything up spray
everything<00:06:07.720> and<00:06:08.230> you<00:06:08.440> should<00:06:08.650> be<00:06:08.800> good<00:06:09.220> if<00:06:09.880> you

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
everything and you should be good if you

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.070 
everything and you should be good if you
can't<00:06:10.330> stand<00:06:10.600> the<00:06:10.780> smell

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
can't stand the smell

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.320 
can't stand the smell
then<00:06:11.410> it's<00:06:11.650> great<00:06:12.100> I<00:06:12.340> am<00:06:12.610> having<00:06:12.820> a<00:06:13.030> bit<00:06:13.210> of

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
then it's great I am having a bit of

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.140 
then it's great I am having a bit of
trouble<00:06:13.780> anyway<00:06:14.650> don't<00:06:14.980> inhale<00:06:15.460> this<00:06:15.790> stay

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
trouble anyway don't inhale this stay

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.320 
trouble anyway don't inhale this stay
fairly<00:06:16.600> far<00:06:17.080> from<00:06:17.590> your<00:06:17.740> orchid<00:06:18.220> and<00:06:18.400> don't

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
fairly far from your orchid and don't

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.150 
fairly far from your orchid and don't
spray<00:06:19.630> it<00:06:19.660> in<00:06:19.900> the<00:06:19.930> air<00:06:20.080> like<00:06:20.440> this<00:06:20.620> try<00:06:20.890> to<00:06:20.920> go

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
spray it in the air like this try to go

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.050 
spray it in the air like this try to go
very<00:06:21.460> close<00:06:21.850> to<00:06:22.120> the<00:06:22.210> leaf<00:06:22.390> just<00:06:22.780> like<00:06:22.960> so<00:06:24.060> say

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
very close to the leaf just like so say

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.080 
very close to the leaf just like so say
and<00:06:25.390> that's<00:06:25.750> it<00:06:26.050> so<00:06:26.710> after<00:06:27.130> that<00:06:27.280> be<00:06:27.610> sure<00:06:27.850> that

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
and that's it so after that be sure that

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.140 
and that's it so after that be sure that
you<00:06:28.180> do<00:06:28.390> this<00:06:28.630> when<00:06:29.470> it's<00:06:29.620> pretty<00:06:30.280> warm

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
you do this when it's pretty warm

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.660 
you do this when it's pretty warm
outside<00:06:31.450> let's<00:06:32.020> say<00:06:32.230> I<00:06:32.470> do<00:06:32.950> it<00:06:33.070> in<00:06:33.160> the<00:06:33.280> morning

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
outside let's say I do it in the morning

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.000 
outside let's say I do it in the morning
so<00:06:33.910> the<00:06:34.240> orchids<00:06:34.600> will<00:06:34.870> dry<00:06:35.110> off<00:06:35.140> before

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
so the orchids will dry off before

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.690 
so the orchids will dry off before
nighttime

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
nighttime

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.360 
nighttime
and<00:06:36.760> also<00:06:37.030> when<00:06:37.990> the<00:06:38.140> day<00:06:38.290> is<00:06:38.590> ending<00:06:38.980> check

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
and also when the day is ending check

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.430 
and also when the day is ending check
between<00:06:39.820> the<00:06:39.940> leaves<00:06:40.210> so<00:06:40.780> you<00:06:40.810> see<00:06:41.110> if<00:06:41.230> there's

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
between the leaves so you see if there's

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.560 
between the leaves so you see if there's
any<00:06:41.680> drop<00:06:42.010> still<00:06:42.340> remaining<00:06:42.730> and<00:06:43.090> just<00:06:43.270> take

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 
any drop still remaining and just take

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.390 
any drop still remaining and just take
them<00:06:43.840> with<00:06:44.500> a<00:06:45.000> napkin<00:06:46.000> so<00:06:46.720> that's<00:06:47.380> about<00:06:47.620> it<00:06:48.010> on
