00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.010
 go it's everybody it's gabriel 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.660
 or who as you prefer and 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.030
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.210
 presentation of a new mode then the 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.910
 fashion called tomettes bear so 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.890
 the ultimate tools so tonight leading makes 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.039
 which consists of mixing tools of 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.180
 minecraft to make one that makes 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.350
 several things at the same time 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.720
 katende shui go out a little bit 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.430
 music so here we will start 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.380
 directly so we have the first tool 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.720
 no that is done with an ax and a 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.630
 pick so it does not need to be in 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.460
 diamond it can be in any 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.070
 material so either one drinks often 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.059
 stone anything makes it craft 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.850
 it's very simple it just takes 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.730
 mix the two and that makes us a 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.910
 diamond pacs do not have that for pierrick 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.399
 axis and axis so that makes diamond pacs 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.390
 so if we look at it cut the 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.450
 super fast trees 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.499
 frankly I'm creative too 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:15.049
 so it'll cut the trees enough 

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:17.179
 quickly and it will also broke 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.639
 lapierre extremely quickly 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.209
 so it's super useful I think you 

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:27.920
 have a little understood the principle of mode 

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:31.099
 then we draw and bella what 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.979
 will we do a new one so for pic 

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:35.899
 axis and hot want it scary and 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.539
 so this one she will cut the hunger 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.549
 she will destroy the earth super fast and 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.899
 mined so it's pretty handy when we 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.279
 makes big constructions or by 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.639
 example of stone constructions and 

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:45.960
 Of wood 

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:49.500
 In this case, we take 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.130
 a tax is like that it's going a lot 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.130
 faster 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.180
 so then the last normal routis 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:01.680
 this is this one so there loose want and 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.770
 lake what will do a chax show each 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.810
 stadium so that's the same thing 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.869
 breaks the ground quickly and intersect 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.709
 the trees and so then one to the tool 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.780
 ultimate so he here the three together 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.100
 so it's a bit shit and I find but 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.290
 it's always cool so we're actually going 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.040
 right place and the three tools which 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.330
 will make us a diamond ultimate and a 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.930
 once we have that we do not need to 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.180
 nothing else 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.980
 so we just we break all blocks 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.140
 super quickly we do everything we 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.780
 we want to fight the balls 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.100
 so that's the ultimate diamond 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.080
 so he also remains one last 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.130
 tool that we can do that so this one 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.519
 it's not a tool in fact it's a 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.569
 armed 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.080
 so that's combining the going to combine or 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.760
 could have expected 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.970
 that's sorry I made a small mistake 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.730
 so we're going to combine the bow and the end of 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.590
 sales we'll see what's going to give I 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.590
 take the arrows up 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.719
 here and soapy do like this 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.689
 this is going to do a tip of a probe 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.439
 so for balance is beautiful is that it 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.769
 actually makes 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:11.439
 well, it's going to hurt the fashions 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.290
 so like a sword so here for the shot 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:18.250
 it's bronze and we can also 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.450
 shoot with so basically it's a one can 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.579
 do the same so if we take by 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.650
 example a marc a diamond sword 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.510
 is going to make a diamond jump and that's it 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.060
 really the best weapon we can 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.769
 to have with this mode so that's all 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.579
 for this fashion presentation I believe 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.170
 that you understood it's a mode 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.450
 super cool it can accelerate soon 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.930
 the constructions if you want when 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.799
 even played in survival so that's so 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.239
 that's all so I'll put all the 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.500
 links in the inscription description 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.239
 sorry I really hope he will have you 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.840
 more and we'll meet again next time 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.840
 to go
