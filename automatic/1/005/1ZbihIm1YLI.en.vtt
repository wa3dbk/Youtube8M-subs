program was different

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.450 
program was different
mainly<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.620> wasn't<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.190> wasn't<00:00:50.309> just

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
mainly because it wasn't it wasn't just

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.189

an<00:00:50.579> individual<00:00:51.120> exercise<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.050> was<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
an individual exercise it was a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.290 
an individual exercise it was a
team-building<00:00:52.920> exercise<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.850> everybody

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
team-building exercise that everybody

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.029

had<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> part<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:57.320> really<00:00:58.320> tested<00:00:58.770> my

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
had a part in it really tested my

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.270 
had a part in it really tested my
leadership<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.730> every<00:01:00.359> aspect<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:04.159> it's<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
leadership in every aspect of it it's a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.730 
leadership in every aspect of it it's a
great<00:01:05.489> team-building<00:01:06.020> exercise<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.320> I

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
great team-building exercise and I

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.560 
great team-building exercise and I
thought<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.400> ended<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.939> such<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.420> positive<00:01:10.049> note

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.450 

attack<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.560> think<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.159> learned

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
attack and I think we really learned

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.240 
attack and I think we really learned
something<00:01:17.700> about<00:01:18.509> our<00:01:18.990> team<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.439> about<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
something about our team and about the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.070 
something about our team and about the
leadership<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.850> our<00:01:21.000> team<00:01:21.210> now<00:01:21.720> what<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.049> your

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
leadership of our team now what was your

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.920 
leadership of our team now what was your
time<00:01:23.119> there<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.210> go<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:27.479> great<00:01:27.689> thing<00:01:27.900> about

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
time there you go the great thing about

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.929 
time there you go the great thing about
our<00:01:28.409> fall<00:01:28.710> break<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.220> at<00:01:29.310> Notre<00:01:29.490> Dame<00:01:29.579> we

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
our fall break here at Notre Dame we

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.359 
our fall break here at Notre Dame we
have<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> one-week<00:01:30.720> fall<00:01:30.990> break<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.189> go

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
have a one-week fall break so we can go

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.280 
have a one-week fall break so we can go
into<00:01:32.549> double<00:01:32.970> sessions<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.869> think<00:01:34.140> it's

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
into double sessions and I think it's

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.560 
into double sessions and I think it's
during<00:01:34.619> those<00:01:34.770> fall<00:01:35.070> break<00:01:35.369> weeks<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.329> we

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
during those fall break weeks that we

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.780 
during those fall break weeks that we
have<00:01:36.689> made<00:01:36.900> great<00:01:37.170> great<00:01:37.650> progress<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.610> our

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.370 
have made great great progress in our
program

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.749 

once<00:01:42.380> practice<00:01:42.740> started<00:01:43.070> I<00:01:43.250> think<00:01:43.310> we<00:01:43.610> all

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
once practice started I think we all

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.490 
once practice started I think we all
just<00:01:43.790> got<00:01:44.150> excited<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.990> get<00:01:45.080> on<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.259> court

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
just got excited to get on the court

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.749

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
with one another and then our

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.080 
with one another and then our
competitive<00:01:47.630> nature<00:01:47.960> just<00:01:48.439> picked<00:01:48.710> up<00:01:52.090> with
