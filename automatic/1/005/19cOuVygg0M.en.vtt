00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
it this weekend but some dude built a

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.600 
it this weekend but some dude built a
nest<00:02:51.760> in<00:02:51.970> there<00:02:52.150> it's<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.480> little<00:02:52.840> red<00:02:52.990> squirrel

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
for us this weekend I think it's because

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.660 
for us this weekend I think it's because
of<00:03:08.200> all<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.590> hunters<00:03:08.920> around<00:03:09.130> in<00:03:09.460> all<00:03:09.580> the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
of all the hunters around in all the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.930 
of all the hunters around in all the
gunshots<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.980> has<00:03:11.980> all<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.370> creatures

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
gunshots and has all the creatures

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.260 
gunshots and has all the creatures
hiding<00:03:13.680> but<00:03:14.680> I'm<00:03:14.890> sure<00:03:15.130> next<00:03:15.430> time<00:03:16.350> the

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
hiding but I'm sure next time the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.490 
hiding but I'm sure next time the
creatures<00:03:19.270> will<00:03:19.420> be<00:03:19.510> back<00:03:19.720> meaner<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.200> bigger

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
creatures will be back meaner and bigger

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.060 
creatures will be back meaner and bigger
than<00:03:20.560> ever<00:03:21.390> after<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.480> hunters<00:03:22.810> leave<00:03:23.070> now

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
than ever after the hunters leave now

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.130 
than ever after the hunters leave now
while<00:03:24.310> that's<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:24.670> for<00:03:24.850> this<00:03:24.940> time<00:03:25.239> take<00:03:25.930> care
