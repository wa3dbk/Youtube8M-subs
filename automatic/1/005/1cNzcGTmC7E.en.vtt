just wait until it's done and there we
go<00:03:06.030> we've<00:03:06.959> got<00:03:06.989> obsidian<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.769> make

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
go we've got obsidian and you can make

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.729 
go we've got obsidian and you can make
it<00:03:11.069> however<00:03:11.250> far<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.209> want<00:03:12.599> it<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.260> be<00:03:13.410> like
