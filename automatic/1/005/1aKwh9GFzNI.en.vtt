doesn't have the kind of typical retro
tail<00:01:00.160> that<00:01:00.340> you<00:01:00.399> see<00:01:00.670> you<00:01:00.820> know<00:01:00.910> with<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.120> big

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
tail that you see you know with the big

tail that you see you know with the big
V<00:01:01.480> sticking<00:01:01.899> out<00:01:02.050> like<00:01:02.200> that<00:01:02.380> this<00:01:02.890> helps<00:01:03.250> a

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
V sticking out like that this helps a

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.740 
V sticking out like that this helps a
little<00:01:03.550> bit<00:01:03.730> of<00:01:03.820> release<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:04.360> it's<00:01:04.479> you<00:01:04.659> know

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
little bit of release and it's you know

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.060 
little bit of release and it's you know
a<00:01:04.780> little<00:01:04.930> bit<00:01:05.140> closer<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.620> what<00:01:05.740> you<00:01:05.830> might<00:01:05.920> be

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
a little bit closer to what you might be

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.350 
a little bit closer to what you might be
riding<00:01:06.250> on<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.520> short<00:01:06.760> board<00:01:06.970> if<00:01:07.090> you<00:01:07.180> have<00:01:07.210> a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
riding on a short board if you have a

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.590 
riding on a short board if you have a
rounded<00:01:08.229> square<00:01:08.380> squash<00:01:08.950> tail<00:01:09.190> a<00:01:09.540> couple<00:01:10.540> of

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
rounded square squash tail a couple of

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.790 
rounded square squash tail a couple of
things<00:01:10.780> about<00:01:10.870> this<00:01:11.080> board<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.440> I<00:01:11.500> think<00:01:11.680> are

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
things about this board that I think are

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.730 
things about this board that I think are
really<00:01:11.890> cool<00:01:12.159> it's<00:01:12.760> got<00:01:13.000> all<00:01:13.420> of<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:13.810> kind<00:01:14.680> of

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
really cool it's got all of the kind of

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.530 
really cool it's got all of the kind of
speed<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:16.229> ease<00:01:17.229> of<00:01:17.470> wave<00:01:17.950> catching

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
speed and ease of wave catching

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.399 
speed and ease of wave catching
characteristics<00:01:19.540> has<00:01:19.659> got<00:01:19.810> lots<00:01:20.080> of<00:01:20.170> foam

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
characteristics has got lots of foam

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.580 
characteristics has got lots of foam
throughout<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:22.630> got<00:01:22.870> very<00:01:23.409> little

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
throughout and it's got very little

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.230 
throughout and it's got very little
rocker<00:01:23.860> as<00:01:24.070> you<00:01:24.159> can<00:01:24.310> see<00:01:24.520> it's<00:01:24.729> a<00:01:24.790> pretty<00:01:25.000> flat

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
rocker as you can see it's a pretty flat

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.590 
rocker as you can see it's a pretty flat
board<00:01:25.540> throughout<00:01:26.020> but<00:01:26.710> what<00:01:27.400> Bing<00:01:28.210> has<00:01:28.390> done

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
board throughout but what Bing has done

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.899 
board throughout but what Bing has done
with<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:29.080> rails<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:29.979> deck<00:01:30.400> shape<00:01:30.700> I

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
with the rails and the deck shape I

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.539 
with the rails and the deck shape I
think<00:01:31.150> gives<00:01:31.420> it<00:01:31.600> that<00:01:32.310> performance<00:01:33.310> kick

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
think gives it that performance kick

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.240 
think gives it that performance kick
which<00:01:33.729> makes<00:01:33.940> it<00:01:34.060> just<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.330> really<00:01:34.600> fantastic

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
which makes it just a really fantastic

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.710 
which makes it just a really fantastic
small<00:01:36.250> wave<00:01:36.430> board<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.790> ride<00:01:36.940> you've<00:01:37.540> got

small wave board to ride you've got

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.630 
small wave board to ride you've got
these<00:01:37.840> really<00:01:38.110> sharp<00:01:38.470> nice<00:01:38.860> beveled<00:01:39.369> rails

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
these really sharp nice beveled rails

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.700 
these really sharp nice beveled rails

coming up almost into a step deck and

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.480 
coming up almost into a step deck and
then<00:01:41.890> you've<00:01:41.979> got<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.159> concave<00:01:42.610> here<00:01:42.940> now<00:01:43.780> that

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
then you've got a concave here now that

up to a bit of foam throughout here and

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.640 
up to a bit of foam throughout here and
throughout<00:01:49.540> here<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.140> then<00:01:50.229> a<00:01:50.260> concave

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
throughout here and then a concave

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.899 
throughout here and then a concave
through<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:50.979> center<00:01:51.250> it<00:01:51.610> means<00:01:51.760> you're

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
through the center it means you're

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.280 
through the center it means you're
getting<00:01:52.119> a<00:01:52.150> lot<00:01:52.270> of<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.420> paddle<00:01:52.960> power<00:01:53.110> and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
getting a lot of the paddle power and

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.240 
getting a lot of the paddle power and
you're<00:01:53.380> getting<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.590> little<00:01:53.799> speed<00:01:54.010> that<00:01:54.159> you

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
you're getting a little speed that you

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.710 
you're getting a little speed that you
get<00:01:54.430> with<00:01:54.549> fish<00:01:54.850> but<00:01:55.060> your<00:01:55.390> feet<00:01:55.540> are<00:01:55.659> a<00:01:55.689> little

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
get with fish but your feet are a little

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.420 
get with fish but your feet are a little
bit<00:01:56.020> down<00:01:56.170> closer<00:01:56.439> to<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.650> water<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:57.100> you<00:01:57.159> feel

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
bit down closer to the water so you feel

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.160 
bit down closer to the water so you feel
a<00:01:57.460> little<00:01:57.580> bit<00:01:57.729> more<00:01:57.939> connected<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:59.049> can

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
a little bit more connected and you can

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.960 
a little bit more connected and you can
turn<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.470> board<00:01:59.590> harder<00:01:59.979> so<00:02:00.460> this<00:02:00.610> goes<00:02:00.820> from

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
turn the board harder so this goes from

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.460 
turn the board harder so this goes from
rail<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.240> rail<00:02:01.420> really<00:02:02.020> easily<00:02:02.290> the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
rail to rail really easily the

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.800 
rail to rail really easily the
transitions<00:02:02.950> are<00:02:03.040> fantastic<00:02:03.640> overall<00:02:04.479> really

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810
