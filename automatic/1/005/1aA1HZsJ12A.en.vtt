00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:05.029
 the next one is practically the same 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.299
 here in this part we already remove the 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.110
 hose that was in the venture 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.680
 then in case your head 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.320
 then do not have this piece here 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.970
 you can put it in the bottom to 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.620
 that passes through the blades and in this way 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.420
 it destroys a little bit more and you take the 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.480
 winner thinner sheets this simply 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.820
 we are going to be a syringe we connect 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.189
 to our co2 system 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.880
 this comes from the bottle and we're going to do 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.880
 a small fold 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.920
 to enter into our filter 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.620
 trying not to grab the blades not 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.329
 we always leave that way 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.750
 we are in an approach to see what 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.750
 you can appreciate 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.559
 as here it is possible to notice the needle 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.850
 it enters the filter but must have 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.910
 in mind that you should not grab 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.030
 ok blades once this is done we will 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.690
 give him 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.690
 to co2 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.619
 and how can the bubble realize 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.080
 it comes out much thinner than if we take it 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.760
 of the venturi 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.760
 now coming out quite a few bubbles 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.190
 but we make an approach 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.440
 almost not enough to notice but those who 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.860
 they come out are very very thin 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.820
 as you see apart from that all the pseudo what 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.220
 spread all over the aquarium 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.950
 it is also very effective equal what 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.120
 same five media with the last system 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.000
 is that it will 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.500
 a lot of current but it's in a very 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.060
 effective simply this one puts a 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.380
 example as an example for aquariums 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.050
 large where there is not much problem 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.300
 that there is a little current in a no 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.130
 I do not recommend it if I return to 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.000
 repeat again here where the 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.160
 output of co2 is passed to the filter and 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.250
 now from the entrance to the filter the same 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.040
 power head blades are going to break 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.900
 the bubbles in the sea so in 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.420
 smaller bubbles 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.250
 and when that is going to help you 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.250
 dissolves more aesthetically 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.910
 and we get to notice a lot because they are 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:39.620
 too thin we are going to open a little 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.620
 so they can see how it comes out even more 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.270
 as more quantity comes out 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.790
 ok all other example that I put them 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.790
 we go with the next
