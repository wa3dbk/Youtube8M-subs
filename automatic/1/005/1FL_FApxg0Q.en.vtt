00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
mat shorts market I think the bookies

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.880 
mat shorts market I think the bookies
got<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.060> pretty<00:01:45.299> well<00:01:45.570> sign<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:45.960> okay

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
got this one pretty well sign up okay

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.050 
got this one pretty well sign up okay
and<00:01:47.189> what<00:01:47.340> do<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.460> think<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> chances<00:01:47.729> of

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and what do you think the chances of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.560 
and what do you think the chances of
this<00:01:48.180> ending<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.630> draw<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:49.110> full-time<00:01:50.570> I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
this ending in a draw of full-time I

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.210 
this ending in a draw of full-time I
think<00:01:52.229> both<00:01:52.409> teams<00:01:52.439> will<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.829> looking<00:01:53.009> to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
think both teams will be looking to

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.429 
think both teams will be looking to
avoid<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.670> draw<00:01:53.939> simply<00:01:54.299> because<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:55.320> know

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
avoid a draw simply because you know

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.380 
avoid a draw simply because you know
Costa<00:01:56.369> Rica<00:01:56.670> certainly<00:01:57.000> went<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.180> four

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
Costa Rica certainly went to four

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.550 
Costa Rica certainly went to four
hundred<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.750> twenty<00:01:57.990> minutes<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
hundred and twenty minutes and the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.990 
hundred and twenty minutes and the
Netherlands<00:01:59.040> they've<00:01:59.250> got<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.759> last

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
Netherlands they've got it in the last

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.789 
Netherlands they've got it in the last
last<00:02:00.329> minute<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.079> stress<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
last minute and the stress of that is

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.410 
last minute and the stress of that is
going<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.219> weighing<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:02.640> them<00:02:02.820> they<00:02:03.270> also

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
going to be weighing on them they also

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.060 
going to be weighing on them they also
played<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.810> very<00:02:04.020> hot<00:02:04.200> conditions<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.860> think

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
played in very hot conditions so I think

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.469 
played in very hot conditions so I think
both<00:02:05.250> teams<00:02:05.280> want<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.700> get<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:05.939> one<00:02:06.119> over<00:02:06.149> in

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
both teams want to get this one over in

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.540 
both teams want to get this one over in
19<00:02:06.810> minutes<00:02:06.960> I'd<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:07.890> very<00:02:07.920> surprised<00:02:08.429> it

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
19 minutes I'd be very surprised it

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.580 
19 minutes I'd be very surprised it
actually<00:02:08.789> went<00:02:08.910> 2-2<00:02:09.750> draw<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.229> extra<00:02:10.440> time

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
definitely looking towards the under 2.5

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.640 
definitely looking towards the under 2.5
on<00:02:41.950> this<00:02:42.100> one<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.310> mean<00:02:42.630> over<00:02:43.630> 2.5<00:02:44.170> i<00:02:44.230> think<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.620> a

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
on this one I mean over 2.5 i think is a

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.200 
on this one I mean over 2.5 i think is a
bit<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.040> stretch<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.580> mean<00:02:45.820> these<00:02:45.970> two

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
bit of a stretch I mean these two

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.420 
bit of a stretch I mean these two
attitude<00:02:46.810> attacking<00:02:47.800> sites<00:02:48.010> but<00:02:48.190> they<00:02:48.310> both

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
attitude attacking sites but they both

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.100 
attitude attacking sites but they both
like<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.790> counter-attack<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.660> think<00:02:49.870> it's

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
like to counter-attack so I think it's

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.630 
like to counter-attack so I think it's
going<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.290> be<00:02:50.350> difficult<00:02:50.710> for<00:02:50.950> them<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.220> find

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
going to be difficult for them to find

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.250 
going to be difficult for them to find
this<00:02:51.730> place<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.150> operate<00:02:52.450> properly<00:02:52.660> yeah

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
this place and operate properly yeah

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.620 
this place and operate properly yeah
that's<00:02:53.710> priced<00:02:53.920> at<00:02:54.070> 1.8<00:02:54.730> there<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.600> a

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
that's priced at 1.8 there is that a

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.230 
that's priced at 1.8 there is that a
good<00:02:55.690> bet<00:02:55.990> to<00:02:56.020> thing<00:02:56.350> inside<00:02:56.500> good<00:02:56.740> odds<00:02:57.240> I'd

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
good bet to thing inside good odds I'd

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.850 
good bet to thing inside good odds I'd
like<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.540> little<00:02:58.900> bit<00:02:59.020> higher<00:02:59.170> there's<00:02:59.710> always

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
like a little bit higher there's always

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.790 
like a little bit higher there's always
but<00:03:00.250> 1.8<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:01.390> know<00:03:01.510> reasonable<00:03:02.020> for<00:03:02.260> me<00:03:02.290> yeah

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
but 1.8 you know reasonable for me yeah

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.520 
but 1.8 you know reasonable for me yeah
can<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.070> see<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.460> line<00:03:03.610> moving<00:03:03.880> at<00:03:04.060> all<00:03:04.530> we

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
can you see that line moving at all we

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.110 
can you see that line moving at all we
have<00:03:05.680> seen<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:05.890> lot<00:03:06.100> of<00:03:06.160> movement<00:03:06.790> in<00:03:06.880> these

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
have seen a lot of movement in these

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.390 
have seen a lot of movement in these
designs<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.720> think<00:03:08.590> it's<00:03:08.830> probably<00:03:08.950> best<00:03:09.280> to

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
designs I think it's probably best to

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.830 
designs I think it's probably best to
wait<00:03:09.610> until<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:10.120> day<00:03:10.270> we'll<00:03:10.480> see<00:03:10.630> what<00:03:10.750> the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
wait until the day we'll see what the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.230 
wait until the day we'll see what the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240

it<00:03:14.740> could<00:03:14.860> go<00:03:15.010> up<00:03:15.130> a<00:03:15.220> little<00:03:15.310> bit<00:03:15.580> but<00:03:15.820> I<00:03:16.090> think

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
it could go up a little bit but I think

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.000 
it could go up a little bit but I think
at<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.840> moment<00:03:16.870> it's<00:03:17.290> probably<00:03:17.530> gonna<00:03:17.650> stable

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
at the moment it's probably gonna stable

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.010 
at the moment it's probably gonna stable
is<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.640> may<00:03:18.910> even<00:03:18.940> go<00:03:19.270> down<00:03:19.300> a<00:03:19.510> little<00:03:19.570> bit<00:03:19.840> more

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
is it may even go down a little bit more

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.050 
is it may even go down a little bit more
