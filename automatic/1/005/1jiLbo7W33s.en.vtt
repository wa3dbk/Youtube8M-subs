from<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.700> way<00:02:02.880> they<00:02:03.090> move

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
from this but this is the way they move

the<00:02:03.810> way<00:02:03.930> they<00:02:03.960> do<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.409> type<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.649> things

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
the way they do the type of things

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.590 
the way they do the type of things
that's<00:02:05.189> how<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> was<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.729> all<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.880> NBA<00:02:06.299> live
