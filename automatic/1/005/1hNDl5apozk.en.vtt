we<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:40.949> also<00:00:41.629> allow<00:00:42.629> him<00:00:43.019> to<00:00:43.260> try<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.589> escape

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
we can also allow him to try and escape

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.340 
we can also allow him to try and escape
from<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> locks<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.809> instance<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.260> he's

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
from the locks so for instance as he's

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.740 
from the locks so for instance as he's
goes<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.680> get<00:00:46.769> out<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.040> a<00:00:47.100> lock<00:00:47.540> he<00:00:48.540> puts

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
goes to get out of a lock he puts

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.140 
goes to get out of a lock he puts
himself<00:00:48.900> into<00:00:49.470> the<00:00:49.559> next<00:00:49.800> lock<00:00:49.980> which<00:00:50.909> puts

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
himself into the next lock which puts

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.210 
himself into the next lock which puts
himself<00:00:51.269> into<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.780> next<00:00:52.019> lock<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> next

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
himself into the next lock and the next

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:01.340 
himself into the next lock and the next
one<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:53.909> next<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.150> out<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.600> it<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:01.260> I've

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
one and the next one out of it so I've

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.619 
one and the next one out of it so I've
got<00:01:01.470> a<00:01:01.500> fluid<00:01:01.979> way<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.850> using<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
got a fluid way of using it as a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.140 
got a fluid way of using it as a
sensitivity<00:01:04.379> type<00:01:04.890> training<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.670> however<00:01:06.030> he

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
sensitivity type training as however he

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.280 
sensitivity type training as however he
goes<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.540> get<00:01:06.689> out<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:09.110> he's<00:01:10.110> actually

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
goes to get out of it he's actually

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.020 
goes to get out of it he's actually
trying<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.740> get<00:01:10.890> out<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:14.939> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
trying to get out so as you can see it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.390 
trying to get out so as you can see it
becomes<00:01:15.360> more<00:01:16.159> intuitive<00:01:17.299> so<00:01:18.299> how<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.810> in

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
becomes more intuitive so how do they in

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.649 
becomes more intuitive so how do they in
so<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.490> idea<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.240> he<00:01:21.330> makes<00:01:21.509> his

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
so the idea of that when he makes his

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.810 
so the idea of that when he makes his
attack<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:23.070> wedge<00:01:23.810> strike<00:01:24.810> however<00:01:25.799> now<00:01:26.640> we're

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
attack in wedge strike however now we're

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.300 
attack in wedge strike however now we're
even<00:01:26.970> pushing<00:01:27.420> bodies<00:01:27.930> as<00:01:28.200> we're<00:01:28.409> moving<00:01:28.590> so

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
even pushing bodies as we're moving so

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.720 
even pushing bodies as we're moving so
the<00:01:29.400> idea<00:01:29.730> of<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.090> wage<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:31.080> spiral<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.950> turn

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
the idea of the wage the spiral the turn

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.730 
the idea of the wage the spiral the turn
there<00:01:33.390> might<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.659> even<00:01:33.990> from<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.440> as<00:01:34.560> he<00:01:34.710> goes

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
there might be even from here as he goes

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.000 
there might be even from here as he goes
to<00:01:34.920> get<00:01:35.280> out<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:36.420> change<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:37.050> he<00:01:37.680> goes<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
to get out we now change it he goes to

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.520 
to get out we now change it he goes to
throw<00:01:38.159> me<00:01:38.690> that<00:01:39.690> puts<00:01:39.900> him<00:01:40.050> into<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.440> one

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.870 

so<00:01:45.530> if<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.680> comes<00:01:45.830> from<00:01:46.070> an<00:01:46.250> attack<00:01:46.549> we<00:01:46.700> can

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
so if it comes from an attack we can

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.910 
so if it comes from an attack we can
move<00:01:47.060> from<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.450> wedge<00:01:48.070> spiral<00:01:49.240> into<00:01:50.240> striking

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
move from the wedge spiral into striking

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.780 
move from the wedge spiral into striking
interlocking<00:01:51.920> into<00:01:52.700> controlling<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:55.520> gives

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
interlocking into controlling it gives

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.690 
interlocking into controlling it gives
that<00:01:56.060> bit<00:01:56.440> we<00:01:57.440> can<00:01:57.560> then<00:01:57.710> go<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:57.860> to<00:01:58.369> clinch

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
that bit we can then go to to clinch

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.450 
that bit we can then go to to clinch
work<00:01:58.970> we<00:01:59.299> can<00:01:59.479> go<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.750> the<00:02:00.500> throwing<00:02:00.950> we<00:02:01.130> can<00:02:01.310> go

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
work we can go to the throwing we can go

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.030 
work we can go to the throwing we can go
down<00:02:01.700> onto<00:02:01.909> ground<00:02:02.360> work<00:02:02.630> we<00:02:03.440> can<00:02:03.619> then<00:02:03.770> step

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
down onto ground work we can then step

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.219 
down onto ground work we can then step
away<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:04.550> we<00:02:04.670> can<00:02:04.850> take<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.270> as<00:02:05.390> stand<00:02:05.720> up<00:02:05.990> as

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
away and we can take it as stand up as

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.529 
away and we can take it as stand up as
boxing<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.100> fighting<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:07.880> so<00:02:08.000> on<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:08.390> we've

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
boxing and fighting and so on so we've

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.830 
boxing and fighting and so on so we've
got<00:02:08.690> all<00:02:08.810> ranges<00:02:09.319> or<00:02:09.500> distances<00:02:10.130> but<00:02:10.340> still

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
got all ranges or distances but still

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.380 
got all ranges or distances but still
the<00:02:11.840> same<00:02:12.140> eight<00:02:12.680> principles<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.580> same<00:02:13.760> ideas

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
the same eight principles the same ideas

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.660 
the same eight principles the same ideas
