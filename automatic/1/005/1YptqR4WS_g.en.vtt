00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.410
 hair dry kubica nursery school 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.120
 I will be with you today, I vote 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.210
 super powerful for this type of hair 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.400
 and a technique to the method be it account 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.789
 that they max calls locke then I go 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.789
 learn 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.270
 this way of applying a rotation 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.680
 little bit of band makes it last 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.510
 for much longer with hair and 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.610
 enter more deeply 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.980
 with this it is indicated for hair 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.810
 super dry curly curly 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.460
 I'll explain the kitchen about it and 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.050
 I'll do it from my mother too. 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.809
 my mother's hair for as long as I 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.489
 take care it's a message he's either I do not know 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.860
 explain what happens through it 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.440
 He's funny will like you. 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.210
 I'll do it and talk to you later. 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.180
 to see that in the difference that always 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.570
 makes even more difference by starting with 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.750
 follow the loc means liquid oil and 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.390
 cream and that's one thing my hair 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.940
 the first step is you wash your hair 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.770
 with shampoo and remove any excess of 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.979
 water with a towel the more you 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.950
 can take over best 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.540
 hence from the liquid phase L and 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.540
 You need to use some liquid. 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.210
 moisturizer I've always used pb pontal but 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.360
 you can use any liquid extended 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.670
 that is moisturizing 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.289
 There you go to the hair and apply wick to 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.289
 wick and leave it for 10 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.489
 after ten minutes he passed the 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.470
 that the part of the oil 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.540
 you can use any where you want 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.060
 coconut oil olive oil garlic 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.830
 any kind of oil you want and 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.989
 will do the same thing will separate the 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.629
 wick to wick hair will apply by 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.940
 top of the positive bottle liquid 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.670
 I come back to make the hair absorb well. 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.790
 if you look and let it act with another 15 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.790
 minutes 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.480
 the last part is from the ones and that is the 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.820
 cream and you can pick a 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.710
 hydration mask you want and 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.860
 apply over the oil of the same 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.170
 jeitinho is not envy innovating with everything 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.640
 Hair Care Discovered Everything 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.130
 This is what I will be able to 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.440
 then you 'll leave it for another 500 or so 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:20.410
 time indicated in the most expensive and there it is 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.410
 rinse and hair is wonderful 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.910
 O 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.530
 It's easy though it's a bit of a process 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.300
 Late 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.000
 I think it's a lot better for you to sing 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.970
 but it 's an overcrowding like that on a single day 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.919
 even if it takes about 40 and 50 minutes 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.509
 that making dates are recordings of the 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.669
 attraction you do not want to see 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.009
 so I only do this your hair is 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.169
 very unified curly curly also 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:31.270
 benefited greatly from this technique 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.039
 This is always a table more or less. 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.020
 It's not so much there. 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.849
 Looked heavy will be weird for 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.990
 This is not one of mine I take care of my 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.330
 Mom and I hope you have 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.310

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.240

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:48.069
 easier and picture of what has been asking

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:51.819

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.039
 what he knows 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.110
 nobody knows everything so it's always monica 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.120
 to tell a little difference 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.889
 of what you also know by someone else 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.020
 We want to know that according to Lieutenant 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.039
