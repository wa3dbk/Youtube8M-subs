00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.420
 about 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.739
 boy 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.709
 difficult day for us thought rest and 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.470
 well go car turns out not 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:00.459
 rested today we had a mountain marathon 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.189
 546 kilometers and we twice climbed 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.900
 we are at the special stage at mark 4 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:08.140
 104 thousand joiners 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.000
 atmospheric gasoline engine is not traveling 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.019
 lost a lot of time well, like a car 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.700
 rides but she rides 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.620
 forty fifty kilometers an hour 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.040
 our whole class turbo diesel engines 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.010
 He put us in just like a standoff. 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.590
 and vexed 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.360
 Yes, in principle, there are no serious problems 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.410
 let's hope tomorrow or the day after 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.950
 hinged stopping distance was very 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.380
 long and in one place 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:41.470
 probably just miraculously did not fall in 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.470
 open car almost two wheels 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:52.850
 we bring practically 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:55.390
 this is exactly 10 12 we carried the project or 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:59.540
 it turned out that we are back on track 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:02.540
 we just got to camp 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.690
 three hours and a half hours restoring 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.820
 the car made him so that he could 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.530
 continue driving yourself if 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.390
 if we were dragged by a technical 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.270
 we use all possibilities to 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.510
 to continue the race today happened 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:26.990
 accident on the highway 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:31.040
 it's my mistake I chose a big one too 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:35.180
 pace in these mountain party turns 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:38.800
 serpentines these speeds with which we 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.800
 drove were critical
