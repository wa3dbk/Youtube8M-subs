00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
one that you could just push the TARDIS

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.860 
one that you could just push the TARDIS
in<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.010> flew<00:02:32.190> away<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.730> now<00:02:33.030> fixed<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.720> just

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
the computer monitor lines on the back

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.040 
the computer monitor lines on the back
get<00:03:26.160> all<00:03:26.310> distorted<00:03:26.880> everything<00:03:27.480> as<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.810> hit

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
you can see the TARDIS is rotating at a

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.270 
you can see the TARDIS is rotating at a
bit<00:03:36.330> of<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.570> steep<00:03:36.930> angle<00:03:37.170> I'm<00:03:37.590> not<00:03:37.770> sure<00:03:38.040> what

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
bit of a steep angle I'm not sure what

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.680 
bit of a steep angle I'm not sure what
you'll<00:03:38.400> freak<00:03:38.640> was<00:03:38.760> planning<00:03:39.060> on<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.270> but<00:03:39.510> as

Alliance to the nearest angled a 90

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.010 
Alliance to the nearest angled a 90
degree<00:03:46.470> angle<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:47.240> it's<00:03:48.240> taser<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.959> you

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
degree angle and it's taser and you

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.600 
degree angle and it's taser and you
can't<00:03:49.170> push<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.500> but<00:03:49.980> as<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:51.030> saw<00:03:51.240> before<00:03:52.610> yeah
