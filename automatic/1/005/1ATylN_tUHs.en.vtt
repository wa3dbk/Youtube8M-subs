00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
rounds in a row and it's pretty exciting

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.389 
rounds in a row and it's pretty exciting
so<00:00:39.629> why<00:00:39.989> are<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.140> sure<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.440> viewers<00:00:41.040> how<00:00:41.309> it

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
so why are you sure the viewers how it

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.819 
so why are you sure the viewers how it
works<00:00:41.579> yeah<00:00:41.910> sure<00:00:42.410> basically<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> deck<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
works yeah sure basically the deck and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.590 
works yeah sure basically the deck and
kill<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.160> turn<00:00:44.340> three<00:00:44.579> or<00:00:44.670> four<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.420> kill

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
kill on turn three or four it can kill

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.900 
kill on turn three or four it can kill
as<00:00:45.690> fast<00:00:45.899> as<00:00:46.050> turn<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.620> well<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:46.950> generally

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
as fast as turn to as well but generally

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.610 
as fast as turn to as well but generally
kill<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.300> turn<00:00:48.480> three<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.750> four<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:51.620> right

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
kill on turn three and four and right

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.869 
kill on turn three and four and right
here<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.160> an<00:00:53.250> optimal<00:00:53.640> hand

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
here this is like an optimal hand

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.590 
here this is like an optimal hand
because<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.129> most<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.030> your<00:00:57.059> combo<00:00:57.480> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
because you have most of your combo you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.060 
because you have most of your combo you
have<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> Warrens<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> Conn<00:00:58.859> de<00:00:58.949> t

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
have the Warrens you have the Conn de t

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.520 
have the Warrens you have the Conn de t
so<00:00:59.969> what<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> would<00:01:00.690> do<00:01:00.870> first<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.260> probably

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
so what I would do first is probably

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.429 
so what I would do first is probably
just<00:01:01.680> play<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> land<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.719> I<00:01:03.719> actually<00:01:03.899> wouldn't

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
just play a land and I actually wouldn't

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.370 
just play a land and I actually wouldn't
cast<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.670> prospector<00:01:06.210> here<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.930> actually

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
cast the prospector here I actually

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.140 
cast the prospector here I actually
wouldn't<00:01:07.740> cast<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.189> prospector<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> think

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
wouldn't cast a prospector here I think

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.120 
wouldn't cast a prospector here I think
that's<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.479> big<00:01:09.869> mistake<00:01:10.020> people<00:01:10.350> make<00:01:10.470> you

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that's a big mistake people make you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.710 
that's a big mistake people make you
wanna<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.090> type<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.299> hand<00:01:12.570> you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
wanna if you have this type of hand you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.000 
wanna if you have this type of hand you
want<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.990> set<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.860> go

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
warrants for six on turn three so what I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.749 
warrants for six on turn three so what I
would<00:01:16.650> actually<00:01:16.799> was<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.310> ship<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> term

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
produced exactly so I'm basically just

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.970 
produced exactly so I'm basically just
going<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.600> cast<00:02:40.810> these<00:02:40.959> get<00:02:41.230> more<00:02:41.410> mate<00:02:41.590> war

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
going to cast these get more mate war

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.280 
going to cast these get more mate war
marshals<00:02:42.430> sack<00:02:43.000> them<00:02:43.180> all<00:02:43.330> eventually<00:02:43.780> I'll

marshals sack them all eventually I'll
draw<00:02:44.470> another<00:02:46.590> empty<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.739> warrens<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.250> then

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
draw another empty the warrens and then

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.400 
draw another empty the warrens and then
you<00:02:48.790> just<00:02:49.000> do<00:02:49.660> it<00:02:49.810> over<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.110> over<00:02:50.200> again

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
you just do it over and over again

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.500 
you just do it over and over again

eventually you'll draw as many cards as
you<00:02:52.630> want<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.020> then<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.350> can<00:02:53.500> just<00:02:53.620> grapeshot

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
out there now to Brian actually was

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.100

is<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.390> maximum<00:03:19.840> you<00:03:19.959> can<00:03:19.989> make<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:21.040> yeah<00:03:21.640> he

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
is the maximum you can make so yeah he

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.130 
is the maximum you can make so yeah he
has<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.000> screenshot<00:03:22.330> of<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.660> worth<00:03:22.840> it's<00:03:23.019> just

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.180 
that looks real explosive I don't think
a<00:03:28.510> lot<00:03:28.630> of<00:03:28.660> people<00:03:28.720> are<00:03:28.900> expected<00:03:28.989> yeah<00:03:29.950> we

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
a lot of people are expected yeah we

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.350 
a lot of people are expected yeah we
thought<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.519> people<00:03:30.670> would<00:03:30.790> be<00:03:31.000> expecting

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
thought that people would be expecting

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.640 
thought that people would be expecting
to<00:03:31.450> standard<00:03:31.780> goblin<00:03:32.080> list<00:03:32.260> but<00:03:32.410> without<00:03:32.530> the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
to standard goblin list but without the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.920 
to standard goblin list but without the
fecundity<00:03:33.100> is<00:03:33.220> just<00:03:33.400> not<00:03:33.550> as<00:03:33.670> explosive<00:03:33.910> so<00:03:34.750> we

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
fecundity is just not as explosive so we

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.120 
fecundity is just not as explosive so we
thought<00:03:35.110> that<00:03:35.170> people<00:03:35.530> would<00:03:35.680> probably<00:03:35.860> just

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
thought that people would probably just

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.470 
thought that people would probably just
shy<00:03:36.310> away<00:03:36.430> from<00:03:36.550> me<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:36.850> test<00:03:37.239> against

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
shy away from me and test against

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.300 
shy away from me and test against
regular<00:03:37.780> decks<00:03:37.989> so<00:03:38.350> if<00:03:38.710> you<00:03:38.860> had<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.069> play<00:03:39.190> in<00:03:39.250> a

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
regular decks so if you had to play in a

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.590 
regular decks so if you had to play in a
ptq<00:03:39.580> but<00:03:39.819> you<00:03:39.910> obviously<00:03:40.000> don't<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.540> you're

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
ptq but you obviously don't and you're

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.540 
ptq but you obviously don't and you're
afraid<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:40.930> playing<00:03:41.140> against<00:03:41.319> this<00:03:41.440> deck<00:03:41.680> what

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
afraid of playing against this deck what

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.830 
afraid of playing against this deck what
would

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
would

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.210 
would
do<00:03:42.989> how<00:03:43.200> would<00:03:43.319> you<00:03:43.410> stop<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.650> what's<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:43.980> best

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
do how would you stop it what's the best

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.920 
do how would you stop it what's the best
card<00:03:44.400> against<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.819> could<00:03:45.030> somebody<00:03:45.209> have<00:03:45.660> won

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
card against you could somebody have won

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.660 
card against you could somebody have won
the<00:03:46.680> Boros<00:03:47.040> mashup<00:03:47.489> is<00:03:47.670> pretty<00:03:48.420> good<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:49.349> a

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
the Boros mashup is pretty good is a

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.280 
the Boros mashup is pretty good is a
like<00:03:50.670> about<00:03:51.000> 5050<00:03:51.599> matchup<00:03:51.959> I'd<00:03:52.110> say

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
like about 5050 matchup I'd say

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.570 
like about 5050 matchup I'd say
whoever's<00:03:52.650> on<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.800> play<00:03:53.040> has<00:03:53.220> an<00:03:53.340> advantage

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
whoever's on the play has an advantage

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.770 
whoever's on the play has an advantage
we<00:03:53.760> have<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.940> slight<00:03:54.209> advantage<00:03:54.269> though

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
we have a slight advantage though

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.270 
we have a slight advantage though
because<00:03:54.989> we<00:03:55.319> just<00:03:55.500> can<00:03:55.590> get<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.830> explosive

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
because we just can get the explosive

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.500 
because we just can get the explosive
draws<00:03:56.459> whereas<00:03:56.760> Boris<00:03:57.030> can't<00:03:57.239> really<00:03:57.420> do

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
draws whereas Boris can't really do

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.020 
draws whereas Boris can't really do
anything<00:03:57.720> about<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.040> so<00:03:59.040> I'd<00:03:59.160> say<00:03:59.340> bros<00:03:59.670> is<00:03:59.790> an

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
anything about it so I'd say bros is an

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.580 
anything about it so I'd say bros is an
ok<00:04:00.299> deck<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.660> play<00:04:00.750> this<00:04:01.049> next<00:04:01.200> shot<00:04:01.379> showing

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
ok deck to play this next shot showing

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.589 
ok deck to play this next shot showing
up<00:04:01.769> but<00:04:02.010> in<00:04:02.400> general<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.970> think<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.569> that

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
up but in general I think that that

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.390 
up but in general I think that that
really<00:04:04.049> isn't<00:04:04.230> vulnerable<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:04.799> anything<00:04:04.950> how

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
really isn't vulnerable to anything how

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.530 
really isn't vulnerable to anything how
would<00:04:05.519> you<00:04:05.549> get<00:04:05.670> around<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:06.030> difficult<00:04:06.360> car

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
would you get around a difficult car

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.240 
would you get around a difficult car
like<00:04:06.660> a<00:04:06.720> pyro<00:04:06.900> static<00:04:07.319> pillar<00:04:07.560> which<00:04:07.830> would

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
like a pyro static pillar which would

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.410 
like a pyro static pillar which would
seem<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.430> damage<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.910> for<00:04:09.060> everything<00:04:09.239> in

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
seem to damage you for everything in

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.580 
seem to damage you for everything in
your<00:04:09.480> deck<00:04:09.660> well<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.080> thing<00:04:10.200> about<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.440> car

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
your deck well the thing about the car

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.770 
your deck well the thing about the car
like<00:04:10.799> that<00:04:10.830> is<00:04:11.069> like<00:04:11.250> your<00:04:12.090> combo<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.510> but

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
like that is like your combo that but

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.119 
like that is like your combo that but
you're<00:04:12.840> also<00:04:12.959> an<00:04:13.080> aggressive<00:04:13.530> deck<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:14.099> I

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
you're also an aggressive deck so I

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.949 
you're also an aggressive deck so I
basically<00:04:14.610> again<00:04:15.000> stacked<00:04:15.239> against<00:04:15.810> burro

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
basically again stacked against burro

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.449 
basically again stacked against burro
stacks<00:04:16.229> I<00:04:16.290> bring<00:04:16.560> in<00:04:16.650> clicks<00:04:16.859> to<00:04:17.010> there<00:04:17.130> anyway

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
stacks I bring in clicks to there anyway

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.060 
stacks I bring in clicks to there anyway
so<00:04:18.389> if<00:04:18.959> they'd<00:04:19.169> have<00:04:19.380> power<00:04:19.590> static<00:04:19.889> pillar

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
so if they'd have power static pillar

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.349 
so if they'd have power static pillar
the<00:04:20.459> borough<00:04:20.639> stick<00:04:20.820> is<00:04:20.910> already<00:04:21.120> taking<00:04:21.329> a

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
the borough stick is already taking a

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.730 
the borough stick is already taking a
lot<00:04:21.479> of<00:04:21.510> damage<00:04:21.660> from<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.989> lands<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:22.380> can<00:04:22.590> just

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
lot of damage from the lands I can just

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.960 
lot of damage from the lands I can just
kill<00:04:22.889> them<00:04:23.010> which<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.160> exactly<00:04:23.250> what<00:04:23.669> happened

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
kill them which is exactly what happened

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.730 
kill them which is exactly what happened
ornery<00:04:24.419> around<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:24.990> also<00:04:25.290> I<00:04:25.380> guess<00:04:25.560> because

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
ornery around and also I guess because

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.200 
ornery around and also I guess because
empty<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.100> warrens<00:04:26.250> cost<00:04:26.550> for<00:04:26.850> you<00:04:27.090> could

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
empty the warrens cost for you could

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.370 
empty the warrens cost for you could
probably<00:04:27.389> actually<00:04:27.600> empty<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.050> warrens<00:04:28.139> for

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
probably actually empty the warrens for

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.230 
probably actually empty the warrens for
a<00:04:28.410> bunch<00:04:28.590> Warchief<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.310> exactly<00:04:30.030> i'll

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
a bunch Warchief and exactly i'll

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.060 
a bunch Warchief and exactly i'll
probably<00:04:30.450> take<00:04:30.630> six<00:04:30.870> damage<00:04:31.169> from<00:04:31.560> cat<00:04:31.770> trying

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
probably take six damage from cat trying

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.350 
probably take six damage from cat trying
to<00:04:32.160> catch<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.430> Warrens<00:04:32.760> but<00:04:32.970> i'll<00:04:33.150> have<00:04:33.330> like

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
to catch the Warrens but i'll have like

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.090 
to catch the Warrens but i'll have like
12<00:04:33.810> guys<00:04:33.960> in<00:04:34.200> place<00:04:34.380> so<00:04:34.590> it's<00:04:34.740> not<00:04:34.830> really<00:04:34.889> a

12 guys in place so it's not really a

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.479 
12 guys in place so it's not really a
big<00:04:35.130> deal<00:04:35.280> thank<00:04:36.030> you<00:04:36.090> very<00:04:36.120> much<00:04:36.270> as
