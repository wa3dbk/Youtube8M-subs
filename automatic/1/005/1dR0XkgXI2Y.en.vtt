in the production process of the new car
a<00:03:14.549> very<00:03:15.090> important<00:03:15.810> part<00:03:16.049> is<00:03:16.260> obviously<00:03:16.709> the

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
a very important part is obviously the

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.429 
a very important part is obviously the

in<00:03:21.599> together

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
in together

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.440 
in together
this<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:23.040> something<00:03:23.519> that<00:03:23.549> normally<00:03:23.999> happens

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
very important moment because everything

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.750 
very important moment because everything
is<00:03:55.139> stripped<00:03:55.409> down<00:03:55.560> all<00:03:55.949> the<00:03:56.250> parts<00:03:56.609> are

is stripped down all the parts are

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.479 
is stripped down all the parts are
checked<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.389> is<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.199> moment<00:03:58.829> in<00:03:59.010> which<00:03:59.040> you

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
checked and is the moment in which you

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.000 
checked and is the moment in which you
have<00:03:59.609> to<00:03:59.819> do<00:03:59.969> the<00:04:00.540> coal<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:01.260> probably<00:04:01.739> will

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
have to do the coal that probably will

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.309 
have to do the coal that probably will
affect<00:04:02.430> all<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:03.000> following<00:04:03.659> part<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.139> the

affect all the following part of the

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.699 
affect all the following part of the
season<00:04:04.560> is<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.400> very<00:04:05.790> crucial<00:04:06.150> moment<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:07.049> more

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
season is a very crucial moment and more

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.379 
season is a very crucial moment and more
than<00:04:07.949> everything<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.579> becoming<00:04:09.180> more<00:04:09.329> and

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
than everything is becoming more and

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.629 
than everything is becoming more and
more<00:04:09.569> crucial<00:04:10.109> since<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.650> new<00:04:10.829> rules<00:04:11.129> are

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
more crucial since the new rules are

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.670 
more crucial since the new rules are
forcing<00:04:12.269> us<00:04:12.449> not<00:04:12.719> to<00:04:12.840> have<00:04:12.870> any<00:04:13.109> testing
