00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.450
 hello friends friends welcome to point 5 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.400
 x 1 already know that you can find me in 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.790
 social networks facebook twitter 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.200
 instagram like fernando 5 x 1 to see in 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.820
 this video I will not talk about anything 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.290
 I'm not going to talk about betas 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.470
 I will not talk about them or about 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.890
 news or anything this video I want 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.870
 make it a video without controversy and 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.470
 simply clarifying at least 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.640
 I want to express 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.500
 a feeling that I feel right now 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.000
 following the comments that I have been 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.690
 living and receiving so much on youtube 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.950
 as in twitter of certain people respect 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.200
 to the video titled the night of the jailbreak 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.460
 well in this video I commented that 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.020
 for a few hours it was possible to sign the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.080
 6.0 point x and be able to perform a jailbreak 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.379
 good people all devices me 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.710
 criticized harshly in addition even some 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.090
 mocking and I say on youtube are 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.200
 present I have not deleted them being there 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.270
 present in the comments you can 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.760
 see but on twitter they were maybe something 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.370
 more serious but well there does not answer and 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.480
 directly do not give importance but 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.480
 yes it is true that 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.820
 no help does not help 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.310
 mainly because a lot of people 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.570
 precisely that he criticized that he did not 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.890
 a video like did marciano font 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.049
 precisely in the comments that 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.700
 they say there is that when you bother the 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.430
 Martian font made the perfect video to 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.520
 see several points mark does not put there 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.920
 he was at his ideal hour mid afternoon not 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.929
 it takes nothing to make a point 2 video 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.240
 what I'll do a video if you already 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.340
 my partner has done and if partner does not 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.899
 rival is that here people think that 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.390
 youtubers are rivals for nothing 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.649
 we are companions we complement the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.600
 information that may some time may 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.190
 complement another or directly if one 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.740
 there's next to the band so the other is 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.720
 it's as simple as that simple, there's no 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.269
 competition is worth that that is clear by 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.500
 at least I do not seek to have it are friends 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.810
 and it is already 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.310
 point 3 regarding point 1 that I said 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.310
 that Martian was mid afternoon and such 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.700
 point 3 here in Spain at three o'clock and 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.720
 morning average 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.360
 while two and a half 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.300
 two thirty in the morning I was 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.550
 sleeping when they arrived 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.069
 notifications to my mobile that apple 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.689
 I was signing that version 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.819
 the first thing that says that I was with 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.300
 everything off was sleeping first thing 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.390
 what I did was turn on everything 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.230
 and get on twitter help people 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.510
 logically I was not going to make a video of the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.050
 3 in the morning but between that I lit 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.240
 all download the version install it and 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.410
 so it took me half an hour for 3 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.750
 in the morning I was not going to do 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.220
 a video more than anything because there are people 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.000
 sleeping and sincerely 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.800
 youtube I do it as a hobby it's worth that 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.830
 It has to be clear I do not earn money 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.910
 on youtube if I have a partner 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.800
 if I have ads 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.800
 but he has not received anything yet 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.730
 I have nothing 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.069
 so 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.110
 I believe that I already dedicate enough 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.530
 hours throughout the week 27 videos 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.200
 a week one a day 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.130
 and with many hours not only the channel of 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.000
 Youtube, what do you see? 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.870
 also the podcast 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.870
 reward 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.680
 you know what they have given me 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.540
 where you want to leave it 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.540
 to leave I say it's worth it 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.550
 right now I say I have not won anything to 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.410
 despite having a partner and how little 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.730
 I'm not going to give 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.319
 buy more than two bags of pipes 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.769
 although you do not know but 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.389
 regardless of what you win at the end 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.090
 the economic issue goes on the other hand to 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.370
 end this you do it because you like it 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.510
 because it really does not make up for how little 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.269
 you can win with the hours that you 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.920
 It is not clear, but it is the fact 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.689
 that's not what you dedicate much of your 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.909
 time I often deprived myself of 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.489
 do things with my partner with my friends 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.919
 and others are not always logically 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.139
 priorities but there are individual days 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.780
 concrete that I have deprived myself of 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.940
 do things just by making a video by 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.070
 be one for friday for being doing 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.960
 a podcast whatever 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.880
 you believe that it really deserves 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.800
 I'm sorry to keep making videos so that 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.200
 over people then mock that of 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.930
 that you warn the next day not gentlemen 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.330
 is that what bothers me even more is that 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.070
 those people over do not follow me on twitter 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.100
 that when I say that you follow me in 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.870
 twitter is not for mocking me for having more 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.930
 followers to say there give it a like 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.169
 just as they do not 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.380
 I do not care to have 3 thousand 900 followers 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:00.830
 that 100 I do it for you 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.330
 help this channel is worth it I repeat it not what 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.220
 I have done with intention to become famous 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.350
 nothing because I do not intend 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.289
 simply with the intention of helping 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.630
 people people who watch youtube videos 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.639
 on youtube be one more be a humble 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.250
 helper over this community 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.889
 technology that little by little goes for more 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.570
 simply and my twitter precisely what 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.760
 What I intend is that it be another point 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.770
 more help for people 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.240
 the people who criticized me for doing the 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.980
 video the next day surely I do not 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.840
 follow on twitter because I put on the 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.400
 three in the morning help people to 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.960
 install that version of 6.0 point x 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.760
 Even people I know have installed it 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.700
 other people do not give you time because in 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.820
 those countries the connections are slow 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.890
 but it bothers me a lot, it upsets me a lot 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:49.730
 people who have mocked on youtube in the 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:52.400
 comments that I have not warned that 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:55.660
 it's a lie, you do not follow me on twitter, friend 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.400
 that's why you did not see it 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.150
 of course do not tell me if you do not want 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:04.000
 But do not lie, do not lie, because there is no 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.770
 thing that angers me more than the lie and 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.670
 in the end I can prove it I have a 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.440
 video channel 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.360
 I have more than 3,000 subscribers in 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.500
 youtube and I think that of people 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.600
 enough to have more 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.520
 credibility that the 4000 dundee who have 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.960
 commented trying to put me the 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.960
 evidence things that are not going to get 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.160
 and see if you are important to me 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.590
 everyone, both good and bad 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.540
 that I'm spending a video look 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.740
 if I value you and I'm losing that 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.180
 time right now I have to be 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.400
 preparing the special podcast of 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.750
 support anniversary 5 x 1 and I'm here 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.040
 I say I'm going to make a stop on the way 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:39.630
 I'm going to make a video 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.630
 so said guys until he declared 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:46.050
 When you animate in the comments, you 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.760
 Thank you value when you work 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:52.540
 thanks 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:55.270
 but criticize for criticizing that you earn 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.210
 criticize a professional who are not 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:01.780
 amateur professionals, surely you 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:03.250
 do you think you look at what critical 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.380
 I get stuck with the language you criticize 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.620
 surely speak is better than me and what 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.030
 do better than me because you do not do it 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.620
 because your time is more important 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.139
 maybe not 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.060
 Well, we're all having a life 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:18.680
 behind this 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:22.160
 there's no more 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.570
 in short guys parentheses I think the 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.440
 vacations that I'm going to take we're going to 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:29.960
 come well to everyone so much to those who 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.330
 they have hate to forget about me so much 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.889
 for those who usually follow us 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.660
 to gather strength for September 

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:38.300
 and see new things and so much for me to 

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.669
 disconnect because I already say that in August 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.960
 We stop for the machinery of 5 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.370
 for 1 and we return to September with the 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.949
 new season 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.840
 said this guys I say goodbye I feel like 

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:49.310
 those that we like to see this kind of 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.509
 videos but I just wanted 

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.330
 express an opinion as he has done 

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:54.810
 People's comments 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.810
 goodbye
