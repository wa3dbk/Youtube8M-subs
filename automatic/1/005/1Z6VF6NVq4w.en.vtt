00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
want you all to try it because it looks

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.610 
want you all to try it because it looks
kind<00:00:36.250> of<00:00:36.430> ridiculous<00:00:37.210> but<00:00:37.540> when<00:00:38.230> you<00:00:38.320> try<00:00:38.589> it

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
kind of ridiculous but when you try it

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.799 
kind of ridiculous but when you try it
you<00:00:38.949> really<00:00:39.250> see<00:00:39.519> wow<00:00:39.760> that's<00:00:40.030> actually<00:00:40.600> super

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
you really see wow that's actually super

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.890 
you really see wow that's actually super
challenging<00:00:41.530> it's<00:00:42.040> a<00:00:42.550> way<00:00:43.150> to<00:00:43.180> improve<00:00:43.690> the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
challenging it's a way to improve the

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.140 
challenging it's a way to improve the
mobility<00:00:44.079> and<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:45.010> stability<00:00:45.400> about<00:00:45.790> your

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
mobility and the stability about your

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.569 
mobility and the stability about your
hips<00:00:46.390> think<00:00:46.780> of<00:00:46.900> a<00:00:46.960> goaltender's<00:00:47.620> hip<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.460> way

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
hips think of a goaltender's hip the way

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.069 
hips think of a goaltender's hip the way
you<00:00:48.640> would<00:00:48.850> think<00:00:49.059> of<00:00:49.149> a<00:00:49.239> pitcher's<00:00:49.600> rotator

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
you would think of a pitcher's rotator

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.590 
you would think of a pitcher's rotator
cuff<00:00:50.489> probably<00:00:51.489> not<00:00:51.670> many<00:00:51.879> of<00:00:52.000> you<00:00:52.150> spend<00:00:52.510> a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
cuff probably not many of you spend a

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.179 
cuff probably not many of you spend a
lot<00:00:52.750> of<00:00:52.780> time<00:00:53.049> working<00:00:53.290> on<00:00:53.589> the<00:00:53.710> rotator<00:00:54.100> cuff

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:54.189 
lot of time working on the rotator cuff

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:56.520 
lot of time working on the rotator cuff
of<00:00:54.610> your<00:00:54.640> hip<00:00:55.000> but<00:00:55.479> you<00:00:55.600> really<00:00:55.869> need<00:00:56.080> to<00:00:56.140> so

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
of your hip but you really need to so

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.649 
of your hip but you really need to so
that<00:00:56.559> you<00:00:56.769> can<00:00:56.890> have<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.580> durable<00:00:58.000> hips<00:00:58.330> but

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
that you can have the durable hips but

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.619 
that you can have the durable hips but
also<00:00:58.869> so<00:00:59.290> that<00:00:59.320> you<00:00:59.589> can<00:00:59.799> express<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:01.330> amount

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
also so that you can express the amount

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.810 
also so that you can express the amount
of<00:01:01.720> force<00:01:02.080> that<00:01:02.379> you<00:01:02.500> can<00:01:02.680> produce<00:01:02.860> because<00:01:03.400> if

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
of force that you can produce because if

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.660 
of force that you can produce because if
we<00:01:04.089> can't<00:01:04.330> stabilize<00:01:04.780> a<00:01:05.590> force<00:01:06.130> then<00:01:06.549> we

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
we can't stabilize a force then we

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.609 
we can't stabilize a force then we
really<00:01:06.939> our<00:01:07.090> body<00:01:07.299> won't<00:01:07.509> let<00:01:07.659> us<00:01:07.900> use<00:01:07.930> it<00:01:08.290> so

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
really our body won't let us use it so

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.800 
really our body won't let us use it so
it<00:01:09.040> might<00:01:09.159> be<00:01:09.220> very<00:01:09.520> very<00:01:09.700> strong<00:01:10.119> but<00:01:10.659> you're

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
it might be very very strong but you're

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.630 
it might be very very strong but you're
losing<00:01:10.930> power<00:01:11.320> because<00:01:12.100> you're<00:01:12.280> not<00:01:12.430> as

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
losing power because you're not as

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.460 
losing power because you're not as
stable<00:01:13.030> as<00:01:13.299> you<00:01:13.420> could<00:01:13.600> be<00:01:13.810> in<00:01:14.049> your<00:01:14.229> hip

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
stable as you could be in your hip

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.310 
stable as you could be in your hip
joints<00:01:14.920> so<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:16.210> one<00:01:16.420> is<00:01:16.570> a<00:01:16.600> burner<00:01:16.869> give<00:01:17.170> it<00:01:17.259> a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
joints so this one is a burner give it a

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.530 
joints so this one is a burner give it a
try<00:01:17.590> and<00:01:17.860> if<00:01:18.340> you<00:01:18.400> want<00:01:18.579> more<00:01:18.820> great<00:01:19.270> drills
