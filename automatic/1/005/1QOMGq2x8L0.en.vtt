 screen channel 8 point cl can see 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.910
 talk about our 20 is how it is pronounced 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.770
 in bake with a 7 and finances the dike 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.960
 but it's a tripod and that we use 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.480
 usually as a type of son does not work 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.740
 much to settle or feel but we 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.390
 serves as a fixed type to take 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.100
 photographs speaker programs like this 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.290
 who are watching here if they want to know 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.180
 five characteristics of this tripod and 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.250
 some tips let's see below 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.899
 in the field the tribute that we use 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.899
 us and its characteristics 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.800
 because we get to the place where we are going to 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.960
 do today's review and we're going to 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.309
 perform this particular tripod 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.449
 you have asked me a lot that the 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.920
 tripod I use to perform 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.130
 recordings and the information is 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.260
 appearing here next to me now 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.240
 is the technical information let's say where 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.560
 you can find the tripod and how 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.940
 look for it on ebay which is the place where 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.650
 I bought it and you will wonder 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.120
 why the bag so small and why 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.860
 dogs bark because they are happy 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.860
 because we are going to make this gut 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.360
 this tripod is a travel tripod 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.390
 then the position of the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.820
 legs open 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.820
 already ready to work let's review 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.610
 feature number one and what portable 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.470
 it seems fundamental to me it touches me a lot 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.210
 travel and take pictures and record videos in 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.160
 different places therefore have a 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.390
 Fluid head tripod is called Hector 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.340
 The types and types of 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.810
 usually used for video is not very 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.670
 convenient because it occupies me very much 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.080
 for if he does not allow me to wear it 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.460
 is this size comes with the 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.700
 bag included and it is very easy to 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.700
 transport 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.040
 feature 2 or second 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.870
 characteristic is the telescopic legs 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.610
 first of the position in which it arrives 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.740
 they open to the side they are locked 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.810
 here and they are perfect to be able 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.760
 start using the tripod and also 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.260
 are telescopic then the way that 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.840
 they have to close in overcoming those 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.220
 tapitas making a click are turning 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.920
 what allows us to take the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.050
 location something like that and now the tripod by 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.480
 complete then it is extremely fast in 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.730
 case of wanting to cover a situation 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.210
 open like this and we already have the possibility of 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.210
 using 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.310
 third characteristic and something that to me 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.900
 love is when you travel to land 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.790
 that are a bit unstable or places 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.200
 where there is a lot of wind and the photo has 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.510
 to be exposed for a long time 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.280
 we can not allow the tripod to 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.500
 move in this case comes with a hook 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.000
 metallic here then usually I 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.260
 I hang in my backpack or any 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.850
 heavy element and that makes the 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.250
 tripod is firmly against the floor and not 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.780
 have almost no vibration the 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.780
 tion also retractable so is saved 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.579
 Another important feature is the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.220
 fourth and the next feature 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.190
 important is that it has 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.540
 not the option to record videos with head 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.640
 fluid how are called the tripods of 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.790
 video are very fluid but if I 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.990
 On to get out of some bad time 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.790
 squeezing the theories of the 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.190
 sides and moving the top 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.840
 generates some resistance and serves to 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.890
 to manage is not ideal but at least 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.890
 It helps us get out of trouble 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.920
 and I'm telling you then I come a 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.900
 normal tripod is portable serves it 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.910
 You can use it in a good way but not 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.540
 we always need a tripod sometimes 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.540
 we need 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.069
 a new power 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.200
 then using this same tripod 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.810
 one of the legs that comes with 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.790
 an indication of an open lock 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.829
 are the other two free legs that are 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.390
 they can keep the same bag and the rest 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.220
 there is a monkey 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.810
 tremendous characteristics of this 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.380
 tripod see you in the world study 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.380
 this channel 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.989
 he was overrunning the peak 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.430
 We went back and came back and there all the 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.199
 Main features of the tripod 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.750
 that we use in channel 89 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:21.269
 vehicle 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.959
 You want to see how to follow us on twitter 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.320
 social networks 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.230
 channel 8 and also remember to follow us on 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.450
 facebook the group is called channel 8 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.980
 this was a new chapter juan pedro tv 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.750
 You can see all the chapters that you have 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.060
 been in this season and the next and 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.560
 the previous one in a channel 8 points the y 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:44.700
 subscribe to this youtube account in 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.620
 a little way up I think that here and 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.000
 that helps us a lot to be able to continue 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.860
 making videos for you 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.650
 I appreciate this it was in Juan to lose because 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.660
 in 8.6 how the microphone is used the 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.460
 Balearic Islands is quite simple , the 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.610
 box in the sender in the person who 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.500
 let's record you put on the belt 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.810
 pass the cable underneath in this case of 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.790
 the shirt of the shirt of the shirt and 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.110
 places approximately one quarter of 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.180
 the mouth that because being a microphone 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.860
 directional allows us to record the 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.540
 being at a distance being 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.010
 place the microphone here would be more 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.690
 difficult for me to come to sleep 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.690
 project forward
