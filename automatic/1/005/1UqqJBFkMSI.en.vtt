of<00:01:04.799> open<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.610> guess<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.590> it's<00:01:07.590> pretty

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
of open I guess so it's pretty

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.859 
of open I guess so it's pretty
impressive<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:08.880> how<00:01:09.030> they<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> whole

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
impressive out how they get it the whole

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.440 
impressive out how they get it the whole
things<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.290> stick<00:01:10.530> together<00:01:11.119> like<00:01:12.119> these

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
things that stick together like these

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.620 
things that stick together like these
connect<00:01:13.460> that<00:01:14.460> looks<00:01:14.610> nice<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.970> seems<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
connect that looks nice and seems like a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.870 
connect that looks nice and seems like a
bit<00:01:15.900> guess<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.439> big<00:01:16.619> rip<00:01:16.770> dobe<00:01:17.549> ought<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> do

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
bit guess one big rip dobe ought to do

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.550 
bit guess one big rip dobe ought to do
dogs<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.869> don't<00:01:19.259> forget<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.950> walks<00:01:20.280> by<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.270> and
