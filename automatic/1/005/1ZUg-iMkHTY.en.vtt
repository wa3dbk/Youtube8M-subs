went all the way around several times

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.210 
went all the way around several times
making<00:02:06.840> smaller<00:02:07.200> circles<00:02:07.680> here<00:02:07.980> I'm<00:02:08.069> leaving

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.140 
bit of a heel too there's also technique
where<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.850> can<00:02:18.560> use<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.800> braids<00:02:20.070> standing<00:02:20.970> up

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
where you can use the braids standing up

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.060 
where you can use the braids standing up
on<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.630> on<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:23.810> narrow<00:02:24.810> side<00:02:24.960> excuse<00:02:25.770> me<00:02:25.920> of

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
on the on the narrow side excuse me of

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.190 
on the on the narrow side excuse me of
the<00:02:26.190> braid<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.970> kind<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.330> roll<00:02:27.570> up<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.960> bright

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
the braid you kind of roll up the bright

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.370 
the braid you kind of roll up the bright
then<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:29.160> know<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:30.630> will<00:02:30.810> become<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.170> much

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
then you know and it will become a much

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.830 
then you know and it will become a much
thicker<00:02:31.680> sole<00:02:32.070> but<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.150> will<00:02:33.300> also<00:02:33.630> need<00:02:33.780> a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
thicker sole but you will also need a

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.080 
thicker sole but you will also need a
lot<00:02:34.110> more<00:02:34.290> braids<00:02:34.860> for<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.730> think<00:02:35.970> I'm

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
lot more braids for that and I think I'm

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.600 
lot more braids for that and I think I'm
going<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.300> save<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.780> technique<00:02:37.170> for<00:02:38.160> when<00:02:38.580> I

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
going to save that technique for when I

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.990 
going to save that technique for when I
have<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:40.370> bigger<00:02:41.370> thicker<00:02:41.790> twine<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:44.100> then<00:02:44.700> I've

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
have a bigger thicker twine so then I've

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.670 
have a bigger thicker twine so then I've
pinned<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:46.590> shape<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.550> my<00:02:47.760> soul<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:49.380> I

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
pinned it in this shape to my soul and I

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.530 
pinned it in this shape to my soul and I
push<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.070> pins<00:02:50.280> all<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.550> way<00:02:50.640> in<00:02:50.820> because

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
push the pins all the way in because

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.240 
push the pins all the way in because
otherwise<00:02:51.840> my<00:02:52.080> thread<00:02:52.500> will<00:02:52.680> get<00:02:52.830> caught<00:02:53.100> in

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
otherwise my thread will get caught in

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.090 
otherwise my thread will get caught in
it<00:02:53.340> which<00:02:53.550> will<00:02:53.700> be<00:02:53.820> really<00:02:54.090> annoying<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:55.100> I'm

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
it which will be really annoying and I'm

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.240 
it which will be really annoying and I'm
now<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:56.730> sewing<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:58.170> braids<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.950> sole

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
now not sewing the braids to the sole

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.700 
now not sewing the braids to the sole
yet<00:02:59.580> I'm<00:02:59.850> just<00:03:00.120> sewing<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.600> braid<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:01.620> the

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
yet I'm just sewing the braid to the

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.290 
yet I'm just sewing the braid to the
braid<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.940> make<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.960> shape<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.620> sole<00:03:05.300> you

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
braid to make the shape of the sole you

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.840 
braid to make the shape of the sole you
also<00:03:06.510> use<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.960> blanket<00:03:07.560> stitch<00:03:07.800> for<00:03:08.070> that<00:03:09.410> so

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
also use a blanket stitch for that so

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.480 
also use a blanket stitch for that so
you<00:03:11.850> take<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.660> outer<00:03:12.900> loop<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.530> one<00:03:13.920> braid<00:03:14.220> and

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
you take the outer loop of one braid and

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.910 
you take the outer loop of one braid and
the<00:03:14.910> outer<00:03:15.120> loop<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:18.260> right<00:03:19.260> next<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.800> it

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
the outer loop of the right next to it

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.370 
the outer loop of the right next to it
and<00:03:20.330> then<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.450> go<00:03:21.600> over<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:23.250> thread<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:25.080> pull

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
and then you go over the thread you pull

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.610 
and then you go over the thread you pull
it<00:03:25.500> through<00:03:26.480> I'm<00:03:27.480> going<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.720> have<00:03:28.020> to<00:03:28.230> zoom<00:03:28.260> in

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
it through I'm going to have to zoom in

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.530 
it through I'm going to have to zoom in
a<00:03:28.650> little<00:03:28.830> bit<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.250> can<00:03:29.310> see<00:03:29.550> this<00:03:29.640> better

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.180 

there<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.630> go<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:36.350> so<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.410> take<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.920> outer

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
there you go so so you take the outer

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.470 
there you go so so you take the outer
loop<00:03:38.520> of<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:40.020> braid<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:41.760> outer<00:03:41.940> loop<00:03:42.209> of

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
loop of this braid and the outer loop of

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.060 
loop of this braid and the outer loop of
the<00:03:42.600> other<00:03:42.780> braid<00:03:44.300> you<00:03:45.300> go<00:03:45.480> over<00:03:46.350> like<00:03:46.800> this

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
the other braid you go over like this

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.190 
the other braid you go over like this
over<00:03:47.610> your<00:03:47.790> string

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:00.180 

and<00:03:51.770> you<00:03:51.890> pull<00:03:52.160> it<00:03:52.310> tight<00:03:54.010> I'll<00:03:55.010> do<00:03:55.220> that<00:03:55.340> again

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.510 

I'm<00:04:01.190> using<00:04:01.550> a<00:04:01.910> really<00:04:02.209> pointy<00:04:03.050> needle<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.650> think

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
I'm using a really pointy needle I think

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.520 
I'm using a really pointy needle I think
maybe<00:04:04.760> you<00:04:05.000> could<00:04:05.150> also<00:04:05.300> use<00:04:05.630> a<00:04:05.660> ballpoint<00:04:06.020> I'm

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
maybe you could also use a ballpoint I'm

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.250 
maybe you could also use a ballpoint I'm
not<00:04:06.680> quite<00:04:06.920> sure<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:07.520> just<00:04:08.180> happened<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.750> use

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
not quite sure I just happened to use

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.809 
not quite sure I just happened to use
this<00:04:09.500> one<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:10.010> it's<00:04:10.760> working<00:04:11.720> really<00:04:11.989> well<00:04:12.140> I

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
this one and it's working really well I

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.539 
this one and it's working really well I
am<00:04:13.819> also<00:04:14.030> using<00:04:14.350> it's<00:04:15.350> an<00:04:15.440> embroidery<00:04:16.130> yarn

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
am also using it's an embroidery yarn

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.120 
am also using it's an embroidery yarn
that<00:04:16.820> I'm<00:04:16.910> using<00:04:17.209> which<00:04:17.930> proves<00:04:18.410> to<00:04:18.590> be<00:04:18.620> really

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
that I'm using which proves to be really

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.550 
that I'm using which proves to be really
really<00:04:19.370> perfect<00:04:19.669> I<00:04:20.090> don't<00:04:20.930> know<00:04:21.139> what<00:04:21.440> the

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
really perfect I don't know what the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.500 
really perfect I don't know what the
right<00:04:21.680> term<00:04:21.950> is<00:04:22.160> but<00:04:22.430> this<00:04:22.580> is<00:04:22.730> not<00:04:23.000> loosely

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
right term is but this is not loosely

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.320 
right term is but this is not loosely
twisted<00:04:23.930> it's<00:04:24.080> um<00:04:24.290> it<00:04:24.590> could<00:04:24.860> be<00:04:25.040> s<00:04:25.220> twisted<00:04:26.060> or

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
twisted it's um it could be s twisted or

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.690 
twisted it's um it could be s twisted or
like<00:04:26.600> four<00:04:27.380> ply<00:04:27.800> or<00:04:28.130> something<00:04:28.460> but<00:04:28.580> it's

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
like four ply or something but it's

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.250 
like four ply or something but it's
something<00:04:28.790> that<00:04:29.120> doesn't<00:04:29.419> easily<00:04:30.050> come

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
something that doesn't easily come

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.400 
something that doesn't easily come
undone<00:04:30.650> I<00:04:31.430> had<00:04:32.060> to<00:04:32.180> really<00:04:32.389> work<00:04:32.479> it<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:33.110> get<00:04:33.260> it

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
undone I had to really work it to get it

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.300 
undone I had to really work it to get it
undone<00:04:33.710> even<00:04:34.040> just<00:04:34.850> like<00:04:35.000> this<00:04:35.350> so<00:04:36.350> that<00:04:37.160> is

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
undone even just like this so that is

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.250 
undone even just like this so that is
good<00:04:37.550> because<00:04:37.760> otherwise<00:04:38.060> I<00:04:38.540> think<00:04:38.690> going

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
good because otherwise I think going

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.530 
good because otherwise I think going
through<00:04:39.380> this<00:04:39.680> rough<00:04:40.010> braid<00:04:40.760> it<00:04:41.120> would<00:04:41.330> just

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
through this rough braid it would just

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.590 
through this rough braid it would just
get<00:04:41.750> you<00:04:42.050> know<00:04:42.139> it<00:04:42.320> would<00:04:42.560> be<00:04:43.100> in<00:04:43.280> pieces<00:04:43.610> plus

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
get you know it would be in pieces plus

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.090 
get you know it would be in pieces plus

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
wood floors or something to just rip

wood floors or something to just rip
this<00:04:50.540> right<00:04:50.840> apart<00:04:51.200> so<00:04:52.010> this<00:04:52.340> is<00:04:52.490> very<00:04:52.669> durable

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
this right apart so this is very durable

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.810 
this right apart so this is very durable
little<00:04:53.810> embroidery<00:04:54.650> thread<00:04:55.040> which<00:04:55.460> I<00:04:55.640> was

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
little embroidery thread which I was

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.690 
little embroidery thread which I was
lucky<00:04:56.090> enough<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.390> have<00:04:56.510> at<00:04:56.690> home<00:04:56.870> so<00:04:57.700> I'll

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
lucky enough to have at home so I'll

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.120 
lucky enough to have at home so I'll
make<00:04:58.880> a<00:04:58.940> few<00:04:59.240> more<00:04:59.419> stitches<00:04:59.710> to<00:05:00.710> show<00:05:00.890> you<00:05:00.950> but

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
make a few more stitches to show you but

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.670 
make a few more stitches to show you but
I<00:05:01.190> think<00:05:01.400> you<00:05:01.700> already<00:05:02.320> figured<00:05:03.320> it<00:05:03.560> out

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
I think you already figured it out

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.320 
I think you already figured it out
probably<00:05:04.539> sometimes<00:05:05.539> you<00:05:06.080> will<00:05:06.760> have<00:05:07.760> to<00:05:07.970> skip

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
probably sometimes you will have to skip

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.460 
probably sometimes you will have to skip
one<00:05:08.690> loop<00:05:08.960> or<00:05:09.229> use<00:05:09.650> one<00:05:09.890> loop<00:05:10.100> twice<00:05:10.539> just<00:05:11.539> that

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
one loop or use one loop twice just that

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.710 
one loop or use one loop twice just that
is<00:05:12.590> how<00:05:12.770> you<00:05:12.830> know<00:05:13.070> the<00:05:13.490> curves<00:05:13.789> in<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.450> braids

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
is how you know the curves in the braids

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.590 
is how you know the curves in the braids
happen<00:05:15.260> so<00:05:16.070> that's<00:05:16.430> why<00:05:16.610> you<00:05:16.669> pinned<00:05:17.090> it<00:05:17.240> first

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
happen so that's why you pinned it first

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.260 
happen so that's why you pinned it first
to<00:05:18.530> get<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.770> into<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.130> right<00:05:19.160> shape<00:05:19.550> of<00:05:20.030> the

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
to get it into the right shape of the

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.980 
to get it into the right shape of the
sole<00:05:21.850> so<00:05:22.850> you<00:05:22.880> just<00:05:23.180> keep<00:05:23.360> going<00:05:25.990> that's

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
sole so you just keep going that's

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.310 
sole so you just keep going that's
really<00:05:27.620> all<00:05:28.430> it<00:05:28.490> is

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.850 

all<00:05:33.320> right<00:05:33.530> I'll<00:05:33.800> be<00:05:34.009> up<00:05:34.130> next<00:05:34.280> what<00:05:34.820> I<00:05:34.850> like

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
all right I'll be up next what I like

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.460 
all right I'll be up next what I like
the<00:05:36.860> heel<00:05:37.300> and<00:05:38.300> when<00:05:38.540> I<00:05:38.570> sew<00:05:39.669> the<00:05:40.669> braid<00:05:41.210> so<00:05:41.630> to

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
the heel and when I sew the braid so to

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.720 
the heel and when I sew the braid so to
the<00:05:42.620> other<00:05:42.800> soul<00:05:43.720> bye-bye
