00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.659
 I apologize for not having taken so long 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.110
 updated diary we were all too 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.579
 are busy cleaning our camp and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.350
 the funeral of our fallen friends after 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.820
 battle 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.610
 hundreds of us took a whole week 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.799
 for putting the camp in order in order 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.759
 could take replenishment and main 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.539
 commander 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.539
 furion will be honest with you sitting here 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.060
 in the shade of the trees far from the camp and lead 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.420
 diary soothes me like never before 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.509
 all my thoughts make sense as i 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.799
 find my purpose and what is it 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.780
 maybe bistmaster somehow told me 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.149
 the ocean no matter how wide it is deep 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.149
 carries no meaning without 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.170
 water drops but calling it ocean you 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:10.119
 do you understand that you have a purpose 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.920
 a small drop should remain a drop 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.319
 otherwise everything will burst into oblivion and I think I 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.250
 parts of it all and 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.040
 drops of water in the ocean of war if I suddenly 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.280
 losing my mind and at least one drop will disappear 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:32.200
 my friends, too, may disappear and all 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:35.829
 will be lost maybe we are small but 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.109
 nothing is more important than us that's what I am today 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.930
 understood and what everyone should know 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:44.290
 but our commander furion is much wiser than us 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.840
 all that's why he stands before us 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.870
 I never thought I would see someone 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.000
 inspiring so much like i 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.880
 looking at the statue of the old commander from 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.720
 ancient times and numbering endless 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.060
 battles defeated by him only him 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.299
 presence inspired incredible courage 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.609
 his eyes were so deep face 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.030
 so wise and even pose was 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:12.100
 proof of right 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.049
 commander and his voice was worth 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.510
 he said something to spread through 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.030
 trees and deep into our hearts 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.569
 even other commanders looked at him 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.959
 bud deity and remembered everything he said to them 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.819
 spoke his speech was short but rather 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.829
 informative he noted that not looking 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.340
 on the fact that, although found, he estimated the enemies 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:36.280
 they still managed to surprise him their number 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.409
 it was great and their determination of departure 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.680
 sure death was a clear sign 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:44.170
 that they are well prepared incomprehensible 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.230
 he also told him something 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.019
 sleeping watch allies from the ancients 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.810
 the times of which you need to find wake up in order 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.840
 they helped us in this war I still 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.180
 I do not fully understand all this but I 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.400
 I know for sure that I became the leader of one of 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.829
 five ranger search groups 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.340
 happy to mention my name and merit in 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.230
 the last battle in front of everyone furion 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.269
 I decided to appoint me and four more 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.120
 guys are the leaders of search groups 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:16.419
 I know that I should be honored 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.419
 but I'm terribly afraid I'm not sure 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.970
 am I ready for this I understand that I must 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:25.479
 find strength and collect all thoughts 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:29.229
 together i don't know where she will have to go 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:31.139
 and will i come back and even if i find these 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.479
 sentries what should i do with them 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:38.020
 so many questions and almost no answers 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:41.320
 but in something I'm sure with me 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:45.099
 no choice i know what if i don't 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:49.169
 cope can not cope and others therefore 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.169
 i dare not let that happen
