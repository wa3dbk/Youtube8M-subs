00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
be a walmart exclusive that's what I'm

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.620 
be a walmart exclusive that's what I'm
thinking<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.010> put<00:00:29.429> me<00:00:29.550> wrong<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:30.359> could<00:00:30.510> be

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
thinking but I put me wrong it could be

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.880 
thinking but I put me wrong it could be
toys<00:00:30.869> r<00:00:31.019> us<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.289> they<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.560> didn't<00:00:31.830> do

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
toys r us and they just didn't do

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.410 
toys r us and they just didn't do
limited<00:00:32.219> edition<00:00:32.610> maybe<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.030> all<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
limited edition maybe it's just all the

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.470 
to lower
I<00:06:39.600> like<00:06:40.020> this<00:06:40.610> it<00:06:41.610> would<00:06:41.790> bump<00:06:42.060> in<00:06:42.240> and<00:06:42.420> a

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
I like this it would bump in and a

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.060 
I like this it would bump in and a
wouldn't<00:06:42.720> be<00:06:42.810> able<00:06:42.900> to<00:06:43.080> go<00:06:43.500> down<00:06:43.650> all<00:06:43.890> the<00:06:43.920> way

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
wouldn't be able to go down all the way

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.430 
wouldn't be able to go down all the way
so<00:06:44.400> that's<00:06:44.610> why<00:06:44.760> I<00:06:44.790> didn't<00:06:47.210> so<00:06:48.210> here<00:06:48.900> it<00:06:48.960> is<00:06:49.020> the

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
so that's why I didn't so here it is the

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.990 
so that's why I didn't so here it is the
fire<00:06:50.810> so<00:06:51.810> it's<00:06:52.230> very<00:06:52.380> cool<00:06:52.650> I<00:06:52.830> like<00:06:53.130> it<00:06:53.310> here's

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
fire so it's very cool I like it here's

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.850
