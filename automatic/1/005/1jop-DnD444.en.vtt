 centuries here best film prequel come 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.230

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.330
 very bad me very bad me two 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.670
 we discover the origin of the minutes and there is 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.590
 a whole new story set in the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.830
 years in 60s England 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.930
 in the original version the voice actors 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.090
 New protagonists your new 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.790
 super villains are sandra bullock and jon 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.640

 fazio also there is a narrator 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.050
 exceptional or alberto angela that 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.770
 just tells the star of nyon is the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.670
 narrative voice to the preview we have 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.640
 met the minions themselves and will be one 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.340
 shows various paintings of the famous of the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.960
 history of art revised in key 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.960
 wicker here is what we have seen 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.240
 we are with the minions but do not speak not 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.240
 they don't even talk 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.720
 we interviewed fabio voice actors 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.520
 fazio and luciana littizzetto and alberto 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.810
 angela at the cinema house 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.280
 before we see what they did to 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.869
 telling combined during the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.869
 photocall and then kozuch admit 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.900
 china more moral 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.410
 from here 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.160
 here 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.160
 I insist 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.710
 from paleoanthropologist and scientist like 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.530
 you would explain the need almost 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.380
 physiological of the minions to follow the most 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.320
 bad of the world is an old story 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.010
 of king or an old prehistory though 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.620
 we see 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.090
 the prehistoric man with that of the film 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.760
 that end badly 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.720
 on the contrary it has always been an animal 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.400
 of the savannah is a cynical villain in the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.190
 meaning that in order to survive it had to 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.470
 find space and kill prey 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.630
 so I imagine that in the savannah man 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.790
 prehistoric was seen as a 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.170
 fearsome hunter especially in the 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.110
 second part of evolution 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.030
 and that's why we're here but this 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.530
 as the jungle law is called i 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.380
 minion in a sense i am a 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.110
 distillate of this evolution but in 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.600
 ironic key clearly because why 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.130
 they always look for the best but 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.810
 make it look like a football team 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.260
 looking for the bomber that fails 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.459
 never to those who make them retreat every 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.290
 detail that I never understood correctly 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.300
 how they make you be immortal , okay 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.890
 this is part let's say for the 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.390
 creativity of the imagination I want 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.090
 see repeatedly told that you are now 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.070
 a couple made of Italian TV in 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:35.350
 this film is indeed one 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:37.360
 couple finally defeated work was 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.489
 of very funny we have not doubled 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.290
 together because I luckily run 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:47.470
 separate and we are still never seen 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:51.030
 but every now and then you have to accept these 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:56.860
 advancing because that's how a man still is 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:59.650
 back in action luciana practice you in 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.209
 this movie 6 the super bad adopt the 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.280
 wants to confess england other 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.660
 character if you were a supersic era 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.019
 I really want to believe he wants it 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.760
 conquer two figures so well 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.439
 English 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.819
 and that of oneself because I have to learn 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.920
 English as I do I must conquer 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.780
 england tells me but i could go to 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.820
 make the race that the queen is looking for 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.470
 elisabetta something new then maybe 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:26.850
 win the new golf tourism and myself 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:31.260
 let's make one willingly invent one 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.270
 machine that transforms 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.260
 gigantic nonsense in phrases of 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.330
 good sense and I would use it all the time with 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.389
 a kind of pacemaker 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.889
 the user is continuously with Lucianina 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.990
 that is when you nest for something 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.430
 atac and activate the machine is the sentence 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.440
 one thing becomes meaningful 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.550
 miracle does not exist in life not 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.880
 produces but I do not unanimously see us 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.720
 active role I would try to solve 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.270
 many problems 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.800
 we said bad I would be against 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.490
 bad but more than these 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.729
 we said these sentences a little bit done not me 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.490
 I find myself in a role of this type I am 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.050
 I would look in one way for another 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.550
 let's say if you were in a cartoon 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.680
 do many things but in reality 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:21.150
 obviously I'd make another team 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:26.070
 bob that is stewart wine together together e 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:30.300
 are my main dream team that you 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:34.169
 you enjoy it I think yes because it never knows 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:39.710
 well the name exactly which I understood or 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:42.570
 stuart 39 must remember scam well 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.039
 in addition to projection interviews 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.080
 printing of the film we participated 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.000
 also a press conference on 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.300
 dubbing in which they have always participated 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.419
 the fabio fazio news let's see what it is 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.169
 been told is the final scene where she is 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:01.650
 in i like the ladder to find 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:05.580
 this environment ie those sound 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.590
 in the pro like it came to mind 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.060
 a flame of flesh from the glasses and then 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.060
 I created it this way 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.710
 then let me say who laughed 22 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.210
 on the glasses that showcase this why 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.210
 woken up by an idiot 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.580
 I present to you my husband grass 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:30.660
 the super genius carrier and it was it 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:34.789
 nor mirror here are the new recruits declines 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:38.310
 ward discs and the little carinola discs 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:41.900
 and strong guys you are tiny and crazy 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.900
 very yellow I adore you 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.860
 if I look pedro at this point I go to 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.070
 make the gazpacho at home because these 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:56.250
 they made it so much he did n't 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.900
 funds will not be released on August 27 at 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.490
 cinema and therefore that will be the occasion 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.509
 to find all the yellow puppets 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.060
 very bad I will do that everyone likes 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:08.389
 this is all from valentina for the players 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.389
 to the next
