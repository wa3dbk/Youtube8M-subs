alka the whole way now this does involve
alguien<00:00:24.689> but<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.050> also<00:00:25.140> involves<00:00:25.610> another

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610

will pretty much get you double the XP

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.400 
will pretty much get you double the XP
so<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.259> get<00:00:31.380> around<00:00:31.820> 190<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> XP<00:00:33.450> or<00:00:33.870> matrix

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
so you can get around 190 a XP or matrix

P per hour you

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.790 
P per hour you
it's<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.200> that's<00:00:37.320> pretty<00:00:37.440> much<00:00:37.590> if<00:00:37.710> you're

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it's but that's pretty much if you're

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.990 
it's but that's pretty much if you're
doing<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.010> concentrated<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.700> if<00:00:38.790> you're<00:00:38.910> doing

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
so it's like this so basically every

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.650

skeleton is in your camera it's pretty

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.780 
skeleton is in your camera it's pretty
much<00:03:09.780> taking<00:03:10.050> about<00:03:10.230> 50%<00:03:10.770> of<00:03:10.830> your<00:03:10.950> camera<00:03:11.220> or

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
much taking about 50% of your camera or

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.110 
much taking about 50% of your camera or
your<00:03:11.850> view<00:03:12.240> not<00:03:13.050> simply<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:14.310> click<00:03:14.670> any<00:03:14.910> able

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
your view not simply you click any able

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.460 
your view not simply you click any able
to<00:03:15.180> get<00:03:15.270> this<00:03:15.360> one<00:03:15.480> over<00:03:15.660> here<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.930> there<00:03:16.350> you

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
to get this one over here to there you

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.740 
to get this one over here to there you
go<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:17.250> can<00:03:17.280> click<00:03:17.610> any<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:18.000> anywhere<00:03:18.630> in<00:03:18.690> the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
go you can click any of anywhere in the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.600 
go you can click any of anywhere in the
middle<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:19.020> these<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.410> it'll<00:03:19.920> cause<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.220> stun

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
middle of these and it'll cause the stun

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.730 
middle of these and it'll cause the stun
so<00:03:21.360> they're<00:03:21.480> cast<00:03:21.720> system<00:03:21.840> now<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.320> trick<00:03:22.590> is

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
so they're cast system now the trick is

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.010 
so they're cast system now the trick is
in<00:03:22.920> between<00:03:23.280> these<00:03:23.400> stones<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:23.820> can<00:03:23.850> alq<00:03:24.150> so

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
in between these stones you can alq so

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.350 
in between these stones you can alq so
let's<00:03:25.350> say<00:03:25.500> we'll<00:03:25.740> stun<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.730> quickly

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
let's say we'll stun this and quickly

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.750 
let's say we'll stun this and quickly
out<00:03:27.660> in<00:03:27.870> between<00:03:28.820> keep<00:03:29.820> going<00:03:30.150> out<00:03:30.560> in<00:03:31.560> between

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
out in between keep going out in between

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.710 
out in between keep going out in between
now<00:03:32.760> if<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:32.970> can<00:03:33.090> keep<00:03:33.180> doing<00:03:33.330> this<00:03:33.540> without

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
now if you can keep doing this without

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.590 
now if you can keep doing this without
any<00:03:34.220> breaks<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.610> never<00:03:35.880> stops

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
any breaks it never stops

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.670 
any breaks it never stops

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.240 
quick XP test for you guys so I'll do
like<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.530> minute<00:03:49.920> we're<00:03:50.550> currently<00:03:50.730> at<00:03:51.170> 303<00:03:52.250> 201

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
like a minute we're currently at 303 201

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.400 
like a minute we're currently at 303 201
9<00:03:53.460> so<00:03:53.820> I'll<00:03:54.180> do<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.510> for<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.690> minute<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.110> see<00:03:55.350> how

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
9 so I'll do it for a minute and see how

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:16.840 
9 so I'll do it for a minute and see how
much<00:03:55.500> we<00:03:55.650> get

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.570 

okay<00:04:17.850> so<00:04:19.130> we're<00:04:20.130> at<00:04:20.310> 300<00:04:20.810> 301<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:22.260> nine<00:04:22.500> or<00:04:23.250> to

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
okay so we're at 300 301 to nine or to

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.080 
okay so we're at 300 301 to nine or to
109<00:04:23.880> one<00:04:24.180> two<00:04:24.390> so<00:04:24.630> we<00:04:24.750> got<00:04:25.040> like<00:04:26.040> five<00:04:26.400> K<00:04:26.610> XP<00:04:26.940> in

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
109 one two so we got like five K XP in

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.430 
109 one two so we got like five K XP in
a<00:04:27.150> minute<00:04:27.420> which<00:04:27.660> is<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.990> lot<00:04:28.230> better<00:04:28.410> than

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
a minute which is a lot better than

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.620 
a minute which is a lot better than
alkene<00:04:28.890> so<00:04:29.820> it's<00:04:29.910> about<00:04:30.000> double<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.360> XP<00:04:30.600> of

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
alkene so it's about double the XP of

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.780 
alkene so it's about double the XP of
alkene<00:04:31.040> but<00:04:32.040> again<00:04:32.220> it's<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.430> little<00:04:32.580> more<00:04:32.700> I

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
alkene but again it's a little more I

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.010 
alkene but again it's a little more I
think<00:04:33.060> I<00:04:33.120> believe<00:04:33.330> it<00:04:33.420> cost<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.690> little<00:04:33.780> more

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
think I believe it cost a little more

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.800 
think I believe it cost a little more
but<00:04:34.080> it's<00:04:34.620> in<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.670> long<00:04:35.910> run<00:04:36.180> I'm<00:04:36.390> not<00:04:36.420> sure<00:04:36.690> if

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
but it's in the long run I'm not sure if

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.260 
but it's in the long run I'm not sure if
it's<00:04:36.900> gonna<00:04:37.020> save<00:04:37.200> you<00:04:37.320> money<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:39.000> guys<00:04:39.090> can
