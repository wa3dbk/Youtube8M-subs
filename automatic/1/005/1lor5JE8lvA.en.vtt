00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.259
 welcome to the next round to ours 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.769
 wm oracle 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.380
 we are trying with a ps3 in the game 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:19.289
 FIFA World Cup 2014 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.180
 Brazil that's probably 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.560
 actually the penultimate game 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.449
 the penultimate game of the german 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.980
 national team already a bit 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.490
 to predict how it will turn out 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.349
 could 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.070
 for that have composed my 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.020
 Colleague Florian Holzbauer hairstyle new 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.440
 hairstyle bit yes on the way 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.030
 of course say 1 1 against 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.399
 Germany assure exactly I find 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.039
 the team party 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.719
 I take the german team 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.329
 looking forward to the first or third 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.670
 to fight for space 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:58.079
 abutting brazil for the host 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.699
 to belong to a guest 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.180
 if you do not come to the finale now 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.720
 without the captain a big end who 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.720
 would have thought that 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.970
 only from three brazilians 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.970
 Brazilians big chance 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.970
 Brazil in luck each about 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.970
 Germany's big 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:48.119
 13 10 minutes 20 so the 113 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:54.170
 I have never seen euphoria 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:58.590
 all first good chance for brazil 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:10.709
 unfortunately only 20 meters back but happened 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:17.220
 The direction is right , I believe it 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:19.830
 not okay concentration yes the Bernese 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.450
 yellow card hummels and we want a lot 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.790
 so far what all dares yet 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:32.670
 okay semi-final 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:38.010
 unbelievable yes I notice the crowds 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.170
 years are in full just over the gate 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.430
 met 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:51.630
 but honestly wanted to cash 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:53.959
 if now an elfmetertor as long as that 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.959
 there is not 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.930
 no offside that does not exist 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.400
 Thorsten unbelievable 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.660
 it is offside off the beaten track 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:25.230
 but went in because you newer 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:29.000
 stand this German diligence 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.000
 and justify boundaries 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:37.349
 so now that we insist 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:43.910
 a heap of incredible may and that too 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.910
 nothing the man of the day 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:51.900
 but it does not work 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:58.400
 now he is back playing the 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.400
 German team once again a chance 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:09.440
 germany probably against holland 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.540
 or would it be in semi-final or 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.509
 argentina that they have too 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.859
 1 0 won a nice game 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:21.180
 florian ich finds almost I earn 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.830
 my brazil were close 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.210
 Well you have to say they had enough 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.160
 chances you just do not have them 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:31.440
 would like to wait again for the eleven meters 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.000
 hinweisen so the chances were there only 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.900
 So you did not actually perceive it 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.550
 deserved loser deserves the location 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.490
 positive is Germany you were 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:48.710
 argentina or I think we cologne in 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:53.729
 finale holland germany holland 1990 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.740
 So what are we going to see? 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.270
 every time next time it is not 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.639
 at least enough for the finale 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.530
 for the third place 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.440
 exactly so it makes good to 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.699
 next time 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.000
 so I have this either in 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.000
 question
