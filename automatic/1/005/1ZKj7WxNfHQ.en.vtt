00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
chosen an awkward way of doing this you

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.980 
chosen an awkward way of doing this you
put<00:01:43.710> these<00:01:43.860> things<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.570> it<00:01:45.570> really<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.960> a

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
put these things in and it really is a

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.330 
put these things in and it really is a
matter<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.350> getting<00:01:46.500> used<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.009> slide

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
matter of getting used to it you slide

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.399

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
initial problems doing that but it's

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.180 
initial problems doing that but it's
really<00:02:22.950> not<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.610> simplest<00:02:24.330> thing<00:02:24.630> it's<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.260> tad

one<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.660> easiest<00:02:33.960> ways<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.350> doing<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.800> is

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
one of the easiest ways of doing it is

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.950 
one of the easiest ways of doing it is
I've<00:02:35.610> got<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.820> bit<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.120> carpet<00:02:36.540> down<00:02:36.690> there<00:02:36.870> I'm

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
not going to go ahead and do that now

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.580 
not going to go ahead and do that now
but<00:02:38.520> really<00:02:39.450> all<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.780> should<00:02:39.930> have<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.200> do<00:02:40.380> is

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
but really all you should have to do is

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.950 
but really all you should have to do is
just<00:02:40.650> put<00:02:41.100> your<00:02:41.220> hands<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.730> do<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.330> but<00:02:42.690> my

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
just put your hands and do that but my

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.280 
just put your hands and do that but my
iphone<00:02:43.830> for<00:02:44.070> whatever<00:02:44.310> I've<00:02:44.490> noticed<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.120> on

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
iphone for whatever I've noticed it on

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.720 
iphone for whatever I've noticed it on
both<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.530> cases<00:02:46.710> catch<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.400> right<00:02:47.550> about

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
both of the cases catch is right about

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.760 
both of the cases catch is right about
here<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.270> not<00:02:49.020> really<00:02:49.170> too<00:02:49.410> worried<00:02:49.740> about

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
here so not really too worried about

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.610 
here so not really too worried about
that<00:02:49.980> because<00:02:50.490> it<00:02:50.670> actually<00:02:50.820> came<00:02:51.180> off<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.620> off

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
that because it actually came off of off

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.990 
that because it actually came off of off
