00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
material to it I come through like this

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.120 
material to it I come through like this
with<00:01:33.240> my<00:01:33.420> pads<00:01:33.690> of<00:01:33.930> flowers<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.590> then<00:01:35.010> I'm

with my pads of flowers and then I'm
coming<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.610> with<00:01:35.790> some<00:01:36.030> gerber<00:01:36.930> daisies<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
coming in with some gerber daisies and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.680 
coming in with some gerber daisies and
the<00:01:38.040> reason<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.580> gerber<00:01:38.850> daisies<00:01:38.880> work<00:01:39.420> so

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
the reason the gerber daisies work so

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.750 
the reason the gerber daisies work so
well<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.380> foam<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.950> because<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> foam

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
well in the foam is because the foam

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.790 
well in the foam is because the foam
gives<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.210> water<00:01:42.420> back<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.990> flowers<00:01:43.560> if

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
gives the water back to the flowers if

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.830 
gives the water back to the flowers if
they're<00:01:44.100> cut<00:01:44.310> short<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.240> don't<00:01:45.540> have

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
they're cut short like this I don't have

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.200 
they're cut short like this I don't have
to<00:01:45.990> worry<00:01:46.200> about<00:01:46.380> those<00:01:46.800> wilting<00:01:47.430> or<00:01:47.610> drooping

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
to how I started the base on this design

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.700 
to how I started the base on this design
by<00:01:53.520> making<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.690> way<00:01:54.960> getting<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.620> all

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
by making it this way getting it all

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.310 
by making it this way getting it all
completed<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.580> then<00:01:57.270> what<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:57.900> did<00:01:58.140> to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
completed and then what we did to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.530 
completed and then what we did to
finalize<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.280> design<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.820> we<00:01:59.970> came<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.390> with

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
finalize the design is we came in with

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.310 
finalize the design is we came in with
anthurium

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
anthurium

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.390 
anthurium
and<00:02:01.590> would<00:02:02.520> put<00:02:02.790> those<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:04.020> an<00:02:04.440> angle<00:02:04.680> took

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
and would put those in on an angle took

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.790 
and would put those in on an angle took
a<00:02:05.430> wood<00:02:05.730> wired<00:02:06.090> pick<00:02:06.660> and<00:02:06.990> put<00:02:07.230> it<00:02:07.320> around<00:02:07.440> the

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
a wood wired pick and put it around the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.100 
a wood wired pick and put it around the
end<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.190> or<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.820> head<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.479> flower<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
end of the or the head of the flower and

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.040 
end of the or the head of the flower and
then<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:11.000> put<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.180> down<00:02:12.240> and<00:02:12.690> into<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
then just put that down and into the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.420 
then just put that down and into the
foam<00:02:13.260> again<00:02:13.530> because<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.130> still

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
foam again because it's still

foam again because it's still
it's<00:02:14.549> home<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:14.939> would<00:02:15.120> pick<00:02:15.359> that's<00:02:15.569> going

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
it's home in a would pick that's going

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.839 
it's home in a would pick that's going
to<00:02:15.959> hold<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.530> there<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:16.980> I'm<00:02:17.370> going<00:02:17.579> to<00:02:17.640> have

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
to hold in there and I'm going to have

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.420 
to hold in there and I'm going to have
that<00:02:18.090> nice<00:02:18.980> sheltering<00:02:19.980> going<00:02:20.280> out

that nice sheltering going out

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.920 
that nice sheltering going out
throughout<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:20.909> design<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.599> keep<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.900> eye

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
about three foot sections and then we

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.690 
about three foot sections and then we
just<00:02:33.030> took<00:02:33.359> and<00:02:33.629> wound<00:02:34.379> that<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.250> through

just took and wound that in and through

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.699 
just took and wound that in and through
the<00:02:35.849> design<00:02:36.239> know<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.810> want<00:02:37.109> to<00:02:37.200> price<00:02:37.500> this

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
the design know you want to price this

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.649 
the design know you want to price this
out<00:02:37.950> per<00:02:38.280> foot<00:02:38.639> like<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:39.000> would<00:02:39.239> anything

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
out per foot like you would anything

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.539
