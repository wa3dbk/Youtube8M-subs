00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.259
 ae 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.570
 Hi people 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.090
 well I want to say sorry to you 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.180
 books that this month really is very 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.610
 complicated make video I have with evidence 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.140
 up to the neck I'm dying 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.610
 slowly 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.800
 of so to make proof and then excuses 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.960
 The prison is now coming out almost 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.589
 end of the month 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.330
 and how you asked for many requests 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.470
 how do I make my tattoos 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.260
 little pen 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.050
 I was thinking, man, there's no way 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.770
 show me how I do it 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.710
 then 90% of them are made 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.020
 school that I still know 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.510
 so I decided to make this video 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.609
 showing my drawings to you 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.449

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.729

 You can see it is full but it is 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.880
 going in the way quite detail 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.640
 then going pros my anime drawings 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.319

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.750

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.769
 lines if a mandate and has this 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.329
 trickster I have here like you 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.560
 You know who you said in my video. 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:48.859
 coruche 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.299
 I'm very all ciel calisi do not be 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:54.650
 low range 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:57.349
 You know how it is so I like it a lot too. 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.319
 to draw type dolls with much 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.980
 influenced by the art of the dome that 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.780
 Mars is annoying and here were my 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.290
 drawings that I inspired on the dolls 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.290
 her 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.140
 now requires that I show a drawing 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.980
 You know, I read a lot and I like it. 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.090
 very 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.380
 for example jackson theft here 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.240
 our link 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.020
 I did this drawing trying to imagine how 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.690
 would be the last book is how it would be 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.360
 sent in the last book 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.120
 At that time, I had neither had nor 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.590
 placed is blonde had still released the 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.520
 first film and so this design already 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:07.950
 relatively old is one year older than 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:12.180
 a year and also has this drawing of what 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.670
 made with the horse are from the first movie 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.400
 now it's over and not the second of its kind 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.109
 My god I have to see I did not have 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.430
 time to see everyone year 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.580
 choice of book jateÃ­ but that 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.580
 emotion 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.040
 I want to give some advice to who 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.460
 draws never give up on improving 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.470
 I never took a course ever, never 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.640
 I always sought for myself me 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.150
 perfect 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.040
 I think I never could have. 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.350
 draw like the drawing now if not 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.419
 For the people, they always encourage me. 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.240
 Saying that you are beautiful and not even much. 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.860
 not helping me and I wanted to show 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.840
 you a great example of this 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:00.510
 one of my goals that I did as 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.410
 had jonas affinity and the same drawing 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:07.130
 I refaced when I was 11 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:11.760
 here is what I did ten years ago 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:15.090
 this one that was nariko of the defendant of sweat 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.470
 She is my diva and you see that the 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.640
 Very childish design was very poor and 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.850
 the same drawing 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:27.140
 a year later when he was 11 years 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.729
 it's been a whole year 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.430
 obviously where the 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.990
 lines so horrible yet even 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.599
 so you can see that it 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.599
 hides in the way here 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.759
 so I think it 's a great example 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:50.870
 for you who draws not to let 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:55.020
 together take down and toxic airshow evil 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.909
 so it always goes that way lets the 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.919
 others do their own thing and will have 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:02.460
 we always try to improve because we do not 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:04.379
 You want to draw like a 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.270
 professional artist but also always 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:10.099
 I used the same thing, did not try to stay 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:15.569
 looking for new ways to draw me 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:17.539
 draw same thing then to finish 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:20.699
 I'll show you this last drawing now. 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:24.210
 I'm still doing it and health is 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:31.530
 ready is she to be having an arm all over 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:33.930
 tattooed here and that's it folks i hope 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.580

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.669
