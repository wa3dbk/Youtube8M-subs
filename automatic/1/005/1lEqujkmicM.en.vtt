00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.450
 heroic sounds on the stand of bmw 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.250
 at the detroit motor show 2013 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.710
 the reason of the appearance of a whole 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.260
 special vehicle's concept study 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.180
 of the new bmw four- wheel coupé only 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.279
 marginal changes will be this 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.510
 two-door mid-range coupé experienced 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.210
 when it comes to the market 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:30.449
 but after all, 98 percent of this 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.759
 Study of the series correspond very much 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.800
 sporty vehicle with the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.239
 pronounced presence clearer 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.590
 differentiated as the predecessor 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.969
 that will certainly be one of the highlights 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.320
 will be in 2013 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.270
 the four-coupé on the 3 Series 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.789
 limousine based bmw is one 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.649
 independent conception in comparison 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.180
 to the limousine is the four- coupé summarizes 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.770
 7 cm flatter also longer and wider 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.629
 it promises more dynamism at eight 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.059
 centimeter grown track at the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.980
 hinterachse 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.199
 in the interior it is noble to the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.250
 leather seats can be ordered as an option 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.740
 we still see the usa 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.440
 growth potential especially in the year 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.630
 In 2013, the usa looks much more positive 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.100
 as europe that's why we are here and 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.670
 That's why we have very specific ones 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.920
 Models presented here for example 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.840
 the facelift of the z4 that at the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.970
 roadster is very discreet 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.230
 only lighting and air intakes 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.410
 have been revised 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.080
 the shapely m6 coupe was made by the 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:36.110
 bmw m gmbh upgrades and makes thanks 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.110
 a twin turbo v8 engine 560 hp 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.909
 the bmw models are supposed to be the way into one 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.909
 have more environmentally friendly mobility 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.490
 we have one specific vehicle 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.369
 developed for the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.930
 Electromobility in 2013 will be us 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.770
 to be in the market in the i3 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.060
 start 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.680
 and I think that will make you this 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.680
 pretty much revolutionize segments
