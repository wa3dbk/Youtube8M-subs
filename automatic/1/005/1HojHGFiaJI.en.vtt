size and it's an extremely slow
germinator<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.250> could<00:00:20.369> take<00:00:20.550> 14<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.240> 21<00:00:21.570> days

to<00:00:22.619> seed<00:00:23.039> start<00:00:23.369> rosemary<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.000> actually<00:00:24.180> ran

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
to seed start rosemary I actually ran

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.480 
to seed start rosemary I actually ran
out<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.810> seeds<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.189> set<00:00:26.340> up<00:00:26.369> your

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
out of seeds but you just set up your

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.939 
out of seeds but you just set up your
seed<00:00:26.820> tray<00:00:27.349> just<00:00:28.349> like<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:30.650> make<00:00:31.650> sure<00:00:31.679> your

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
seed tray just like this make sure your

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.100 
seed tray just like this make sure your
soil<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.520> well<00:00:33.059> packed<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.510> there<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.840> you

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
soil is well packed in there and you

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.080 
soil is well packed in there and you
just<00:00:34.320> drop<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.829> three<00:00:35.190> or<00:00:35.280> four<00:00:35.309> seed<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.910> want

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
just drop in three or four seed you want

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.430 
just drop in three or four seed you want
to<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:36.270> three<00:00:36.510> or<00:00:36.540> four<00:00:36.630> seeds<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.200> rosemary

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
to do three or four seeds with rosemary

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.220 
to do three or four seeds with rosemary
because<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.520> such<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.090> slow<00:00:39.270> germinator<00:00:39.960> and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
because it is such a slow germinator and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.229 
because it is such a slow germinator and
sometimes<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.309> doesn't<00:00:41.460> germinate<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:42.059> all

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
sometimes it doesn't germinate at all

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.700 
sometimes it doesn't germinate at all
and<00:00:42.450> then<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:42.930> press<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.440> about<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
and then you just press it in about a

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.560 
and then you just press it in about a
quarter<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.160> an<00:00:44.309> inch<00:00:45.079> cover<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.230> up<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.149> in<00:00:48.149> 14

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
quarter of an inch cover it up and in 14

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.869 
quarter of an inch cover it up and in 14
to<00:00:48.719> 21<00:00:49.079> days<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.829> should<00:00:50.039> get<00:00:50.190> some<00:00:50.430> seedlings

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
to 21 days you should get some seedlings

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.580 
to 21 days you should get some seedlings
now<00:00:51.059> something<00:00:51.449> interesting<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:52.170> does

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
now something interesting here does

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.869 
now something interesting here does
these<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.890> been<00:00:52.980> growing<00:00:53.309> six<00:00:53.520> or<00:00:53.640> seven

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
these have been growing six or seven

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.119 
these have been growing six or seven
weeks<00:00:53.969> here's<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.360> seed<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.199> germinated

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
weeks here's a seed that just germinated

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.580 
weeks here's a seed that just germinated
so<00:00:56.520> even<00:00:56.820> six<00:00:57.090> weeks<00:00:57.329> later<00:00:57.570> maybe<00:00:57.960> five<00:00:58.350> weeks

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
so even six weeks later maybe five weeks

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.150 
so even six weeks later maybe five weeks
later<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:59.550> seed<00:00:59.789> germinated<00:01:00.270> there<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
later this seed germinated there and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.560 
later this seed germinated there and
then<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> seed<00:01:02.489> germinated<00:01:03.120> there<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.510> you

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
then the seed germinated there so you

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.230 
then the seed germinated there so you
can<00:01:03.870> see<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.920> these<00:01:05.070> are<00:01:05.280> slow<00:01:05.700> germinate

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
can see that these are slow germinate

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.789 
can see that these are slow germinate
errs<00:01:06.360> they<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.600> take<00:01:06.930> some<00:01:07.140> time<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.439> when

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
errs they do take some time so when

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.560 
errs they do take some time so when
you're<00:01:07.920> growing<00:01:08.100> rosemary<00:01:08.670> definitely<00:01:09.420> put

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
you're growing rosemary definitely put

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.440 
you're growing rosemary definitely put
three<00:01:09.840> or<00:01:09.869> four<00:01:10.170> seeds<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.070> cell<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.640> hope

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
three or four seeds in a cell and hope

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.420 
three or four seeds in a cell and hope
for<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> best<00:01:12.750> after<00:01:13.619> about<00:01:13.740> six<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.189> seven

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
for the best after about six or seven

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.190 
for the best after about six or seven
weeks<00:01:14.580> your<00:01:15.090> plants<00:01:15.450> will<00:01:15.540> get<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.960> size

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
weeks your plants will get to this size

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.870 
weeks your plants will get to this size
and<00:01:16.470> they're<00:01:16.560> ready<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> go<00:01:17.040> into<00:01:17.220> transplant

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and they're ready to go into transplant

115 cross it out and next year write

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.469 
115 cross it out and next year write
something<00:01:28.020> new<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.290> there<00:01:28.820> just<00:01:29.820> loosely<00:01:30.210> put

something new on there just loosely put
in<00:01:30.630> your<00:01:30.780> starting<00:01:31.229> mix<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.430> make<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> big

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
in your starting mix and make a big

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.219 
in your starting mix and make a big
circle<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:34.890> finger<00:01:35.689> long<00:01:36.689> large
