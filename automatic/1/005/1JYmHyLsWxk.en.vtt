this<00:01:56.689> which<00:01:57.109> I<00:01:57.349> will<00:01:57.529> put<00:01:57.679> a<00:01:57.709> link<00:01:57.979> down<00:01:58.249> below

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
this which I will put a link down below

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.089 
this which I will put a link down below
so<00:01:59.060> yeah<00:01:59.329> I<00:01:59.539> just<00:01:59.779> got<00:01:59.959> one<00:02:00.109> of<00:02:00.229> theirs<00:02:00.529> kinds

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.099 
so yeah I just got one of theirs kinds

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:02.859 
so yeah I just got one of theirs kinds
of<00:02:01.219> topic<00:02:01.520> up<00:02:01.639> it's<00:02:01.880> really<00:02:02.149> simple<00:02:02.419> you<00:02:02.840> just

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
of topic up it's really simple you just

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.169 
of topic up it's really simple you just
do<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.319> yourself<00:02:03.349> and<00:02:04.069> only<00:02:04.459> takes<00:02:04.849> about<00:02:05.029> half

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
do it yourself and only takes about half

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.239 
do it yourself and only takes about half
an<00:02:05.630> hour<00:02:05.659> or<00:02:06.139> so<00:02:06.349> and<00:02:06.649> I<00:02:06.739> think<00:02:06.950> it's<00:02:07.130> only

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
an hour or so and I think it's only

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.580 
an hour or so and I think it's only
about<00:02:07.429> 7<00:02:08.090> pounds<00:02:08.300> or<00:02:08.660> something<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.349> it's<00:02:09.530> a

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
about 7 pounds or something so it's a

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.920 
about 7 pounds or something so it's a
lot<00:02:09.770> cheaper<00:02:09.800> then<00:02:10.759> getting<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.420> done<00:02:11.630> in<00:02:11.810> the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
lot cheaper then getting it done in the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.440 
lot cheaper then getting it done in the
salon<00:02:12.320> so<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.830> last<00:02:13.070> thing<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.610> got<00:02:13.700> which<00:02:14.420> was

as well and they're not see-through

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.210 
as well and they're not see-through
because<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:54.140> know<00:03:54.260> where<00:03:54.470> you<00:03:54.560> go<00:03:54.709> gym<00:03:55.010> and
