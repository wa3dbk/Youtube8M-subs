game mechanics but like different

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.850 
game mechanics but like different
characters<00:01:03.390> or<00:01:03.809> something<00:01:04.320> cool<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.830> I

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
characters or something cool like that I

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.560

Freddy's<00:01:23.640> story<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:23.880> think<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.270> Scott<00:01:24.509> has

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
Freddy's story I think that Scott has

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.630 
Freddy's story I think that Scott has
completed<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> five<00:01:25.860> nights<00:01:26.159> at<00:01:26.340> Freddy's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.310 
completed the five nights at Freddy's
site<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:26.939> entirely<00:01:27.210> before<00:01:27.479> game<00:01:27.869> franchise

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.510 
site but entirely before game franchise
against<00:01:28.560> he<00:01:28.650> could<00:01:28.740> say<00:01:28.860> up<00:01:28.979> five<00:01:29.189> nights<00:01:29.400> at

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
against he could say up five nights at

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.890 
against he could say up five nights at
Freddy's<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.329> he's<00:01:30.450> going<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> go<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.720> to

done the five nights at Freddy's

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.859 
done the five nights at Freddy's
franchise<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.909> know<00:01:48.060> there's<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.299> lot<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.630> like

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
franchise I know there's a lot of like

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.450 
franchise I know there's a lot of like
unknowns<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.920> there's<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> lot<00:01:50.280> of

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
unknowns and there's a lot of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.789 
unknowns and there's a lot of
speculation<00:01:50.960> about<00:01:51.960> different<00:01:52.320> aspects<00:01:52.680> of

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799

this<00:01:52.950> story<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> think<00:01:53.579> Scott<00:01:53.820> intended

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
this story but I think Scott intended

this story but I think Scott intended
for<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> games<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.649> he<00:01:55.770> didn't

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
for the games to be like that he didn't

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.170 
for the games to be like that he didn't
want<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.130> give<00:01:56.310> away<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> answers<00:01:57.030> guys

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
want to give away all the answers guys

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.639 
want to give away all the answers guys
he<00:01:57.360> wanted<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> community<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.170> thinking<00:01:58.560> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
he wanted the community of thinking to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.959 
he wanted the community of thinking to
come<00:01:58.770> up<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:58.979> these<00:01:59.130> amazing<00:01:59.399> theories

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
come up with these amazing theories

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.910 
come up with these amazing theories
about<00:02:00.479> what<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> story<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.469> game<00:02:01.710> is

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
about what the story of the game is

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.870 
about what the story of the game is
that's<00:02:02.100> what<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.250> really<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:02.549> Scott<00:02:02.850> has

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that's what I really think Scott has

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.370 
that's what I really think Scott has
intended<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.420> do<00:02:03.540> with<00:02:03.659> these<00:02:03.780> five<00:02:04.020> nights<00:02:04.259> at

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
intended to do with these five nights at

intended to do with these five nights at
Freddy's<00:02:04.590> games<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.979> that's<00:02:05.100> why<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> consider

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
Freddy's games and that's why I consider

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.059 
Freddy's games and that's why I consider
these<00:02:05.909> games<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.810> masterpieces<00:02:07.680> they<00:02:07.829> just

these games to be masterpieces they just

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.949 
these games to be masterpieces they just
they<00:02:08.399> bring<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> community<00:02:09.270> together<00:02:09.539> they

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
like that not many games actually let us
