00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
you know we were arrested but even when

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.180 
you know we were arrested but even when
you<00:02:39.140> have<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.290> week<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.620> between<00:02:39.709> playoff

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
you have a week in between playoff

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.680 
you have a week in between playoff
rounds<00:02:40.519> here<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:40.970> always<00:02:41.120> feel<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.420> bit<00:02:41.569> out<00:02:41.660> of

shape and and I think that was the case
for<00:02:43.880> us<00:02:44.090> but<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.810> was<00:02:44.930> no<00:02:45.049> excuse<00:02:45.380> no<00:02:46.190> excuse

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
I think in hindsight you'd have to you

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.349 
I think in hindsight you'd have to you
know<00:03:25.220> tribute<00:03:25.609> some<00:03:25.850> of<00:03:25.970> our<00:03:26.120> problems

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
thought that given the time off that

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.449 
thought that given the time off that
we'd<00:03:32.180> had<00:03:32.390> that<00:03:33.319> we<00:03:33.560> needed<00:03:33.799> to<00:03:33.920> get<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.250> rust
