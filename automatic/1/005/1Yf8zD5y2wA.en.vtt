00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.480
 tells crowd is meza the mário mustache 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.029
 bringing another video releases the child from 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.939
 online radio channel for you 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.590
 and this video is a training for you and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.350
 there you have doubts about how the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.740
 dubbing as the roger of outrage at 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.640
 rigor left the plan the nic mendonça 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.859
 in a game 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.440
 So this video for you takes a look 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.570
 in some scenes I separated some 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.940
 moments of speech from him and others 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.770
 characters from the first episodes 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.480
 and then you will be able to check how it is 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:50.430
 in my opinion the next shit 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.910
 in scenes that are not action demanding a 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.670
 performance and such one is with vigor by 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.219
 For example, he looks really good on me. 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.070
 I thought I thought it was quiet, lita. 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.460
 coherent with the scene in that in those with 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.140
 conversations a little more casual like that 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.630
 but I found it a little bit that I missed it 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.479
 give you an experience to be an actor 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.600
 even when it's time for the nation to scream 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.159
 with criminals for example I found 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.530
 which was very very serene if the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.990
 personal criminal would not respect the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.820
 face would not be afraid with the guy 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.750
 talking the way he talks and 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.040
 funny because that's how you stand half a dozen 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.200
 or this is not it? 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.509
 but the guy speaks with his tongue stuck like this 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.400
 not that I have a perfect diction but 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.850
 the person who has the tongue stuck talking 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.119
 end up funny every turn not 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.430
 This is such a fun and entertaining game. 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.030
 have a company also forgive me but it is 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.189
 I do not think he's the ideal guy. 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.670
 For this I do not know why they called 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.280
 he but as I said in more scenes 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.009
 Calm down, I think he is. I think 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.770
 all right in the text of the question're cool 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.140
 some things have not been translated 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.370
 so more colloquially but other 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.250
 they were cool as 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.560
 the police officer who will answer if he is 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.950
 with something he speaks negatively 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.220
 instead of talking not talking or typing 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.260
 nor an alleged crooked type, nor is it 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.680
 was cool means that there colloquial 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.900
 more is to give a greater dimension to 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.409
 Who is listening in the Portuguese language? 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.750
 huh 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:36.720
 it does not look like the guy is reading this 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.129
 so that's what they are there and analyze 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.569
 you comment below the video in the 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.540
