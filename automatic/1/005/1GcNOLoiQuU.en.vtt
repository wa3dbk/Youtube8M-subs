00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
um what I'm going to do is probably mix

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.550

some clear acrylic powder in each jar

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.790 
some clear acrylic powder in each jar
and<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.180> can<00:03:11.390> use<00:03:11.570> them<00:03:11.810> on<00:03:12.049> my<00:03:12.290> nails

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
to say that the packaging that the

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.920 
to say that the packaging that the
shipment<00:05:10.190> the<00:05:10.580> shipping<00:05:11.000> this<00:05:11.150> time<00:05:11.450> was<00:05:11.660> much

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
shipment the shipping this time was much

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.750 
shipment the shipping this time was much
faster<00:05:12.260> the<00:05:13.130> packaging<00:05:13.820> was<00:05:14.360> um<00:05:15.760> the

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
faster the packaging was um the

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.600 
faster the packaging was um the
packaging<00:05:17.270> of<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.510> of<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.990> stuff<00:05:18.260> is<00:05:18.440> fair<00:05:19.370> I

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
packaging of the of the stuff is fair I

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.310 
packaging of the of the stuff is fair I
want<00:05:19.789> to<00:05:19.849> say<00:05:19.970> that<00:05:20.180> the<00:05:20.599> packaging<00:05:21.050> for<00:05:21.200> these

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
want to say that the packaging for these

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.040 
want to say that the packaging for these
was<00:05:21.680> nice<00:05:22.150> packaging<00:05:23.150> for<00:05:23.330> this<00:05:23.450> as<00:05:23.660> you<00:05:23.900> can

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
was nice packaging for this as you can

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.660 
was nice packaging for this as you can
see<00:05:24.200> it<00:05:24.320> flew<00:05:24.530> all<00:05:24.710> over<00:05:24.740> the<00:05:25.039> place

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
see it flew all over the place

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.730 
see it flew all over the place
it's<00:05:26.970> fair<00:05:27.330> I<00:05:27.660> like<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.200> fact<00:05:28.350> that<00:05:28.470> you<00:05:28.620> can

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
it's fair I like the fact that you can

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.840 
it's fair I like the fact that you can
keep<00:05:28.920> them<00:05:29.040> and<00:05:29.190> something<00:05:29.430> like<00:05:29.460> this<00:05:29.670> so<00:05:29.820> i'm

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
keep them and something like this so i'm

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.060 
keep them and something like this so i'm
probably<00:05:30.150> going<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:30.480> buy<00:05:31.050> a<00:05:31.290> better<00:05:31.560> container

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
probably going to buy a better container

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.890 
probably going to buy a better container
to<00:05:32.280> keep<00:05:32.460> my<00:05:32.610> glitters<00:05:33.030> in<00:05:33.210> because<00:05:33.510> this<00:05:33.720> is

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
to keep my glitters in because this is

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.870 
to keep my glitters in because this is
kind<00:05:34.110> of<00:05:34.260> like<00:05:34.380> once<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:34.800> open<00:05:35.250> it<00:05:35.340> I<00:05:35.490> couldn't

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
kind of like once I open it I couldn't

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.670 
kind of like once I open it I couldn't
get<00:05:36.030> it<00:05:36.120> back<00:05:36.330> to<00:05:36.540> close<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:37.230> way<00:05:37.380> it<00:05:37.530> was

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
get it back to close the way it was

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.480 
get it back to close the way it was
before<00:05:38.070> so<00:05:38.870> yeah<00:05:39.870> there's<00:05:40.620> not<00:05:40.860> too<00:05:41.070> much<00:05:41.220> of

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
before so yeah there's not too much of

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.340 
before so yeah there's not too much of
like<00:05:41.760> negative<00:05:42.360> stuff<00:05:42.750> to<00:05:42.900> say<00:05:43.050> because<00:05:43.200> I

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
like negative stuff to say because I

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.140 
like negative stuff to say because I
haven't<00:05:43.650> actually<00:05:43.950> tried<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:44.580> product
