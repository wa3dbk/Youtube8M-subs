house<00:02:14.070> was<00:02:14.490> gonna<00:02:14.700> crash<00:02:14.970> or<00:02:15.450> whatever<00:02:15.900> but

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
house was gonna crash or whatever but

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.700 
house was gonna crash or whatever but
everything<00:02:17.700> kind<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:17.970> stabilized<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:19.020> maybe

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
everything kind of stabilized and maybe

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.490 
everything kind of stabilized and maybe
one<00:02:20.040> market<00:02:20.460> tanked<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:21.320> everything<00:02:22.320> was

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
one market tanked but everything was

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.710 
one market tanked but everything was
kind<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:22.800> okay<00:02:23.130> everyone<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.210> still<00:02:24.480> making

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
kind of okay everyone is still making

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.550 
kind of okay everyone is still making
money<00:02:24.930> right<00:02:26.660> that's<00:02:27.660> what<00:02:27.960> this<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.170> going<00:02:28.440> to

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
money right that's what this is going to

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.250 
money right that's what this is going to
be<00:02:28.770> like<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:30.090> reason<00:02:30.420> people<00:02:30.690> still<00:02:31.110> make

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
be like the reason people still make

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260 
be like the reason people still make
money<00:02:31.440> when<00:02:31.680> auction<00:02:32.010> houses<00:02:32.340> grow<00:02:32.610> has<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.120> do

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
money when auction houses grow has to do

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.210 
money when auction houses grow has to do
with<00:02:33.510> some<00:02:33.690> neat<00:02:33.900> economic<00:02:34.530> theories<00:02:34.860> having

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
with some neat economic theories having

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.340 
with some neat economic theories having
to<00:02:35.310> do<00:02:35.460> with<00:02:35.700> imperfect<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.990> perfect

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
to do with imperfect and perfect

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.420 
to do with imperfect and perfect
competition<00:02:38.150> market<00:02:39.150> elasticity<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
competition market elasticity and the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.830 
competition market elasticity and the
fact<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.820> prices<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:43.140> WoW<00:02:43.700> decrease

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
fact that prices in WoW decrease

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.230 
fact that prices in WoW decrease
according<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.709> inverse<00:02:47.610> log<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.720> the

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
according to the inverse log of the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.830 
according to the inverse log of the
market<00:02:51.240> size<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.989> server<00:02:52.890> population<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.910> so

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
market size the server population and so

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.940 
market size the server population and so
the<00:02:55.080> last<00:02:55.260> part<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:56.150> what<00:02:57.150> I'll<00:02:57.390> focus<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.560> and

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
the last part is what I'll focus on and

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.870 
the last part is what I'll focus on and
that's<00:02:59.160> pretty<00:02:59.760> much<00:03:00.000> just<00:03:00.380> saying<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:02.310> if

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
that's pretty much just saying that if

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.630 
that's pretty much just saying that if
the<00:03:03.480> auction<00:03:04.290> house<00:03:04.500> size<00:03:04.860> if<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.400> server

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
the auction house size if the server

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.570 
the auction house size if the server
size<00:03:06.000> doubles<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:07.200> price<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.370> goods

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
size doubles the price of the goods

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.699 
size doubles the price of the goods
won't<00:03:09.000> fall<00:03:09.300> in<00:03:09.480> half<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.110> let's<00:03:10.350> say<00:03:10.440> you're

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
won't fall in half so let's say you're

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.070 
won't fall in half so let's say you're
selling<00:03:11.100> gems<00:03:11.430> for<00:03:11.790> 200<00:03:12.270> gold<00:03:12.480> each<00:03:12.780> and

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
selling gems for 200 gold each and

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.650 
selling gems for 200 gold each and
you're<00:03:13.800> selling<00:03:14.160> 10<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.489> them<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.790> day<00:03:15.000> then

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
you're selling 10 of them a day then

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.590 
you're selling 10 of them a day then
you're<00:03:15.810> making<00:03:16.110> 2,000<00:03:16.739> gold<00:03:16.830> if<00:03:17.130> your<00:03:17.850> server

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
you're making 2,000 gold if your server

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.070 
you're making 2,000 gold if your server
doubles<00:03:19.290> then<00:03:19.739> you'll<00:03:20.519> be<00:03:20.670> selling<00:03:21.060> 20<00:03:21.660> gems<00:03:21.930> a

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
doubles then you'll be selling 20 gems a

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.410 
doubles then you'll be selling 20 gems a
day<00:03:22.260> but<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.100> won't<00:03:23.280> be<00:03:23.549> selling<00:03:23.850> them<00:03:24.150> for<00:03:24.180> a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
day but you won't be selling them for a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.330 
day but you won't be selling them for a
hundred<00:03:24.720> gold<00:03:24.959> you'll<00:03:25.350> be<00:03:25.500> selling<00:03:25.920> them<00:03:26.130> for

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
hundred gold you'll be selling them for

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.509 
hundred gold you'll be selling them for
a<00:03:26.850> hundred<00:03:27.720> twenty-five<00:03:28.290> gold<00:03:28.739> or<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.070> hundred

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
a hundred twenty-five gold or a hundred

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.759 
a hundred twenty-five gold or a hundred
fifty<00:03:30.000> gold<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:31.140> you'll<00:03:31.380> really<00:03:31.680> be

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
fifty gold and so you'll really be

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.850 
fifty gold and so you'll really be
making<00:03:32.340> three<00:03:32.730> thousand<00:03:33.239> gold<00:03:33.390> from<00:03:34.290> those

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
making three thousand gold from those

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.039 
making three thousand gold from those
gems<00:03:35.310> because<00:03:35.850> you'll<00:03:36.000> be<00:03:36.060> selling<00:03:36.600> twice<00:03:36.810> as

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
gems because you'll be selling twice as

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.740 
gems because you'll be selling twice as
many<00:03:37.230> for<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.830> little<00:03:38.220> bit<00:03:38.430> more<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.090> in<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.600> end

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
many for a little bit more so in the end

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.449 
many for a little bit more so in the end
you'll<00:03:40.200> be<00:03:40.380> actually<00:03:41.100> making<00:03:41.370> more<00:03:41.880> money<00:03:43.459> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
you'll be actually making more money the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.860 
you'll be actually making more money the
only<00:03:44.670> problem<00:03:44.880> with<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.480> we're

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
only problem with this is that we're

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.720 
only problem with this is that we're
talking<00:03:45.900> about<00:03:46.260> revenue<00:03:46.769> increase<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.489> not

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
talking about revenue increase and not

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.810 
talking about revenue increase and not
profit<00:03:48.330> increase<00:03:48.810> so<00:03:49.410> on<00:03:49.799> servers<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.640> have

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
profit increase so on servers that have

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.460 
profit increase so on servers that have
twenty<00:03:51.239> percent<00:03:51.540> Alliance<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.230> eighty

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
twenty percent Alliance and eighty

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.520 
twenty percent Alliance and eighty
percent<00:03:52.709> hoard<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.910> Alliance<00:03:54.480> is<00:03:54.750> going<00:03:55.440> to

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
percent hoard the Alliance is going to

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.970 
percent hoard the Alliance is going to
see<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.890> huge<00:03:56.370> decrease<00:03:56.850> in<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:58.170> price<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.709> the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
see a huge decrease in the price of the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.120 
see a huge decrease in the price of the
goods<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.610> so<00:04:00.209> people<00:04:00.780> like<00:04:01.130> blacksmiths

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
goods and so people like blacksmiths

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.289 
goods and so people like blacksmiths
dual<00:04:02.640> crafters<00:04:03.150> or<00:04:03.390> take<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.690> crafters<00:04:04.260> um

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
dual crafters or take the crafters um

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.300 
dual crafters or take the crafters um
they<00:04:06.299> aren't<00:04:06.840> going<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.260> be<00:04:07.380> able<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.920> turn<00:04:08.250> a

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
they aren't going to be able to turn a

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.270 
they aren't going to be able to turn a
profit<00:04:08.580> on<00:04:08.940> their<00:04:09.180> goods<00:04:09.470> but<00:04:10.470> generally

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
profit on their goods but generally

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.860 
profit on their goods but generally
those<00:04:11.489> servers<00:04:11.820> have<00:04:12.180> already<00:04:12.450> been<00:04:12.600> merged

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
those servers have already been merged

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.039 
those servers have already been merged
with<00:04:13.350> other<00:04:13.760> other<00:04:14.760> servers<00:04:15.299> that<00:04:15.570> balance

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
with other other servers that balance

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.870 
with other other servers that balance
that<00:04:16.320> out<00:04:16.350> so<00:04:17.340> we<00:04:18.200> should<00:04:19.200> be<00:04:19.380> good<00:04:19.700> most<00:04:20.700> of

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
that out so we should be good most of

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.839 
that out so we should be good most of
that's<00:04:21.000> already<00:04:21.359> been<00:04:21.540> taken<00:04:21.750> care<00:04:21.930> of<00:04:22.140> by<00:04:22.470> now

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
that's already been taken care of by now

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.520 
that's already been taken care of by now
and<00:04:23.849> if<00:04:24.000> they<00:04:24.180> haven't<00:04:24.390> they<00:04:24.720> will<00:04:24.930> be<00:04:25.110> by<00:04:25.470> the

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
and if they haven't they will be by the

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.480 
and if they haven't they will be by the
time<00:04:25.770> of

time of

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.430
