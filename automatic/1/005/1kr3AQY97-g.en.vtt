00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.560
 really show piece in the week 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.660
 I was allowed to find out which one I brought for you 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.619
 and the case was there of course 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.490
 made very easy 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.090
 I feel a bit in the monkey 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.099
 ok okay sweetness koeni jan i had 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.809
 until recently and I was up for three weeks 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.430
 vacation so that was not so crazy because 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.530
 heard nothing at all from sweet cake 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.480
 but you know sweet I'll come that we 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.190
 an old microsoft franchise for him 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.680
 previously always on the PC 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.000
 now for xbox 360 and xbox one is for 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.719
 such a version became mainly here 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.420
 shown 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.030
 and yes it is a tycoon game in which you 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.430
 so yes animals must manage as it were 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.870
 and it was the spirit of bill gates 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.940
 around in this game 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.219
 the and blood bill gates the the man who 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.680
 is giving away his billions along month 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.180
 yes because you have monkeys in the game 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.610
 well among other things but it is more one 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.220
 good the charity behind the game it 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.140
 is so that anyway part of the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.390
 sweet cake proceeds go to it 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.150
 world nature fund and an organization 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.659
 that puts wild animals back in the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.520
 nature 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.290
 yes and the nice thing about it is you 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.710
 affect where the money goes 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.320
 is going 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.799
 so the moment you see from 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.430
 ethereal a very rare elephant with 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.869
 pink dots is made dead in kenya and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.850
 that's in the news and you think so 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.810
 of hematite'm not okay and we m 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.400
 our elephants must donate to it 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.840
 wild and in the game you can them 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.060
 stake out in the wild 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.770
 and when, for example, one and 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.869
 target was achieved like a thousand 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.240
 Elephants have been released into the wild themselves 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.479
 microsoft okay that's very good 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.689
 community here we give now 100,000 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.790
 euros to that organization for that 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.750
 oil okay then a little about the game 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.969
 did you think so 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.280
 I like it or I had something like that 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.520
 I like the animals the very nice look 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.439
 rest of the game not necessarily very much 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.860
 neat and in that sense of smoke 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.970
 completely mad 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.710
 but 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.570
 I thought the people there were really the spark 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.750
 look fantastic and were quite a few 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.300
 well you can walk all the way around your park 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.250
 you can feel them yourself you can all 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.990
 corners and holes of the park you can 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.300
 seen from a variety of points of view at 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.040
 This absolute bed saw looked very good 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.820
 and it was very tired and and that in and 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.830
 zoom out 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.940
 but it is just so cool and in addition 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.070
 that is actually enough for me 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.780
 but it is i just think it is more 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.300
 you don't necessarily know about action games 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.650
 sometimes you expect revolutionary new ones 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.750
 things but this is just this just one 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.000
 huge upgrade from sweet to do but whatever 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.160
 do you think of the cache ron s of the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.070
 game because let's be honest this is 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.660
 really focused on kids kids and and 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.980
 people who like sweet cake ron like it 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.300
 is very accessible you get 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.130
 Constant help becomes real to it 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.290
 hand if you do not understand what you 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.640
 you can do via very simple 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.040
 menu structure 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.590
 call in help yes you can ask yourself 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.320
 is challenging enough but good you can 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.940
 well research 'you can do all that 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.660
 Do things that you actually do at a time 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.459
 then 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.590
 only the sit is a kind of cash 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.440
 guys over which like real ones 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.970
 hardcore fan I think a little too little and 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.110
 you pull I think that's right I think 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.850
 it's more a customization so 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.200
 outdoors game is then a hardcore too 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.820
 to do 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.489
 well then let's have a bite 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:32.519
 eat and then we continue with the rest 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:34.390
 of the game you do need some food actually 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.080
 within 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.080
 no i'm up to it 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.470
 Oh
