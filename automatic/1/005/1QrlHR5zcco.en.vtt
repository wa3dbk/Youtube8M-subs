00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.190 
whatever and I welded the other piece to
the<00:02:18.040> bottom<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.629> bought<00:02:19.629> your<00:02:19.870> uncle

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
the bottom of that bought your uncle

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.839 
the bottom of that bought your uncle
it's<00:02:20.680> got<00:02:20.799> a<00:02:20.830> little<00:02:20.980> bit<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.220> flex<00:02:21.459> which<00:02:21.700> is

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
it's got a little bit of flex which is

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.259 
it's got a little bit of flex which is
good<00:02:22.500> I'll<00:02:23.500> run<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.860> stacks<00:02:24.190> out<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.819> here<00:02:25.150> and

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
good I'll run the stacks out to here and

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.680 
good I'll run the stacks out to here and
then<00:02:25.420> probably<00:02:26.319> go<00:02:26.500> up<00:02:26.739> here<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:28.360> it'll<00:02:28.540> be<00:02:28.660> a

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
then probably go up here so it'll be a

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.720 
then probably go up here so it'll be a
little<00:02:29.019> bit<00:02:29.110> wide<00:02:29.379> I<00:02:29.769> can<00:02:30.400> even<00:02:30.519> put<00:02:30.700> a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
little bit wide I can even put a

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.580 
little bit wide I can even put a
freaking<00:02:31.060> handle<00:02:31.450> on<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.720> here<00:02:31.959> so<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.200> can<00:02:32.440> get

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
freaking handle on to here so I can get

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.009 
freaking handle on to here so I can get
up<00:02:32.680> onto<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.069> flat<00:02:33.250> tech<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:34.750> got<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.380> get<00:02:35.470> my
