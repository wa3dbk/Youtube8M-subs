going to bring it to about the end until

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.940 
going to bring it to about the end until
you<00:02:13.820> really<00:02:14.060> can't<00:02:14.300> write<00:02:14.720> anymore<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.380> then

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
you really can't write anymore and then

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.920 
you really can't write anymore and then
just<00:02:16.100> wrap<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.310> around<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.760> base<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.120> your<00:02:17.300> bun

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
I think it's just a nice little way to

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.940 
I think it's just a nice little way to
add<00:02:23.360> some<00:02:23.570> spice<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.780> your<00:02:23.930> normal<00:02:24.230> buns
