institute of food technologists and
we've<00:00:07.319> been<00:00:07.470> talking<00:00:07.830> about<00:00:07.919> food<00:00:08.309> safety<00:00:08.599> we

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
we've been talking about food safety we

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.780 
we've been talking about food safety we
just<00:00:09.870> defrosted<00:00:10.800> some<00:00:10.860> foods<00:00:11.280> now<00:00:11.639> we're

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
just defrosted some foods now we're

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:20.050 
just defrosted some foods now we're
going<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:11.969> heat<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.179> up<00:00:12.360> in<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.630> microwave

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.279 

sometimes<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.270> difficult<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.840> tell<00:00:22.020> if<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
sometimes it's difficult to tell if a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.870 
sometimes it's difficult to tell if a
food<00:00:22.439> has<00:00:22.740> been<00:00:22.980> thoroughly<00:00:23.189> cooked<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.789> the

food has been thoroughly cooked in the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.370 
food has been thoroughly cooked in the
microwave<00:00:23.910> especially<00:00:24.869> when<00:00:25.050> you're<00:00:25.199> working

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
your food is done is to use a

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.740 
your food is done is to use a
temperature<00:00:33.120> thermometer<00:00:35.630> there<00:00:36.630> are

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
temperature thermometer there are

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.330 
temperature thermometer there are
several<00:00:36.960> different<00:00:37.469> kinds<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.100> have

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
several different kinds you can have

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.780 
several different kinds you can have
digital<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.960> regular<00:00:40.320> dial<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:41.309> has<00:00:41.489> some

listed<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.960> happens<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
listed on it what happens in the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.049 
listed on it what happens in the
microwave<00:00:46.890> compared<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> say<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
microwave compared to say on the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.750 
microwave compared to say on the
stovetop<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> food<00:00:49.770> may<00:00:50.190> not<00:00:50.430> heat

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
stovetop is that the food may not heat

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.000 
stovetop is that the food may not heat
evenly<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.750> may<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:51.989> portions<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
evenly so you may have portions of the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.430 
evenly so you may have portions of the
food<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.219> are<00:00:53.460> very<00:00:53.579> hot<00:00:53.940> other<00:00:54.270> parts<00:00:55.050> that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
food that are very hot other parts that

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.529 
food that are very hot other parts that
are<00:00:55.559> really<00:00:55.860> cold<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.059> just<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.420> way

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
are really cold and this is just the way

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.270 
are really cold and this is just the way
part<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> way<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.590> microwave<00:00:59.010> works

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
part of the way that the microwave works

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.720 
part of the way that the microwave works
so<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.090> may<00:01:00.359> want<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.719> stop<00:01:01.020> food<00:01:01.640> when<00:01:02.640> you

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
so you may want to stop food when you

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.939 
so you may want to stop food when you
think<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.149> been<00:01:03.359> heated<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.350> little<00:01:04.619> bit<00:01:04.799> and

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
think it's been heated a little bit and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
think it's been heated a little bit and
stir<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.000> try<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.450> some<00:01:06.689> mixing

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
stir it up to try to get some mixing

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.260 
stir it up to try to get some mixing
it's<00:01:07.830> also<00:01:08.040> recommended<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.850> when<00:01:09.119> you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
it's also recommended that when you

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.910 
it's also recommended that when you
think<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> food<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.990> finished<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.650> addition

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
think the food is finished in addition

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.100 
think the food is finished in addition
to<00:01:11.220> using<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.670> thermometer<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.750> wait<00:01:12.930> about

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
to using a thermometer you wait about

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.190 
to using a thermometer you wait about
two<00:01:13.560> minutes<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:14.070> let<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.460> food<00:01:14.760> finish<00:01:15.200> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
two minutes to let the food finish to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.550 
two minutes to let the food finish to
let<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> heat<00:01:16.619> equilibrate<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.689> we'll<00:01:18.810> stop

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
let the heat equilibrate so we'll stop

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.550 
let the heat equilibrate so we'll stop
our<00:01:19.770> food<00:01:20.009> right<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:20.869> we'll<00:01:21.869> use<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> clean

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
our food right now we'll use a clean

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.710 
our food right now we'll use a clean
utensil<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.670> fork<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:25.939> I<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.119> feel<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
utensil a fork and I can feel that the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.819 
utensil a fork and I can feel that the
outer<00:01:27.930> edge<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.500> food<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.890> pretty<00:01:29.400> hot<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
outer edge of this food is pretty hot I

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.039 
outer edge of this food is pretty hot I
even<00:01:31.829> see<00:01:32.070> some<00:01:32.250> steam<00:01:32.579> coming<00:01:32.939> off<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.930> I'm

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
even see some steam coming off but I'm

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.810 
even see some steam coming off but I'm
going<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.290> give<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.619> stir<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.280> case<00:01:35.520> and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
going to give it a stir just in case and

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.469 
going to give it a stir just in case and
as<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> test<00:01:36.869> we<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.920> check<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:38.460> what<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
as a test we can check and see what the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.219 
as a test we can check and see what the
temperature<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:39.930> right<00:01:40.259> now<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.930> we'll<00:01:43.020> stick

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
temperature is right now so we'll stick

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.139 
temperature is right now so we'll stick
