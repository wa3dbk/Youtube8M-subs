 you watch the topic of the week in the studio Tatyana 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.099
 Kozyreva Hello Wednesday, April 8 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.950
 Petersburg Governor George 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.570
 Poltavchenko addressed the deputies 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.540
 registry office with a traditional job report 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.939
 Government for 2014 and outlined 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.739
 priorities for the future what are the prospects 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.919
 expect the construction industry of the city 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.930
 look in our issue 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.700
 this year brought us new challenges on 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.980
 who Petersburg reacted 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.200
 promptly and decently with this positive 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.420
 notes george poltavchenko began his speech 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.440
 appreciating the construction industry governor 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.480
 certainly celebrated 2014 records 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.940
 2014 taking into account the multiplicative 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.760
 effect of the industry attracted to the main 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.300
 Petersburg funds of about 400 billion 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.060
 rubles 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.250
 first about the Soviet history of the city 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.030
 the construction committee has executed its 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.130
 budget allocations 84 percent 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.930
 177 facilities commissioned 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.360
 utility and transport 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.519
 construction 28 objects 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.250
 health physical education and 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.210
 Sports 18 educational facilities in volume 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.460
 including 13 kindergartens 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.070
 total here are residential and non-residential facilities 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.810
 Petersburg amounted to 6.3 million 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.820
 square there is no george 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.890
 Poltavchenko said that save such 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.900
 volumes this year are unlikely to succeed 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.610
 construction market participants need 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.710
 time to get used to raising prices 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.830
 on building materials and rebuild 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.570
 financing mechanism 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.190
 the city does not intend to soon take 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.880
 new commitment to 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.040
 construction 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.350
 engineering and social infrastructure 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.030
 during the development of the territory the worst that can 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.970
 now make the city start again 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.530
 approve all that the investor will deign and 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.229
 grab construction commitments 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.799
 engineering networks of roads for another 2 pa 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.409
 budget from aha urgent interests 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.220
 Petersburg and the townspeople we do not retreat 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.070
 super 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.020
 so I advise Deril and developer 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.270
 Immediately think about reasonable cooperation with 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.350
 cities in one form or another 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.540
 public private partnership 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.819
 either look for new partners and merge 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.289
 effort what does it mean will it slow down 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.390
 development of the construction industry in general 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.250
 or infrastructure construction time 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.120
 lies on the shoulders of real estate investors, we asked 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.709
 our experts 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.530
 unit when the city on various and 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.470
 a cup which the city is literate 59 and 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.540
 swam on training and how he will 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.280
 some how they see these delay 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.380
 project but nothing has changed 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.000
 ionizers with they develop engineering 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.739
 infrastructure development point of view 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.390
 social infrastructure to schools and 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.180
 kindergartens are also in fact 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.510
 Well, besides this, there are other types 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.250
 the object if they were still like works but i 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.030
 I'm afraid there is wrong there honey 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.640
 pancake 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.890
 they should not be clearly on someone 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.900
 certainly one that is certainly 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.940
 plots even got to the city because 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.750
 what is it all the same to develop 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.600
 infrastructure yes here are some norms and 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.970
 Understandably, what the developer do 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.380
 what a little while should 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.630
 maintain overall construction 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.519
 community tends to 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.260
 such a city â€‹â€‹policy development 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.700
 the construction industry can really 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.140
 slow down also some 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.100
 developers say that they can 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.120
 rise and cost per square meter 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.220
 the governor said that now need 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.980
 focus on integrated development 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.780
 territories to build not only housing 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.410
 but also all the necessary social and 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.840
 transport 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.359
 engineering infrastructure at the same time among 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.739
 most promising investment 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.049
 projects georgy poltavchenko mentioned 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.910
 development of a large port area 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.799
 Petersburg port zone bronco ii 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.959
 quite resonant project 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.310
 satellite town south foot means 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.170
 satellite city southern i am very 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.220
 skeptical about this project and 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:53.160
 I think that he just does not need clubs in 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.989
 huge claim number and common and with 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.400
 environmental point of view 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.739
 and cultural heritage 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.920
 honestly me very understandable bee sergey 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.900
 so appreciates this project can 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.000
 he will bring a colossal transport 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.069
 overload to the fact that all these people will 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.590
 go to work in petersburg this there 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.290
 It was 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.480
 and in general, we are not better in my opinion 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.129
 however, the deputy fully agrees with 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.620
 the fact that the territory under construction 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.690
 need to master the complex but notes 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.519
 the fact that the standards for pre-construction 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.960
 design will now approve 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.479
 administration of Smolny 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.860
 is an absolute minus and I know that 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.590
 out of tremendous pressure from 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.940
 developers so that the regulations cram so 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.190
 that would be possible housing 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.470
 build more links accordingly 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.500
 turned out to be smaller and really wearing 6 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.150
 sand pressure all the same will be able to succumb 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.400
 worth noting that this week 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.240
 Vice Governor Marat Oganesyan 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.340
 submitted to the deputies 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.290
 draft law amending 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.210
 the general plan of Petersburg and here 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.130
 preferred low-rise 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.229
 building up and increasing the number of 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.760
 recreational areas and this means that 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.870
 developers' profitability may decrease 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.400
 the governor in his report also 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.560
 spoke about the development of transport 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.690
 infrastructure in St. Petersburg in particular 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.639
 that there are no such stations in the city and 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.060
 Underground construction 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.010
 which 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.289
 would be delayed due to lack of money 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.970
 cities for example southwestern so 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.460
 necessary to the townspeople promise to pass 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.289
 on time in 2020 also george 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.940
 Poltavchenko expressed his position on 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.440
 about the construction of the highway number 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.860
 seven which must go through 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.000
 separate park road from the center to 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.970
 side of Zelenogorsk along 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.900
 railway tracks will come 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.789
 it was foreseen by everyone 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:36.099
 cities over the past 30 years and not us her 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.660
 from there excludes the integrity of the specific 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.610
 the park can be saved if its in 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.410
 boundaries 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.360
 the highway will pass either underground or 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.070
 on the overpass besides the governor 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.050
 noted that all scheduled for this 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.740
 year road junction will be started and 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.510
 delivered on time 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.430
 and the project of the Smolensk bridge in alignment 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.990
 Greater Smolensky Prospect in the list 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.010
 to allocate funding from the budget 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:59.320
 is the first number of the main key 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.120
 the task of building the governor called 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.550
 ranking all investment 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.840
 projects from the budget priority will receive 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.700
 those for which there is a contract 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.590
 obligations of the city and those that are already 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.450
 ready for 70 percent or more 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.310
 the need will also be taken into account 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.930
 territory social infrastructure 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.030
 the ability to attract private and 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.890
 federal funds and that governor 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.900
 noted more than once during his report 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.930
 tax revenues to the city budget 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.389
 across from 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.030
 two years after the implementation of this or that 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:28.990
 project you watched the topic of the week with you 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.990
 There was Tatyana Kozyrev
