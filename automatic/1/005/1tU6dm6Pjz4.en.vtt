he<00:00:00.480> too<00:00:00.750> was<00:00:00.900> fond<00:00:01.140> commanded<00:00:01.680> COBOL<00:00:01.979> here<00:00:02.100> and

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
he too was fond commanded COBOL here and

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.610 
he too was fond commanded COBOL here and
today<00:00:02.460> I'm<00:00:02.669> gonna<00:00:02.820> be<00:00:02.970> showing<00:00:03.149> you<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.750> better

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
today I'm gonna be showing you a better

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.940 
today I'm gonna be showing you a better
way<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.009> put<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.850> delay<00:00:06.299> on<00:00:06.330> things<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.200> it's

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
way to put a delay on things and it's

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.180 
way to put a delay on things and it's
really<00:00:08.220> really<00:00:09.030> simple<00:00:09.960> so<00:00:10.230> it's<00:00:10.860> not<00:00:11.010> too

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
really really simple so it's not too

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.660 
really really simple so it's not too
hard<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.429> understand<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.059> basically<00:00:12.599> normally

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
hard to understand so basically normally

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.970 
hard to understand so basically normally
delay<00:00:14.670> something<00:00:15.120> like<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.740> it's

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
delay something like this and it's

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.700 
delay something like this and it's
really<00:00:17.390> complicated<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.690> have<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.020> take

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
really complicated and you have to take

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.400 
really complicated and you have to take
forever<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.400> set<00:00:20.880> every<00:00:21.119> tick<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.199> only

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
forever to set every tick and this only

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.970 
forever to set every tick and this only
lasts<00:00:22.769> about<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.010> good<00:00:23.250> 10<00:00:23.720> seconds<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.019> it's

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
lasts about a good 10 seconds and it's

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.700 
lasts about a good 10 seconds and it's
just<00:00:26.220> not<00:00:26.369> worth<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.180> basically<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.590> you

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
just not worth it so basically what you

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.700 
just not worth it so basically what you
could<00:00:28.830> do<00:00:28.949> instead<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:30.260> if<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.410> have<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
could do instead is if you have the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.130 
could do instead is if you have the
materials<00:00:32.250> if<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.000> creative<00:00:33.450> then<00:00:33.960> this

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
materials if it's in creative then this

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.350 
materials if it's in creative then this
is<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:34.530> easy<00:00:34.739> if<00:00:36.350> you<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.500> need<00:00:37.680> blocks

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
is really easy if you just need blocks

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.060 
is really easy if you just need blocks
powered<00:00:39.360> rails<00:00:39.570> rails<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:42.710> command<00:00:43.710> bog<00:00:43.860> may

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
powered rails rails and command bog may

spider<00:00:47.250> webs<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.820> don't<00:00:47.969> even<00:00:48.120> know<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.329> that's

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
spider webs I don't even know if that's

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.130 
spider webs I don't even know if that's
collectible<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.469> survival<00:00:50.120> but<00:00:51.140> anyway

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
collectible in a survival but anyway

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.260 
collectible in a survival but anyway
this<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.440> how<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:52.980> basically<00:00:53.879> this

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
this is how you do it so basically this

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.979 
this is how you do it so basically this
cart<00:00:54.719> falls<00:00:55.710> down<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.879> sets<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.480> off<00:00:57.690> and

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
cart falls down and it sets this off and

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.470 
cart falls down and it sets this off and
then<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.199> goes<00:00:58.379> back<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.070> resets<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
then it goes back up and resets and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.810 
then it goes back up and resets and
basically<00:01:01.820> each<00:01:02.820> web<00:01:03.589> is<00:01:04.589> 30<00:01:05.220> seconds<00:01:05.670> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
basically each web is 30 seconds so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.490 
basically each web is 30 seconds so
that's<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.150> minute<00:01:06.510> that's<00:01:06.750> two<00:01:07.020> minutes<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
that's a minute that's two minutes and

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.800 
that's a minute that's two minutes and
that's<00:01:07.710> two<00:01:08.400> minutes<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.909> half<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.420> two<00:01:09.510> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that's two minutes and a half so two and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.859 
that's two minutes and a half so two and
a<00:01:10.049> half<00:01:10.200> minutes<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.430> whole<00:01:11.970> system<00:01:12.299> and

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
a half minutes for this whole system and

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.429 
a half minutes for this whole system and
you<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.619> course<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:15.140> Optima<00:01:16.140> or

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
you can of course this is a Optima or

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.170 
you can of course this is a Optima or
model<00:01:17.479> modifiable<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.930> guess<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.560> word<00:01:19.710> and

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
model modifiable I guess is the word and

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.760 
model modifiable I guess is the word and
you<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.420> make<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.229> high<00:01:22.380> Z<00:01:22.590> one

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
you can make this go as high Z one

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.999 
you can make this go as high Z one
biggest<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.280> way<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:24.119> want<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.740> now<00:01:25.740> there

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
biggest the way you want and now there

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.270 
biggest the way you want and now there
are<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> few<00:01:26.369> tweaks<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.330> there<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
are a few tweaks in this there is if a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.850 
are a few tweaks in this there is if a
web<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.970> directly<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.750> front<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:32.460> arm<00:01:32.670> of

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
web is directly in front of the arm of

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.260 
web is directly in front of the arm of
the<00:01:36.829> sea<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.700> working

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the sea as you can see I just working

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.130 
the sea as you can see I just working
and<00:01:40.220> yeah<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> web's<00:01:41.880> directly<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.570> or

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
and yeah so if the web's directly in or

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.649 
and yeah so if the web's directly in or
right<00:01:43.500> underneath<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.880> first<00:01:45.210> rail

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
right underneath this first rail

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.200 
right underneath this first rail
it'll<00:01:46.200> take<00:01:46.409> eight<00:01:46.619> seconds<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.610> let<00:01:48.030> me<00:01:48.090> show

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it'll take eight seconds so let me show

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.280 
it'll take eight seconds so let me show
you<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.360> one<00:01:48.960> two<00:01:50.119> three<00:01:51.140> four<00:01:52.220> five<00:01:53.270> six

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
you that one two three four five six

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.410 
you that one two three four five six
seven<00:01:55.290> eight<00:01:55.939> and<00:01:56.990> as<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:59.149> it<00:02:00.149> took

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
seven eight and as you can see it took

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.719 
seven eight and as you can see it took
eight<00:02:00.570> seconds<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.590> seems<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.340> card

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
eight seconds and it seems that the card

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.260 
eight seconds and it seems that the card
just<00:02:03.299> get<00:02:03.509> subtracted<00:02:03.689> down<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.979> that

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
just get subtracted down to it so that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.330 
just get subtracted down to it so that
doesn't<00:02:06.270> always<00:02:06.990> necessarily<00:02:07.560> happen<00:02:08.220> I'll

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
doesn't always necessarily happen I'll

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.279 
doesn't always necessarily happen I'll
see<00:02:08.489> what<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.640> how<00:02:09.509> long<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.810> takes<00:02:09.959> right<00:02:10.110> here

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
see what it how long it takes right here

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.949 
see what it how long it takes right here
in<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.410> second<00:02:10.770> for<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.039> guys<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
in a second for you guys and

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.240 
in a second for you guys and
don't<00:02:12.140> think<00:02:12.290> about<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.739> earlier<00:02:13.069> but

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
don't think about that earlier but

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.979 
don't think about that earlier but
basically<00:02:13.670> this<00:02:13.849> one<00:02:14.030> will<00:02:14.180> take<00:02:14.359> five

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
basically this one will take five

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.649 
basically this one will take five
seconds<00:02:15.560> because<00:02:15.739> it<00:02:16.189> is<00:02:16.310> not<00:02:16.659> directly

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
seconds because it is not directly

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.199

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
24 25 26 27 28 29 and 30 so I guess that

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.309 
24 25 26 27 28 29 and 30 so I guess that
was<00:03:09.079> perfect<00:03:09.590> last<00:03:10.549> time<00:03:10.819> I<00:03:11.269> had<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.019> make<00:03:12.200> this

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
was perfect last time I had to make this

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.170 
was perfect last time I had to make this
video<00:03:12.500> again<00:03:12.829> because<00:03:13.129> I<00:03:13.219> messed<00:03:13.400> up<00:03:13.669> cuz

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
video again because I messed up cuz

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.259 
video again because I messed up cuz
mired<00:03:14.799> my<00:03:15.799> judgement<00:03:16.159> recording<00:03:16.579> I<00:03:16.790> didn't

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
mired my judgement recording I didn't

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.099 
mired my judgement recording I didn't
get<00:03:17.419> I<00:03:17.769> said<00:03:18.769> like<00:03:18.949> 29<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.879> it<00:03:20.000> went<00:03:20.180> but<00:03:20.810> yeah

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
get I said like 29 and it went but yeah

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.659 
get I said like 29 and it went but yeah
as<00:03:21.229> 30<00:03:21.500> seconds<00:03:21.919> exactly

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
as 30 seconds exactly

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.369 
as 30 seconds exactly
and<00:03:23.019> yeah<00:03:24.019> so<00:03:24.349> it's<00:03:24.500> very<00:03:24.739> simple<00:03:25.129> to<00:03:25.310> make<00:03:25.340> and

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
and yeah so it's very simple to make and

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.710 
and yeah so it's very simple to make and
I<00:03:27.379> think<00:03:27.500> I'll<00:03:28.370> make<00:03:28.579> it<00:03:28.790> for<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.030> guys<00:03:29.449> really

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:24.259 
25 26 27 28 29 30 31 so yes 30 seconds

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.120 
25 26 27 28 29 30 31 so yes 30 seconds
I'm<00:06:24.710> just<00:06:24.860> miscounted<00:06:25.900> so<00:06:26.919> basically<00:06:27.919> that's

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
I'm just miscounted so basically that's

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.890 
I'm just miscounted so basically that's
30<00:06:28.400> seconds<00:06:28.759> and<00:06:28.909> that's<00:06:29.120> 30<00:06:29.360> seconds<00:06:29.750> so<00:06:29.840> you

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
30 seconds and that's 30 seconds so you

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.570 
30 seconds and that's 30 seconds so you
can<00:06:30.020> do<00:06:30.110> that<00:06:30.259> designed<00:06:30.680> to<00:06:30.830> so<00:06:31.099> basically

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
can do that designed to so basically

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.810 
can do that designed to so basically
this<00:06:31.789> gonna<00:06:31.940> be<00:06:32.029> three<00:06:32.240> happens<00:06:33.520> so<00:06:34.520> yeah

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
this gonna be three happens so yeah

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.310 
this gonna be three happens so yeah
that's<00:06:35.060> it<00:06:35.149> guys<00:06:35.330> thanks<00:06:35.630> for<00:06:35.659> watching<00:06:35.750> a

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
that's it guys thanks for watching a

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.350 
that's it guys thanks for watching a
very<00:06:36.680> basic<00:06:36.919> tutorial

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
very basic tutorial

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.059 
very basic tutorial
a<00:06:38.389> lot<00:06:38.780> easier<00:06:39.199> than<00:06:39.439> doing<00:06:39.530> repeaters

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:40.069 
a lot easier than doing repeaters

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:41.649 
a lot easier than doing repeaters
everywhere<00:06:40.580> and<00:06:40.819> having<00:06:41.060> to<00:06:41.120> set<00:06:41.300> the<00:06:41.419> ticks

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:41.659 
everywhere and having to set the ticks

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:45.700 
everywhere and having to set the ticks
and<00:06:42.280> I<00:06:43.280> think<00:06:43.460> it's<00:06:43.550> more<00:06:43.669> efficient<00:06:44.090> and<00:06:44.710> so

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
and I think it's more efficient and so

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.029 
and I think it's more efficient and so
yeah<00:06:45.889> so<00:06:46.219> thanks<00:06:46.430> for<00:06:46.520> watching<00:06:46.580> guys<00:06:48.039> also
