00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.900
 hi people i wanted to give you a little one 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.440
 give quicktipp with and what you do 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.350
 can 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.930
 against dry skin 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.320
 face and indeed 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.820
 since forever dry skin and forever 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.100
 I've been searching for ages 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.570
 Always been on the right cream 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.550
 for me that enough moisture 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.279
 donates my skin nicely taken care of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.869
 and I still feel sensitive to it 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.610
 React if you skin very much 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.470
 Sensitive quickly reacts with redness 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.210
 and so on and I never have 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.870
 really the right cream for me 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.910
 found 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.070
 there were a few the train okay but me 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.390
 I always noticed that evening 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.699
 my skin gets dry again 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.739
 had to cream in the afternoon and mine 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.329
 Keeps skin nice when I make up 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.120
 have taken has always been my 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.829
 deposed dry skin and 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.600
 yes it was not so nice and i have 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.070
 he never found the cream it 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.989
 my skin made me 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.870
 good food in the morning until evening 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.050
 and now I'm on it and 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.990
 Although on series and I have a serum 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.840
 bought very much from old request of the very 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.039
 and pomegranate very dry skin that 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.200
 there is rossmann and you wear that 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.840
 under the day care or under the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.540
 normal cream on after cleaning 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.670
 first serum and because that is fed 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.530
 About the cream and so I do that 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.200
 now for a few weeks and it has 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.020
 my skin picture changed completely 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.150
 creaming is through after that very much 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.080
 really nice for my skin until the evening 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.330
 to keep 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.159
 I do not get dry anymore 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.380
 even at the nose not where always so 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.450
 A critical point was I can make 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.960
 wear up and it looks nice and 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.220
 even by the evening it holds by the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.470
 my skin is still beautiful 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.619
 looks and well supplied and plump and 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.150
 just not so dry and 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.299
 dried out and it is really through 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.979
 this serum occurred to me and me 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.930
 not only for this serum 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.210
 but generally speak for series 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.220
 if you have dry skin and so far 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.250
 have not found a cream you 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.320
 have donated enough moisture 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.760
 then a look pause times to get it 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.670
 There are different brands of 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.480
 the body shop of everyone 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.420
 natural cosmetics brand of all sorts 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.519
 There are series and some are stomach 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.920
 fished to tighten the skin some 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.990
 for moisture sensitive skin and 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.460
 look around you and used 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.080
 just look under your cream 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.940
 So what happened to me has it 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.650
 really improved so much and that's why 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.330
 I just did not want that for you 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.490
 withheld but this tip 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.260
 give with me because for years I knew 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.420
 nothing of series and have never been with the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.100
 thoughts played that are very much mine 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.830
 I could always change skin 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.990
 only new krems tested but never 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.850
 Tried around and I think so 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.650
 I would have really tested the whole cream 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.270
 If I can just save a good one 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.280
 she would have had that under me 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.300
 give the cream and then it would be faith 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.240
 I have been good 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.830
 and yes that's my tip is looking for you 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.140
 massage you and if you are very very 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.400
 have dry skin or even if you 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.780
 sensitive skin has there 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.640
 different series then against 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.430
 sensitive euro against redness are 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.530
 So check it out and it does not have to 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.670
 the most expensive his age or because 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.350
 this time will 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.290
 Thun perhaps for the beginning also about 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.310
 to test it out and that's it 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.270
 already from me 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.680
 I wish you a nice day and 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.780
 Well cared for the skin I wish you 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.010
