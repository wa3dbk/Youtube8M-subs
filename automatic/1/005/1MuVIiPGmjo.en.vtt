00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.940
 examples from the past for copies that 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.940

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.450

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.720
 bottom 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.030
 I looked at their nature that seems to me 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.830
 so nice to do and that was already one 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.050
 few years ago dessel so fat two 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.140

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.910
 that is that is just funny i will take a minute 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.440
 the channel number of the people you are 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.619

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.090

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.310
 many people will know certain but 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.090
 I think you should keep this not what we 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.310
 on he started around him he us 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.490
 the first Dutch commentator from 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.560
 call of duty you can actually do it 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.300
 thank him maybe thanks to this 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.910
 already happening is that he is the first 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.620
 dutch was a hood here you come 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:46.780
 there i made and that he could really be son 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.390
 the voices but I come eye 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.000
 I sucked you like mountain genius 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.010
 committee de just like baxter with its all 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.240
 web and chewie qua are known by axel 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.760
 was all stopped after their being 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.610
 unfortunately i really feel doing it 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.950
 all be that they stopped I found it 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.450
 really very very cunt 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.399
 but of course in the course of the 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.140
 s also new examples come to 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.290
 like paul 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.880
 you as a pi or jan peter to a 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.870
 cargo bike 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.200
 fresh 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.049
 bratwurst your army and much more because there 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.260
 are so many channels 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:28.989
 really as much as your community of two 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.159
 years ago and now grab the bee and put them 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.610
 next to each other 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:37.420
 pack of channels in terms of live comes there is a bowl 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.709
 and at home the difference is so big it 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.709
 difference is so big 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.790
 in the past, live commentary was rare 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.170
 the dl1 if you have a special reason that if 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.299
 the example a new call of duty 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.489
 came out if you have the thousand subscribers 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.349
 reaches what used to be 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.079
 huge if you asked 1000 chips 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.480
 it looked like you had the 100,000 likes 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:02.290
 and then you were so happy 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.459
 and now you keep it easier 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.530
 garden chips than before 2006 I mean 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.690
 You can get garden service within a few 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.150
 months get growth deda 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.670
 rest for a long time because the so 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.020
 many channels have been added and that 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.390
 I also think that is a pity about the 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.630
 community what is so much live 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.880
 done that is no longer appreciated 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.760
 to post a comment just like it used to be 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.380
 that you experienced something like 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.540
 lunar dentist that he has a keys 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.980
 shocks or that you know I want something 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.510
 had experienced funny things during 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.959
 school things like that you asked and 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.910
 a committee who said you and who you with you 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.920
 You should share your views with you 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.260
 subscribers 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.390
 And of course that is still there 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.920
 Paul also returned with it and I give up 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.010
 him completely what i also miss the resin 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.350
 church that comes live it is there 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.290
 Sure they have stayed nice well every day 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.600
 so much live commentary is it too 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.269
 not nice to watch 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.700
 comment is his fun from eck 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.959
 purely because the story behind is purely 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.959
 because story is behind 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.549
 but I am not saying that there are many among them 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.680
 channels of this year's sigma octans like that 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.959
 that there is no talent among them 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.530
 there is enough talent between what says 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.020
 paul likes it like paul agrees 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.380
 to this context tip where you have to 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:36.720
 paddling the level is high do not test 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:41.070
 Normally it really seems like the 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.460
 always with talent popping up more and more 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.780
 that's really fat 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.350
 so I could sit him here of course too 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.600
 grow and get better with the culture 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:54.699
 ghost and on when I pick this up 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:57.009
 four days, then the community must 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.720
 I think going very well 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.940
 cold your the coast must be the community of 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.669
 put the netherlands on the map again 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.020
 would rather sleeve to make his hair so real 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.430
