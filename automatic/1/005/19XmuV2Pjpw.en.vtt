00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.970
 ouahbi choice sir know what we 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.050
 needed 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.200
 we needed to win especially 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.400
 especially here at last 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.690
 finally it's a very, very big team 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.020
 where so that's it's thing 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.760
 done one is 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.400
 today satisfied to take 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.349
 take these four bridges also provided 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.260
 a lot of effort certainly the physiognomy 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.370
 of the match could have we could have 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.370
 allow to take this time but 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.890
 it is surely 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.350
 the boys finally finished a little 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.710
 blunt on the make the carton the carton 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.089
 hurts us too very good players in 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.070
 face a misstep it must be forgotten so 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.949
 so already already reported win this 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.680
 match with a content crumpled me enough 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.940
 interesting it's very positive 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.430
 there we are in a situation more than 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.980
 complicated so 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.449
 especially with the results the result 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.340
 of brive yesterday outside so years 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.140
 with them we still had a little bit 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.020
 more pressure on the shoulders so that's 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.170
 after this match won it's a 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.270
 relief especially especially we'll say 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.890
 and still the face to face way to 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.540
 a big team of Toulon so that's 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.450
 clear especially the relief and that's 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.770
 these good auguries the matches it's 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.720
 that usually starts when we 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.640
 try to tell us we were going 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.220
 try not to let them time 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.570
 to ask their game to reassure themselves 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.580
 we knew they were a bit of a 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.970
 even a little overhauled at the level of 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.740
 workforce 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.210
 we thought we would try to 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.820
 take from match input and that's it 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.290
 we did it's a real four 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.950
 points that do a lot of good this 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.659
 tonight because 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.700
 it's imperative victory for us 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.219
 was 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.320
 last received toulon so we get 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.360
 had to win this match and that's thing 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.100
 made with a big game and a lot 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.530
 intensity so 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.369
 in terms of play also we have I think 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.500
 we produced a game 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.840
 it has led to handling errors but I 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.340
 think we can be tonight 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.810
 maybe a little crazy at a time 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.819
 given but 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.989
 we managed to hold it and it was hard 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.160
 because to do it I think he 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.590
 mark ten minutes from the end two 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.330
 tests happily that it remains not 5 or 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.160
 10 more minutes it could have been this 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.390
 could have been hard as we think two 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.790
 tests that hurt us very badly 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.170
 it's a shame because the first one 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.599
 first quarter of an hour we are good we 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.060
 must we even mark us too 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.319
 but good unfortunately when not and 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.569
 after things are going a lot less 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.599
 well we start losing in duels 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.640
 we miss tackles and we take two 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.980
 trials that will make us do that which 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.220
 are hurting so that's luckily they 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.600
 did not notice a ceviche after the 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.880
 half time because if it could not be 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.860
 heavy and the players have the merit of 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.200
 to have hung 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.730
 it was not easy but at the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.640
 exit we can hope for a little 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.890
 more good here is zero point but 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.099
 it's not not dramatic for us 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.099
 Those are
