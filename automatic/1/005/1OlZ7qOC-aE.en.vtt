the hard stuff we're just learning we go
some<00:00:13.259> simple<00:00:13.590> side<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.889> side<00:00:14.070> start<00:00:14.429> off<00:00:14.549> with

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
some simple side to side start off with

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
and back to front

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.019 
and back to front
check<00:00:16.650> out<00:00:16.740> some<00:00:16.890> tail<00:00:17.070> drags<00:00:17.369> then<00:00:17.730> figure

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
check out some tail drags then figure

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.040 
check out some tail drags then figure
Eight's<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.359> get<00:00:18.480> your<00:00:18.600> transitioning

properly<00:00:19.439> then<00:00:19.920> we'll<00:00:20.039> learn<00:00:20.130> some<00:00:20.310> heads<00:00:20.490> up

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
properly then we'll learn some heads up

properly then we'll learn some heads up
dee<00:00:20.850> King<00:00:21.060> one<00:00:21.480> hand<00:00:21.689> dear<00:00:21.840> King<00:00:22.050> curling<00:00:22.650> and

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
dee King one hand dear King curling and

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.929 
dee King one hand dear King curling and
then<00:00:23.400> finally<00:00:23.789> dipping<00:00:24.029> backwards<00:00:28.880> okay<00:00:29.880> so

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
then finally dipping backwards okay so

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.450 
then finally dipping backwards okay so
to<00:00:30.150> start<00:00:30.449> that's<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.750> good<00:00:30.869> size<00:00:31.399> proper<00:00:32.399> way

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
to start that's a good size proper way

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.010 
to start that's a good size proper way
to<00:00:32.489> go<00:00:32.640> side<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.910> side<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.660> cushion<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
to go side to side is to cushion the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.540 
to go side to side is to cushion the
puck<00:00:34.200> by<00:00:34.380> rotating<00:00:34.710> your<00:00:34.829> stick<00:00:35.100> towards<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
puck by rotating your stick towards the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.869 
puck by rotating your stick towards the
ground<00:00:35.700> installation<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:36.989> doesn't<00:00:37.320> feel

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
ground installation so it doesn't feel

practice I make a pretty weird face when
I<00:02:41.480> do<00:02:41.629> it<00:02:41.689> because<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.049> takes<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.349> fair<00:02:42.590> bit<00:02:42.620> of

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
I do it because it takes a fair bit of

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.710 
I do it because it takes a fair bit of

often the first time you try I learned

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
just go in side to side this is just so

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.780 
just go in side to side this is just so
you<00:02:54.650> can<00:02:54.769> learn<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:54.950> timing<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.579> get<00:02:55.700> the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
you can learn the timing and get the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:07.400 
you can learn the timing and get the

to curl you need to take your top hand
and<00:03:17.000> put<00:03:17.390> underneath<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.810> arm<00:03:18.020> with<00:03:18.200> your

world to do but you can quickly notice
how<00:03:57.100> an<00:03:57.190> inline<00:03:57.400> puck<00:03:57.610> slows<00:03:57.940> down<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.330> pulls

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
how an inline puck slows down and pulls

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.210 
how an inline puck slows down and pulls
away<00:03:58.630> from<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:59.050> over<00:03:59.140> time<00:03:59.350> so<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.100> have<00:04:00.190> to

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
away from you over time so you have to

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.920 
away from you over time so you have to
keep<00:04:00.400> pulling<00:04:00.610> it<00:04:00.820> towards<00:04:01.150> yourself<00:04:01.210> of<00:04:01.600> HD

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
keep pulling it towards yourself of HD

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.990 
keep pulling it towards yourself of HD
so<00:04:02.830> what<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.040> means<00:04:03.280> is<00:04:03.460> you've<00:04:03.610> got<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.790> pull

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
so what that means is you've got to pull

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.520 
so what that means is you've got to pull
the<00:04:04.120> puck<00:04:04.330> back<00:04:04.510> each<00:04:04.750> time<00:04:05.050> you<00:04:05.170> go<00:04:05.290> side<00:04:05.500> to

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
the puck back each time you go side to

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
when you got inside to side he went to

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.330 
when you got inside to side he went to
cushion<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.470> puck<00:04:16.650> properly<00:04:17.010> with<00:04:17.130> soft
