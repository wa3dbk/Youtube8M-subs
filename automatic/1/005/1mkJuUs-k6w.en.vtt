00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.500
 You have a beautiful home! 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.200
 How old is your daughter? 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 I'm not dead. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 You are not dead. 

00:00:18.673 --> 00:00:20.346
 We are still alive! LIFE CAN CHANGE INTO AN INSTANT 

00:00:22.446 --> 00:00:25.146
 I drive every day up here because my crazy sister can't get out of the house. 

00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:27.946
 I'd like you not to smoke at home. 

00:00:28.746 --> 00:00:30.846
 I'm not at home, I'm in the garage! 

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:35.046
 IT IS EASY TO FINISH WITH LOSING 

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:37.246
 I have a convention in New Orleans 

00:00:41.446 --> 00:00:42.846
 To take away, thanks. 

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:46.146
 SOMETIMES THERE NEED A UNKNOWN 

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:48.146
 Here you go, honey. 

00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:49.246
 I'll pay him, I'll pay him. 

00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:52.246
 TO HELP YOU SEE THE WORLD 

00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:53.346
 Work in a streap club. 

00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:56.146
 How old are you? 15? 

00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:01.346
 Sorry, I think I'll stop here for a while. 

00:01:01.446 --> 00:01:02.446
 What are you saying? 

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:03.646
 I can't go home now. 

00:01:05.446 --> 00:01:07.346
 Will you sleep all day? Stand up! 

00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:13.746
 Doug, I'm here. 

00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:14.946
 You are in New Orleans ?! 

00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:17.146
 You are beautiful! 

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:19.846
 A TOUCHING AND EXCITING JOURNEY. 

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:20.846
 GANDOLFINI AND LEO ARE PURE DYNAMITE. 

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:23.146
 STEWART'S INTERPRETATION IS ELECTRIC. 

00:01:23.446 --> 00:01:25.146
 There is someone I would like to introduce you to. 

00:01:25.846 --> 00:01:27.846
 He has many names because he works in a strep club. 

00:01:28.246 --> 00:01:29.946
 WELCOME THE SURPRISES 

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:31.246
 Lois, this is Mallory. 

00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:32.146
 Hello. 

00:01:32.446 --> 00:01:33.346
 How are you? 

00:01:33.846 --> 00:01:35.046
 Wait up! WELCOME TO UNCERTAINTY 

00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:36.546
 She ran away from Florida. 

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:37.646
 You are crazy! 

00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:39.446
 Then go lock yourself in your damn house again. 

00:01:39.946 --> 00:01:41.546
 So it's your job to look after her? 

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:42.046
 Why not? 

00:01:42.446 --> 00:01:43.446
 Tell me what you want, Doug. 

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:47.046
 Do you want to pretend that a fugitive stripper is your daughter? 

00:01:47.146 --> 00:01:47.846
 WELCOME THE DISCOVERY 

00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:48.746
 Do you have children? 

00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:52.546
 We had a daughter. She died in a car accident. 

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:53.746
 It sucks! 

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:54.846
 It is. 

00:01:54.946 --> 00:01:55.946
 Do you think it's all his fault? 

00:01:56.046 --> 00:01:57.046
 Let's not talk about this. 

00:01:57.146 --> 00:01:58.146
 WELCOME THE FRIENDSHIP 

00:01:58.246 --> 00:01:59.946
 I can't let you do it anymore. 

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:02.046
 You are not my mother! So you disappear from my life. 

00:02:02.146 --> 00:02:02.346
 No 

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:03.446
 Where are you going? 

00:02:03.846 --> 00:02:04.846
 Come on, come home. 

00:02:05.046 --> 00:02:07.046
 Then go away, go away, damn you! 

00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:10.046
 I'm nobody's child. 

00:02:10.446 --> 00:02:11.446
 You broke my heart. 

00:02:15.246 --> 00:02:16.246
 Where are you going? 

00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:17.446
 Here. 

00:02:17.746 --> 00:02:18.746
 Then I'll stay here with you.
