00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.490 

so<00:00:02.090> this<00:00:02.840> graph<00:00:03.199> is<00:00:03.850> a<00:00:04.850> project<00:00:05.510> I<00:00:05.840> did<00:00:05.870> for<00:00:06.350> my

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.500 
so this graph is a project I did for my

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.850 
so this graph is a project I did for my
math<00:00:06.710> class<00:00:07.010> it<00:00:07.490> is<00:00:08.650> supposed<00:00:09.650> to<00:00:09.710> be<00:00:09.800> a

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
math class it is supposed to be a

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.910 
math class it is supposed to be a
rollercoaster<00:00:10.250> with<00:00:11.240> that<00:00:12.080> I<00:00:12.110> designed<00:00:12.620> with

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
rollercoaster with that I designed with

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.750 
rollercoaster with that I designed with
a<00:00:12.950> set<00:00:13.490> of<00:00:13.519> requirements<00:00:13.820> needed<00:00:15.129> the<00:00:16.129> blue<00:00:16.400> is

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
a set of requirements needed the blue is

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.210 
a set of requirements needed the blue is
where<00:00:17.179> the<00:00:17.419> graph<00:00:17.599> is<00:00:17.869> increasing<00:00:18.589> and<00:00:18.890> the

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
where the graph is increasing and the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.640 
where the graph is increasing and the
pink<00:00:19.519> is<00:00:19.759> where<00:00:20.269> the<00:00:20.570> graph<00:00:20.810> is<00:00:21.050> decreasing<00:00:21.320> I

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
pink is where the graph is decreasing I

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.569 
pink is where the graph is decreasing I
was<00:00:24.650> supposed<00:00:25.039> to<00:00:25.189> find<00:00:25.489> a<00:00:25.939> an<00:00:26.869> equation<00:00:27.769> for

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
was supposed to find a an equation for

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.149 
was supposed to find a an equation for
it<00:00:28.730> and<00:00:28.939> verify<00:00:29.509> it<00:00:29.569> by<00:00:30.109> division<00:00:30.800> of<00:00:30.979> some

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:31.159 
it and verify it by division of some

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:36.040 
it and verify it by division of some
sort<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:31.939> no<00:00:32.870> matter<00:00:33.079> what<00:00:33.320> I<00:00:33.350> did<00:00:33.500> my<00:00:35.050> numbers

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
sort and no matter what I did my numbers

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.729 
sort and no matter what I did my numbers
would<00:00:36.320> not<00:00:36.559> work<00:00:36.920> so<00:00:37.609> I<00:00:37.969> had<00:00:38.149> to<00:00:38.300> use<00:00:38.739> piecewise

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
would not work so I had to use piecewise

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.759 
would not work so I had to use piecewise
functions<00:00:41.230> to<00:00:42.730> determine<00:00:43.730> this<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:45.410> those<00:00:45.589> my

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
functions to determine this and those my

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.439 
functions to determine this and those my
function<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:46.640> I<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.140> a<00:00:48.170> seventh<00:00:48.890> root

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
function and I it is a seventh root

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:58.540 
function and I it is a seventh root
graph<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:53.589> my<00:00:54.589> roots<00:00:54.890> involve<00:00:57.010> 63<00:00:58.010> which<00:00:58.309> is

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
graph and my roots involve 63 which is

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:06.240 
graph and my roots involve 63 which is
my<00:00:58.850> double<00:00:59.510> red<00:01:00.429> 201<00:01:01.719> 310

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.880 

plus<00:01:07.250> or<00:01:07.520> minus<00:01:08.030> five<00:01:08.690> I<00:01:10.000> now<00:01:11.000> I<00:01:11.030> needed<00:01:11.390> to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
plus or minus five I now I needed to

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.290 
plus or minus five I now I needed to
graph<00:01:12.890> it<00:01:13.160> on<00:01:13.730> a<00:01:13.790> graphing<00:01:14.780> calculator<00:01:16.300> this

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
graph it on a graphing calculator this

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.020 
graph it on a graphing calculator this
is<00:01:17.510> my<00:01:17.750> graphing<00:01:18.260> calculator<00:01:18.770> if<00:01:19.550> you<00:01:19.700> can't

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
is my graphing calculator if you can't

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.190 
is my graphing calculator if you can't
see<00:01:20.390> it<00:01:22.570> but<00:01:23.570> my<00:01:23.630> functions<00:01:24.260> in<00:01:24.410> there<00:01:26.200> and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
see it but my functions in there and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:02:00.760 
see it but my functions in there and
this<00:01:27.320> was<00:01:27.500> holographs

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.039 

good<00:02:01.600> so<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:02.780> is<00:02:02.930> my<00:02:03.110> graph<00:02:03.380> on<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:03.920> technology

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
good so that is my graph on a technology

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.290 
good so that is my graph on a technology
type<00:02:06.049> device<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:08.349> my<00:02:09.399> practical<00:02:10.399> domain<00:02:11.030> of

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
type device and my practical domain of

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.690 
type device and my practical domain of
my<00:02:11.780> rollercoaster<00:02:12.709> ride<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.430> about<00:02:14.150> zero<00:02:15.140> to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
my rollercoaster ride is about zero to

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.360 
my rollercoaster ride is about zero to
419<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.739> my<00:02:18.739> range<00:02:19.069> is<00:02:19.459> about<00:02:20.230> from<00:02:21.370> negative

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
419 and my range is about from negative

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.729 
419 and my range is about from negative
eighty<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:23.650> 270<00:02:24.650> feet<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:26.630> sounds<00:02:27.530> about

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
eighty to 270 feet that sounds about

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:28.089 
eighty to 270 feet that sounds about
right

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
right

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:35.550 
right
and<00:02:30.519> it<00:02:31.519> is<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.150> seventh<00:02:32.840> degree<00:02:33.700> polynomial<00:02:34.700> so

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
and it is a seventh degree polynomial so

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.020 
and it is a seventh degree polynomial so
my<00:02:36.560> far<00:02:37.190> left<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.970> goes<00:02:38.959> up<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.799> my<00:02:40.730> far<00:02:41.000> right

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
my far left and goes up and my far right

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.309 
my far left and goes up and my far right
and<00:02:41.680> goes<00:02:42.680> down<00:02:43.160> so<00:02:43.940> that<00:02:44.420> about<00:02:44.690> sums<00:02:44.750> up<00:02:45.140> my

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
and goes down so that about sums up my

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.110 
and goes down so that about sums up my
project<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:47.290> yeah<00:02:48.400> that's<00:02:49.400> about<00:02:49.640> it

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
project so yeah that's about it

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.590 
project so yeah that's about it
hope<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.170> liked<00:02:51.380> it
