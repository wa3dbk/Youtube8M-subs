00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Hi, today's video teaches you how to make a 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.580
 thing that we usually buy ready 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.560
 but it is so quick and easy to do that 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.560
 worth doing at home is the lap 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.660
 in a bowl put a cup of 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.490
 white flour a cup of 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.770
 whole wheat flour 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.730
 a quarter of a teaspoon of salt and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.130
 mix 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.080
 add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and go 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.599
 putting a few hands on until 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.160
 turn a smooth, uniform dough to my 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.520
 made about three-quarters of 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:37.410
 cups of water and in the profiles 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.870
 of life in the 14 peace 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.700
 open one of the little schools until they come 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.870
 with a maximum of 2 millimeters of 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.940
 thickness 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.940
 if you wanted more cute records 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.890
 open dough without driving and cut 1 to 1 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.879
 with the help of a dessert plate and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.620
 a knife 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.719
 heat a skillet over medium heat 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.460
 for about two minutes put a 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.649
 mass disk and hopes to form some 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:04.049
 Next come and stay 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:06.450
 other side as you make them 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.430
 Lips put a man from an empty and 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.860
 a very close service for them to give 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.170
 a light to a decline let resting 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.420
 for about 20 minutes before using 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.360
 I found that you prefer I used the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.360
 sweater and pinto lettuce I spun ready 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.250
 whoever does this respect is prolific 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.300
 leaves kfd and she also passed some 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.830
 important tips 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.630
 he made his appeal very great and did not 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.090
 there is a risk that it will be clear and 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.040
 many avoid it can get hard and not 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.230
 It's just that you went home or doubled up. 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.760
 it gets brittle put inside 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.620
 a vessel or plastic as well 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.150
 is very important for 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.430
 that it is malleable is not that I go 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.530
 working with it you can start with 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.170
 hot or cold snacks rolled up 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.390
 folded like I did or even do 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.970
 like a pizza put the stuffing on top 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.560
 and another suggestion that I give is you to do 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.050
 a daily treat that is in this video 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.330
 here and check out this and other visits there 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.380
 in the blog that we also in the networks 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.790
 social 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.790
