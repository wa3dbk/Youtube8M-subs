playing a Mozart piano concerto

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.540 
playing a Mozart piano concerto
technically<00:00:47.260> concerto<00:00:47.800> is<00:00:47.920> piano<00:00:48.219> plus

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
technically concerto is piano plus

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.329 
technically concerto is piano plus
orchestra<00:00:49.210> but<00:00:49.420> Mozart<00:00:50.199> had<00:00:50.530> reduced<00:00:50.920> this

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
orchestra but Mozart had reduced this

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.189 
orchestra but Mozart had reduced this
particular<00:00:51.640> one<00:00:51.999> into<00:00:52.359> a<00:00:52.390> string<00:00:52.659> quartet<00:00:52.839> so

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
particular one into a string quartet so

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:54.540 
particular one into a string quartet so
it<00:00:53.319> really<00:00:53.530> becomes<00:00:53.859> a<00:00:54.010> chamber<00:00:54.339> music

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550

the concerto is really interesting in

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.780 
the concerto is really interesting in
and<00:01:08.350> of<00:01:08.409> itself<00:01:08.590> because<00:01:09.130> it<00:01:09.159> has<00:01:09.520> this

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
and of itself because it has this

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.600 
and of itself because it has this
dialogue<00:01:10.570> to<00:01:10.870> it<00:01:10.990> you<00:01:11.110> have<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:11.290> piano<00:01:11.770> versus

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
your group of instruments and they have

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.070 
your group of instruments and they have
dialogue<00:01:15.550> with<00:01:15.850> one<00:01:16.090> another<00:01:16.330> sometimes<00:01:16.900> the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
dialogue with one another sometimes the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.770 
dialogue with one another sometimes the
pianist<00:01:17.560> is<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.920> spotlight<00:01:18.550> and<00:01:18.910> is<00:01:19.240> all<00:01:19.630> buy

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
pianist is the spotlight and is all buy

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.930 
pianist is the spotlight and is all buy
them<00:01:19.960> by<00:01:20.260> herself<00:01:20.980> in<00:01:21.250> this<00:01:21.370> case<00:01:21.700> and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
them by herself in this case and

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.400 
them by herself in this case and
sometimes<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.600> strings<00:01:22.930> are<00:01:23.110> all<00:01:23.230> by

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
sometimes the strings are all by

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.650 
sometimes the strings are all by
themselves<00:01:23.650> and<00:01:24.130> sometimes<00:01:24.670> they<00:01:24.970> are

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
themselves and sometimes they are

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.780 
themselves and sometimes they are
responding<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:26.650> each<00:01:26.770> other<00:01:26.980> in<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.400> really

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
responding to each other in a really

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.230 
responding to each other in a really
organic<00:01:28.000> way<00:01:28.960> either<00:01:29.770> through<00:01:30.220> dialogue<00:01:30.760> or

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
organic way either through dialogue or

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.470 
organic way either through dialogue or
supporting<00:01:32.110> one<00:01:32.260> another<00:01:32.290> and<00:01:32.800> I<00:01:33.670> think<00:01:33.940> that

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
supporting one another and I think that

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.060 
supporting one another and I think that
that<00:01:34.630> genre<00:01:34.990> that<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.440> genre<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:35.800> really

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
that genre that the genre is really

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.920 
that genre that the genre is really
interesting<00:01:36.580> in<00:01:36.760> that<00:01:36.820> way<00:01:37.240> just<00:01:37.480> because<00:01:37.660> you

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
interesting in that way just because you

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.290 
interesting in that way just because you
get<00:01:38.410> that<00:01:38.560> idea<00:01:38.770> of<00:01:39.220> dialogue<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:39.970> I<00:01:40.120> think

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
get that idea of dialogue and I think

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.300 
get that idea of dialogue and I think
that's<00:01:40.540> going<00:01:40.690> to<00:01:40.750> be<00:01:41.290> perfect<00:01:41.860> with<00:01:42.130> the

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
that's going to be perfect with the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.980 
that's going to be perfect with the
dance<00:01:42.550> because<00:01:42.910> it's<00:01:43.060> going<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.360> allow<00:01:43.480> for

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
dance because it's going to allow for

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.990 
dance because it's going to allow for
that<00:01:44.020> dialogue<00:01:44.620> on<00:01:44.830> stage<00:01:45.250> between<00:01:45.580> the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
that dialogue on stage between the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.720 
that dialogue on stage between the
characters<00:01:46.740> having<00:01:47.740> an<00:01:48.010> open<00:01:48.280> mind<00:01:48.520> I<00:01:48.670> think

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
characters having an open mind I think

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.640 
characters having an open mind I think
is<00:01:48.970> just<00:01:49.120> essential<00:01:49.660> I<00:01:49.720> mean<00:01:49.870> Mozart<00:01:50.230> himself

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
is just essential I mean Mozart himself

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.010 
is just essential I mean Mozart himself
had<00:01:50.890> an<00:01:50.920> open<00:01:51.250> mind<00:01:51.460> he<00:01:51.880> was<00:01:52.090> extending<00:01:52.960> the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
had an open mind he was extending the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.840 
had an open mind he was extending the
boundaries<00:01:53.320> at<00:01:53.530> all<00:01:53.650> times<00:01:53.980> we<00:01:54.460> don't<00:01:54.550> feel

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
boundaries at all times we don't feel

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.360 
boundaries at all times we don't feel
that<00:01:54.910> because<00:01:55.240> we<00:01:55.510> know<00:01:55.750> Mozart<00:01:55.960> so<00:01:56.710> well<00:01:56.950> in<00:01:57.250> a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
that because we know Mozart so well in a

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.010 
that because we know Mozart so well in a
way<00:01:57.520> but<00:01:57.580> he<00:01:58.000> himself<00:01:58.390> was<00:01:58.630> kind<00:01:58.870> of<00:01:58.930> a

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
way but he himself was kind of a

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.740 
way but he himself was kind of a
trailblazer<00:01:59.740> and<00:01:59.950> bringing<00:02:00.580> in<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.820> new<00:02:01.450> kind

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
trailblazer and bringing in a new kind

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.380 
trailblazer and bringing in a new kind
of<00:02:01.930> emotionalism<00:02:02.680> in<00:02:03.070> his<00:02:03.370> music<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.820> wasn't

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
of emotionalism in his music that wasn't

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.730 
of emotionalism in his music that wasn't
really<00:02:04.990> thought<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:05.890> in<00:02:06.250> the

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
really thought of in the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.130 
really thought of in the
era<00:02:07.070> so<00:02:07.490> he<00:02:07.759> was<00:02:07.909> ushering<00:02:08.360> in<00:02:08.479> something<00:02:08.929> new

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
era so he was ushering in something new

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.890 
era so he was ushering in something new
and<00:02:09.380> so<00:02:09.800> with<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:10.340> kind<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.759> way<00:02:11.270> of<00:02:11.300> honoring

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
and so with that kind of way of honoring

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.990 
and so with that kind of way of honoring
Mozart<00:02:12.349> we<00:02:12.590> need<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:12.860> be<00:02:12.980> ready<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.520> usher<00:02:13.849> in
