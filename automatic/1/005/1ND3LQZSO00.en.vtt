morning one thing that we don't talk
about<00:04:45.200> a<00:04:45.320> whole<00:04:45.620> lot<00:04:45.800> here<00:04:46.070> is<00:04:46.280> beta<00:04:46.640> beta<00:04:47.600> is

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
about a whole lot here is beta beta is

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.450 
about a whole lot here is beta beta is
the<00:04:48.110> amount<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.710> stock<00:04:49.010> moves<00:04:49.310> in

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
the amount that a stock moves in

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.630 
the amount that a stock moves in
relation<00:04:49.880> to<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.090> rest<00:04:50.180> of<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.450> market<00:04:50.630> okay

Blackstone's<00:04:52.640> beta<00:04:53.030> is<00:04:53.330> up<00:04:53.390> over<00:04:53.960> two<00:04:54.470> which

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
Blackstone's beta is up over two which

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.620 
Blackstone's beta is up over two which
means<00:04:55.100> that<00:04:55.280> it<00:04:55.400> moves<00:04:55.670> a<00:04:55.880> lot<00:04:56.060> more<00:04:56.330> than<00:04:56.540> the

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
means that it moves a lot more than the

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.670 
means that it moves a lot more than the
rest<00:04:56.780> of<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:56.930> market<00:04:57.080> so<00:04:57.320> on<00:04:57.410> a<00:04:57.500> day<00:04:57.530> like

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
rest of the market so on a day like

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.380 
rest of the market so on a day like
today<00:04:57.860> when<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.370> market<00:04:58.700> is<00:04:58.730> being<00:04:59.000> volatile

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
today when the market is being volatile

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.360 
today when the market is being volatile
you'll<00:04:59.690> see<00:04:59.900> Blackstone<00:05:00.410> stock<00:05:00.740> being<00:05:01.010> even

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
you'll see Blackstone stock being even

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.070 
you'll see Blackstone stock being even
more<00:05:01.400> volatile<00:05:01.880> so<00:05:02.450> I<00:05:02.480> don't<00:05:02.660> think<00:05:02.870> that<00:05:03.050> that

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
more volatile so I don't think that that

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.409 
more volatile so I don't think that that
this<00:05:03.560> move<00:05:03.830> in<00:05:03.980> particular<00:05:04.490> is<00:05:04.640> reason<00:05:05.390> for

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
this move in particular is reason for

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.450 
this move in particular is reason for
investors<00:05:05.990> to<00:05:06.020> freak<00:05:06.350> out<00:05:06.500> this<00:05:06.980> is<00:05:07.130> just<00:05:07.340> a

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
investors to freak out this is just a

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.340 
investors to freak out this is just a
sign<00:05:07.700> of<00:05:07.730> Blackstone<00:05:08.570> being<00:05:08.780> a<00:05:08.840> more<00:05:08.990> volatile

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
sign of Blackstone being a more volatile

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.480 
sign of Blackstone being a more volatile
stock<00:05:09.560> I<00:05:09.680> think<00:05:09.860> it's<00:05:09.950> also<00:05:10.100> worth<00:05:10.250> noting

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
stock I think it's also worth noting

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.220 
stock I think it's also worth noting
that<00:05:10.669> Blackstone<00:05:11.120> is<00:05:11.360> a<00:05:11.390> pretty<00:05:11.600> big<00:05:11.750> dividend

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
that Blackstone is a pretty big dividend

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.110 
that Blackstone is a pretty big dividend
payer<00:05:12.440> and<00:05:12.860> we've<00:05:13.010> seen<00:05:13.220> dividend<00:05:13.640> payer<00:05:13.790> sell

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
payer and we've seen dividend payer sell

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.909 
payer and we've seen dividend payer sell
off<00:05:14.330> during<00:05:15.020> this<00:05:15.169> interest<00:05:15.680> rate

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
off during this interest rate

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.590 
off during this interest rate
environment<00:05:16.370> people<00:05:17.030> aren't<00:05:17.240> sure<00:05:17.330> if<00:05:17.360> rates

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
environment people aren't sure if rates

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.850 
environment people aren't sure if rates
are<00:05:17.750> moving<00:05:17.960> up<00:05:18.080> so<00:05:18.200> I<00:05:18.230> think<00:05:18.290> that<00:05:18.530> might<00:05:18.680> be

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
are moving up so I think that might be

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.500 
are moving up so I think that might be
another<00:05:19.100> reason<00:05:19.310> that<00:05:20.000> that's<00:05:20.120> moving<00:05:20.390> a

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
another reason that that's moving a

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.110 
another reason that that's moving a
little<00:05:20.630> bit<00:05:20.720> more<00:05:21.070> to<00:05:22.070> piggyback<00:05:22.400> off<00:05:22.669> the<00:05:22.880> off

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
little bit more to piggyback off the off

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.360 
little bit more to piggyback off the off
the<00:05:23.180> dividend<00:05:23.720> players<00:05:23.960> moving<00:05:24.770> to<00:05:24.980> the

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
the dividend players moving to the

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.980 
the dividend players moving to the
mortgage<00:05:25.669> REIT<00:05:25.850> space<00:05:26.120> which<00:05:26.480> has<00:05:26.630> just<00:05:26.840> been

mortgage REIT space which has just been

under attack in the last couple months

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.420 
under attack in the last couple months
or<00:05:29.479> so<00:05:29.690> and<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:30.740> pain<00:05:30.919> continues<00:05:31.340> this
