00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.600
 no doctor at home without domicile 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.520
 there was congress and that back for companies 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.220
 today we are going to talk about how to see 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.140
 correctly a bottle of wine to 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.970
 correctly open a bottle of wine 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.610
 you need a bottle of wine for 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.120
 course of an opener as we are going to 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.580
 do the most important thing is to move less 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.190
 possible from the bottle because if the bag 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.039
 It has already been a long time in the bottle 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.420
 can have support and it becomes fashionable in 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.390
 bottle 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.870
 when we open a bottle we go with the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.449
 opener blade open the capsule the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.850
 wine is called from here never makes to see 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:53.210
 here explains why then 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.119
 we found the capsule of the bottle and 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.879
 limit the bottle 

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:01.879
 let's be able to have a clean cut at 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.149
 time to have the bottle open 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.909
 there we have a totally clean cut to 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.649
 gastronomic level well if we have this 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.170
 clean cut we can clean 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.300
 correctly the head of the bottle will 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.759
 it's been a long time you have 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.619
 some partnership agreement 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.299
 that is the protocol of an opening 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.509
 correct of a routine 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.659
 Now let's open the bottle and talk to 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.730
 the bottle we are going to insert 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.660
 correctly 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:36.150
 the opener and what we are going to do is several 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.860
 times like that a time the second time 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.760

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.800
 there is a phytose 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:55.000
 formerly when there was a turn 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.130

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.800
 leave your diners worked and 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.980

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.310
