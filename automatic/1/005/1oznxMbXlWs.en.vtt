00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:14.750 
know I was like literally playing with

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.210 
know I was like literally playing with
myself<00:07:14.930> that<00:07:15.260> entire<00:07:15.560> time<00:07:15.800> those<00:07:16.190> are

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:16.220 
myself that entire time those are

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.220 
myself that entire time those are
probably<00:07:16.520> the<00:07:16.670> easiest<00:07:17.210> missions<00:07:17.690> I've<00:07:17.900> ever

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.230 
probably the easiest missions I've ever

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.860 
probably the easiest missions I've ever
had<00:07:18.500> to<00:07:18.620> do<00:07:18.770> and<00:07:18.800> you<00:07:19.730> know<00:07:19.910> I<00:07:20.150> had<00:07:20.450> to<00:07:20.630> like

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
had to do and you know I had to like

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.210 
had to do and you know I had to like
literally<00:07:21.170> one<00:07:21.380> of<00:07:21.410> my<00:07:21.560> missions<00:07:21.920> at<00:07:22.100> one

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:22.220 
literally one of my missions at one

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.310 
literally one of my missions at one
point<00:07:22.400> was<00:07:22.610> to<00:07:22.760> steal<00:07:23.090> candy<00:07:23.480> from<00:07:23.660> an<00:07:24.020> infant

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:24.320 
point was to steal candy from an infant

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.840 
point was to steal candy from an infant
child<00:07:24.590> that<00:07:24.860> had<00:07:24.980> just<00:07:25.220> come<00:07:25.460> out<00:07:25.580> of<00:07:25.730> its

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:25.850 
child that had just come out of its

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.570 
child that had just come out of its
mother's<00:07:25.970> vagina<00:07:26.240> so<00:07:27.070> that<00:07:28.070> that<00:07:28.400> was

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:28.580 
mother's vagina so that that was

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.700 
mother's vagina so that that was
probably<00:07:28.910> harder<00:07:29.870> than<00:07:29.900> what<00:07:30.230> I<00:07:30.290> just<00:07:30.500> had<00:07:30.620> to

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:30.710 
probably harder than what I just had to

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.890 
probably harder than what I just had to
do<00:07:30.830> oh<00:07:31.040> oh<00:07:31.580> I'm<00:07:31.910> sorry<00:07:32.150> should<00:07:32.570> I<00:07:32.630> get<00:07:32.750> your
