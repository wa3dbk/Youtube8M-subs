00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
graffiti and so I decided to stop and to

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.180 
graffiti and so I decided to stop and to
just<00:00:35.040> focus<00:00:35.400> on<00:00:35.550> my<00:00:35.610> degree<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.840> my<00:00:37.410> education

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
I started to feel this void in my life

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.209

because<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.430> was<00:00:41.460> no<00:00:41.820> longer<00:00:42.090> doing<00:00:42.210> graffiti<00:00:42.420> I

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
because I was no longer doing graffiti I

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.340 
because I was no longer doing graffiti I
wanted<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.550> figure<00:00:45.180> out<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.480> way<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.690> doing

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
wanted to figure out a way of doing

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.970 
wanted to figure out a way of doing
street<00:00:47.070> art<00:00:47.420> non-destructively<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.890> came

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
street art non-destructively so I came

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.490 
street art non-destructively so I came
up<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.460> way<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.820> doing<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.960> you

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
up with a way of doing it you

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.610 
up with a way of doing it you
yarn<00:00:52.770> because<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.700> how<00:00:54.240> temporary<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.020> was<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
yarn because of how temporary it was and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
yarn because of how temporary it was and
how<00:00:55.770> easy<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.130> was<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.610> take<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.360> down<00:00:57.540> I<00:00:59.210> want

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
how easy it was to take it down I want

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.760 
how easy it was to take it down I want
people<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> be<00:01:00.630> walking<00:01:00.780> by<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.470> see

you<00:01:12.510> know<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:13.400> usually<00:01:14.400> choose<00:01:14.760> my<00:01:15.030> locations

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
you know I usually choose my locations

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.210 
you know I usually choose my locations
based<00:01:16.080> off<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.670> how<00:01:17.670> new<00:01:18.390> or<00:01:18.780> old<00:01:18.840> they<00:01:19.260> are<00:01:19.290> but

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
based off of how new or old they are but

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.730 
based off of how new or old they are but
I<00:01:20.250> tend<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.850> gravitate<00:01:21.229> towards<00:01:22.229> bringing

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
I tend to gravitate towards bringing

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.940 
I tend to gravitate towards bringing
color<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.810> sort<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.899> a<00:01:24.990> dull<00:01:25.170> space<00:01:25.560> or

color to sort of a dull space or
forgotten<00:01:26.310> space<00:01:27.200> all<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.320> pieces<00:01:28.590> consist<00:01:29.280> of

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
forgotten space all my pieces consist of

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.270 
forgotten space all my pieces consist of
putting<00:01:30.570> yourself<00:01:30.690> through<00:01:31.229> some<00:01:31.860> sort<00:01:32.100> of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
putting yourself through some sort of

manual labor or continuous motion either

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.540 
manual labor or continuous motion either
like<00:01:36.060> walking<00:01:36.509> back<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:36.720> forth<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.649> tying

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
like walking back and forth for tying

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.080 
like walking back and forth for tying
thousands<00:01:39.330> of<00:01:39.420> knots<00:01:40.340> for<00:01:41.340> instance<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
thousands of knots for instance the the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.960 
thousands of knots for instance the the
piece<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.200> did<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:44.430> know<00:01:44.550> we<00:01:44.670> spent

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
piece that I just did you know we spent

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.510 
piece that I just did you know we spent
over<00:01:45.210> 12<00:01:45.450> hours<00:01:45.630> creating<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.380> now<00:01:46.770> you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
over 12 hours creating it but now you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.100 
over 12 hours creating it but now you
know<00:01:47.640> standing<00:01:48.060> back<00:01:48.300> you<00:01:48.690> know<00:01:48.780> creating

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
know standing back you know creating

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.859 
know standing back you know creating
this<00:01:49.259> arc<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.160> space<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.850> know<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.720> almost

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
this arc in the space you know it almost

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.260 
this arc in the space you know it almost
appears<00:01:52.350> as<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:52.979> floating<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:54.149> it's

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
appears as if it's floating or if it's

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.289 
appears as if it's floating or if it's
like<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.810> mist<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.130> from<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.060> rain

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
like the mist you know from the rain

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.080 
like the mist you know from the rain
that's<00:01:57.840> creating<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.530> color<00:01:59.369> field<00:01:59.760> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
that's creating this color field you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.719 
that's creating this color field you
know<00:02:00.439> after<00:02:01.439> walking<00:02:01.650> back<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.070> forth<00:02:02.340> or

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
know after walking back and forth or

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.580 
know after walking back and forth or
tying<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.150> many<00:02:03.299> knots<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.080> seeing<00:02:04.290> sort

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
tying so many knots and just seeing sort

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.340 
tying so many knots and just seeing sort
of<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.939> final<00:02:06.090> product<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.720> seeing<00:02:06.990> people

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
of the final product and seeing people

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.090 
of the final product and seeing people
interact<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.610> engage<00:02:08.880> with<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.690> just

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
interact and engage with it it's just

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.350 
interact and engage with it it's just
it's<00:02:11.100> just<00:02:11.190> like<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.610> greatest<00:02:11.940> feeling<00:02:12.239> ever
