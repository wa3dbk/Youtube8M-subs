00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.380
 that's the way how to learn to 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.599
 drive well today I'll teach you 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.350
 again how to park in a 

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:13.440
 pending that may show slightly 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.440
 ah 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.980
 this is the slope where I have 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.360
 parked my vehicle that always 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.180
 pronounced 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.300
 is a dependent and with a lot 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.740
 inclination then when I starting 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.740
 of a little withdrawal of the vehicle 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.740
 so that when I can start, I do not have 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.440
 that throw backhand just turn the 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.910
 rims completely to the right without 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.800
 have to be independent networks because 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.400
 that's not for me to buy it then 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.470
 we have someone like parking the vehicle 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.470
 It was removed from the other vehicle 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.620
 I 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.970
 with the tires like I said 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.739
 turning to where the platform is for 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.739
 that the car is more secure even 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.820
 the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.860
 as it was a temporary departure from the 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.270
 parking lights on so that the 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.460
 people know is that I'm not going to delay 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.900
 much then the car was very good 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.900
 insured the car was at first 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.120
 and it stayed and stayed with the tires towards the 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.220
 left as I tell you and handbrake 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.840
 completely up and very well 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.780
 insured will also make them have well 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.030
 present that or leave it at first or what 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.280
 you leave in reverse and handbrake up 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.020
 with strength that is well placed 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.880
 then now let's do the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.100
 process of starting that comes first 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.420
 what am I going to do when I start and I have 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.130
 my car in these circumstances 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.920
 then it is in first hand disease 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.290
 up then I put the keys of the 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.390
 vehicle and how will I have it in 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.540
 first then what I'm going to do is 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.880
 sink the clutch without sinking the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.500
 clutch and ignite the vehicle to one day 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.869
 of clutch will be able to see 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.750
 a clutch and I have my foot on the brake 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.710
 I also have the brake foot then 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.500
 I'm going to make my vehicle 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.980
 the brake at this time becomes soft or 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.920
 be the cold is already making its 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.349
 functions 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.450
 its function to stop in this vow already 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.020
 is braking I have the handbrake 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.150
 as you can see above then I'm going to 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.379
 go down like this 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.379
 seatbelt 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.810
 but now 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.780
 and I can start it first and where 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.370
 is I start to turn the address to 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.040
 that the car is going to make me I have 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.830
 first 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.260
 I have a video remember I have the close 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.140
 I forgot I have not released it here you can see 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.450
 the results the car is in first 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.220
 at this moment it is in first it could 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.079
 I also do the neutral but I'm going to 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.890
 leave first and I'm releasing it 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:11.129
 gently as I go I go 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.180
 pulling out that they are giving others 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.010
 completely address to management 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.640
 because remember that I had a car very 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.379
 stuck to the front then I'm letting go 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.470
 Gently blowing up clubs and brake 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:26.890
 close and brake and at this time already 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.190
 luck of all the way you can see there 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.829
 I've only been training them gently 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.140
 and obviously first because as always 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.730
 I insisted on the slopes very 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.620
 inclined you have to get off with the car 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.870
 moored see you in the next of 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.390
 Learn to drive please give me 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.950
 like to comment me this video sure that 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.950
 I thought so until then
