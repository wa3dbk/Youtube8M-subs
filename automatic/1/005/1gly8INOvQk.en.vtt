a<00:02:51.000> poof<00:02:51.210> smoke<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.810> then<00:02:52.500> there's<00:02:52.740> an<00:02:52.950> animal

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430

coming<00:02:53.910> out<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.300> that's<00:02:54.930> because<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.500> when

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
coming out and that's because that when

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.560 
coming out and that's because that when
you<00:02:56.400> fight<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.670> don't<00:02:56.910> actually<00:02:57.120> kill<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
you fight you don't actually kill the

you fight you don't actually kill the
samurai<00:02:58.020> instead<00:02:58.890> what<00:02:59.040> happens<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.490> that<00:02:59.520> you

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
samurai instead what happens is that you

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.270 
samurai instead what happens is that you
break<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.690> spell<00:03:00.990> that<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.950> holds<00:03:02.190> them

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
break the spell that a that holds them

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.580 
break the spell that a that holds them
together<00:03:02.460> and<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:04.110> releases<00:03:04.380> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
together and and that releases the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.950 
together and and that releases the
animal<00:03:05.100> inside<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.570> game<00:03:06.780> that's

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
animal inside so this is a game that's

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.560 
animal inside so this is a game that's
all<00:03:07.080> about<00:03:07.760> restoring<00:03:08.760> parents<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.270> nature

you<00:03:42.830> can<00:03:42.950> also<00:03:43.100> choose<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.490> approach<00:03:44.380> combat

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
you can also choose to approach combat

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.500 
you can also choose to approach combat
and<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.710> different<00:03:46.220> things<00:03:47.060> that<00:03:47.150> happen<00:03:47.450> in

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
and the different things that happen in

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.360 
and the different things that happen in
the<00:03:47.630> game<00:03:47.780> in<00:03:47.960> many<00:03:48.290> many<00:03:48.440> different<00:03:48.590> ways<00:03:49.100> so

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
the game in many many different ways so

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.580 
the game in many many different ways so
here<00:03:50.060> for<00:03:50.090> instance<00:03:50.270> I<00:03:50.600> can<00:03:50.660> show<00:03:50.900> you<00:03:50.960> our

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
here for instance I can show you our

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.980 
here for instance I can show you our
stealth<00:03:51.950> function<00:03:52.400> if<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:53.300> go<00:03:53.420> into<00:03:53.570> the<00:03:53.780> grass

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
stealth function if I go into the grass

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.800 
stealth function if I go into the grass
here<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.380> Crouch<00:03:55.540> hero<00:03:56.540> becomes

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
here and Crouch hero becomes

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.930 
here and Crouch hero becomes
semi-transparent<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.950> that<00:03:58.459> means<00:03:58.670> that<00:03:58.850> the

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
semi-transparent and that means that the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.260 
semi-transparent and that means that the
enemies<00:03:59.240> can't<00:03:59.510> see<00:03:59.690> him<00:03:59.840> so<00:04:00.970> basically<00:04:01.970> i'll

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
enemies can't see him so basically i'll

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.640 
enemies can't see him so basically i'll
let<00:04:02.450> this<00:04:02.600> a<00:04:03.459> patrol<00:04:04.459> of<00:04:04.490> samurais<00:04:05.380> walk<00:04:06.380> past

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
let this a patrol of samurais walk past

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.410 
let this a patrol of samurais walk past
me<00:04:06.830> and<00:04:06.950> hopefully<00:04:07.610> there<00:04:07.940> won't<00:04:08.000> be<00:04:08.150> able<00:04:08.270> to

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
me and hopefully there won't be able to

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.080 
me and hopefully there won't be able to
see<00:04:08.570> me<00:04:08.690> they<00:04:09.230> shouldn't<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:09.910> then<00:04:10.910> i<00:04:10.970> can

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
see me they shouldn't and then i can

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.990 
see me they shouldn't and then i can
perform<00:04:11.330> an<00:04:11.420> ambush<00:04:11.780> on<00:04:11.930> them

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.280 

so<00:04:18.540> as<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.690> can<00:04:18.780> see<00:04:18.900> that's<00:04:19.109> pretty

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
so as you can see that's pretty

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.900 
so as you can see that's pretty
effective<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:20.310> it's<00:04:20.430> really<00:04:20.549> up<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:20.790> the

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
effective so it's really up to the

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.490 
effective so it's really up to the
player<00:04:21.120> how<00:04:21.329> he<00:04:21.390> wants<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.780> approach<00:04:22.200> the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
player how he wants to approach the

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.730 
player how he wants to approach the
different<00:04:22.830> situations<00:04:23.780> all<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.840> ninjas<00:04:25.440> also

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
different situations all the ninjas also

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.760 
different situations all the ninjas also
have<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:26.130> super<00:04:26.700> move<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.200> heroes<00:04:28.470> super

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
have a super move and the heroes super

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.250 
have a super move and the heroes super
move<00:04:28.950> is<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.700> you<00:04:30.090> can<00:04:30.210> freeze<00:04:30.480> time<00:04:30.750> as<00:04:31.020> we

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
move is that you can freeze time as we

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.980 
move is that you can freeze time as we
can<00:04:31.380> see<00:04:31.530> here<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.850> when<00:04:33.330> doing<00:04:33.570> that<00:04:33.720> you<00:04:33.870> can

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
can see here and when doing that you can

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.340 
can see here and when doing that you can
then<00:04:34.110> pick<00:04:34.410> out<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:35.130> samurais<00:04:35.550> one<00:04:35.820> by<00:04:35.970> one

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
then pick out the samurais one by one

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.040 
then pick out the samurais one by one
and<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:38.040> take<00:04:38.910> them<00:04:39.060> out<00:04:39.150> really<00:04:39.360> easily<00:04:39.720> like

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
and and take them out really easily like

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.030 
and and take them out really easily like
that<00:04:41.840> but<00:04:42.840> all<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.260> different<00:04:43.560> ninjas<00:04:43.830> have

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
that but all the different ninjas have

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.070 
that but all the different ninjas have
different<00:04:44.460> super<00:04:44.970> moves<00:04:45.150> so<00:04:45.750> it's<00:04:45.930> all<00:04:46.050> about

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
different super moves so it's all about

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.100 
different super moves so it's all about
tactics<00:04:46.770> about<00:04:46.950> how<00:04:47.520> you<00:04:47.580> want<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:47.940> approach

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
tactics about how you want to approach

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.200 
tactics about how you want to approach
different<00:04:49.110> battle<00:04:49.410> situations<00:04:49.980> just<00:04:50.940> want<00:04:51.150> to

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.280 
different battle situations just want to
get<00:04:51.270> a<00:04:51.330> bit<00:04:51.450> of<00:04:51.480> health<00:04:52.169> up<00:04:52.320> here<00:04:54.230> rather<00:04:55.230> than

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
get a bit of health up here rather than

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.480 
get a bit of health up here rather than
having<00:04:55.500> health<00:04:55.770> packs<00:04:56.010> we<00:04:56.160> thought<00:04:56.310> it<00:04:56.400> was

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
having health packs we thought it was

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.000 
having health packs we thought it was
really<00:04:56.700> nice<00:04:56.820> to<00:04:56.880> have<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.320> like<00:04:58.320> fruit<00:04:58.650> trees
