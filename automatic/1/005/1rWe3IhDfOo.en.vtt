00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
and here I'm just sketching out on a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.560 
and here I'm just sketching out on a
piece<00:00:47.870> of<00:00:48.050> clay<00:00:48.290> of<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.250> basic<00:00:50.030> shape<00:00:50.270> that<00:00:50.300> I

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
piece of clay of the basic shape that I

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.650 
piece of clay of the basic shape that I
want<00:00:50.810> and<00:00:51.170> it<00:00:51.950> kind<00:00:52.460> of<00:00:52.700> looks<00:00:53.240> a<00:00:53.360> little<00:00:53.420> like

a<00:00:53.690> horseshoe<00:00:54.140> with<00:00:54.740> the<00:00:54.950> point<00:00:55.310> at<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.790> top

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
a horseshoe with the point at the top

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.060 
a horseshoe with the point at the top
it's<00:00:57.500> really<00:00:57.530> similar<00:00:58.040> to<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:59.230> tourist<00:01:00.230> key<00:01:00.530> so

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
it's really similar to a tourist key so

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.950 
it's really similar to a tourist key so
once<00:01:01.250> you<00:01:01.370> have<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.730> sides<00:01:01.970> smooth<00:01:02.360> out<00:01:02.600> the

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
once you have the sides smooth out the

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.010 
once you have the sides smooth out the
switch<00:01:03.260> of<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.590> play<00:01:04.240> now<00:01:05.240> I'm<00:01:05.390> just<00:01:05.570> going<00:01:05.780> to

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
switch of the play now I'm just going to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.100 
switch of the play now I'm just going to
attach<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.770> body<00:01:07.730> of<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.510> key<00:01:08.660> to<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:08.870> head

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
attach the body of the key to the head

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.540 
attach the body of the key to the head
of<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.320> key<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:10.070> do<00:01:10.190> that<00:01:10.310> I'm<00:01:10.430> just

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
of the key and to do that I'm just

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.390 
of the key and to do that I'm just
emptying<00:01:11.000> out<00:01:11.300> a<00:01:11.330> little<00:01:11.690> place<00:01:12.200> near<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:13.190> tip

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
emptying out a little place near the tip

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.790

of<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.640> head<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.080> just<00:01:15.080> smoothing<00:01:15.440> it<00:01:15.620> on

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
of the head and just smoothing it on

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.230 
of the head and just smoothing it on
there<00:01:16.040> you<00:01:16.220> want<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:16.700> make<00:01:16.820> sure<00:01:16.850> that

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
there you want to make sure that

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.090 
there you want to make sure that
everything<00:01:17.720> is<00:01:17.900> really<00:01:18.080> nicely<00:01:18.410> attached<00:01:18.830> so

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
everything is really nicely attached so

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.920

you can also do the same thing on the

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.050 
you can also do the same thing on the
back<00:01:21.110> of<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.440> key<00:01:21.650> right<00:01:22.280> now<00:01:22.550> with<00:01:22.790> some<00:01:22.940> of

can take your second medium bulb clay
and<00:01:51.980> start<00:01:52.490> working<00:01:52.730> on<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.120> bottom<00:01:53.330> so

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
and start working on the bottom so

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.840 
and start working on the bottom so
you're<00:01:54.560> going<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.770> want<00:01:54.980> to<00:01:55.040> cut<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:55.340> into<00:01:55.550> a

top or bottom of the diamond and then

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.680 
top or bottom of the diamond and then
smooth<00:02:03.020> out<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.770> edges<00:02:04.060> all<00:02:05.060> right<00:02:05.210> now<00:02:05.420> I'm

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
smooth out the edges all right now I'm

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.680 
smooth out the edges all right now I'm
going<00:02:05.930> to<00:02:06.200> cut<00:02:06.470> out<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:07.390> design<00:02:08.390> on<00:02:08.420> the

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
going to cut out the design on the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.690 
going to cut out the design on the
inside<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.350> it's<00:02:09.470> basically<00:02:09.860> like<00:02:10.190> three

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
inside and it's basically like three

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.020 
inside and it's basically like three
leaves

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
leaves

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.350 
leaves
so<00:02:12.480> you're<00:02:12.750> going<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.900> cut<00:02:13.140> out<00:02:13.260> one<00:02:14.270> for<00:02:15.270> the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
so you're going to cut out one for the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.240 
so you're going to cut out one for the
tip<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.780> diamond<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.440> then<00:02:16.620> two<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.130> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
tip of the diamond and then two on the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.500 
tip of the diamond and then two on the
sides<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:18.120> little<00:02:19.160> circle<00:02:20.160> right<00:02:21.000> at<00:02:21.300> the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
sides and a little circle right at the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.800 
sides and a little circle right at the
base<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.910> once<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.090> smooth<00:02:24.360> out<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
base of it and once you smooth out the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.020 
base of it and once you smooth out the
insides<00:02:25.290> edge<00:02:25.770> looks<00:02:26.310> something<00:02:26.520> like<00:02:26.700> this

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
insides edge looks something like this

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.120 
insides edge looks something like this
and<00:02:27.360> then<00:02:27.930> you're<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.260> going<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.680> want<00:02:28.920> to

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
and then you're just going to want to

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.970 
and then you're just going to want to
attach<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.940> body<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.270> your<00:02:30.420> key<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.950> now

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
attach it to the body of your key so now

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.970 
attach it to the body of your key so now
with<00:02:32.340> some<00:02:32.610> left<00:02:32.850> over<00:02:33.120> both<00:02:33.300> plays<00:02:33.709> make<00:02:34.709> two

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
with some left over both plays make two

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.300

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
logs fold them in half making C's and

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.330 
logs fold them in half making C's and
attach<00:02:38.970> them<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.660> base<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.560> key<00:02:40.800> like

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
attach them to the base of the key like

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.580 
attach them to the base of the key like
you<00:02:41.459> did<00:02:41.670> before<00:02:41.850> for<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.780> head<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.380> key

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
you did before for the head of the key

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.150 
you did before for the head of the key
make<00:02:44.070> two<00:02:44.489> small<00:02:45.030> spirals<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.140> attach<00:02:46.830> them

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
make two small spirals and attach them

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.979

bottom

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.099 

this<00:03:00.790> is<00:03:00.939> what<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.239> base<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.629> the<00:03:01.719> key<00:03:01.900> should

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
this is what the base of the key should

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.199 
this is what the base of the key should
look<00:03:02.290> like<00:03:02.319> all<00:03:03.129> right<00:03:03.280> now<00:03:03.609> it's<00:03:03.790> time<00:03:04.000> for
