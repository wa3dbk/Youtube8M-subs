00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.110
 when he first ran that me 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.150
 believe that there is such a feeling as if 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.260
 your own child so the first steps 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.449
 So you have been accompanied 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.779
 if the development like the first 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.019
 motors were made and then now 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.390
 this complete system where you too 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.160
 the control has written and that 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.860
 then it really works like that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.190
 that has always presented that's it 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.190
 Fulfills 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.700
 the first attempts on smooth ground too 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.320
 running are the first experiences of success 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.970
 if it works then 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.160
 the system then even a little 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.920
 Obstacle rises and you too 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.420
 learn where to turn now and where 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.060
 more question emerge that is 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.190
 then it just opens up 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.480
 once quite a lot of wonder says there must 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.850
 one now goes also scientifically 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.010
 next hector is an inspired one 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.080
 six-piece robot and that 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.780
 six-parted already indicates the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.610
 inspiration all depends on what insects 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.920
 one has to say that one from 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.130
 insects always speaks to you 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.250
 small creatures are also hector's 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.340
 about the factor 20 is larger 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.510
 So just under a meter tall why 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.650
 the bar stay that lies 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.850
 Finally, that the track has been 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.490
 actually 100 years ago 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.740
 that's used in science 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.080
 originally had methodical reasons 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.450
 why to investigate stick insects 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.009
 has to move control above all 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.840
 because they have no wings and not 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.970
 can jump so they have to run 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.460
 and because the legs are very similar 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.050
 look and you thought so that the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.810
 Legs probably all very similar 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.880
 be regulated so that actually 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.880
 over the decades then one 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.220
 become a very important model organism 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.759
 is about motion control in animals too 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.759
 understand 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.650
 hector is unique in its combination 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.140
 he is just a robot system with many 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.390
 degrees of freedom we are all elastic 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.970
 and we have a pretty high degree 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.620
 ii sensor so many sation 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.900
 sensors that come to the system it 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.520
 And these mix this high sensor 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.200
 sighting sgraja the elasticity and so on 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.200
 further that makes it special 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.299
 each leg has its own regulator, the 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.329
 decides what the leg does 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.579
 unlike many classic ones 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.170
 engineers concepts where to find one 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.049
 calculator , he always says you do that 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.859
 you do that, that's not the case 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:54.620
 so that the regulators talk to each other and 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.750
 which has each leg sharing its neighbor 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.370
 with what it does depend on it 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.439
 Decides worry each leg for itself 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.450
 even what makes sense next 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:06.829
 is and interact through this 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.200
 this sex regulator then arises one 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.840
 coordinated way of gearing, for example 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.280
 not that someone pretends 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.290
 most robot systems today 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.109
 especially industrial robots that are stiff 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.500
 and in elastic and all biological 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.299
 Systems are inherently elastic and inherent 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.879
 so it is something special a 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.650
 to build the robot in all its 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.989
 also has elasticity 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.900
 that is if the one with the leg 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.930
 somewhere and on the path there 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.609
 is an obstacle in the way then the may 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.940
 calm because of its elasticity 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.590
 the drives will be noticed 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.940
 and can provide appropriate reflexes 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.120
 trigger that then for example 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.919
 that's what he says about that 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.409
 can feel his surroundings because he is her 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:53.329
 one is already in a position to touch 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.810
 stop over certain obstacles 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.810
 get 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.220
 the 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.260
 the divine coordination regulates that is 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.620
 he determine when which take off 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.440
 may 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.750
 He has hundreds of parameters there 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.570
 that affect the running 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.360
 and if you try them all now 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.790
 would test with the real robot 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.440
 then it would be quickly worn out and stuff like that 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.750
 You can just do the the simulation 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.810
 use and run day and night 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.830
 leave or because there are any engines 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.390
 have to be serviced 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.120
 That's why we have a simulation 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.190
 hector now with the 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.840
 skills he has now stands as 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.520
 research platform for the first time so 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.470
 disposal that means we would that 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.300
 continue to test it with the 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.850
 Stop seeing biologists in close consultation 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.410
 how we improve the results 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.490
 can and each other there 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.720
 can fertilize what again 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:51.360
 Questions are in it, we are stuck in it 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.500
 want to show in three years that hector 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.380
 outside in normal natural environment 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.450
 on different surfaces one 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.100
 running behind people 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.360
 can work independently and independently 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.320
 then maybe back again 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:11.600
 still running around obstacles and that 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.600
 Robust and reliable masters
