00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
the skin but it still is a buzz cut

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.949 
the skin but it still is a buzz cut
there's<00:01:47.160> still<00:01:47.489> hair<00:01:47.880> remaining<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.569> the<00:01:48.750> head

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
there's still hair remaining on the head

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.290 
there's still hair remaining on the head
and<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.709> all<00:01:49.920> going<00:01:50.069> to<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.220> uniform<00:01:50.759> all<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
and it's all going to be uniform all the

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.479 
and it's all going to be uniform all the
same<00:01:51.509> length<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:52.050> you're<00:01:52.560> shaving<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> head

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:53.489 
same length if you're shaving the head

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:55.609 
same length if you're shaving the head
then<00:01:54.119> what<00:01:54.300> you<00:01:54.420> would<00:01:54.569> most<00:01:54.840> likely<00:01:55.050> do<00:01:55.319> like

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
then what you would most likely do like

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.410 
then what you would most likely do like
if<00:01:55.830> Dan<00:01:56.039> had<00:01:56.220> come<00:01:56.429> in<00:01:56.580> for<00:01:56.789> example<00:01:57.119> what

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
if Dan had come in for example what

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.270 
if Dan had come in for example what
saying<00:01:57.660> I<00:01:57.780> want<00:01:57.959> to<00:01:58.050> shave<00:01:58.259> my<00:01:58.440> head<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.069> first

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
saying I want to shave my head the first

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.979 
saying I want to shave my head the first
thing<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.610> would<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.880> done<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.660> go<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:00.989 
thing I would have done is I go to the

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:02.540 
thing I would have done is I go to the
smallest<00:02:01.410> that<00:02:01.739> I<00:02:01.770> had<00:02:02.069> which<00:02:02.280> would<00:02:02.429> be

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
smallest that I had which would be

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.490 
smallest that I had which would be
straight<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> blade<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.080> in<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.259> case

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
straight on the blade so in this case

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.620 
straight on the blade so in this case
let's<00:02:04.739> say<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> take<00:02:05.160> my<00:02:05.369> walls<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:06.060> would<00:02:06.539> have

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
let's say I take my walls I would have

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.999 
let's say I take my walls I would have
taken<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.110> put<00:02:07.440> it<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.770> closed<00:02:07.979> position

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
taken this put it in the closed position

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.040 
taken this put it in the closed position
and<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.819> really<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.239> removed<00:02:09.569> all<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.810> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
and I really have removed all of the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.780 
and I really have removed all of the
hair<00:02:10.229> from<00:02:10.379> his<00:02:10.530> head<00:02:10.590> as<00:02:10.860> best<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.280> could<00:02:11.550> so

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
hair from his head as best I could so

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.820 
hair from his head as best I could so
I'm<00:02:11.910> right<00:02:12.150> down<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.510> just<00:02:12.660> stubble<00:02:13.170> on<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
I'm right down to just stubble on the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.160 
I'm right down to just stubble on the
top<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.190> his<00:02:14.310> head<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.730> would<00:02:15.360> then<00:02:15.540> take<00:02:15.569> and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
top of his head I would then take and

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.460 
top of his head I would then take and
put<00:02:17.069> warm<00:02:17.760> hot<00:02:18.060> towels<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.750> help<00:02:18.930> open<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:19.319> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
put warm hot towels to help open up the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.589 
put warm hot towels to help open up the
pores<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:20.010> would<00:02:20.459> place<00:02:20.670> them<00:02:20.879> on<00:02:21.000> top<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.390> his

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
pores I would place them on top of his

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.470 
pores I would place them on top of his
head<00:02:21.629> here<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.349> then<00:02:23.310> let<00:02:23.970> them<00:02:24.120> sort<00:02:24.390> of

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
head here and then let them sort of

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.030 
head here and then let them sort of
you'll<00:02:24.750> love<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.140> head<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.319> little<00:02:25.500> bit<00:02:25.680> make

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
you'll love the head a little bit make

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.589 
you'll love the head a little bit make
sure<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.520> pores<00:02:26.760> are<00:02:26.970> getting<00:02:27.180> nice<00:02:27.360> and

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
sure that the pores are getting nice and

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.960 
sure that the pores are getting nice and
warmed<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.230> opened<00:02:28.560> up<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.920> would<00:02:29.520> then<00:02:29.640> remove

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
warmed and opened up I would then remove

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.630 
warmed and opened up I would then remove
them<00:02:30.239> if<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.930> have<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> lather<00:02:31.590> machine<00:02:32.129> which

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
them if you have a lather machine which

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.550 
them if you have a lather machine which
is<00:02:32.849> basically<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.269> hot<00:02:33.659> lather<00:02:33.900> machine<00:02:34.349> that's

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
is basically a hot lather machine that's

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.830 
is basically a hot lather machine that's
the<00:02:34.709> ideal<00:02:35.040> way<00:02:35.219> to<00:02:35.250> do<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.519> shaved<00:02:35.849> head<00:02:36.120> you

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
the ideal way to do a shaved head you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.899 
the ideal way to do a shaved head you
would<00:02:36.959> then<00:02:37.109> take<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.489> required<00:02:38.489> amount<00:02:38.819> of

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
would then take the required amount of

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:39.260 
would then take the required amount of
hot

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
hot

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.120 
hot
either<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:40.020> would<00:02:40.140> put<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.350> over<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:41.100> whole

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
either you would put that over the whole

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.890 
either you would put that over the whole
area<00:02:41.280> that's<00:02:41.820> going<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.060> be<00:02:42.120> shaved<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
area that's going to be shaved on the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.420 
area that's going to be shaved on the
top<00:02:43.050> of<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.290> head<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.130> would<00:02:44.280> then<00:02:44.310> take

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
top of the head and you would then take

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.450 
top of the head and you would then take
a<00:02:44.700> straightedge<00:02:45.210> razor<00:02:45.530> now<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:47.070> don't

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
a straightedge razor now and I don't

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.040 
a straightedge razor now and I don't
have<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.700> straight<00:02:48.030> edge<00:02:48.210> razor<00:02:48.450> because<00:02:48.780> I

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
have a straight edge razor because I

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.200 
have a straight edge razor because I
don't<00:02:49.230> offer<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:49.770> particular<00:02:50.070> service<00:02:50.460> but

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
don't offer this particular service but

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.670 
don't offer this particular service but
what<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.390> can<00:02:51.660> show<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.170> would<00:02:52.320> essentially

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
what I can show you it would essentially

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.950 
what I can show you it would essentially
be<00:02:52.800> like<00:02:53.190> this<00:02:53.400> feather<00:02:53.700> razor<00:02:54.000> but<00:02:54.720> instead

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
be like this feather razor but instead

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.010 
be like this feather razor but instead
of<00:02:55.020> having<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.440> guard<00:02:55.710> on<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.750> we<00:02:57.750> were<00:02:57.900> to

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
of having a guard on it we were to

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.380 
of having a guard on it we were to
remove<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.860> would<00:02:59.190> be<00:02:59.400> right<00:03:00.060> down<00:03:00.270> to

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
remove that it would be right down to

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.240 
remove that it would be right down to
the<00:03:00.480> edge<00:03:00.630> here<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:01.290> just<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.560> very<00:03:01.950> edge

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
the edge here and just the very edge

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.730 
the edge here and just the very edge
which<00:03:02.850> is<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:03.030> straight<00:03:03.510> edge<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:04.020> what<00:03:04.590> would

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
which is a straight edge is what would

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.250 
which is a straight edge is what would
be<00:03:04.860> used<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.310> cut<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.550> head<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.150> when<00:03:06.990> I<00:03:07.020> say

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
be used to cut the head and when I say

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.360 
be used to cut the head and when I say
cut<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.590> head<00:03:07.740> I<00:03:07.770> don't<00:03:07.920> mean<00:03:08.130> you're<00:03:08.250> going

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
cut the head I don't mean you're going

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.980 
cut the head I don't mean you're going
to<00:03:08.460> cut<00:03:08.640> holes<00:03:08.910> into<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.240> you're<00:03:09.450> essentially

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
to cut holes into it you're essentially

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.870 
to cut holes into it you're essentially
going<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.530> take<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:11.010> you're<00:03:11.040> going<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.460> glide

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
going to take and you're going to glide

set<00:03:18.210> angle<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.870> make<00:03:18.990> sure<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.470> don't

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
set angle to make sure that you don't

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.650 
set angle to make sure that you don't
cut<00:03:19.920> into<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.340> head<00:03:20.520> you<00:03:21.060> just<00:03:21.090> want<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.510> let

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
cut into the head you just want to let

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.600 
cut into the head you just want to let
the<00:03:21.960> the<00:03:22.320> straight<00:03:22.560> edge<00:03:22.680> razor<00:03:22.890> glide<00:03:23.160> across

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
the the straight edge razor glide across

the the straight edge razor glide across
the<00:03:23.790> top<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.210> remove<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.630> hair<00:03:24.810> at<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.740> end

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
the top and remove the hair at the end

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.860 
the top and remove the hair at the end
of<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.130> time<00:03:26.430> period<00:03:26.460> I<00:03:27.000> would<00:03:27.450> then<00:03:27.600> clean

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
of that time period I would then clean

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.690 
of that time period I would then clean
off<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.230> hair<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:29.010> head<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.400> remaining

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
off the hair the head of the remaining

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.330 
off the hair the head of the remaining
shaving<00:03:30.150> lotion<00:03:30.570> that's<00:03:31.110> on<00:03:31.380> there<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.860> would

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
shaving lotion that's on there I would

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.220 
shaving lotion that's on there I would
probably<00:03:32.550> take<00:03:32.820> some<00:03:33.060> cool<00:03:33.420> towels<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:34.050> help

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
probably take some cool towels to help

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.020 
probably take some cool towels to help
close<00:03:34.530> those<00:03:34.800> pores<00:03:35.130> again<00:03:35.490> because<00:03:35.910> you've

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
close those pores again because you've

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.270 
close those pores again because you've
just<00:03:36.240> had<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.420> shaving<00:03:36.870> experience<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.680> then<00:03:38.250> I

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
just had a shaving experience and then I

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.190 
just had a shaving experience and then I
would<00:03:38.490> probably<00:03:38.700> apply<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.510> little<00:03:39.960> bit<00:03:40.080> of

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
would probably apply a little bit of

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.960 
would probably apply a little bit of
what<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.410> like<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.740> call<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:41.070> bay<00:03:41.250> rum<00:03:41.520> which<00:03:41.820> is

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
what I like to call the bay rum which is

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.720 
what I like to call the bay rum which is
a<00:03:42.000> basically<00:03:42.660> it's<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:43.190> aftershave<00:03:44.190> lotion

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
a basically it's a aftershave lotion

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.900 
a basically it's a aftershave lotion
it's<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.120> hair<00:03:45.420> tonic<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.950> apply<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.730> head

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
it's a hair tonic to apply to the head

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.630 
it's a hair tonic to apply to the head
to<00:03:48.120> help<00:03:48.330> moisturize<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.560> head<00:03:49.740> and<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.100> make

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
to help moisturize the head and to make

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.730 
to help moisturize the head and to make
sure<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.820> there's<00:03:51.209> no<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:52.380> know<00:03:52.410> clogged

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
sure that there's no you know clogged

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.410 
sure that there's no you know clogged
pores<00:03:53.070> or<00:03:53.280> anything<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.670> nature<00:03:53.820> in<00:03:54.270> it

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
pores or anything of that nature in it

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.199 
pores or anything of that nature in it
so<00:03:55.250> that's<00:03:56.250> probably<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:56.610> longer<00:03:56.880> explanation

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
so that's probably a longer explanation

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.940 
so that's probably a longer explanation
that<00:03:57.690> what<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:57.959> may<00:03:58.170> have<00:03:58.290> been<00:03:58.440> looking<00:03:58.560> for

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
that what you may have been looking for

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.920 
that what you may have been looking for
but<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.280> primary<00:04:00.000> differences<00:04:00.450> between<00:04:00.750> a

but the primary differences between a
buzz<00:04:01.200> cut<00:04:01.440> versus<00:04:01.860> a<00:04:01.980> shaved<00:04:02.280> head<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.730> the

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
buzz cut versus a shaved head is the

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.810 
buzz cut versus a shaved head is the
amount<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:03.900> removal<00:04:04.350> of<00:04:04.500> hair<00:04:04.740> shaved<00:04:05.550> head
