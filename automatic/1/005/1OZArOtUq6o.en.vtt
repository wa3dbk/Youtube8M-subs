king is in the middle of the base if
that<00:02:25.260> makes<00:02:25.440> any<00:02:25.530> sense<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.130> they<00:02:26.640> have<00:02:26.910> such

middle of the base like I have in mind I

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.330 
middle of the base like I have in mind I
mean<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.170> really<00:02:43.290> hard<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.920> three<00:02:44.100> star
