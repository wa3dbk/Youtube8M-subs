00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
go tell it on a mountain because I might

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.139 
go tell it on a mountain because I might

but to be completely honest this is

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:57.919 
but to be completely honest this is
exactly<00:01:56.520> what<00:01:56.819> I<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:56.969> looking<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.389> as<00:01:57.630> far<00:01:57.659> as

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
really like to compete if I can't

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.660 
really like to compete if I can't
compete<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.780> way<00:02:03.929> that's<00:02:04.280> not<00:02:05.280> only<00:02:05.399> fair

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
compete in a way that's not only fair

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.489 
compete in a way that's not only fair
but<00:02:05.729> also<00:02:05.999> organized<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.229> don't

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:07.499 
but also organized and I don't

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:09.380

necessarily<00:02:08.160> want<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:08.880> play<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.119> that's<00:02:09.240> just

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
necessarily want to play and that's just

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.790 
necessarily want to play and that's just
why<00:02:09.570> I<00:02:09.600> don't<00:02:09.840> play<00:02:09.990> pvp<00:02:10.320> and<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.590> lot<00:02:10.710> of<00:02:10.740> people

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
ask me to PvP it's just why I don't

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.559 
ask me to PvP it's just why I don't

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.660 
before obviously so having a team that I
could<00:02:28.349> practice<00:02:28.439> with<00:02:28.709> actually<00:02:29.189> makes<00:02:29.400> me

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
could practice with actually makes me

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.199

want to play pvp now so this is a really
good<00:02:33.450> update<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.049> is<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> great<00:02:34.560> update

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
good update and this is a great update

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.610 
good update and this is a great update
for<00:02:35.069> PvP<00:02:35.459> years<00:02:35.609> in<00:02:35.760> general<00:02:36.090> there<00:02:36.989> were<00:02:37.200> some

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
for PvP years in general there were some

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.559 
for PvP years in general there were some
class<00:02:37.889> balance<00:02:38.370> changes<00:02:38.609> that<00:02:39.000> will<00:02:39.090> probably

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
class balance changes that will probably

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.110 
class balance changes that will probably
go<00:02:39.750> over<00:02:39.780> once<00:02:40.469> the<00:02:40.950> changes<00:02:41.609> are<00:02:41.730> close<00:02:41.939> to

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
go over once the changes are close to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.360 
go over once the changes are close to
finalized<00:02:42.629> on<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.079> some<00:02:43.469> of<00:02:43.590> them<00:02:43.709> don't

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
finalized on that some of them don't

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.030 
finalized on that some of them don't
seem<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:45.329> be<00:02:45.540> necessarily<00:02:46.409> functioning

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
seem to be necessarily functioning

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.649 
seem to be necessarily functioning
properly<00:02:47.189> for<00:02:47.700> example<00:02:48.120> currently<00:02:48.269> on<00:02:48.629> the

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
properly for example currently on the

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.379 
properly for example currently on the
pts<00:02:49.169> the<00:02:50.010> phase<00:02:50.459> walkability<00:02:50.909> that<00:02:51.299> the

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
pts the phase walkability that the

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.110 
pts the phase walkability that the
assassins<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.769> equivalent<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.459> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
assassins have and the equivalent of the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.199 
assassins have and the equivalent of the
the<00:02:55.049> counselors<00:02:56.040> version<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.700> assassin

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
the counselors version of the assassin

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.000 
the counselors version of the assassin
it's<00:02:57.900> actually<00:02:58.109> broken<00:02:58.349> doesn't<00:02:58.739> have<00:02:58.829> a<00:02:58.859> cool

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
it's actually broken doesn't have a cool

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
it's actually broken doesn't have a cool
down<00:02:59.159> so<00:02:59.340> it's<00:02:59.459> kind<00:02:59.669> of<00:02:59.700> funny<00:02:59.879> watching

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
down so it's kind of funny watching

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.990 
down so it's kind of funny watching
everybody<00:03:00.359> teleporter<00:03:00.870> ramp<00:03:01.049> however<00:03:02.000> that's

everybody teleporter ramp however that's

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.899 
everybody teleporter ramp however that's
not<00:03:03.599> a<00:03:03.959> that's<00:03:04.680> going<00:03:05.159> live<00:03:05.370> it's<00:03:05.579> actually<00:03:05.879> a

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
not a that's going live it's actually a

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.670 
not a that's going live it's actually a
bug<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.480> there's<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.870> few<00:03:07.109> bugs<00:03:07.290> like<00:03:07.500> that

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
bug and there's a few bugs like that

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.959 
bug and there's a few bugs like that
with<00:03:07.919> some<00:03:08.129> of<00:03:08.219> the<00:03:08.280> changes<00:03:08.430> like<00:03:08.790> that

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:08.969 
with some of the changes like that

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.979 
with some of the changes like that
powertech<00:03:09.810> DPS<00:03:10.290> got<00:03:10.560> changed<00:03:11.419> pretty<00:03:12.419> pretty

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
powertech DPS got changed pretty pretty

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.839 
powertech DPS got changed pretty pretty
significantly<00:03:13.650> actually<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.459> mean<00:03:14.700> you

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.580 
significantly actually I mean you
wouldn't<00:03:15.060> think<00:03:15.239> like<00:03:15.510> everything<00:03:16.469> is

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
wouldn't think like everything is

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.110 
wouldn't think like everything is
different<00:03:16.769> but<00:03:17.159> there<00:03:17.459> were<00:03:17.579> some<00:03:17.729> pretty<00:03:17.879> big

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
different but there were some pretty big

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.149 
different but there were some pretty big
changes<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.629> will<00:03:18.780> end<00:03:18.930> up<00:03:19.049> covering<00:03:19.409> but

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
changes that will end up covering but

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.490 
changes that will end up covering but
since<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:20.489> is<00:03:20.669> a<00:03:20.699> pvp<00:03:21.239> patch<00:03:21.449> I'm<00:03:22.019> forced<00:03:22.440> to

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
understand they also took the previous

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.979 
understand they also took the previous
tier<00:03:37.019> of<00:03:37.260> pvp<00:03:38.040> gear<00:03:38.340> out<00:03:38.669> or<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.329> lowest

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
tier of pvp gear out or the the lowest

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.869 
tier of pvp gear out or the the lowest
one<00:03:40.199> I<00:03:40.229> should<00:03:40.379> say<00:03:40.739> that's<00:03:41.280> no<00:03:41.459> longer<00:03:41.579> there

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
one I should say that's no longer there

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.490 
one I should say that's no longer there
anymore<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.449> you<00:03:42.569> can't<00:03:42.780> actually<00:03:42.930> purchase

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
anymore so you can't actually purchase

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.939 
anymore so you can't actually purchase
it<00:03:43.680> not<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.909> I'm<00:03:45.319> necessarily<00:03:46.319> broken<00:03:46.799> up

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
it not that I'm necessarily broken up

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:48.649 
it not that I'm necessarily broken up
about<00:03:47.069> it<00:03:47.280> because<00:03:47.759> I've<00:03:47.909> never<00:03:47.939> really

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
about it because I've never really

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.439 
about it because I've never really
wanted<00:03:49.439> it<00:03:49.590> but<00:03:49.859> now<00:03:50.159> that<00:03:50.459> there's<00:03:50.669> a<00:03:50.729> really

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
wanted it but now that there's a really

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.229 
wanted it but now that there's a really
good<00:03:51.780> tier<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.229> pvp<00:03:52.650> gear<00:03:52.829> coming<00:03:53.099> in<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:53.849> i

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
good tier of pvp gear coming in I i

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.479 
good tier of pvp gear coming in I i
think<00:03:54.780> i'll<00:03:54.900> actually<00:03:55.079> strive<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:56.159> get<00:03:56.340> it

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
think i'll actually strive to to get it

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.129 
think i'll actually strive to to get it
and<00:03:56.639> you<00:03:57.239> can<00:03:57.359> see<00:03:57.479> the<00:03:57.599> cost<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:58.049> everything

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
and you can see the cost of everything

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.280 
and you can see the cost of everything
right<00:03:58.560> there<00:03:58.769> it's<00:03:59.489> fairly<00:04:00.329> expensive<00:04:00.840> per

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
right there it's fairly expensive per

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.439 
right there it's fairly expensive per
piece<00:04:01.530> but<00:04:02.159> i'm<00:04:02.280> pretty<00:04:02.400> sure<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:03.030> can

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
piece but i'm pretty sure you can

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.719 
piece but i'm pretty sure you can
compensate<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.169> you<00:04:04.349> could<00:04:04.470> just<00:04:04.500> get<00:04:04.799> it<00:04:04.829> in

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
compensate and you could just get it in

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.909 
compensate and you could just get it in
fact<00:04:06.030> so<00:04:06.359> far<00:04:06.629> from<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.079> numbers<00:04:07.379> i'm<00:04:07.530> seeing

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
fact so far from the numbers i'm seeing

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.129 
fact so far from the numbers i'm seeing
it<00:04:08.189> is<00:04:08.699> actually<00:04:09.120> very<00:04:09.150> similar<00:04:09.509> to<00:04:09.659> wow<00:04:09.900> in

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
it is actually very similar to wow in

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.740 
it is actually very similar to wow in
the<00:04:10.620> time<00:04:10.859> it<00:04:10.889> takes<00:04:11.159> to<00:04:11.310> gear<00:04:11.699> up<00:04:11.729> you<00:04:12.689> know

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
the time it takes to gear up you know

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.289 
the time it takes to gear up you know
really<00:04:13.049> good<00:04:13.290> arena<00:04:13.680> gear<00:04:13.979> and<00:04:14.250> wow<00:04:14.970> or<00:04:15.180> at

really good arena gear and wow or at

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.029 
really good arena gear and wow or at
least<00:04:15.449> when<00:04:15.629> it<00:04:15.750> used<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.139> back<00:04:16.349> in<00:04:16.380> Cataclysm

significant<00:05:05.060> increase<00:05:05.630> in<00:05:05.710> PvP<00:05:06.710> cues<00:05:07.390> not<00:05:08.390> the

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
significant increase in PvP cues not the

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.780 
significant increase in PvP cues not the
time<00:05:08.900> that<00:05:09.140> it<00:05:09.260> takes<00:05:09.410> but<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:09.860> you<00:05:10.190> know<00:05:10.310> you

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
time that it takes but the you know you

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.070 
time that it takes but the you know you
know<00:05:10.910> I'm<00:05:11.060> trying<00:05:11.150> to<00:05:11.270> say<00:05:11.450> the<00:05:11.870> amount<00:05:12.050> of

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
know I'm trying to say the amount of

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.480 
know I'm trying to say the amount of
people<00:05:12.140> queuing<00:05:12.650> for<00:05:12.680> it<00:05:12.980> so<00:05:13.100> it<00:05:13.160> should<00:05:13.340> take

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
people queuing for it so it should take

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.520 
people queuing for it so it should take
a<00:05:13.520> quicker<00:05:14.210> amount<00:05:14.480> of<00:05:14.540> time<00:05:14.660> especially<00:05:15.200> if

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
a quicker amount of time especially if

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.500 
a quicker amount of time especially if
you're<00:05:15.650> doing<00:05:15.920> arenas<00:05:16.400> so<00:05:16.820> my<00:05:16.970> suggestion<00:05:17.360> to
