how<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.809> dogs<00:00:34.140> get<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.739> well<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.579> get<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.910> by

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
how the dogs get it well we get it by

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.930 
how the dogs get it well we get it by
ingesting<00:00:36.870> an<00:00:36.989> intermediate<00:00:37.620> host<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.430> slugs

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
ingesting an intermediate host so slugs

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.720 
ingesting an intermediate host so slugs
and<00:00:39.149> snails<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:40.590> not<00:00:40.770> necessarily<00:00:40.920> just

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
and snails and it's not necessarily just

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.400 
and snails and it's not necessarily just
the<00:00:41.910> obvious<00:00:42.059> great<00:00:42.540> big<00:00:42.690> slugs<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.290> have

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the obvious great big slugs that we have

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.380 
the obvious great big slugs that we have
to<00:00:43.530> worry<00:00:43.739> about<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.190> also<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.520> tiny<00:00:45.000> little

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
to worry about it's also a tiny little

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.660 
to worry about it's also a tiny little
ones<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.559> might<00:00:46.710> not<00:00:46.860> even<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:47.399> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
ones that we might not even see and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.639 
ones that we might not even see and
particularly<00:00:48.450> they<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:48.989> found<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.379> water

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
particularly they can be found in water

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.400 
particularly they can be found in water
bowls<00:00:50.010> or<00:00:50.550> they<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.420> found<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.719> toys<00:00:52.050> left

they're rooting through undergrowth and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.200 
they're rooting through undergrowth and
that's<00:01:11.189> when<00:01:11.460> they<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.700> pick<00:01:11.909> up<00:01:12.060> these

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
that's when they can pick up these

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.570 
that's when they can pick up these
little<00:01:12.510> slugs<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.650> say<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> facts<00:01:14.280> the

not be itself might be losing weight to

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.280 
not be itself might be losing weight to
coughing<00:01:32.000> bleeding<00:01:33.000> might<00:01:33.720> become<00:01:33.869> anemic

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
coughing bleeding might become anemic

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.499 
coughing bleeding might become anemic
where<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.770> gets<00:01:34.860> very<00:01:35.009> very<00:01:35.189> pale<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.390> way

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509

through to seizures fits and very sadly

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.560 
through to seizures fits and very sadly
ultimately<00:01:39.329> death<00:01:39.680> so<00:01:40.680> once<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.759> dog<00:01:41.970> ingests
