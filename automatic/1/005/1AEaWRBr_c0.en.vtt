00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.450
 because I'm a clumsy and also look for 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.719
 say questions because you are not my 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.719
 father 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.670
 what the hell is wrong with you, but what is it? 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.670
 we did 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.210
 osvaldo 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.350
 answer me I'm so sorry sir 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.340
 I did see it at the party 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.340
 It was my temple 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.260
 today 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:54.309
 and I'm happy 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.309
 tomorrow ended all the vices 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:12.460
 sorry 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.080
 Then I spent to record myself and a flat part 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.080
 you're fine you remember what we did 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.830
 that you should have thrown for that 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.470
 balcony 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.390
 but my dad is going to find you so that 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.160
 you stay forever in this damn 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.350
 country for free but in a jail that 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:38.230
 do you know of innocence 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:41.470
 none was innocent they were all the same 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:46.860
 weak and vulnerable 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.860
 but deep down they were harlots 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.900
 and I won 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.900
 they will leave me free 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.560
 it's worth saying nothing ready for 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.500
 come back against me yes but let's see 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.020
 how much does the t1 visit gives you luck 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.150
 that's the cheesiest thing I heard in my 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.020
 life I have to go I can not anymore 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.610
 keep waiting 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.190
 just a minute please if the same 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.480
 you said ten years ago if you do not compete but 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.910
 win 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.670
 boys are sure we did well 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.310
 and not let Daniel enter the team 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.230
 no matter at this point 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.270
 we want in the team then you do not 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.440
 It remains more than endure I do not care 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.990
 as they did with their last coach 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.360
 and you 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.670
 you are no longer the capital 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.460
 a captain has to know how to sink with 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.010
 his team 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.290
 and you have no idea what 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.879
 what are you 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.879
 then everyone understood 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.630
 from this moment 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.730
 they are winners 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.900
 because this one that is here 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.900
 does not train losers
