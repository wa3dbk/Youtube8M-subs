00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.680
 good morning girls then today is a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.540
 day of vacation because April 26th 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.900
 and I have done so sinfully that the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.670
 time as they had already announced 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.540
 all the newscasts do enough 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.400
 disgust 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.800
 this morning I went out just to do the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.720
 spending demand with the bike obviously at 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.420
 return I took that today is fine then them 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.160
 you are at home or dozing all over 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.199
 day I woke up a little later I have to 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.080
 go to the gym but I had an hour 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.329
 about still free and I thought of 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.140
 try making this trick that 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.290
 meanwhile you asked me why 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.180
 But even I October million followers 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.820
 a girl above all had asked me 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.129
 because he had bought some color gods 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.079
 burgundy plum color did not know well 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.550
 as combining asked me if by 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.980
 guides then I used 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.550
 mainly this palette here that 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.620
 she the short stop under 4 8 of slick 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.280
 so the eye shadows all come from 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.729
 this blade here is the result e 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.229
 this makes me laugh because now I could 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.210
 even put on the suit to go in 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.479
 gym so I go in overalls though col 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.140
 makeup who cares nothing I wanted 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.420
 just let you see how I had it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.250
 I combined the colors honestly 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.900
 I don't mind the effect there goes a little 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.580
 make it so maybe I wouldn't do it 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.159
 in the morning to go to work but it 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.979
 I would keep more for an aperitif dinner here 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.409
 because I am a bit impeded 5 given 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.110
 not one, however, is twenty minutes 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.329
 maybe do this trick it takes e 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.180
 just this tina shirts i wash myself 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.430
 shown in the ski oil inside and 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.729
 is so so now you see it too 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.729
 just wear it and see you soon 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.920
 then we start from the base eye shadow that 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.500
 we are going to do with this illusion 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.630
 of shadows of scene 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.740
 which is called he and it is this purplish 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.740
 prune ceo 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.980
 also below while drying it I go to 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.030
 outline the eyebrows with the bravo 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.700
 design and fix by paola p after i go into 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.380
 gym so I try to do a trick 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.620
 that holds this more times also 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.020
 at the gym in the evening when I take off my make-up 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.520
 I really have to get over the cotton 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:56.750
 in short, it really has a good seal 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.750
 so it's good for our purpose 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.820
 look now let's take ours 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.420
 palette and let's go to the center 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:16.070
 of the eyelid the pink this beautiful rose 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.070
 very intense show 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.950
 in the outermost part of the eye a 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.950
 peak this color here instead 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.189
 instead this very bright purple born 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.019
 I want it to apply below and just 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.739
 just barely in the corner of the eye 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.739
 external 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:07.180
 at this point to blend the purple and the 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:12.209
 eye shadow contours over way to 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.209
 soften the contours a bit, let's say 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.709
 this colorino but found to put 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.450
 under the eyebrows this a little more 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.450
 brilliants born within the eye 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.199
 the thin eyeliner This here is the 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.669
 ultra shine eyeliner and color pupa 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.629
 since the girl had asked me for it 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:54.680
 and 00 01 and is that of the collection 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:05:01.340
 50s that there is now no here it is e 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:04.069
 purple and glittery to me at this point 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.819
 remember to put the gel on 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:13.430
 eyebrows above to make it long 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:17.630
 held in waterproof and mascara this e 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.550
 that of eu stretching fiber with 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.039
 this I found myself very well there 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.630
 I had already spoken I had found if well 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:30.759
 remember in a big box 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:33.759
 ok let's put some Cypriot complexion 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.759
 perfect 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:46.749
 a well and one of Mediterranean land but 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:06:05.870
 blush one of my absolute favorites 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:06:09.949
 or snow embroidery makeup I put some 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:13.180
 this color here as illuminating here 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.180
 on the cheeks 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:24.050
 and how to gloss the peak on software 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:31.460
 again I don't like this one here 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:33.110
 a lot because from ceo and rose but then 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.620
 especially weird neighbor instead a 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.620
 bag 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.450
 finished 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.550
 does not make remorse 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.420
 and to see that he seemed to be assistant to 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:10.380
 regia seemed assistant director 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:13.460
 you don't bite mommy you are 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.460
 the assistant director
