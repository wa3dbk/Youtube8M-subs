00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
the team so when they are the higher

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.810 
the team so when they are the higher
seat<00:04:42.020> he<00:04:42.410> is<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.650> closest<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.370> opponents

going<00:04:49.340> to<00:04:49.400> try<00:04:49.639> and<00:04:49.760> get<00:04:49.850> into<00:04:50.030> his<00:04:50.240> head<00:04:50.450> is

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
going to try and get into his head is

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.360 
going to try and get into his head is
that<00:04:51.050> a<00:04:51.080> strategy<00:04:51.530> move<00:04:51.650> here<00:04:51.860> from<00:04:51.950> instinct

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
that a strategy move here from instinct

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.150 
that a strategy move here from instinct
I<00:04:52.850> think<00:04:53.780> I<00:04:53.930> don't<00:04:54.200> know<00:04:54.260> necessarily<00:04:54.590> that's

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
I think I don't know necessarily that's

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.230 
I think I don't know necessarily that's
a<00:04:55.250> strategy<00:04:55.460> move<00:04:55.760> I<00:04:55.850> think<00:04:55.880> that's<00:04:56.180> a

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
a strategy move I think that's a

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.270 
a strategy move I think that's a
personal<00:04:56.630> preference<00:04:56.900> for<00:04:57.229> neighbor<00:04:57.500> I<00:04:57.800> mean

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
personal preference for neighbor I mean

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.930 
personal preference for neighbor I mean
in<00:04:58.400> 2007<00:04:59.180> season<00:04:59.600> those
