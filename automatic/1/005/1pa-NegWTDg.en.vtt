00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello girls I'm delighted with you 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.540
 find today you make a 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.610
 little video to introduce you to my 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.080
 new hairstyle does a lot of 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.690
 hairstyle you I did not touch to 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.200
 my shot I just touch my color 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.049
 hair 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.330
 so to make you a little summary of 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.750
 my last hair experiences the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.550
 last time finally in September 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.740
 I decided to tie and dye 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.810
 so to shadows and m and you've been 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.160
 many do not like and for me 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.000
 I did not really like it either because 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.189
 that I think it made me 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.780
 roots really too dark knowing 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.420
 that I got myself an ash melon is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.530
 clear naturally at the root and who 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.809
 fade very quickly 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.300
 naturally with the sun the pool 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.950
 the sea ​​and all that here at the meeting and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.140
 dombret I did not like it so I 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.640
 do that in September and from the month 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.570
 of November I decided to become 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.520
 so light blond and so November 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.160
 january january I made wicks 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.239
 so the team simply 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.460
 except that the last time I did 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.870
 wicks so it was in January we 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.670
 did not use the same technique as 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.619
 usually 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.240
 the hairdresser made lashes at 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.670
 brush 100 meters of aluminum foil 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.320
 and nothing at all was in the open air 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.540
 and suddenly I was there I had 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.000
 glare ultra gilded you should know that 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.759
 I hate golden white highlights 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.530
 white copper and I do not like it at all 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.990
 I like the cold colors yam ounce 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.880
 andré lebon fascinates and it suited me 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.320
 not really after you're not 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.990
 realized that I had I 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.430
 does little video and then the share of 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.300
 time I have hair tied in 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.280
 back with 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.840
 wax or butter so they are 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.100
 very sensible when games fasteners 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.660
 back and that I put something 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.060
 inside so it did not show 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.110
 really but once I read them and we 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.450
 really saw that there were 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.550
 big locks well gilded reflections 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.200
 well gilded effect did not like at all 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.480
 yesterday I went to the hairdresser 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.600
 and I asked him to redo me 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.610
 platinum wicks so we did that it's 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.270
 this party so since the end 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.530
 was already well discolored and and then 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.760
 we did 1 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.830
 how is it still called me I am 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.330
 not very good in technical terms 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.700
 hairstyle what I'm not at all 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.140
 hairdresser but as I often I 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.800
 begins to remember a little bit the names 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.330
 and it's called that's it I forgot 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.710
 the name 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.080
 a skating a skating a skating a 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.610
 patina and patina made it possible to 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.970
 really set the locks in blonde 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.620
 platinum almost white and neutralize 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.980
 all the golden side for that I really 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.720
 that the blue of the white becomes cold in 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.300
 done and that really very very well 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.150
 market because I do not know if you 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.590
 realize but I really have more 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.640
 no golden highlights and that's what I 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.470
 wanted so I'm really very 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.459
 very very happy 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.110
 at the level of the cut we do not touch anything 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.090
 you that I had cut last time 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.380
 I made a well degraded square 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.140
 to send emails that are really 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.670
 very short on the top and we did not 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.350
 all in chorus since I let it grow 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.840
 knowing that I find it's a 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.130
 little bit degraded because at the bottom 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.350
 there is no longer too body and suddenly 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.150
 they tend to transplant 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.670
 to the outside and me personally 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.920
 I do not like it too much but if not at the level 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.020
 of color I am really delighted delighted 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.190
 I'm not sure if we're going 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.170
 account with the light 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.459
 kiala but I think we're going 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.270
 account they are really exactly the 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.220
 white as I like 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.420
 so I'm going now I think space 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.459
 is a little bit the wicks make them 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.320
 that every two months see all 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.130
 three months I'll see but all good 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.540
 the three months it's going to be difficult 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.620
 wait I think every two months 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.750
 but I'm pretty much the color that I 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.050
 wish to have it say platinum blonde a 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.060
 very light platinum blonde with an effect 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.770
 almost coloring the colorations then 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.790
 that these are just wicks 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.620
 e 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.239
 so other little things that I have 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.040
 tested it's the famous steam pod 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.049
 so I was told exactly when 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.909
 I had my shadow and r so it was 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.400
 in September it was the novelty of 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.709
 at l'oréal and I wanted to 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.340
 order one and then finally I was able to 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.269
 test it 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.859
 so yesterday so this is an iron one to 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.239
 smooth but a little peculiar to an iron 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.890
 to smooth that works with the 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.480
 steam and iron straightener that 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.189
 works with water vapor so 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.040
 you have a station that looks like a 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:14.260
 little to a boss station to pose the 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.329
 ipod is like that with a part where 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.310
 you put the water there is a filter a 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.859
 filter system inside and the 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.030
 professed told me that there was no 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.490
 no need to fill it too much too much 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.960
 often and therefore actually the straightener 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.070
 and against it is very very big me 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.449
 it surprised me I'm a girl and I'll wash 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.680
 never take root well what 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.330
 I liked it with the che hd that was 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.910
 still very thin and it allowed 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.259
 to really catch the roots and 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.849
 so his city his hair but at the same 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.530
 time it leaves you one seen that there is this 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.030
 process that the water vapor is 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.130
 actually I have never had the 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.449
 hair as soft they are really 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.280
 very very very very are so at the level 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.370
 smoothing if we compare with the ghd 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.349
 it's the same way they read it as well by 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.120
 against the quality of the hair 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:55.120
 of rendering on the hair the hair and 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.130
 and me - reindeer he keeps from 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.510
 flexibility and they are damaged a lot 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.340
 less that is to say that me when I 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.510
 pass my sister bed on small 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.479
 front locks and but that are 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.580
 really colorful sam frizzy effect 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.229
 so much so that it's still 180 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.330
 degrees even I believe that 210 I do not know 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.639
 the more it abyss well done of brightness 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.979
 you see that it respects a lot more 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.810
 the hair so me it is clear and net 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.330
 that I will invest in a fashion style 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.880
 it's going to be my next purchase I think 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.830
 in hair accessories and I you 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.510
 honestly recommend using it the 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.770
 paseo steam peeps if you're anything like me 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.620
 you have basic and curly hair 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.760
 lying and I will be celebrating woman is very 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.740
 curly and I have a lot 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.840
 which may not be apparent when 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.070
 look at them like that and that in addition to 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.900
 so be discoloration of 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.810
 colorations more straightener you 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.580
 sure you 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.520
 and hair and there with steampunk it's 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.419
 a super alternative 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.280
 on the other hand I do not know at all 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.730
 recommended I know it costs to 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.350
 around 180 200 euros with the 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.510
 products at arcana fos me she she has me 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.970
 presented two products there is a cream 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.950
 that you apply if your level is going 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.570
 say of hair awareness and 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.270
 averages so me that's what she told me 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.280
 put everywhere before passing the 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.720
 steampunk and after you have a serum 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.880
 when the level of awareness is 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.220
 higher than she really put me to 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.570
 the end on the wisps most 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.360
 sensitized ie the matches of 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.190
 front on top here is my we put 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.210
 a little bit and she ironed the wings 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.100
 ironing the steampunk 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.410
 so I really find it at the level of the 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.419
 final rendering compared to I 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.120
 restless it's better because I'm doing more 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:27.860
 flexible and less damaged 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.060
 now I will not come back to eat at 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.560
 jd I would keep it anyway since 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.270
 when we go on vacation bring back the 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.430
 small base like that and just close 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.710
 impossible so I learned the jld for 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.850
 when I go on vacation or to do 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.380
 touch-ups or when I leave in 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.600
 weekend and I will only use the 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.470
 steampunk from end of the world I 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.490
 just have them 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.080
 by the way if you know where are we 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.510
 can order it if you have good 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.729
 plans of ideas do not hesitate to them 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.050
 comment 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:52.820
 it will be everything for this video I hope 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.229
 that my new look
