00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 and so hello everyone with you canceling videos with 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.240
 channel 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.550
 and now i will shoot my third review 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.900
 on the nerve of this review we will have 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.980
 participate in strife measures so to begin with 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:21.020
 Let's go to what it was when I bought it 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.020
 was surprisingly a very thin box 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:30.750
 blaster clip on six rounds 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.000
 two instructions and in general six 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.620
 cartridges 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.510
 the elite one i lost i have 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.110
 the spare is also okay so for 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.079
 let's get to the blaster blaster itself 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.940
 us semiautomatically that is its not 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.960
 you just need to recharge each time 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.000
 you need to pull the trigger each time 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:59.879
 here is the field of flight three buttons first 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.789
 includes the blaster itself 2 trigger 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.010
 and 3 you somehow pulled the clip 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.049
 inclusion blaster does not work if 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.840
 if in blast or not clips if in 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.150
 cage run out of ammo if open 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.700
 here it is a cap there is such a pimp 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.560
 here she she clicks on this one 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:26.520
 little black button 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.900
 when it is closed the blaster is powered by 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.820
 four batteries 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.130
 There are two regular fingers on it . 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.420
 slats on which you can cling all sorts 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.799
 gadgets such as sights and knobs also 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.799
 you can attach the barrel 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:51.090
 butt we are shorter it can be easy and 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.909
 externally and internally modify how you 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.219
 already see it 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:02.100
 from the elite series that's such a bright blue 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:05.329
 orange white coloring in general so 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.860
 like all elite series blasters 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:14.270
 here 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:18.550
 patch there are two loops here first 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.550
 old what could be transferred 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:36.220
 also there is a little personal but everything 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:39.410
 same sight there and so it shoots at 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.430
 distance up to 20 meters since this 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.739
 elite series 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:49.150
 and now you can go to the actual 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.150
 the very test
