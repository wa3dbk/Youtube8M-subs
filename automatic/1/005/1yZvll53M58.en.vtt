00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.790
 nice and tony b today i'm talking about five 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.620
 types of opponents I hate to meet up 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.570
 finished in before starting though 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.070
 let me like you write me here 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.630
 under which of these five that there are 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.880
 I will list and the one that gives you the most 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.890
 bother to find on high put but when 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.360
 play against royal kings at the fifth 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.009
 place we find a category of those 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.480
 that really makes me angry or 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.329
 those who have two identical shirts 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.070
 both at home and away because there 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.480
 put the white shirt in the house in 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.250
 a company of even on the road if 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.469
 find one like you that for example le 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.719
 same white shirts as you play 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.280
 because there is no time to waste 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.809
 those who point to what they must have 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.879
 played and strength still the shirt 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.589
 so i feel forced to change e 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.019
 to the voices I always enjoy putting on 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:50.929
 white details at last raga decide 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.789
 to play white against white and red 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.210
 against red that is really out of 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.010
 head 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.379
 in fourth place we find those who 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.179
 ring at the back passage at the 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.980
 let's defender to ring a 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:02.569
 defender so by chance 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.430
 let's start ringing with the fullback 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:06.920
 then throw the ball out and then 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.930
 steal the right balloon they want 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.290
 against one with the holy goalkeeper also the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.060
 ie crossbar goalkeeper have also 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.620
 ass raga then those who run away to 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.300
 I am in fourth place of mine 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.800
 ranking in third place we find one 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.000
 category that many of those second 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.670
 they will put even higher or 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.740
 those who watch three replays ie you have 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.210
 pulled the central went on the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.940
 goalkeeper passed you 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.250
 if taken crossbar pole goal no must 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.409
 review three replays just because you 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.510
 must make you scream of bruce during the 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.369
 game and this is a boys thing of 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.680
 the ones I really hate most because 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.840
 if then the dog connection when maybe 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.380
 you leave everything you keep seeing three 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.170
 replay 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.000
 you will say what you solve I say what 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.770
 solve we go to the second place where 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.300
 we find the category similar to what it does 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.430
 get even more angry or those 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.840
 that never sucks or those that 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.430
 the game begins 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.590
 enter the teams on the field look at each other 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.229
 the whole presentation is a foul 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.240
 let's look at the replays whatever happens 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.970
 which is not of the stage in play e 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.310
 they concern her all because she lives one 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.039
 beautiful graphics I have to sclerate you with 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.989
 ugly that is what you look at you have seen 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.730
 3 billion times no 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.170
 and like the first time I can understand the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.620
 first time you play but not always 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.120
 all animations all root by and 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.280
 we arrive at the first place where we find 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.980
 the category that officially on the podium 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.220
 more on high put I will move those who 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.630
 mark the ninety-seventh ass 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.150
 because it is not possible 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.420
 that is, I played the game up front 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.970
 37 throws 97 percent of ball possession is 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.190
 that however the kick-off and the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.140
 remitted from the bottom I make you do the 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.579
 goalkeeper did miracles in referee 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.860
 he did not give me 56 penalty and you to 97th 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.170
 leftovers, delicious breakfasts and everything enters 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.630
 in the penalty area pole post 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.760
 crossbar on the other side that balloon 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.200
 returns hits a spaceship in the wake 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.079
 chemical blast 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.690
 the head referee crosses between you and you 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.700
 signs of rebound for own goals I do n't know 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.510
 I don't even know what raga is not 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.190
 You can take goals like that and nothing 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.959
 as a Christian the five players that I 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.310
 I hate more about the ultimate team 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.720
