matter so I guess for you guys there's

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.779 
matter so I guess for you guys there's
still<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> few<00:00:19.109> questions<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.710> mean<00:00:19.859> lots<00:00:20.609> of

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
still a few questions I mean lots of

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:21.920 
still a few questions I mean lots of
it's<00:00:20.910> going<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.150> be<00:00:21.240> gained<00:00:21.449> what's<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
it's going to be gained what's in the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.390 
it's going to be gained what's in the
game<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.350> we'll<00:00:22.590> find<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.890> out<00:00:22.980> alt

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
game and we'll find that out alt

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.189 
game and we'll find that out alt
eventually<00:00:23.850> but<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.600> think<00:00:24.869> there's<00:00:25.019> still

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
eventually but but I think there's still

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.640 
eventually but but I think there's still
a<00:00:25.260> little<00:00:25.470> bit<00:00:26.119> unknown<00:00:27.119> about<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> launch<00:00:28.260> so

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
a little bit unknown about the launch so

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.679 
a little bit unknown about the launch so
