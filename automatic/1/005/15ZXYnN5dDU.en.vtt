00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.590
 so keep getting ready for a new one 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.599
 video thanks for turning my name 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.089
 is live data today we do with the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.279
 the best weapons continue to be the focus of attention 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.260
 light machine guns and that'll 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.990
 I go through as the video progresses 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.500
 abbreviate mms because that's just easier 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.510
 is 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.550
 I have to confess to you that I intend to 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.670
 start production with this video 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.240
 only really played very little with alice 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.130
 have 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.200
 in direct combat with another 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.530
 Opponents then perhaps even one 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.760
 really strong weapon like the f2000 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.010
 It had me unbelievable 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.969
 Hardly even a chance 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.579
 to have against him 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.770
 the positioning is with an emmy im 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.750
 direct fight even more important 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.789
 as it was otherwise 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.190
 defensive play is not 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.379
 sometimes so bad pay special attention 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.719
 that you do not shoot while you are 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.059
 you still moved because then the scatter 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.109
 at some nm even reads almost 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.719
 is doubled 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.199
 but no matter now it goes directly to the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.960
 weapons 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.650
 the first energy is clearly there 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.340
 the aws with just under 100 shots per magazine 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.710
 charge and a high firing rate of 780 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.200
 shot per minute, this weapon is whole 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.030
 clearly my favorite the damage pro 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.950
 However, the hit is no longer so 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.869
 highest but is more likely to be 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.540
 the level of most assault rifles 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.880
 the aws not only for a short time but it 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.220
 good on longer distances too 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.350
 use and that works very well 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.299
 because just the spill is not too high 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.220
 is also the recoil after a short time 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.900
 getting used to it is pleasant too 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.869
 control and who else is still in 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.840
 shorter advances of let's say so 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.399
 will shoot five to seven balls too 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.299
 His goal is at medium distances 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.759
 can meet 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.540
 Moreover, the loading time is one of 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.180
 shortest in the segment of lgs with it 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.880
 is the aws in my opinion 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.560
 clearly the most versatile lng too 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.979
 after one of the last patches in the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.850
 The weapon was annoyed so something 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.580
 I still find it worse 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.530
 pretty good too good, you ask yourself 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.640
 I'm not sure, maybe she is 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.650
 so good but what of the way 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.690
 if there is violence in the game , too 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.360
 be used and that's why I would always 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.850
 to aws when i jazz all 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.380
 wants to play 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.010
 alternatively, there is also the mb 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.810
 4 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.870
 advantage with her is that you can get her directly 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.450
 in the main game without any dlcs to 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.220
 it has technical data 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.420
 At first glance it even looks good 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.640
 a little more appealing than the aws mgv 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.950
 has a high rate of 800 shot per 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.709
 minute and even a bigger magazine 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.840
 of 200 shows that is after or time 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.270
 for a lot longer and is enclosed 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.709
 just six seconds my damage 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.080
 Both weapons are very different 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.830
 little of each other only the damage 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.690
 curve is something better in the mp4 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.850
 but find the mp4 worse 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.370
 is the recoil and also the scatter 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.530
 to control both balls 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.060
 So it is important in short 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.340
 to shoot 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.430
 on very short distances as you can 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.230
 For example, on operation finds loose 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.150
 of course, you can just add to the quantity 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.489
 you have to keep pure for that, after all 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.440
 his 200 shows in the magazine 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.780
 even if the mp4 in my opinion 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.970
 not as good as the one that or that 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.100
 Anyway , it's real 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.290
 commendable fabian siegismund of 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.290
 battle bare is totally on the creak 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.100
 Now we drive the slightly larger 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.530
 Protected on one of them is the m 240 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.510
 b you notice immediately that the one 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.780
 higher residue compared to the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.739
 two other previous weapons for that 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:54.940
 has but also with the 240 mg of the 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:58.060
 makes a high harm from 34 to 25 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.850
 with her 650 rounds per minute she is 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.769
 not the fastest anymore 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.410
 the total table but still the 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.920
 fastest in the damage class of how 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.900
 said 34 to 25 also she only has 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.060
 100 shows in the magazine and the 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.640
 negligence is six seconds away 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.039
 or just under six seconds either 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.739
 just low recoil technically 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.180
 one with the m 240 on shorter distances 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.789
 just keep it 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.360
 so much is clear when she but then 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.310
 on green 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.979
 distances you have to do something more 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.469
 pay attention to his shot very much 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.419
 short salvos of a maximum of two to three 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.590
 Balls should be enough for something else 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.110
 to meet 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.270
 when he is but then really 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.069
 The weapon will be difficult to jump around 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.539
 then still like crazy but you 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.400
 He does not need so many anyway 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.849
 hit an opponent to ground 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.280
 bring 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:50.409
 So if you have a quiet hand in the 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.919
 to prove control of the recoil 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.939
 will also be able to curb the m 240 and 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.610
 have a lot of fun 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:59.680
 even with the slightly heavier lmg it 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.060
 of course I have an alternative 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.770
 picked out there would be the m60 e4 too 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.669
 which causes a great deal of damage 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.129
 34 to 25 has only 100 shot in the magazine 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.669
 but a bit easier to do that 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:17.529
 controlling recoil than even that 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.289
 240 w which among other things at the 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:22.270
 lower firing rate of only 5 170 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.939
 shot per minute is what the 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.800
 Reload time concerns yes that is 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:29.469
 something very bad with almost eight 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.639
 Seconds you are definitely on good 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:32.560
 instructed to cover 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.150
 Personally, I like that and 60 now 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.250
 Not too much because the fire rate 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.589
 Well, that's too low 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.909
 at least in my opinion a few 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:42.430
 but then she has a win and a play 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:44.169
 still really fun but you 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.940
 just have to deal with that one 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.099
 not just in a horde of 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.800
 jump opponents and then also 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:52.539
 can do 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.689
 so now I was briefly something 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:57.729
 to mention m 249 because that too has me 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:59.439
 really fun especially on 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.060
 cards like operation easy is you 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:03.279
 so well on the way 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.529
 in some situations they pull me 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.629
 even a bit better than the aws too 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:09.520
 Being able to do that is just possible 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.740
 have finally been disappointed 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.560
 It always depends on the situation and yours 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.060
 opponent how good a weapon seems more 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.460
 I did not want to say to the weapon either 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.129
 because I always try my videos 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.319
 quite short or as short as 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.439
 possible to say what to conclude 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:28.330
 I have here again my top 3 list 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:31.300
 on the first position is very clear 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.599
 who finds aws in second place 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:37.300
 then the m 240 b again and up 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:38.800
 In the third place I have the m 249 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.990
 Placed because I like to 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.090
 have some variety and with this 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.099
 Mix of the three weapons one has 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.590
 it determines something like it sees 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.849
 actually with your top3 lmg it out 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.599
 just write me one 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:51.520
 comment 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:52.900
 the best guns carbine and 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.460
 I already have storm rifles 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.319
 treats and links to the 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.389
 Of course, you can do the respective videos in 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.250
 For the description, or you stick 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:02.319
 just the entire playlist too 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:05.440
 You can handle it directly now 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:07.780
 times your opponents with tidy lmbv much 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.340
 fun then you win and see if 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.139
 I would like the video 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.319
 me of course very much a thumb 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:17.219
 to the top or and an abo look forward 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:17.219
 Until next time
