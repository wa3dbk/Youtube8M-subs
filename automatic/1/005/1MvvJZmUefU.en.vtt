00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
 for everyone we find ourselves 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.200
 today in a new video that 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.150
 is of a category that you like 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.069
 a lot it's of course a solid 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.349
 so today as you have seen 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.559
 in the title we will talk about their 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.269
 cavernous morphology so what is 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.880
 I mean by the cavalier morphology 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.619
 so lately on facebook and 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.800
 on the internet in general a study 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.730
 are circulating on the impact of the weight of the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.289
 rider on the horse is to read his 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.060
 studies to exchange a little with 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.530
 different people around these 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.940
 results made me understand that it's me 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.510
 did not like at all what came out of 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.719
 this study 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.640
 in fact we are told that the rider does not 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.860
 must not exceed 10% of the weight of its 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.460
 horse so about on a horse of 600 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.250
 kg it's going to do that we have to do in the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.360
 70 kg to break everything 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.180
 it's just a problem 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.809
 because in my opinion it's going to break everything 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.030
 the diversity of the world of riding 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.829
 as much as you say if a rider does not 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.850
 must not exceed 70 kg I should 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.220
 stop riding on horseback 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.290
 whereas when you see on horseback I 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.600
 not the impression that I like horses 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.100
 that I work simply because 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.200
 that I do not think it's a 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.780
 question of rider pepper I think 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.360
 that it's a question of already from the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.299
 rider of the metaphysical rider of the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.240
 horse and work then asked according 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.960
 I can buy up to 95 kg 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.500
 if we even know why not the moment 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.619
 we climb slightly to a rider 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.180
 50 60 70 kg that will bring as a bag 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.750
 in potatoes it's worse than anything 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.880
 90 kg jumper which will do this light 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.619
 is also a rider who will be worked 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.240
 his horse so that he does not suffer the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.700
 pain of his weight simply 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.860
 because if we of course put a 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.329
 95 kg person on a thoroughbred who 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.549
 fate of races that has been working 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.189
 adapted of course that it will not work 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.630
 but even a 75 kg rider 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.710
 will not work because that kind of 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.360
 false need a work with the loin 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.159
 she work on foot before having a 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.650
 jumper on the back because when going out 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.780
 races with a 50 kg jockey they 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.050
 will not be ready to wear someone but 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.390
 if we take a horse maybe the one 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:18.130
 French who was well muscled 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.470
 maybe a merit 1a finger a 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.150
 fjord 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.800
 everything is put all these kinds of horses 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.810
 if one the adapted work can be 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.420
 mounted by all and maybe I'm going 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.680
 make me enemies because that's me 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.120
 I think riding is not a 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.250
 sport of filiform mannequins 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.470
 riding is a sport that must 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.300
 to be diverse or you there must be 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.030
 50 kg people and people 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.530
 90 kg so that drives me crazy actually 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.120
 when I see people who will say 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.410
 with cavalia who is strong that she has to 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.970
 not ride his horse because she's me 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.410
 abused I find it aberrant 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.239
 because there are so many things that are 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.290
 abused by all that to say that a 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.580
 Malian case that will be pampered 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.830
 with his misstep that will mount it a 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.390
 times a week lightly with 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.440
 adapted work should stop everything 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.480
 just because she's fat 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.390
 it's anything and it's not done 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.220
 and if these things are not respected they 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.750
 are further encouraged by studies 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.530
 scientists who in my opinion would be a 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.970
 little aberrant 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.890
 I do not really see what will become of 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.900
 our sport it's going to be just some of the 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.280
 filiform people who will be able 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.530
 ride on horseback and I'll find that 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.000
 frankly very boring you look 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.890
 Western riding is a lot of 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.450
 strong people riding horses and 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.030
 their horses do not seem to be worn 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.920
 so bad even if the stations riders 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.600
 are all pretty light that I use are 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.239
 light there are dressage riders 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.410
 hung ambulance quite massive and their 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.239
 horses are doing well 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.160
 then stop seeing evil everywhere 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.660
 when a person a little ford will ride 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.760
 on a horse if she work the 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.980
 adapted way I do not see the concern to 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.900
 from the moment the work is 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.820
 adapted to the horse there is no reason 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.079
 that it goes wrong if we work from 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.970
 so that they have a good duet 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.549
 well muscled with a job can be 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.049
 lighter and ben why not and he 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.459
 must stop wanting to be all 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.870
 it's like in life you have to 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.549
 that they have diversity is 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.400
 frankly a world where there would be that 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:01.180
 riders that are less than 70 kg and 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.890
 with limits when we try to 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.570
 to put it all the time riding 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.239
 will never evolve again we will find 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.110
 in falling back into a psychorigid thing 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.640
 com 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.560
 as was the world of riding 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.670
 maybe 50 years ago and that's 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.890
 frankly not something that I 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.720
 want so if you want to share on this 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.910
 subject as usual go in 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.739
 comment we discuss together is 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.600
 always low in respect of some and 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.700
 others I would put you study 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.690
 scientist who is English in the 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.810
 info bar for you to do 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.720
 your idea yourself I will lose 10 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.490
 where I hope that seven soldiers even a re 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.140
 to your brains and will make you want 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.490
 to exchange I do lots of kisses 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.140
 until next time learn 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.620
 heal it's good you can go back moment 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.620
 but I was waiting
