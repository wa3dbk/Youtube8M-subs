00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.290
 and I see movies like most 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.990
 people put little emphasis on the 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.360
 scenes in the script in the lights and I 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.280
 I concentrate very much on enjoying the 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.290
 movie and eat my popcorn 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.140
 but I am a student of English pera tura 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.060
 and when I read if I put a lot of emphasis on 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.670
 the story in the narrative in the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.410
 thematic and I do not become more critical and more 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.869
 selective not just read this kind of 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.600
 works but as the movie was very 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.580
 successful I tried and finished the first 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.210
 movie when it premiered last year 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.640
 and two weeks ago I read 150 pages of 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.710
 first book but I stopped reading it because 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.260
 I wanted to read caption fire before 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.839
 watch the movie of the cinema then 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.629
 I started reading 300 pages of five hundred 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.819
 that brings this second book but not 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.949
 You can continue reading the story if it is 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:54.109
 very catchy is very good but the 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.999
 narration not the whole book is 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.549
 developed from the perspective of 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:01.489
 cards then it is a work very 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:02.690
 descriptive very sensory but also 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.830
 It is full of hormones 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.180
 from a teenage vision 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.370
 The truth is that I already had enough 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.160
 with fear license to avenge me 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.650
 reading five hundred pages of a girl 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.360
 16 year old looking for his identity clarified 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.970
 to narrate from the perspective of a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.190
 Teen is not easy it 's complicated 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.580
 you even have to leave your authoring self 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.290
 to become your character and the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.090
 author will do it in a very 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.010
 good but I think that accuses of this 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.870
 literary resource becomes the 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.670
 totality of the work this narration 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.530
 there came a point and that the work of suzanne 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.420
 collins became very tedious for me 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.880
 reading then I could not finish the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.710
 200 pages that I had left besides 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.660
 I noticed that there were not many resources 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.940
 literary abuse of the narrative of 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.040
 adolescent but lacks resources like 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.170
 the metaphor or the ellipsis or very many 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.240
 more than you can put a work of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.100
 so many pages for example a long time ago 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.500
 I read news about Ferdinand's empire 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.210
 step and fernando the glass or use two 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.640
 narrators one is from the perspective 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.700
 of carlota that after having saved 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.920
 mexico are narrating crazy nya in a 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.570
 madhouse of europe and then you change the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 chapter and is a different narrator 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.140
 mix of the two narrator 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.150
 for more than a thousand pages and nothing 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.590
 it becomes tedious keeps you very very 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.540
 inside the story and it keeps you 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.760
 intrigued and want to continue reading another 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.890
 case is the guardian devil of javier 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.170
 velasco also does the same 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.540
 Javier Velasco tells you a chapter 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.790
 from the perspective of a woman of a 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.680
 Chava who at 15 decides to leave 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.430
 from home to move to new 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.230
 York alone and explore the world with everything 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.910
 what this entails and the next 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.709
 chapter is from the perspective of 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.060
 programmer mixes the two pitchers and 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.069
 it takes you for almost three hundred pages 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.050
 with three hundred pages and then it seems 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.300
 a masterful way and I think that that's 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.450
 something of my does not take advantage of this resource and 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.830
 ends up being a work that can not 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.690
 finish that could not be included 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.280
 union of god both a novel and the 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.860
 movie there is a decision that takes the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.720
 President snow and this becomes 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.940
 a total alteration of the history 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.489
 besides that it also becomes the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.690
 central axis of film and novel but 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.560
 while I was with the first pages 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.900
 from the book 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.360
 this decision became very predictable and 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.010
 when a book becomes predictable the 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.280
 truth is that it stops liking me fuck 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.530
 interest me respect 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.060
 there is no swimmer in the narrator is the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.459
 camera this allows us to have 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.990
 many very diverse perspectives and 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.850
 even some that either in the book 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.800
 for example the life of the president is 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.420
 lou how is your life how it relates 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.400
 with other people as a conversation 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.560
 how is your character and this gives you a 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.030
 Very different taste at the time of Francis 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.489
 lawrence taking advantage of all the resources 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.010
 that he has as a director manages to catch the 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.080
 viewer from beginning to end is already 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.030
 good in elliptical or vintage stories 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.100
 futurists we have seen it directing 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.530
 other works as I am legend or 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.239
 Konstantin and then the experience 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.040
 last serves you for every point 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.530
 apply it in this new movie the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.480
 script was run by two men one 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.450
 from simon beaufoy the same one who won the 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.360
 Oscar for the slow tom miller movie 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.739
 the other is my world art that has already won 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.750
 Oscar also for the movie 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.819
 Eurovision chain and also already announced 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.120
 who will be the star wars writer 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.060
 episode 7 and to top the movie is 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.380
 starring jennifer lawrence pure 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.480
 heavyweight from 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.390
 going through screenwriters and ending with 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.400
 the beauty of this girl 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.110
 then to finish the book do not 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.360
 I recommend as recommended works 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.550
 previous in other videos that I've done 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.580
 but you do not have that the version is very fan 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.500
 of this saga of suzanne collins because 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.060
 will help you taste scenes in the 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.830
 movie that maybe can not develop 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.890
 if you do not give this book to you and you're going to 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.800
 account for things that is not said in the 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.110
 film the movie then go see it all the 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.300
 world is talking about it and if it has 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.280
 a lot of action and you are fasting you follow 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.050
