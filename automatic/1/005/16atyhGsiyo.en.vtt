chunking<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.250> still<00:00:14.580> suck<00:00:14.849> but<00:00:15.389> um<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.870> hope<00:00:16.080> I'm

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
chunking I still suck but um I hope I'm

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.750 
chunking I still suck but um I hope I'm
probably<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.949> think<00:00:17.190> I'm<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> little<00:00:17.520> better

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
probably I think I'm a little better

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.510 
probably I think I'm a little better
than<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> was<00:00:18.119> before<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.949> the<00:00:19.949> first<00:00:20.220> battle

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
than I was before so the first battle

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.010 
than I was before so the first battle
was<00:00:20.640> actually<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> mecha<00:00:21.240> Frieza<00:00:21.689> versus

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
was actually a mecha Frieza versus

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.070 
was actually a mecha Frieza versus
cooler<00:00:22.320> final<00:00:22.680> form<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.420> I<00:00:24.420> thought<00:00:24.630> oh<00:00:24.810> yeah

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
cooler final form and I thought oh yeah

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.769 
cooler final form and I thought oh yeah
that<00:00:25.289> kind<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.470> makes<00:00:25.650> sense<00:00:25.800> because<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.400> think

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
that kind of makes sense because I think

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.849 
that kind of makes sense because I think
pleased<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.869> was<00:00:27.960> actually<00:00:28.109> stronger<00:00:28.710> when<00:00:28.800> he

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
pleased I was actually stronger when he

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.080 
pleased I was actually stronger when he
went<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> earth<00:00:29.220> when<00:00:29.460> he<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.640> mecha<00:00:29.789> Frieza

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
went to earth when he was mecha Frieza

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.410 
went to earth when he was mecha Frieza
then<00:00:30.929> he<00:00:31.019> was<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.199> Namek<00:00:31.859> that's<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:33.239> I

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
then he was on Namek that's just what I

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.000 
then he was on Namek that's just what I
think<00:00:33.480> I'm<00:00:33.899> not<00:00:34.020> sure<00:00:34.170> if<00:00:34.260> that's<00:00:34.380> entirely

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
think I'm not sure if that's entirely

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.639 
think I'm not sure if that's entirely
true<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:36.000> whatever<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.930> he<00:00:37.230> as<00:00:37.320> strong<00:00:37.530> as

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
true but whatever so is he as strong as

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.000 
true but whatever so is he as strong as
