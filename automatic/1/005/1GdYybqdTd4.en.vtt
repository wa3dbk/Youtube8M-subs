00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.720
 I will say that the first is not fuse 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:54.070
 it was diablo 1 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.050
 I didn't have a campaign my grandfather had him 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.930

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.090

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.349

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:25.810

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.849

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.899
 genre 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:32.059
 and it is impossible that you choose one but like 

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:35.369
 me more 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:38.219
 remembered oblivion because he 

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:41.490
 the young hot was just playing it 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.569
 for days on end because really 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.809
 marvin that was 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:47.009
 Zdorovski this was new and all I played 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:53.099
 still house bar windows 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:54.689
 but no matter how the points grafon 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.009
 else it would not be the level that is 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:57.569
 oblivion he was still 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.429

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.199

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:04.050
 even here on boxing graphics such and 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:06.509
 therefore he is no longer remembered personally 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.240
 for me so but on the gameplay according to the schedule 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:12.749
