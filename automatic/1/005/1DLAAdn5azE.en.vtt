00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:13.410
 Yes Hello, my name is Yu 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:19.050
 Today I would like to talk with you about speeches that men without pulse often use 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:22.870
 You know who you are or what a woman's like and become male psychology 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:29.790
 Kedomo I think that many people think I 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:29.790
 I was asking you if you listened to the end 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:38.170
 As there may be contents , I'm glad if you listen to the end by all means 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:47.590
 In First 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:50.930
 I wonder why today I would like to talk about serifs often used by this pulseless men 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.280
 If you say that you thought 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.850
 Many men are 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:02.770
 Even for women who don't 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.470
 I'm thinking of trying to avoid being as gentle as possible 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.830
 The 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.480
 So from such a woman 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.850
 approach 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:23.790
 It is not much to say and so much clearly no even 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.790
 As often as possible , the expression will be wrapped in oblate 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:32.910
 The 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:34.140
 I do not have a neck with you and I would like to associate with you as a friend 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.740
 Or 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.520
 Or are you not interested at all 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.520
 By 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.590
 Let's say a word 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.270
 The line is changing at all 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.270
 So today 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.360
 The line that men who are not interested in other women often use 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.290
 Since we have examined the I would like to tell the about three 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.620
 Then the first one 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.010
 It will be fun if I go with my boyfriend 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.239
 This is right 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.239
 For example you 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.740
 For men who are concerned 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:34.730
 When I said that I wanted to go to the amusement park 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.730
 I have answered me I'm probably unlikely went with boyfriend 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.310
 It is this to wear 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:49.069
 It contains anycast of what kind of words in say kneaded'm happy like this boyfriend 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:54.970
 If you say 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:03:02.230
 Yourself and that Tteyuu is not interested in its place 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:03.400
 The wording of the order yourself to convey both that I mean saying such is to become your boyfriend 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.220
 so 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.810
 So if this is said a bit 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:18.430
 At that time a little positive for you 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.430
 The fact that such feelings are not Toka want to be a boyfriend 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.769
 Because it represents 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.569
 I think that you can refer to 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.569
 Well then 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:42.350
 It feels like a little sister or something 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.350
 It feels like we are a family. 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.060
 To Te 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.800
 Men are you 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.800
 When I say that like a sister like a presence Toka family exist 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.660
 It is already 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.810
 No pulse 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:05.030
 Please think that 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:07.280
 Men are against women they like 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.960
 Toka or only sister 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:21.310
 I do not use 9 expressions like a family very much 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:21.310
 However , I think that I think that I think that I am truly close and familiar 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.800
 Then No. 3 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.900
 Let's play with everyone 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:37.710
 For men 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:45.240
 It 's a very big thing to meet the opposite sex alone 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:46.410
 Maybe some women may think it normal to see a couple of male friends 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:55.970
 But 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:55.970
 Men do not meet alone with women who are not interested as much as possible 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.590
 Especially my favorite men in my group 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:09.870
 You 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:14.700
 When I said that I wanted to meet alone 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:18.740
 When such an answer comes back , it is almost oh 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:21.699
 Think of the current condition as a pulse 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.699
 I think it's good 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.920
 In a three lines mentioned here now 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.820
 Kedomo What is 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:40.070
 How N 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:45.520
 Male opponent as a friend does not mean no never interested also true to you 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.520
 If you are thinking that you want to get along 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.090
 I think 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:56.449
 So when such is now the current Kataa 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:06:00.040
 Say you only want to go out with you as a friend 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:03.480
 I may not have thought of 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:10.810
 Such time is the other party 2 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:16.530
 Get down from your friends by making them a bit doggy 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.530
 Possibility of upgrading to kindle existence 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.380
 Because there is enough 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.440
 By all means Well how to make your partner doki 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:35.550
 Try using it- 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:44.070
 Because you can change it to something you care about 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:46.689
 Even if I listen to the three things now, it's completely impossible to say 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:54.239
 Please do not think 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:54.239
 Men are not vulnerable to women's approaches. 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:07.810
 Speaking may be bad, but even if men like it 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:11.460
 Even if it is about 50%, depending on your approach 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:14.720
 The moon is the possibility of development 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.720
 There is enough 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.520
 It is- 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:26.240
 Wow 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:31.460
 Not so much at all completely completely 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:37.120
 Pounding more and more to say went Press and hold down rapidly 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:38.560
 Kedomo continue to the carnivorous-based women of like is I know ng 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.030
 Yup 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.260
 approach 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.260
 It depends on the approach 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:08:00.330
 I think that if you can do my best by all means as you can become an existence that is bothering you 

00:07:53.070 --> 00:08:05.540
 So today I talked about the words that men often use pulseless speech 

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:05.540
 Thank you for listening to today
