it just kind of flows together nicely
this<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.949> particularly<00:00:17.580> useful<00:00:17.850> against

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
this is particularly useful against

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.620 
this is particularly useful against
passage<00:00:19.020> blockers<00:00:19.500> like<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.850> said<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> passive

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
passage blockers like I said a passive

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.840 
passage blockers like I said a passive
blocker<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.230> somebody<00:00:22.650> who<00:00:22.830> just<00:00:22.859> defaults

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
blocker is somebody who just defaults

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.340 
blocker is somebody who just defaults
straight<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.269> covering<00:00:24.750> up<00:00:24.930> as<00:00:25.109> soon<00:00:25.230> as

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
straight to covering up as soon as

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.830 
straight to covering up as soon as
someone<00:00:25.560> throws<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> punch<00:00:26.240> at<00:00:27.240> their<00:00:27.390> top<00:00:27.599> half

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
someone throws a punch at their top half

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.529 
someone throws a punch at their top half

so for example I'm gonna throw it at her
she's<00:00:30.810> gonna<00:00:30.900> passively<00:00:31.500> block<00:00:31.859> I'm<00:00:32.189> gonna

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
she's gonna passively block I'm gonna

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.750 
she's gonna passively block I'm gonna
throw<00:00:32.550> one<00:00:32.790> two<00:00:33.030> boom<00:00:33.809> boom<00:00:34.230> okay<00:00:34.739> now<00:00:35.640> an

throw one two boom boom okay now an

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.940 
throw one two boom boom okay now an
active<00:00:36.180> blocker<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.780> somebody<00:00:37.110> who<00:00:37.290> uses<00:00:37.649> more

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
active blocker is somebody who uses more

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.209 
active blocker is somebody who uses more
parry<00:00:38.280> easy<00:00:38.489> vanes<00:00:38.969> they<00:00:39.450> catch<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.620> I'm<00:00:41.010> gonna

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
parry easy vanes they catch so I'm gonna

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.069 
parry easy vanes they catch so I'm gonna
throw<00:00:41.460> my<00:00:41.579> one-two<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.000> she'll<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.660> an<00:00:42.809> active

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
throw my one-two and she'll as an active

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.779 
throw my one-two and she'll as an active
blocker<00:00:43.320> probably<00:00:43.739> do<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> parry<00:00:44.190> parry<00:00:44.520> so

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
blocker probably do a parry parry so

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.200 
blocker probably do a parry parry so
here<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:49.160> active<00:00:50.160> blockers<00:00:50.550> usually<00:00:51.000> are<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
here so active blockers usually are a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.369 
here so active blockers usually are a
little<00:00:51.390> more<00:00:51.539> confident<00:00:51.960> with<00:00:52.050> their<00:00:52.140> blocks

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
little more confident with their blocks

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.830 
little more confident with their blocks
they've<00:00:52.710> got<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> little<00:00:53.100> bit<00:00:53.190> better<00:00:53.340> vision

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
they've got a little bit better vision

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.750 
they've got a little bit better vision
maybe<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.140> isn't<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.440> best<00:00:55.559> combo<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.250> land

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
maybe this isn't the best combo to land

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.950 
maybe this isn't the best combo to land
I'm<00:00:56.910> sure<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.180> could<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> lot<00:00:57.930> easier

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
I'm sure you could but it's a lot easier

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.229 
I'm sure you could but it's a lot easier
to<00:00:58.410> land<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.710> combo<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.309> passive<00:00:59.820> blockers

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
to land this combo on passive blockers

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.700 
to land this combo on passive blockers
because<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.870> keep<00:01:00.989> their<00:01:01.199> attention<00:01:01.289> off

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
because you can keep their attention off

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.979 
because you can keep their attention off
top<00:01:01.920> where<00:01:02.520> they<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> smaller<00:01:03.390> field<00:01:03.719> of

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
top where they have a smaller field of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.740 
top where they have a smaller field of
vision<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.589> then<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:06.000> low<00:01:06.270> at<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> end

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
vision and then I can go low at the end

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.450 
vision and then I can go low at the end
of<00:01:06.810> my<00:01:06.900> combo<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.470> probably<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> better

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
of my combo and probably have a better

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.770 
of my combo and probably have a better
chance<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.880> hitting<00:01:09.000> at<00:01:09.299> least<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> first

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
chance of hitting at least the first

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.690 
chance of hitting at least the first
time<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.080> throw<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:11.040> from<00:01:11.250> here
