okay this is how to use your multi
communication<00:00:07.710> system<00:00:08.540> also<00:00:09.540> known<00:00:09.960> as<00:00:10.019> a

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
communication system also known as a

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:19.010 
communication system also known as a
navigational<00:00:11.759> system<00:00:12.799> first<00:00:13.799> off<00:00:17.779> you<00:00:18.779> see

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
navigational system first off you see

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.620 
navigational system first off you see
here<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.529> says<00:00:20.039> tape<00:00:20.430> right<00:00:21.270> here<00:00:21.330> it

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
turn up and it increases the fan airflow

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.240 
turn up and it increases the fan airflow
okay

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
okay

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.760 
okay
this<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.790> your<00:01:05.909> compass<00:01:06.330> okay<00:01:07.170> these

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
this is your compass okay these

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.880 
this is your compass okay these
characters<00:01:08.430> mean<00:01:08.729> north<00:01:09.240> east<00:01:10.049> west<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
characters mean north east west and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.359 
characters mean north east west and
south<00:01:10.950> north<00:01:11.760> will<00:01:12.030> always<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.450> red<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:14.189> it

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
south north will always be red so if it

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.030 
south north will always be red so if it
does<00:01:14.610> work<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.960> if<00:01:16.229> your<00:01:16.470> compass<00:01:16.799> does

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
does work if you if your compass does

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.300 
does work if you if your compass does
work<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:18.299> vehicle<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.470> always<00:01:19.890> just

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
work in your vehicle then always just

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.039 
work in your vehicle then always just
look<00:01:20.610> out<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:20.790> where<00:01:21.150> North<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.869> you'll

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
look out for where North is and you'll

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.390 
look out for where North is and you'll
be<00:01:22.170> okay<00:01:22.439> um<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.729> might<00:01:24.030> not<00:01:24.330> because<00:01:25.400> these

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
be okay um it might not because these

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.149 
be okay um it might not because these
navigation<00:01:27.090> systems<00:01:27.509> are<00:01:27.750> designed<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.829> work

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
navigation systems are designed to work

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.270 
navigation systems are designed to work
only<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.790> Japan<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.450> some<00:01:31.259> cases<00:01:31.740> when<00:01:32.009> they

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
only in Japan and some cases when they

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.609 
only in Japan and some cases when they
go<00:01:32.520> out<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.909> Japan<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.780> don't<00:01:34.229> work

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
go out of Japan they just don't work

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.890 
go out of Japan they just don't work
they<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:34.950> tend<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> be<00:01:35.369> blank<00:01:35.729> all<00:01:36.720> right

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
they just tend to be blank all right

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.770 
they just tend to be blank all right
what<00:01:37.650> else<00:01:37.829> do<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.009> got<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.490> press<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.390> again

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
what else do we got here press it again

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.010 
what else do we got here press it again
this<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:41.040> gas<00:01:41.250> mileage<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:42.630> right<00:01:42.840> now

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
this is your gas mileage so right now

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.510 
this is your gas mileage so right now
we're<00:01:43.200> moving<00:01:43.380> at<00:01:43.649> one<00:01:43.829> kilometer<00:01:43.979> an<00:01:44.430> hour

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
we're moving at one kilometer an hour

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.520 
we're moving at one kilometer an hour
because<00:01:44.820> we're<00:01:45.149> actually<00:01:45.299> not<00:01:45.570> moving<00:01:45.780> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
because we're actually not moving and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.700 
because we're actually not moving and
we're<00:01:46.680> averaging<00:01:47.119> 2.8<00:01:48.119> kilometers<00:01:48.320> per<00:01:49.320> liter

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
we're averaging 2.8 kilometers per liter

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.069 
we're averaging 2.8 kilometers per liter
that's<00:01:49.950> our<00:01:50.189> gas<00:01:50.460> mileage<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.630> says<00:01:51.869> how

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
that's our gas mileage this says how

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.219 
that's our gas mileage this says how
close<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.590> are<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.189> gas<00:01:53.520> station<00:01:53.720> but<00:01:54.720> again

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
close we are to a gas station but again

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.530 
close we are to a gas station but again
this<00:01:55.680> may<00:01:55.979> not<00:01:56.189> work<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.790> because<00:01:57.000> you're

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
this may not work for you because you're

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.170 
this may not work for you because you're
in<00:01:57.630> Africa<00:01:58.049> all<00:01:58.590> right

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
in Africa all right

in Africa all right
and<00:02:00.649> then<00:02:01.649> back<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.430> tape<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.390> also<00:02:03.659> change

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
and then back to tape I can also change

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.219 
and then back to tape I can also change
this<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:05.030> television<00:02:06.030> which<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.719> may<00:02:06.840> not<00:02:07.020> get

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
but I can also change it to the radio

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.539 
but I can also change it to the radio
