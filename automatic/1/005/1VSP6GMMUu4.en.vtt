balloon<00:01:49.330> surgery<00:01:49.990> ideal<00:01:50.830> for<00:01:51.189> Anya<00:01:51.549> yeah<00:01:52.180> I

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
balloon surgery ideal for Anya yeah I

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.880 
balloon surgery ideal for Anya yeah I
think<00:01:52.479> it's<00:01:52.659> perfect<00:01:53.080> for<00:01:53.140> Anya<00:01:53.500> for<00:01:53.740> many

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
think it's perfect for Anya for many

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.070 
think it's perfect for Anya for many
reasons<00:01:54.310> but<00:01:54.460> her<00:01:55.030> case<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.510> a<00:01:55.540> pretty<00:01:55.900> typical

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
reasons but her case is a pretty typical

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.630 
reasons but her case is a pretty typical
case<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:56.799> would<00:01:56.979> see<00:01:57.189> with<00:01:57.400> a<00:01:57.430> lot<00:01:57.610> of

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
case that I would see with a lot of

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.390 
case that I would see with a lot of
patients<00:01:58.210> traditional<00:01:59.049> sinus<00:01:59.380> surgery<00:01:59.799> many

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
patients traditional sinus surgery many

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.070 
patients traditional sinus surgery many
times<00:02:00.700> she's<00:02:00.970> had<00:02:01.119> at<00:02:01.299> least<00:02:01.420> one<00:02:01.659> previous

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
times she's had at least one previous

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.960 
times she's had at least one previous
surgery<00:02:02.439> and<00:02:02.710> she<00:02:03.040> really<00:02:03.220> was<00:02:03.369> suffering<00:02:03.729> and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
surgery and she really was suffering and

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.429 
surgery and she really was suffering and
so<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.150> thought<00:02:04.450> I<00:02:04.479> felt<00:02:04.720> she<00:02:04.990> was<00:02:05.080> an<00:02:05.170> ideal

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
so I thought I felt she was an ideal

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.749 
so I thought I felt she was an ideal
candidate<00:02:05.979> for<00:02:06.189> some<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.460> newer<00:02:06.640> things

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
candidate for some of the newer things

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.389 
candidate for some of the newer things
that<00:02:07.210> were<00:02:07.330> utilizing<00:02:07.750> kind<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.590> futuristic

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
that were utilizing kind of a futuristic

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.160 
that were utilizing kind of a futuristic

or an innovative approach to treating
sinus<00:02:11.590> problems<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:12.100> can<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.370> show<00:02:12.610> us<00:02:12.640> like

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
sinus problems so can you show us like

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.850 
sinus problems so can you show us like
what<00:02:13.299> exactly<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.840> did<00:02:14.049> I<00:02:14.170> sure<00:02:14.470> will<00:02:14.650> well

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
what exactly you did I sure will well

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.800 
what exactly you did I sure will well
what<00:02:15.190> we<00:02:15.310> did<00:02:15.459> with<00:02:15.610> onion<00:02:16.030> ischl<00:02:16.360> II<00:02:16.420> was<00:02:16.630> we

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
what we did with onion ischl II was we

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.560 
what we did with onion ischl II was we
started<00:02:16.870> by<00:02:17.650> using<00:02:17.890> this<00:02:18.340> balloon<00:02:19.120> as<00:02:19.390> we've

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
started by using this balloon as we've

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.270 
started by using this balloon as we've
talked<00:02:19.780> about<00:02:19.870> before<00:02:20.019> a<00:02:20.560> sinuplasty

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
talked about before a sinuplasty

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.310 
talked about before a sinuplasty
technique<00:02:22.060> where<00:02:22.269> we<00:02:22.299> place<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.780> balloon<00:02:23.049> up

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
technique where we place the balloon up

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.310 
technique where we place the balloon up
into<00:02:23.650> her<00:02:23.860> sinuses<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.579> this<00:02:25.030> situation<00:02:25.989> Anya

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
into her sinuses in this situation Anya

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.170 
into her sinuses in this situation Anya
was<00:02:26.470> really<00:02:26.799> suffering<00:02:27.040> from<00:02:27.340> frontal<00:02:27.820> sinus

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
was really suffering from frontal sinus

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.600 
was really suffering from frontal sinus
disease<00:02:28.329> particularly<00:02:29.200> we<00:02:29.799> dilated<00:02:30.489> or

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
disease particularly we dilated or

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.880 
disease particularly we dilated or
expanded<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.720> drainage<00:02:32.200> opening<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.799> the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
expanded the drainage opening of the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.650 
expanded the drainage opening of the
frontal<00:02:33.220> sinus<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.850> then<00:02:34.269> what<00:02:34.360> we<00:02:34.480> did<00:02:34.600> was

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
frontal sinus and then what we did was

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.629 
frontal sinus and then what we did was
which<00:02:35.230> was<00:02:35.380> really<00:02:35.560> interesting<00:02:35.680> was<00:02:36.250> we<00:02:36.400> took

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:36.639 
which was really interesting was we took

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.280 
which was really interesting was we took
this<00:02:36.850> device<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.600> this<00:02:38.049> is<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> sinus

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
this device and this is a sinus

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.770 
this device and this is a sinus
what<00:02:40.069> this<00:02:40.250> is<00:02:40.430> designed<00:02:41.060> for<00:02:41.360> is<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.690> be

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
what this is designed for is to be

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.320 
what this is designed for is to be
placed<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.500> that<00:02:42.680> drainage<00:02:43.099> opening<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:43.849> to

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
placed in that drainage opening and to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.360 
placed in that drainage opening and to
sit<00:02:44.540> in<00:02:44.659> place<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.170> allow<00:02:45.409> that<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.739> heal<00:02:46.190> in

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
sit in place and allow that to heal in

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.300 
sit in place and allow that to heal in
an<00:02:46.459> open<00:02:46.790> position<00:02:47.200> interestingly<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.769> has<00:02:48.950> a

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
an open position interestingly it has a

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.850 
an open position interestingly it has a
reservoir<00:02:50.030> or<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.360> valve<00:02:50.780> at<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.110> end<00:02:51.470> of<00:02:51.709> it

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
reservoir or a valve at the end of it

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.280 
reservoir or a valve at the end of it
which<00:02:52.459> is<00:02:52.640> originally<00:02:53.209> utilized<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.110> just

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
which is originally utilized to just

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.890 
which is originally utilized to just
fill<00:02:54.560> with<00:02:54.769> saline<00:02:55.069> and<00:02:55.430> as<00:02:55.940> innovators<00:02:56.540> what

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
fill with saline and as innovators what

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.509 
fill with saline and as innovators what
we<00:02:57.019> realized<00:02:57.440> was<00:02:57.560> we<00:02:57.769> could<00:02:57.950> put<00:02:58.129> drugs

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
we realized was we could put drugs

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.820 
we realized was we could put drugs
inside<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.239> and<00:02:59.480> allow<00:02:59.989> those<00:03:00.260> drugs<00:03:00.680> to

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
inside of that and allow those drugs to

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.220 
inside of that and allow those drugs to
be<00:03:01.010> delivered<00:03:01.610> through<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.150> stent<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.750> think

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
be delivered through that stent I think

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.900 
be delivered through that stent I think
of<00:03:03.319> it<00:03:03.410> as<00:03:03.500> basically<00:03:03.860> it's<00:03:04.010> cardiology<00:03:04.760> in

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
of it as basically it's cardiology in

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.430 
of it as basically it's cardiology in
the<00:03:05.000> nose<00:03:05.180> cardiologists<00:03:06.079> have<00:03:06.140> been<00:03:06.260> doing

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
the nose cardiologists have been doing

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.680 
the nose cardiologists have been doing
like<00:03:06.560> four<00:03:06.769> years<00:03:06.799> stents<00:03:07.370> for<00:03:07.670> blood<00:03:08.209> vessels

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
like four years stents for blood vessels

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.600 
like four years stents for blood vessels
to<00:03:08.750> keep<00:03:09.019> them<00:03:09.260> open<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:09.769> it's<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.010> similar<00:03:10.250> kind

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
to keep them open so it's a similar kind

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.059 
to keep them open so it's a similar kind
of<00:03:10.819> it's<00:03:11.329> exactly<00:03:11.660> right<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.470> it's<00:03:12.860> you

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
of it's exactly right and and it's you

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.949 
of it's exactly right and and it's you
know<00:03:13.129> it's<00:03:13.310> basically<00:03:13.459> delivering<00:03:14.420> drug<00:03:14.720> to

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
know it's basically delivering drug to

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.990 
know it's basically delivering drug to
the<00:03:15.049> affected<00:03:15.590> area<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.040> sinuses<00:03:16.549> in<00:03:16.790> a

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
the affected area and the sinuses in a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.460 
the affected area and the sinuses in a
way<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.299> we've<00:03:17.420> never<00:03:17.690> really<00:03:18.049> been<00:03:18.200> able<00:03:18.319> to

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
way that we've never really been able to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.270 
way that we've never really been able to
do<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:18.739> work

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
do that work

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.460 
do that work
so<00:03:19.609> in<00:03:19.790> this<00:03:19.940> animation<00:03:20.450> here<00:03:20.690> we<00:03:20.870> have<00:03:21.049> a

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
so in this animation here we have a

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.770 
so in this animation here we have a
guide<00:03:22.099> catheter<00:03:22.459> that's<00:03:22.879> placed<00:03:23.299> inside<00:03:23.629> the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
guide catheter that's placed inside the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.559 
guide catheter that's placed inside the
nose<00:03:23.959> we're<00:03:24.230> advancing<00:03:25.010> this<00:03:25.489> stent<00:03:25.879> into<00:03:26.150> the

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
nose we're advancing this stent into the

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.199 
nose we're advancing this stent into the
sinus<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:27.170> basically<00:03:28.129> once<00:03:28.370> this<00:03:28.549> stent<00:03:29.090> is

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
sinus and basically once this stent is

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.300 
sinus and basically once this stent is
in<00:03:29.329> good<00:03:29.450> position<00:03:29.510> were<00:03:30.230> releasing<00:03:31.010> the

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
in good position were releasing the

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.979 
in good position were releasing the
guide<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.849> the<00:03:31.940> stents<00:03:32.209> stays<00:03:32.540> in<00:03:32.750> place

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
guide and the stents stays in place

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.960 
guide and the stents stays in place
we're<00:03:33.470> trimming<00:03:33.829> it<00:03:34.069> inside<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.489> nose<00:03:34.700> and

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
we're trimming it inside the nose and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.640 
we're trimming it inside the nose and
that's<00:03:35.299> an<00:03:35.450> example<00:03:35.780> as<00:03:36.109> you<00:03:36.200> can<00:03:36.349> see<00:03:36.500> those

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
that's an example as you can see those

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.650 
that's an example as you can see those
little<00:03:36.739> openings<00:03:37.250> of<00:03:37.459> where<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:38.060> drug<00:03:38.420> or<00:03:38.629> the

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
little openings of where the drug or the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.809 
little openings of where the drug or the
saline<00:03:39.140> will<00:03:39.319> drain<00:03:39.620> through<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:40.430> treat<00:03:40.700> the

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
saline will drain through to treat the

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.910 
saline will drain through to treat the
sinuses<00:03:41.329> and<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.930> device<00:03:42.410> interesting

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
sinuses and that device interesting

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.190 
sinuses and that device interesting
would<00:03:43.069> be<00:03:43.099> removed<00:03:43.849> in<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.060> nose<00:03:44.299> or<00:03:44.660> from<00:03:45.109> the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
would be removed in the nose or from the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.159 
would be removed in the nose or from the
nose<00:03:45.380> at<00:03:45.709> 28<00:03:46.519> days<00:03:46.730> after<00:03:47.239> surgery<00:03:47.419> in<00:03:47.840> the

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
nose at 28 days after surgery in the

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.050 
nose at 28 days after surgery in the
office<00:03:48.560> with<00:03:48.739> local<00:03:49.069> anesthesia<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:49.849> it's<00:03:49.970> not

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
office with local anesthesia so it's not
