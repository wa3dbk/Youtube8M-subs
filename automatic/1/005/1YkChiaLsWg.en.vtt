didn't really manage to fight him off
very<00:02:04.680> effectively<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.540> me<00:02:06.540> personally<00:02:06.780> I

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
very effectively so me personally I

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.330 
very effectively so me personally I
don't<00:02:07.140> really<00:02:07.290> accept<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.860> excuse<00:02:08.310> that

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
don't really accept that excuse that

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.199 
don't really accept that excuse that
Braemar<00:02:08.789> was<00:02:09.110> waiting<00:02:10.110> for<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:11.610> ref<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.970> stop

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.460 
Braemar was waiting for the ref to stop
it<00:02:12.390> because

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
it because

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.080 
it because
I<00:02:13.500> get<00:02:13.800> caught<00:02:14.010> with<00:02:14.040> shots<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.670> not<00:02:14.820> fire

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
I get caught with shots and not fire

I<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:18.510> don't<00:02:18.660> think<00:02:18.780> brain<00:02:19.080> was<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.440> good

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
I just don't think brain was that good

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.920 
I just don't think brain was that good
to<00:02:19.800> be<00:02:19.890> honest<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.790> would<00:02:21.330> take<00:02:21.570> Enzo

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
to be honest so I would take Enzo

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
fighting thing you know what I could

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.780 
fighting thing you know what I could
have<00:02:39.210> won<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.390> fight<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:41.190> yeah<00:02:41.520> that's<00:02:41.730> just

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
have won that fight so yeah that's just

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.820 
have won that fight so yeah that's just
my<00:02:42.000> take<00:02:42.210> on<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.480> people<00:02:42.630> maybe<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.620> disagree

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
my take on it people maybe you disagree

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.800 
my take on it people maybe you disagree
but<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.610> think<00:02:44.640> my<00:02:45.060> can<00:02:45.210> only<00:02:45.330> could<00:02:45.510> win<00:02:45.660> that

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
but I think my can only could win that

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.040 
but I think my can only could win that
fight<00:02:46.020> with<00:02:46.170> two<00:02:46.320> two<00:02:47.070> good<00:02:47.280> eyes<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:48.050> Braemar

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
fight with two two good eyes and Braemar

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.630 
fight with two two good eyes and Braemar
definitely<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.800> weakest<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.490> light

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
definitely the weakest of the light

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.100 
definitely the weakest of the light
heavyweight<00:02:50.910> champions<00:02:51.450> at<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.600> moment<00:02:51.990> in

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
heavyweight champions at the moment in

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.380 
heavyweight champions at the moment in
my<00:02:52.500> opinion<00:02:52.950> it's<00:02:53.520> between<00:02:53.640> him<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.090> Schumann

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
my opinion it's between him and Schumann

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.210 
my opinion it's between him and Schumann
off<00:02:54.510> bar<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.930> think<00:02:55.230> Bremer<00:02:55.650> might<00:02:55.890> even<00:02:56.040> be

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
off bar I think Bremer might even be

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.530 
off bar I think Bremer might even be
weaker<00:02:56.550> than<00:02:56.640> human<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.240> look<00:02:57.390> very

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
weaker than human of you look very

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.150 
weaker than human of you look very
one-dimensional<00:02:57.840> in<00:02:58.410> there<00:02:58.590> aside<00:02:58.890> from<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
one-dimensional in there aside from the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.620 
one-dimensional in there aside from the
first<00:02:59.400> round<00:02:59.640> where<00:02:59.820> he<00:02:59.850> looked<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.540> know

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
first round where he looked you know

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.070 
first round where he looked you know
pretty<00:03:00.900> good<00:03:01.250> other<00:03:02.250> than<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.580> he<00:03:02.670> looked

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
pretty good other than that he looked

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.550 
pretty good other than that he looked
one-dimensional<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.140> think<00:03:04.320> he<00:03:04.410> was

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
one-dimensional I think he was

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.020 
one-dimensional I think he was
struggling<00:03:04.860> with<00:03:05.070> Mac<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.280> Eric<00:03:05.670> macro

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
struggling with Mac and Eric macro

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.570 
struggling with Mac and Eric macro
