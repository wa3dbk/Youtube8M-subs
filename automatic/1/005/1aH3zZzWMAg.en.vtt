00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the year but at the end of the day there

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.670

if you see his preseason games he can

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.910 
if you see his preseason games he can

a<00:02:09.869> great<00:02:10.050> chance<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.500> making<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.860> up<00:02:11.009> right<00:02:11.250> now

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
a great chance of making it up right now

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.040 
a great chance of making it up right now
this<00:02:11.700> year<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.120> don't<00:02:12.450> see<00:02:12.540> him<00:02:12.660> getting<00:02:12.780> it

Kemba Walker
right<00:02:14.680> rookie<00:02:15.160> but<00:02:15.490> you're<00:02:15.610> not<00:02:15.730> going<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.000> get

the Rookie of the Year this year only

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.260 
the Rookie of the Year this year only
because<00:02:17.980> Charlotte<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.610> not<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.820> good<00:02:19.090> team

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
because Charlotte is not a good team

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.790 
because Charlotte is not a good team
right<00:02:19.510> now<00:02:19.570> they<00:02:19.870> traded<00:02:20.140> all<00:02:20.380> their<00:02:20.650> good

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
right now they traded all their good

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.860 
right now they traded all their good
players<00:02:20.950> away<00:02:21.220> Corey<00:02:21.820> michetti<00:02:22.210> he's<00:02:22.690> going

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
players away Corey michetti he's going

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.090 
players away Corey michetti he's going
to<00:02:22.930> have<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.050> great<00:02:23.230> year<00:02:23.350> this<00:02:23.530> year<00:02:23.710> but<00:02:24.070> still

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
to have a great year this year but still

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.610 
to have a great year this year but still
it's<00:02:24.520> not<00:02:24.670> MVP<00:02:25.150> worthy<00:02:25.480> for<00:02:25.660> Kemba<00:02:25.840> Walker<00:02:25.960> but

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
it's not MVP worthy for Kemba Walker but

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.650 
it's not MVP worthy for Kemba Walker but
definitely<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.160> great<00:02:27.400> future<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:28.300> leaves<00:02:28.510> us

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
definitely a great future this leaves us

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.780 
definitely a great future this leaves us
