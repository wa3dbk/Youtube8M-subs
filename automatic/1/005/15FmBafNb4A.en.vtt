00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 and an accident here on the street good view with 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.400
 The police lieutenant next to me. 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.049
 military 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.990
 oshea who speaks about this 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.990
 occurrence what happened here that 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.210
 there was a collision between two vehicles and 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.029
 one of them being a pickup truck after 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.520
 that the collision hit a pole 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.720
 broke the post and such a whole neighborhood without 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.449
 light 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.349
 is one of the drivers were 26 one 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.779
 truck and a vehicle in a Celtic the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.300
 vehicle the celtic vehicle the driver 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.880
 assumed that you have drunk alcohol is 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.800
 he was a volunteer tested the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.170
 he actually found that he 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.450
 drank alcohol 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.260
 we are doing all the procedures 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.120
 As usual 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.520
 in the case of that driver of the Celtic vehicle 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.379
 did not give the traffic crime 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.309
 the source that gave traffic violation 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.260
 it's being done the fine will bring him to CNN 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.879
 it is being collected 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.100
 Breathalyzer tests were performed in the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.090
 two drivers only one was 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.770
 drunk 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.710
 we are recording the occurrence for 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.330
 in the future, the authorities will take 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.720
 appropriate measures in the case had a 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.549
 post that was broken here, do not accelo 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.619
 then you should look for these 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.020
 drivers thinking this was expanded 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.509
 the broken post so we can 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.150
 understand who was the initial provocateur 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.920
 this collision that culminated is composed of 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.600
 He fell to the floor and the ceiling after 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.180
 probably something must be done 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.970
 because these neighborhoods that are 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.520
 being done asphalt surfacing then 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.220
 have some that do not have signaling as 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.229
 The one who made the crossing has a 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.220
 street that does not have 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.680
 stop then it will be done later 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.079
 a better analysis to know who was the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.670
 cause of the accident but this 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.759
 individual who was in the midst of heaven for 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.200
 he is drunk he is already a cause 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.869
 of the accident, right? 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.759
 but something to present only this 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.070
 is to alert the population to the 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.630
 itumbiara that fit who we have the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.810
 lipstick, you are 24 hours, so these people 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.819
 who still insist on drinking 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.569
 alcoholic and drive vehicle 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.920
 we are 24 hours with the fountain source 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.830
 since then the vehicles are 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.349
 If you need it, how was it? 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.500
 to the place of occurrence and take the test 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.500
 of the breathalyzer
