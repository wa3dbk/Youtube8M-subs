00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.970
 dear friends hello my name is 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.000
 yuri 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.120
 Lobana's name now I will try when 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.290
 to you that there has never been any 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.860
 planet tayton 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.480
 I have a special opinion on this and 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.920
 solid evidence 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.529
 but let's do everything in order and who will not 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.230
 agree please explain it with 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:33.940
 my point of view I will be glad to hear 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:37.739
 different theories and assumptions and so on 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:42.070
 about the origin of the asteroid belt 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.129
 there are many hypotheses and guesses one of 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.229
 them destruction some never there 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.780
 phaeton 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:54.220
 as a result of a cosmic disaster 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:57.369
 another hypothesis tells us that in 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.949
 This place for the formation of the planet is not 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:03.519
 enough material 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:07.030
 it still flies between Jupiter and 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:10.630
 Mars was relatively recently discovered 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.170
 another asteroid belt between uranium and 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.760
 neptune but that existed there 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.710
 once the planet and speech does not go 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.130
 since asteroids possess common 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.100
 properties for both corbel should 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.420
 take into account their total 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.300
 origin 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.860
 what reasons did not allow the property 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.750
 gather at one point if we are 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.659
 carefully study the location of the nodes 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.620
 points in the solar system then we will notice 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.690
 that with a small number of nodes 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.940
 located in orbit 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.390
 a planet is formed with a large radius and 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:56.110
 mass and vice versa with large quantities 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.229
 nodal points in orbit radius and massively 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.880
 the planets come out able than the previous 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.880
 case for comparison, take 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.490
 earth venus and mars earth from venus 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.349
 form a steady five-pointed figure 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.269
 stars while spinning around the sun 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.510
 accordingly these planets possess 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:20.140
 greater radius and mass than mars 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.269
 which with the joint movement of the earth 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.230
 form in their orbit a nodal point with 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.780
 15 degrees apart 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.480
 if we are on Mars orbit on nothing else 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.209
 nodal points that it forms 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.610
 together with Jupiter the distance between 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.239
 courses will be measured even less 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.670
 by size 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:47.299
 this way on the palisade of the nodal 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.709
 points a massive body like a planet 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:54.500
 can not be formed because it will be the 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.060
 same destroyed on a periodic 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.940
 disturbing force 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.849
 outgoing from neighboring planets even 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.340
 Mars satellites are forced to take into account 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.859
 this factor 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.290
 therefore in this area 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:12.670
 solar systems will be sustainable body 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.120
 similar in size to the Mansa satellites 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.980
 which are the asteroid asteroid 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.430
 these asteroids will form small 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.859
 waves that will not collapse 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.230
 large planetary waves 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:31.120
 relation which will be mine 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.090
 ripples on the surface of large main 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.100
 1993 space probe or lego 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.000
 direct jupiter photographed 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:44.049
 asteroid and up to a length of 55 kilometers a 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.230
 around him like it wasn't incredible 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:50.810
 addressed little to the name duck 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.870
 bodies over time 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.140
 science does not explain this phenomenon for 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.670
 exception may like brothers in mind 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.959
 there is a joke shove up 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.390
 but 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.220
 liquid to recognize the fact that asteroid 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.920
 indicates a small wave 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.950
 it becomes clear above 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.850
 phenomenon as a combination of two small won 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.190
 rolling outer space 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.100
 asteroid orbits will be on topic 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.760
 camp where there are no corner points from 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.840
 the planets 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.820
 the occurrence of an orbit on a nodal point 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.270
 died or fall late on the planet 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.000
 so now in orbits 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.060
 there are those asteroids that are not 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.090
 hurt hotspots even though 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.240
 that the orbits themselves can go inside 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.870
 insults and and venus dwelt the way of every 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.630
 the planets 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.200
 pour and as much of the nodal wavelength 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.800
 points 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.139
 because their wave coincides with nodes 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.190
 field and creates sustainable 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:00.320
 the orbital system from here follows the conclusion 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.100
 since there are theories about wave 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.240
 structure 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:09.470
 what about the law of the world 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.840
 in question it should be no concern 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.450
 no theory 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.669
 negative dear friends have anyone 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.729
 you have questions for me 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:22.639
 please visit my site on the frame 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.460
 Yandex search engine write his bolivia 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.530
 and about me there is also the opposite 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.060
 write contact 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.340
 send here you on my site you 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.430
 find all my books and for yourself 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.400
 information and there are also displaying 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.910
 means and oak through it you will find all 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:45.520
 My videos with you were Yuri Lobanov 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.520
 Thank you for your attention until next time.
