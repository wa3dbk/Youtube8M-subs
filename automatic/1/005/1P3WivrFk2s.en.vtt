what<00:04:21.269> I<00:04:21.299> figured<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.750> was<00:04:21.840> gonna<00:04:21.900> do<00:04:22.109> is<00:04:22.229> put<00:04:22.410> the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
what I figured I was gonna do is put the

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.529 
what I figured I was gonna do is put the
filter<00:04:23.280> pump<00:04:23.430> down<00:04:23.700> there<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.390> way

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
filter pump down there that way

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.390 
filter pump down there that way
everything<00:04:24.840> gets

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
everything gets

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.750 
everything gets
down<00:04:26.820> that<00:04:27.120> way<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.980> just<00:04:28.980> gets<00:04:29.160> collected<00:04:29.310> to

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
down that way and just gets collected to

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.850 
down that way and just gets collected to
the<00:04:29.880> filter<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:30.720> that's<00:04:31.290> what's<00:04:31.500> going<00:04:31.650> on

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
the filter so that's what's going on

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.370 
the filter so that's what's going on

it<00:05:35.610> half<00:05:35.790> for<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.060> video<00:05:36.300> so<00:05:36.690> I<00:05:36.720> was<00:05:37.410> like<00:05:37.620> well

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
it half for the video so I was like well

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.560

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
reek I can't redo that part of the video

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.590 
reek I can't redo that part of the video
cuz<00:05:44.250> I<00:05:44.310> trimmed<00:05:44.610> off<00:05:44.760> dead<00:05:45.000> plant<00:05:45.300> matter<00:05:45.480> and

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
cuz I trimmed off dead plant matter and

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.030 
cuz I trimmed off dead plant matter and
stuff<00:05:45.900> so<00:05:46.170> that<00:05:46.320> really<00:05:46.440> sucked<00:05:46.800> it<00:05:46.890> was<00:05:46.920> a

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
stuff so that really sucked it was a

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.330 
stuff so that really sucked it was a

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.440 
rockin now the reason I had this LED
beam<00:05:58.440> down<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:58.800> luigia<00:05:59.250> is<00:05:59.520> because<00:06:00.060> I<00:06:00.090> found

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
beam down the luigia is because I found

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.570 
beam down the luigia is because I found
out<00:06:00.660> that<00:06:00.870> I<00:06:00.930> mean<00:06:01.230> it<00:06:01.770> might<00:06:01.950> just<00:06:02.130> be<00:06:02.220> me<00:06:02.400> but

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
out that I mean it might just be me but

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.850 
out that I mean it might just be me but
when<00:06:03.150> luigia<00:06:03.630> first<00:06:03.900> go<00:06:04.050> into<00:06:04.200> your<00:06:04.290> tank<00:06:04.650> I

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
when luigia first go into your tank I

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.130 
when luigia first go into your tank I
think<00:06:04.890> it<00:06:05.190> likes<00:06:05.370> a<00:06:05.490> lot<00:06:05.700> of<00:06:05.760> light<00:06:06.060> and<00:06:06.330> I'm
