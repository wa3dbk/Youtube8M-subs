to<00:00:43.760> be<00:00:43.879> ambushed<00:00:44.739> on<00:00:45.739> there's<00:00:46.010> like<00:00:46.219> six

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.539 
so I guess like a freighter decided to
go<00:00:53.780> blow<00:00:54.019> up<00:00:54.230> here<00:00:54.440> like<00:00:54.860> a<00:00:54.979> suicidal

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:55.549

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:24.669 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:29.980 

who<00:07:25.669> seriously<00:07:26.510> ok<00:07:27.020> enough<00:07:27.560> of<00:07:27.970> my<00:07:28.990> whatever
