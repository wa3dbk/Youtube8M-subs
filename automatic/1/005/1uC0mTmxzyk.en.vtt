00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
hello this is dr. brain again here we

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.240 
hello this is dr. brain again here we
are<00:00:05.879> in<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.150> ponds<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:07.049> little<00:00:07.980> bit<00:00:08.099> more

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
are in the ponds a little bit more

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.879 
are in the ponds a little bit more
rostral<00:00:08.849> than<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.120> previous<00:00:09.599> section<00:00:10.110> we

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
rostral than the previous section we

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.379 
rostral than the previous section we
would<00:00:11.070> say<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.820> probably<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
would say that this is probably the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.039

mentioned<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.600> last<00:00:33.750> time<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.410> really

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
mentioned to you last time we really

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.510 
mentioned to you last time we really
should<00:00:34.920> divide<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.399> ponds<00:00:35.670> into<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> basis

we<00:00:44.770> can<00:00:45.010> use<00:00:45.040> as<00:00:45.400> the<00:00:45.550> dividing<00:00:46.030> line<00:00:46.210> this

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
we can use as the dividing line this
