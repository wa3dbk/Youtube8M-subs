00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.940
 hi to all from phone assists that 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.730
 I wanted to present this cover 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:17.160
 original white apple is branded as 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:20.340
 you can see 16gb at the apple logo is the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.660
 original cover is sold as well 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.199
 without any accessories it is excellent 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.720
 excellent workmanship made in china like all of them 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.600
 apple things I recommend 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.890
 buy along with this cover also 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.770
 the chrome frame 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.010
 you can buy this which is not 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.789
 the original one costs respect 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.510
 to the original and much less and is perfect 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:53.219
 I show how to position it on 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.399
 cover with kisses very well and 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.230
 therefore you will not have the defect that you would do 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.050
 your original cover when it goes 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.940
 good if then to close now must 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.360
 first put it in the lower part 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.850
 where is the dock connector after having 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.979
 positioned this part we go along 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.890
 long line until you reach su 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.700
 be able to trigger the chrome frame 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.060
 in its place there is no air at all 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.400
 this way then the chrome cover 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.350
 fits perfectly with the cover 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.530
 original and then possibly another 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.540
 purchase that you could do together with 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:41.280
 new white cover could be 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.950
 this that to the original antenna of the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.630
 your iphone 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.009
 this one puts itself down here as now 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.990
 you still see the double sided adhesive tape 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:59.490
 to be able to make it adhere to the cover 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.280
 would go down here on these two there are 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.009
 two white teeth and here yes 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:12.750
 it would incur therefore this allows you 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:18.000
 to receive gps signal mts 3g not 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.069
 the sled of the of the is supplied 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.540
 cover 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.550
 I believe that your original one goes 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.450
 well eventually you should buy at 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.810
 also the white briefs if the cover 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.739
 and white black of course yours 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.610

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.830
 serve this support there 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.700
 found on the site is nothing but 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:48.269
 the support that keeps you pushed into his 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:52.340
 home the silent ringtone button is 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:55.950

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.080
 button the silent switch 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.510
 ringtone and should be placed 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.140
 inside our water cover 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.590
 Jun therefore maintains in his series the 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.519
 our antenna keeps pushing down 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.980
 the chrome frame is at the bottom 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:18.390
 supported by three screws and then maintains 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.000
 our silent ringtone button 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.209
