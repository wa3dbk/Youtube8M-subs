the<00:01:50.909> quark<00:01:51.240> mini<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:52.110> two<00:01:52.320> three<00:01:52.590> flashlights

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the quark mini one two three flashlights

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.240 
the quark mini one two three flashlights
which<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.460> obviously<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.090> lot<00:01:54.360> brighter<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
which is obviously a lot brighter and

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.520 
which is obviously a lot brighter and
that's<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> r5<00:01:56.820> version<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> was<00:01:58.079> testing

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
that's the r5 version that I was testing

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.709 
that's the r5 version that I was testing
but<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.729> kind<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.000> give<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.240> an<00:02:00.360> idea<00:02:00.479> of

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
but just to kind of give you an idea of

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.270 
but just to kind of give you an idea of
what<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.110> beam<00:02:01.290> looks<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.070> how<00:02:02.159> much

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
what the beam looks like and how much

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.590 
what the beam looks like and how much
light<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.729> puts<00:02:02.939> out<00:02:03.469> now<00:02:04.469> as<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.250> see<00:02:05.600> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
light it puts out now as you can see the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.889 
light it puts out now as you can see the
mini<00:02:07.380> 123<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.310> slightly<00:02:08.700> brighter<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.599> not<00:02:09.750> by

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
mini 123 is slightly brighter but not by

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.809 
mini 123 is slightly brighter but not by
that<00:02:10.259> far<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.800> stretch<00:02:10.830> even<00:02:11.430> though<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
that far of a stretch even though the

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.429 
that far of a stretch even though the
specs<00:02:13.030> tell<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.689> that<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.650> mini<00:02:14.859> 123<00:02:15.489> has<00:02:15.640> got

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
specs tell you that the mini 123 has got

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.199 
specs tell you that the mini 123 has got
205<00:02:17.439> lumens<00:02:17.889> I<00:02:18.010> believe<00:02:18.280> or<00:02:18.549> around<00:02:18.849> 190

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
205 lumens I believe or around 190

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.629 
205 lumens I believe or around 190
somewhere<00:02:19.930> around<00:02:20.019> there<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:20.499> the<00:02:21.310> Phoenix

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:21.639 
somewhere around there and the Phoenix

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.440 
somewhere around there and the Phoenix
e11<00:02:22.150> puts<00:02:22.389> out<00:02:22.540> 105<00:02:23.459> but<00:02:24.459> still<00:02:24.879> there<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.299> can

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
e11 puts out 105 but still there you can

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.929 
e11 puts out 105 but still there you can
see<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:25.629> they're<00:02:26.040> they're<00:02:27.040> slightly<00:02:27.400> closed

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
see that they're they're slightly closed

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.009 
see that they're they're slightly closed
as<00:02:28.239> far<00:02:29.230> as<00:02:29.349> output<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:30.719> now<00:02:31.719> the<00:02:31.780> difference

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
as far as output and now the difference

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.670 
as far as output and now the difference
between<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.680> mini<00:02:32.889> 123<00:02:33.579> and<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.790> e<00:02:33.819> 11<00:02:34.329> is<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
between the mini 123 and the e 11 is the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.490 
between the mini 123 and the e 11 is the
operation<00:02:36.489> on<00:02:36.719> the<00:02:37.719> mini<00:02:37.900> one<00:02:38.079> two<00:02:38.230> three

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
operation on the mini one two three

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.360 
operation on the mini one two three
you've<00:02:38.980> got<00:02:39.159> several<00:02:39.549> modes<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.889> operate

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
you've got several modes but you operate

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.629 
you've got several modes but you operate
it<00:02:42.489> by<00:02:42.730> twisting<00:02:43.359> the<00:02:44.400> head<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.519> the

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
it by twisting the head of the

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.659 
it by twisting the head of the
flashlight<00:02:46.150> as<00:02:46.359> opposed<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.049> having<00:02:47.260> a

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:47.669 
flashlight as opposed to having a

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:53.129 
flashlight as opposed to having a
activation<00:02:48.669> switch<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:51.340> tail<00:02:51.549> cap<00:02:52.139> now

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
activation switch in the tail cap now

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.839 
activation switch in the tail cap now
different<00:02:53.739> strokes<00:02:54.099> for<00:02:54.340> different<00:02:54.519> folks

different strokes for different folks
not<00:02:55.359> everyone<00:02:55.780> likes<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:57.419> tail<00:02:58.419> caps<00:02:58.719> which

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
not everyone likes the tail caps which

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.789 
not everyone likes the tail caps which
some<00:02:59.409> people<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.889> the<00:03:00.599> twist<00:03:01.599> on<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.049> off<00:03:02.169> me

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
some people like the twist on and off me

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.309 
some people like the twist on and off me
personally<00:03:03.370> if<00:03:03.699> I<00:03:04.389> can<00:03:04.599> have<00:03:04.750> all<00:03:04.959> my<00:03:04.989> lights

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
personally if I can have all my lights

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.959 
personally if I can have all my lights

have a tail cap switch button I choose

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.569 
have a tail cap switch button I choose
that<00:03:10.209> now<00:03:11.109> some<00:03:11.560> complaints<00:03:12.040> people<00:03:12.280> have<00:03:12.400> had

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
that now some complaints people have had

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:13.800 
that now some complaints people have had
about<00:03:12.790> this<00:03:13.000> light<00:03:13.239> there<00:03:13.480> haven't<00:03:13.689> been<00:03:13.719> a

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
about this light there haven't been a

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.809 
about this light there haven't been a
lot<00:03:13.989> of<00:03:14.019> reviews<00:03:14.409> on<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:14.650> in<00:03:14.949> fact<00:03:15.579> I<00:03:15.760> think

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
lot of reviews on it in fact I think

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.780 
lot of reviews on it in fact I think
there's<00:03:16.090> only<00:03:16.150> one<00:03:16.299> on<00:03:16.629> YouTube<00:03:17.079> is<00:03:17.639> that<00:03:18.639> the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
there's only one on YouTube is that the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.990 
there's only one on YouTube is that the
beam<00:03:19.000> is<00:03:19.030> not<00:03:19.479> exactly<00:03:20.220> centered<00:03:21.220> or<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.549> LED

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
beam is not exactly centered or the LED

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.599 
beam is not exactly centered or the LED
emitter<00:03:22.720> isn't<00:03:23.169> completely<00:03:23.470> centered<00:03:23.799> so<00:03:24.459> the

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
emitter isn't completely centered so the

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.780 
emitter isn't completely centered so the
beam<00:03:24.790> looks<00:03:25.060> not<00:03:25.629> completely<00:03:26.790> asymmetrical

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
beam looks not completely asymmetrical

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.309 
beam looks not completely asymmetrical
or<00:03:28.090> round<00:03:29.049> when<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.739> shine<00:03:30.009> it<00:03:30.220> on<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.489> wall<00:03:31.319> I

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
or round when you shine it on the wall I

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.319 
or round when you shine it on the wall I
haven't<00:03:32.829> found<00:03:33.009> that<00:03:33.220> with<00:03:33.430> this<00:03:33.609> one<00:03:33.819> this

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
haven't found that with this one this

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.030 
haven't found that with this one this

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
one I ordered from a store online i'll

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.530 
one I ordered from a store online i'll
go<00:03:39.159> ahead<00:03:39.189> and<00:03:39.370> annotate<00:03:39.849> the<00:03:40.000> name<00:03:40.150> because<00:03:40.449> i

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
go ahead and annotate the name because i

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.509 
go ahead and annotate the name because i
forget<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.019> now<00:03:41.169> I<00:03:41.439> think<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:41.829> was<00:03:41.919> aimed<00:03:42.189> calm

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
forget it now I think it was aimed calm

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.629 
forget it now I think it was aimed calm
tactical<00:03:43.500> but<00:03:44.500> anyways<00:03:44.859> this<00:03:44.979> is<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.220> brand<00:03:45.459> new

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
tactical but anyways this is a brand new

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.789 
tactical but anyways this is a brand new
one<00:03:45.819> wasn't<00:03:46.509> sent<00:03:47.019> back<00:03:47.199> to<00:03:47.229> Phoenix<00:03:47.680> or

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
one wasn't sent back to Phoenix or

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.789 
one wasn't sent back to Phoenix or
anything<00:03:48.159> and<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.579> find<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.239> beams

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
anything and I find that the beams

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.890 
anything and I find that the beams
perfectly<00:03:50.799> centered<00:03:51.400> it's<00:03:52.120> got<00:03:52.299> a<00:03:52.329> nice<00:03:52.540> round

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
perfectly centered it's got a nice round

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.550 
perfectly centered it's got a nice round
shape<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.439> it<00:03:53.849> now<00:03:54.849> if<00:03:55.479> I<00:03:55.599> was<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:56.019> compare<00:03:56.530> it

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
shape to it now if I was to compare it

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.149 
shape to it now if I was to compare it
to<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:57.040> quark<00:03:57.759> mini<00:03:58.030> one<00:03:58.269> two<00:03:58.449> three<00:03:58.949> I'll<00:03:59.949> go

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
to the quark mini one two three I'll go

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.999 
to the quark mini one two three I'll go
ahead<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.370> turn<00:04:00.549> that<00:04:00.759> one<00:04:00.939> on<00:04:00.969> high<00:04:01.829> you<00:04:02.829> can

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:03.009 
ahead and turn that one on high you can

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:07.020 
ahead and turn that one on high you can
see<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.280> it<00:04:04.269> does<00:04:04.509> have<00:04:04.750> a<00:04:04.780> cleaner<00:04:05.139> beam<00:04:06.030> for

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
see that it does have a cleaner beam for

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.909 
see that it does have a cleaner beam for
the<00:04:07.120> most<00:04:07.299> part<00:04:07.419> at<00:04:08.139> least<00:04:08.199> the<00:04:08.650> center
