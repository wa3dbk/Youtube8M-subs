okay<00:00:01.589> Paul<00:00:02.159> and<00:00:02.490> thunder<00:00:02.820> three<00:00:03.120> here<00:00:05.150> we're

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
okay Paul and thunder three here we're

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.250 
okay Paul and thunder three here we're
gonna<00:00:06.330> try<00:00:06.629> some<00:00:06.930> power<00:00:07.140> readings<00:00:07.649> today

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
gonna try some power readings today

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.190 
gonna try some power readings today
Saturday<00:00:11.269> well<00:00:12.269> it's<00:00:12.389> not<00:00:12.570> 12<00:00:12.840> o'clock

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
Saturday well it's not 12 o'clock

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.849 
Saturday well it's not 12 o'clock
anymore<00:00:13.679> that's<00:00:13.920> what<00:00:14.099> time<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.309> got<00:00:14.549> here<00:00:14.820> I

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
anymore that's what time I got here I

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.560 
anymore that's what time I got here I
got<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.039> one<00:00:17.250> kiloohm<00:00:17.640> we're<00:00:18.060> gonna<00:00:18.240> check<00:00:18.420> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
got a one kiloohm we're gonna check the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.740 
got a one kiloohm we're gonna check the
power<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.260> one<00:00:19.439> kiloohm<00:00:19.859> resistor

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
power with the one kiloohm resistor

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.029 
power with the one kiloohm resistor
across<00:00:22.369> the<00:00:23.369> outputs<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:25.080> wrist<00:00:25.260> resistor

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
across the outputs the wrist resistor

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.870 
across the outputs the wrist resistor
actually<00:00:26.490> checks<00:00:27.080> 984<00:00:28.080> ohms<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.490> we're<00:00:29.760> gonna

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
actually checks 984 ohms so we're gonna

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.250 
actually checks 984 ohms so we're gonna
use<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.720> exact<00:00:31.199> number<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:35.840> got<00:00:36.840> rid<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
use that exact number I got rid of the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.709 
use that exact number I got rid of the
little<00:00:37.469> red<00:00:37.800> clip<00:00:38.520> joining<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> two<00:00:39.450> coils

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
little red clip joining the two coils

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.170 
little red clip joining the two coils
together<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.590> made<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> nice<00:00:41.370> solder<00:00:41.730> joint

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
together I made a nice solder joint

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.389 
together I made a nice solder joint
there<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.640> plus<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.120> squared<00:00:45.780> up<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.920> coils

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
there and plus I squared up the coils

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.220 
there and plus I squared up the coils
more<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:48.000> didn't<00:00:48.270> cut<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.629> ends<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.200> I

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
more I didn't cut the ends but I

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.450 
more I didn't cut the ends but I
actually<00:00:49.500> put<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.449> small<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:52.340> spacer

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.799 

cardboard<00:00:57.920> in<00:00:58.920> between<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> coils<00:00:59.809> keeping

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
cardboard in between the coils keeping

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.920 
cardboard in between the coils keeping
them<00:01:01.340> square<00:01:02.420> compensating<00:01:03.420> for<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
them square compensating for the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.250 
them square compensating for the
crookedness<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.189> ends<00:01:05.780> but<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> coil<00:01:07.110> is

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
crookedness the ends but the coil is

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.190 
crookedness the ends but the coil is
nice<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.680> straight<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.340> got<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> pipe<00:01:09.200> up

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
nice and straight I got the pipe up

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.609 
nice and straight I got the pipe up
against<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.640> side<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> coils<00:01:13.140> which<00:01:13.470> we

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
against one side of the coils which we

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.640 
against one side of the coils which we
found<00:01:13.860> out<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.220> extremely<00:01:14.760> important<00:01:15.650> right

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
found out is extremely important right

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:26.330 
found out is extremely important right
now<00:01:17.299> or<00:01:18.299> at<00:01:20.360> 114<00:01:21.360> 8<00:01:22.280> volts<00:01:24.979> let's<00:01:25.979> see<00:01:26.189> I'll

so<00:04:09.239> 16<00:04:11.840> say<00:04:12.840> 16<00:04:14.540> was<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.569> micro<00:04:16.320> watts

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
so 16 say 16 was a micro watts

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.199 
so 16 say 16 was a micro watts
I<00:04:18.109> checked<00:04:19.109> it<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.350> other<00:04:19.500> day<00:04:19.769> I<00:04:20.070> got<00:04:21.000> about

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
I checked it the other day I got about

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.500 
I checked it the other day I got about
22<00:04:22.880> but<00:04:23.880> uh<00:04:23.910> how<00:04:24.630> much<00:04:24.900> difference<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:26.510> we're

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
22 but uh how much difference so we're

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.740 
22 but uh how much difference so we're
way<00:04:27.810> down<00:04:27.840> there<00:04:28.880> in<00:04:29.880> voltage<00:04:30.870> or<00:04:31.229> power<00:04:31.260> yet

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
way down there in voltage or power yet

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.890 
way down there in voltage or power yet
16<00:04:34.190> micro<00:04:35.190> watts

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
16 micro watts

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.830 
16 micro watts
I'm<00:04:36.900> gonna<00:04:37.050> check<00:04:37.380> power<00:04:37.590> again<00:04:38.690> we're<00:04:39.690> gonna

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
I'm gonna check power again we're gonna

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
I'm gonna check power again we're gonna
go<00:04:40.050> back<00:04:40.289> and<00:04:40.320> connect<00:04:41.419> another<00:04:42.710> circuit<00:04:43.710> on

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
go back and connect another circuit on

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.730 
go back and connect another circuit on
there<00:04:44.130> go<00:04:44.910> back<00:04:44.940> to<00:04:45.240> my<00:04:45.360> all<00:04:45.539> original<00:04:46.260> dual

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
there go back to my all original dual

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.610 
there go back to my all original dual
circuit<00:04:47.280> design<00:04:47.820> which<00:04:48.180> cuts<00:04:48.720> down<00:04:48.840> voltage<00:04:49.289> a

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
circuit design which cuts down voltage a

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.409 
circuit design which cuts down voltage a
lot<00:04:49.800> so<00:04:49.979> it<00:04:50.130> brings<00:04:50.310> up<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.729> current<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.240> lot

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
lot so it brings up the current a lot

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.890 
lot so it brings up the current a lot
I'll<00:04:52.229> see<00:04:52.729> what<00:04:53.729> the<00:04:53.880> power<00:04:54.060> readings<00:04:54.660> are

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
I'll see what the power readings are

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.860 
I'll see what the power readings are
like<00:04:55.289> that

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:05.180 

see<00:04:58.740> also<00:04:59.010> I<00:05:00.560> think<00:05:01.560> I'll<00:05:01.800> try<00:05:02.220> I<00:05:04.039> have<00:05:05.039> this

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
see also I think I'll try I have this

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.010 
see also I think I'll try I have this
other<00:05:05.400> pipe<00:05:05.729> here

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
other pipe here

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.560 
other pipe here
that's<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:07.500> little<00:05:07.740> bit<00:05:07.860> smaller<00:05:08.570> diameter

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
that's a little bit smaller diameter

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.410 
that's a little bit smaller diameter
than<00:05:09.600> the<00:05:09.780> one<00:05:09.990> I<00:05:10.020> have<00:05:10.320> in<00:05:10.530> there<00:05:10.710> right<00:05:10.890> now

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
than the one I have in there right now

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.640 
than the one I have in there right now
it'll<00:05:12.420> actually<00:05:12.600> fit<00:05:13.080> inside<00:05:13.260> this<00:05:13.710> other<00:05:13.950> one

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
it'll actually fit inside this other one

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.270 
it'll actually fit inside this other one
I'm<00:05:16.650> gonna<00:05:16.890> try<00:05:17.190> that<00:05:17.220> in<00:05:18.230> there<00:05:19.230> and<00:05:19.470> replace

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
I'm gonna try that in there and replace

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.050 
I'm gonna try that in there and replace
and<00:05:20.960> see<00:05:21.960> if<00:05:22.050> there's<00:05:22.260> any<00:05:22.410> difference

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
and see if there's any difference

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.880 
and see if there's any difference
between<00:05:24.060> a<00:05:24.360> smaller<00:05:24.750> pipe<00:05:25.140> or<00:05:25.350> a<00:05:25.380> bigger<00:05:25.590> pipe

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
between a smaller pipe or a bigger pipe

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.190 
between a smaller pipe or a bigger pipe
these<00:05:26.580> two<00:05:26.850> really<00:05:27.180> don't<00:05:27.360> have<00:05:27.600> that<00:05:27.660> much

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
these two really don't have that much

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.700 
these two really don't have that much
difference<00:05:28.860> between<00:05:29.660> the<00:05:30.660> diameter<00:05:31.320> of<00:05:31.500> them

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
difference between the diameter of them

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.620 
difference between the diameter of them
so<00:05:32.100> I<00:05:32.130> don't<00:05:32.250> think<00:05:32.790> there<00:05:32.970> will<00:05:33.180> be<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.570> much

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
so I don't think there will be that much

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.200 
so I don't think there will be that much
difference<00:05:34.260> if<00:05:35.070> anything<00:05:35.550> I'd<00:05:35.670> like<00:05:35.850> to<00:05:35.970> try<00:05:36.180> a

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
difference if anything I'd like to try a

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.660 
difference if anything I'd like to try a
pipe<00:05:36.540> that's<00:05:36.780> the<00:05:37.320> same<00:05:37.560> diameter<00:05:37.920> as<00:05:38.220> the<00:05:38.340> ID

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
pipe that's the same diameter as the ID

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:46.790 
pipe that's the same diameter as the ID
of<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:40.470> PVC<00:05:42.050> tube<00:05:43.050> here<00:05:45.410> but<00:05:46.410> if<00:05:46.500> this<00:05:46.650> small

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
of the PVC tube here but if this small

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.520 
of the PVC tube here but if this small
one<00:05:47.130> works<00:05:47.430> just<00:05:47.850> the<00:05:47.880> same<00:05:47.970> I'm<00:05:48.750> gonna<00:05:49.020> use<00:05:49.290> it

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
one works just the same I'm gonna use it

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.920 
one works just the same I'm gonna use it
from<00:05:49.710> now<00:05:49.890> on<00:05:49.920> and<00:05:50.460> I'm<00:05:51.270> gonna<00:05:51.420> take<00:05:51.750> that

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
from now on and I'm gonna take that

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.930 
from now on and I'm gonna take that
larger<00:05:52.410> pipe<00:05:52.620> that's<00:05:52.890> in<00:05:53.070> there<00:05:53.280> and<00:05:53.490> maybe<00:05:53.670> do

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
larger pipe that's in there and maybe do

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.290 
larger pipe that's in there and maybe do
an<00:05:54.060> experiment<00:05:54.720> where<00:05:54.960> I<00:05:55.020> will<00:05:55.560> wrap<00:05:55.970> the<00:05:56.970> coil

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
an experiment where I will wrap the coil

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.910 
an experiment where I will wrap the coil
right<00:05:57.900> around<00:05:58.350> it<00:05:58.850> and<00:06:00.290> try<00:06:01.290> to<00:06:01.320> use<00:06:01.620> it

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
right around it and try to use it

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.630 
right around it and try to use it
instead<00:06:02.220> of<00:06:02.520> these<00:06:02.760> coils<00:06:03.120> we<00:06:03.480> have<00:06:03.780> here<00:06:04.640> that

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
instead of these coils we have here that

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.600 
instead of these coils we have here that
way<00:06:05.850> we<00:06:06.000> will<00:06:06.210> have<00:06:06.270> copper<00:06:07.250> all<00:06:08.250> the<00:06:08.490> way

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
way we will have copper all the way

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.820 
way we will have copper all the way
around<00:06:08.940> the<00:06:09.480> inside<00:06:09.600> of<00:06:09.870> the<00:06:10.080> coils<00:06:10.530> and<00:06:12.830> we're

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
around the inside of the coils and we're

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.030 
around the inside of the coils and we're
still<00:06:14.070> I<00:06:14.960> don't<00:06:15.960> know<00:06:16.110> how<00:06:16.440> much<00:06:16.590> time<00:06:16.860> I'll

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
still I don't know how much time I'll

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.340 
still I don't know how much time I'll
have<00:06:17.220> today<00:06:17.660> I'm<00:06:18.660> gonna<00:06:18.870> do<00:06:19.020> some<00:06:19.230> more

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
have today I'm gonna do some more

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.620 
have today I'm gonna do some more
experiments<00:06:20.070> with<00:06:20.310> the<00:06:20.430> coil<00:06:20.700> is<00:06:21.000> is<00:06:21.210> tough

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
experiments with the coil is is tough

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.360 
experiments with the coil is is tough
and<00:06:21.930> that's

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
and that's

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.830 
and that's
so<00:06:23.910> it's<00:06:24.060> gonna<00:06:24.150> take<00:06:24.330> a<00:06:24.390> while<00:06:24.630> to<00:06:24.660> make

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
so it's gonna take a while to make

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.960 
so it's gonna take a while to make
another<00:06:25.230> coil<00:06:25.560> up<00:06:25.830> wrap<00:06:26.160> the<00:06:26.370> coil<00:06:26.610> around

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
another coil up wrap the coil around

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.510 
another coil up wrap the coil around
that<00:06:27.150> pipe<00:06:27.390> and<00:06:27.720> the<00:06:28.680> other<00:06:28.830> thing<00:06:29.100> I<00:06:29.220> want<00:06:29.430> to

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
that pipe and the other thing I want to

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.390 
that pipe and the other thing I want to
do<00:06:29.670> yet<00:06:30.270> is<00:06:30.660> try<00:06:31.620> to<00:06:31.650> add<00:06:31.890> a<00:06:31.920> whole<00:06:32.190> nother

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
do yet is try to add a whole nother

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.340 
do yet is try to add a whole nother
antenna<00:06:32.940> and<00:06:33.210> a<00:06:33.270> whole<00:06:33.420> nother<00:06:33.630> circuit<00:06:34.200> yet

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
antenna and a whole nother circuit yet

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.000 
antenna and a whole nother circuit yet
and<00:06:35.420> combine<00:06:36.420> the<00:06:36.630> outputs<00:06:37.110> and<00:06:37.500> hopefully<00:06:37.980> I

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
and combine the outputs and hopefully I

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.160 
and combine the outputs and hopefully I
could<00:06:38.340> still<00:06:38.580> use<00:06:38.790> the<00:06:39.060> same<00:06:39.270> coil<00:06:39.660> and<00:06:39.840> ground

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.170 
could still use the same coil and ground

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.680 
could still use the same coil and ground
they<00:06:41.160> could<00:06:41.340> share<00:06:41.640> the<00:06:41.880> same<00:06:42.120> coil<00:06:42.450> and

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
they could share the same coil and

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.220 
they could share the same coil and
ground<00:06:43.580> so<00:06:44.580> that's<00:06:44.910> our<00:06:45.180> power<00:06:45.480> readings<00:06:45.990> for

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 
ground so that's our power readings for

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.690 
ground so that's our power readings for
now<00:06:46.730> not<00:06:47.730> much<00:06:47.970> of<00:06:48.150> squawk<00:06:48.450> about<00:06:49.310> but<00:06:50.310> we'll

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
now not much of squawk about but we'll

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.920 
now not much of squawk about but we'll
get<00:06:50.880> it<00:06:51.000> up<00:06:51.120> there<00:06:51.330> I'm<00:06:52.230> sure<00:06:52.710> of<00:06:52.920> things

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
get it up there I'm sure of things

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.240 
get it up there I'm sure of things
especially<00:06:54.930> when<00:06:55.350> we<00:06:55.440> start<00:06:55.770> figuring<00:06:56.010> out

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
especially when we start figuring out

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.940 
especially when we start figuring out
more<00:06:56.610> with<00:06:57.360> frequencies<00:06:58.170> and<00:06:58.410> getting<00:06:58.680> things

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
more with frequencies and getting things

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.790 
more with frequencies and getting things
to<00:06:59.190> resonate<00:06:59.730> here
