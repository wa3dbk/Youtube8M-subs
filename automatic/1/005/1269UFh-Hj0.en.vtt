00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.420
 the word karis is taken from the Latin language and 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.870
 means rotting and and rotting 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.110
 korres is caused by bacteria 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:16.049
 tooth diseases our body is populated 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.750
 numerous bacteria they penetrate 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.220
 in the body immediately after birth and transmitted 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.039
 man from parents and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.720
 immediate surroundings not all of these 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.730
 bacteria are harmful 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.490
 so for example bacterial flora 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.230
 bowel is vital for us in this 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.809
 case of talking about symbiosis 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.390
 other bacteria just takes 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.700
 free habitat they are called 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.050
 fireplace salame they bring us 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.780
 indirect benefit 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.270
 so for example due to the fact that on our 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.860
 cummins all 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.920
 others cannot live there 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.780
 harmful bacteria 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.270
 sometimes the host bacteria fights for 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.129
 dominant position like 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.350
 microorganisms in medicine are called 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.879
 the opportunists 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.250
 bacteria that as a result of fighting for 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.470
 dominance harm the host ie 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.619
 they win the fight called 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.390
 pathogenic bacteria 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.790
 There is a lot of different mouth 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.590
 bacteria one of them occupy a niche in 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.299
 living space obstructing 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.640
 settling this space more 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.650
 aggressive microorganisms others 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.409
 the bacteria just coexist with us 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.400
 this way bacteria live in our mouth 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.979
 symbiots 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.720
 and bacteria cummins scarlet bacterial 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.329
 the flora may however change dramatically 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.759
 when for example living conditions change 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.430
 from bacteria cummins olaf can suddenly 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.090
 develop pathogens it 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.890
 happens for example during caries people 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.710
 gets caries if at the same time 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.759
 there are some factors of which 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.790
 the most important are 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.399
 The following factors are caused by 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.740
 master plaque on the teeth so-called 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.180
 plaque time 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.090
 cofactor due to the host itself 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.759
 include all the qualities possessed 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.270
 host for example tooth anatomy composition 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.700
 saliva 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.880
 habitual way of caring for the oral cavity 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.179
 plaque this plaque formed from 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.320
 carbohydrate parts of saliva and bacteria she and 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.180
 appears if poorly cleaned 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.950
 if all these factors are bad care 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.300
 oral plaque presence and 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.820
 enough time 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.100
 accompany each other then appears 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.120
 korres 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.310
 let's take a movie trip 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.400
 inside the bacterial plaque 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.780
 it is organized as a small town so 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.250
 there are bacteria which 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.010
 specializes in making 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.630
 hold onto the tooth surface others 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.220
 bacteria supplies food 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.860
 forming pipes for transportation 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.080
 nutrient streptococci 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.540
 secrete organic acids from 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.070
 refined carbohydrates 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.830
 the latter then has a harmful effect on the tooth 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.670
 as they cause a selection of 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.950
 tooth enamel 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.730
 its minerals and 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.660
 so the plaque is comparable to a small town 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.420
 plaque formation lasts somewhere 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.610
 twenty four hours only this time 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.710
 later from the original fireplace solovey 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.560
 symbiotes form pathogens 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.170
 bacteria if there is no organization in 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.150
 plaque then oral bacteria are not dangerous 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.640
 they become such only 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.900
 organized into a mature plaque causing 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.000
 caries and periodontitis understand why 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.459
 important is effective plaque removal with 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.220
 using a dental irrigator 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.380
 floss and toothbrush since so 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.280
 way bacteria lose habitat 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.230
 and without it they do no harm 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.050
 however as soon as caries penetrates 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.930
 dentin is yellow here it begins 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.540
 resettlement of bacteria already in the day of the shadow of the bin 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.360
 ten contain proteins that serve them 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.730
 a further power source even if 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.610
 the plaque will be subsequently removed then 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.430
 stop caries is impossible caries 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.709
 gets its own pain dynamics 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.890
 appear only when Karis 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.930
 reach the dental nerve red line in 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.990
 such a case is necessary to hold 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.200
 root canal treatment since the dental nerve 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.760
 is infected with caries bacteria if 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.520
 root canal treatment performed 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.670
 poor quality then it leads even years 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.720
 later to bone inflammation in this case 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.799
 the patient often speaks of a dental focus 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.280
 not to avoid resection 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.590
 apex or tooth extraction 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.650
 it is now easier to understand how it flows 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.740
 typical dental career typical dental 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.800
 career means 50 years of crown and 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.260
 bridges partial dentures and sometimes already 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.540
 full dentures here you see 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.360
 x-rays of patients of different 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.580
 dental offices you noticed 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.680
 what do they all have as possible with you 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.620
 the so-called bad teeth themselves 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.200
 are on the side when looking at these 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.900
 pictures even to a layman it is clear that 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.470
 fillings crowns and bridges white spots on 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.919
 snapshots 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.710
 appear first on the side teeth 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.169
 why so unfortunately we often 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.850
 do not brush our teeth very carefully 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.400
 thoughts are busy with something else 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.340
 besides in whom the toothpastes creates 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.410
 a false sense of freshness at the same time 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.260
 front teeth that is the part that 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.180
 everyone can see we clean well and here 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.360
 hidden teeth often 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.300
 not enough as a result 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.580
 invisible to us on the ice first of all in 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.310
 gaps between teeth which 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.919
 causes late tooth enamel destruction 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.000
 korres and gum disease 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.060
 periodontitis 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.640
 that's why we put seals first 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.560
 on the side teeth if besides the doctor 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.440
 the substandard patient did not work 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.930
 got proper advice ie 50 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.960
 we have a side or no teeth at all or 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.990
 they are bad on the front teeth it turns out 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.870
 additional load and in 60 years already 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.479
 A full denture is typical. 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.979
 dental career 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.780
 regular and thorough oral hygiene 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.300
 quality treatment and or 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.130
 medical explanatory work 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.960
 prevents the occurrence of caries helping 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.289
 we keep our smile all the way 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.289
 old age
