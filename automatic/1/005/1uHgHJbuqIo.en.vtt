00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.240
 hello my name is evgeny drafts in i 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.400
 the protagonist of the series 9 whose life 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.110
 You can look at youtube last 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.449
 time very often started asking 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.150
 I personally have questions about understatement 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.550
 car how to make it better how much 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.130
 You made there what are your racks 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.210
 what is there how to make it soft or 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.370
 something else just i think if i 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.050
 answered these questions for money then I would 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.470
 become a millionaire believe it 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.090
 there are so many messages that I just don't 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.710
 I can even answer them all 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.530
 there is no desire to answer them therefore 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.280
 I decided today to write a separate blog 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.700
 about your personal car VAZ 2113 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.460
 which I think is a very 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.190
 worthy for our roads for our 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.550
 time for the second samara because 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.970
 many people know that she will decompose 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.030
 heavier than priors dozens of dvenashki 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.080
 I think at first to start with the suspension 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.920
 resistant spring turns here 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.350
 I have installed short-rack 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.990
 underreporting to minus 120 is that this 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.830
 means it means that my rack 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.670
 rack housing reduced ie lower 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.700
 I get a cup reduced to 12 cm 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.790
 6 centimeters and stock less than 12 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.240
 centimeters thus the rack becomes 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.070
 as if lower is less at maximum 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.020
 decreasing the spring will work 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.380
 effectively even how can you tokyo 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.450
 even better here I have oiled 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.720
 rack as the front and rear rear 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.080
 also -120 many people tell me that 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.580
 my car is somehow strange if 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.140
 you want to see how it lies 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.800
 you can really talk to 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.810
 Photo 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.030
 find in contact there are many photos 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.220
 can see why cars stand on 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.540
 slope because we have started the summer 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.010
 and we decided what we should do better 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.670
 hide the sun because very 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.600
 bakes badly 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.280
 about the springs that I have with the springs 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.410
 I get absolutely worth it 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.040
 standard vazovskie springs which 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.290
 go factory 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.630
 no there is no dolphin and god no 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.970
 some others like that but I don't like them 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.220
 because they give the car some 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.690
 stiffness is either too soft so i 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.530
 I take just the classic standard 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.549
 decoction rack 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:39.410
 from vase and just shorten in front 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:42.350
 I have shortened three and seven turns, that is 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.010
 my spring has become half that is 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.180
 what was left 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.730
 I have a shroud 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.340
 four and a half total there one of 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.290
 four and a half flowers peeped many 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.799
 I say what you need to cut 3 on 5 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.640
 but I never do this 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.650
 stuck to 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.840
 but once I lasted it decided 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.359
 gash but i got what joe 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:10.650
 lower so i'm drinking in front of 37 behind 45 and 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:14.250
 cars stand exactly even i just don't 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.109
 I really like when landing rides ass 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.909
 they have low and before all in heaven 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.579
 as if it doesnâ€™t even look there 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.169
 literally centimeter difference yes that is 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.260
 still somehow ugly and especially 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:28.319
 when the front drive turns 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.060
 you press the gas starts to leave . before 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.530
 rises and the car does not look at all 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.849
 beautifully that's why i'm drinking like this 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.090
 it turns out after I put all 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:42.090
 This suspension put all these springs 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.550
 I had my own wheels which 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.709
 usually put on AvtoVAZ this is 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:51.300
 tires at 170 you 65 to 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.099
 the car went generally everything was fine 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.700
 okay, I didn't touch anything anywhere 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.290
 It was perfect and any sunbeds can 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.510
 overcome but after i set 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.269
 rubber 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:07.830
 a profile no less than 155 by 65 car sharply 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:11.310
 just fell down she just i don't know 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.959
 congress it became impossible to drive all around 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.569
 absolutely hurt before I drove 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.049
 defenseless and here the other day for put 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.380
 defense 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.900
 because it broke through the crankcase and all the oil 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.000
 flowed well by the way noticed 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.200
 in advance what broke through and thereby 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.990
 I did not knock the engines also can still 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.880
 remind one of the fact that with such 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.460
 a strong understatement is obtained front 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.169
 part of it just squander and 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.860
 so 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:43.050
 who has 14 wheels not less than 14 wheels they 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.509
 put spacers under the ball because 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.889
 the saber that goes to the crab hurts the pulley 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:52.379
 the crankshaft thereby produces wear 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.969
 just quick so change checks in 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:57.779
 this crankshaft is very disadvantageous to us too 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:59.759
 expensive in what plus rubber that's such a 155 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:03.389
 five cars meet right away just 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.050
 mentally on the floor and not rub not the front and 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.539
 rear arches 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.400
 never is everything ok there 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.379
 space is still a lot and so how would 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.050
 I decided to put this rubber because 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:16.050
 I did not want to shift the beam and 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.839
 but did not want to do collapse like mad 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.699
 I don't like him so you can do 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:23.669
 conclusions that you need to correct 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.499
 it turns out the landing turns out the main thing 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.180
 This short-rack stand immediately say 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:28.770
 the main thing is never to cut from the tincture 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.529
 because there will be tough a lot of problems 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.050
 the second is the right washed down the springs to 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:39.360
 the car was standing exactly on the road 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:43.020
 and tires are all no principle anymore 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.719
 strongly need nothing this men in this 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.910
 you can meet 15-20 thousand peoples 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:53.270
 under the power of why I do not put air 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:56.300
 First, if we compare for some 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.220
 cream from our city principle i im 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.200
 They are not inferior because they have 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.480
 simply 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.940
 racks stand there at minus 70 so u 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.620
 they are there or they have some wheels 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.950
 huge so they just have a car 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.320
 lays down and i think that what's really 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.350
 real landing and those who are on 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.910
 ride statics a lot and not for one 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.030
 day and how the pills and go there 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.640
 for example a season or something else 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.680
 so I think that I do not see the point 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.470
 to invest in it 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.110
 it's unreasonable unreasonable let's inter there 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.060
 40,000 apple and not get from this 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.670
 generally maximum that is an understatement 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.210
 or maximum overestimate easier 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:42.500
 do like this entry for spend on 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:45.170
 15-20 things and live quietly ride I think 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.530
 about landing everything told and 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:50.540
 I would also like to dispel such as 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.840
 you are such a common stereotype about 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:56.420
 what's on the car with the landing goes 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.060
 people there non-Slavic appearance I want 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.430
 dispel this myth because on this 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.170
 car and chewing 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:05.360
 purely Russian guy there for example I have 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:09.040
 hundreds of friends who ride and 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:14.200
 they are all Russians and when they say something 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:16.150
 such as they do not go Russian and terrible 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.280
 people, I think it's wrong 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.740
 because in every nation there are fucking 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.100
 bitches fucking and worthless people all kinds of uebki 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.870
 who are near labor and everything and and 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:29.770
 Russians are such snakes 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.340
 and any general any nation at all any 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.520
 development 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.950
 so no need to think stereotypically not 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.220
 you need to be this herd that goes like 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:41.650
 then here with brain stitched on this i 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.690
 I think my story cars today 

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:48.280
 finished don't be afraid to experiment 

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:50.800
 understate sawing spring be the topic in 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:55.350
 there's nothing wrong with that so I think 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.350
 all on it so
