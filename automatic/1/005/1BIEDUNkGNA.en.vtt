00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:07.470
 Hi there, you are watching the channel diode and 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.070
 we keep playing mine kraft file 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:16.710
 single player season 2 me and another 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:21.000
 report from the stream of February 10, 2014 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.850
 but in general, I am over my farm 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.820
 the witches are here for about an hour and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.789
 firstly why am i here 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.349
 everything is simple and obvious enough but 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.630
 we fought over it some amount 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.200
 time was not quite clear why 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.690
 the company works like that there probably something 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.969
 still have to tweak possible but in 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.040
 principle can now function in 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.129
 general, the fact is that all caves here 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.430
 it is necessary or digs up all this business only 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.920
 peasant women either branch mining and compels 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.820
 everything is semi blocking but since i 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.239
 arch lucky man accordingly 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.219
 here is just a lot 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.710
 canyons in one place I've never been so much 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.280
 I have not seen more than three in my opinion here 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.560
 thing i found in general they are right here 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.540
 they him 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.500
 here here there in general here everything is 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.360
 canyons, caves, all know where this is 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.970
 feeling you can't find a cave 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.040
 in which you can pass here if 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.750
 I want to walk in the caves damn I know 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.180
 where do i do it right next to the house 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.950
 and actually put the bed here 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.890
 put the semi-blocks so that you can 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.780
 spend the night there probably next stream 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.490
 I will build a portal here so that I will not 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.130
 had to rise ward you are creepy 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.110
 long staircase 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.570
 just put the portal will connect with 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.759
 water portal well, that is the opposite 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.170
 and I will teleport 100 to 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.110
 stand on the farm some 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.869
 time as I said I am here 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.689
 about an hour let's go down 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.180
 try and at the same time the killer to edren 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.750
 mothers because i'm on my own hard 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.090
 the fall will be fatal yes a little bit 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.860
 podlagivaet vps reduces with quite 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.720
 strongly but you can live 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.060
 the only thing that annoys me sometimes 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.739
 then spawning traveling nothing 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.720
 he will not see because when here 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:21.330
 all caves are immersed in the district and their 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.880
 really a lot that's actually so yes 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:30.390
 here is spider 1 most likely not spawn 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:32.209
 somewhere somewhere on wires x or all 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.370
 it just didn't close 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:39.650
 like this place here or here 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.650
 such where this lamp is 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.830
 here now here now here now 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.390
 slept right in front of us most likely 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.450
 what is the need to look for this place 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:03:00.120
 where they can spawn fix here's another 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:02.310
 one came crawling spawn yes but so farm 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.950
 how would function and with this you can 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.310
 live you let's see what this scheme 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.500
 didn't bring a lot of effort into it 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.130
 if it will bring insufficient 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.549
 the amount of gunpowder can even be 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.680
 hammer in everything build a sand generator 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.650
 sand oak make and make heaps 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.290
 dynamite well or just digger simple 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.280
 children with the old grandfather way here 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.950
 any trash is coming 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.459
 these are the golems of which i'm there on 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.069
 the farm has leaked the bottles do not need absolutely 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.609
 sugar enough enough 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.889
 sticks a bunch of powder just a bunch of pores here 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.380
 About an hour I do not know how many there 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.269
 thousand items per hour promise 80 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.040
 half a thousand well, if so be it 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.220
 powder fall in an hour I'm basically 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.209
 pleased with the glow of stone less than gunpowder 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.220
 but nevertheless here is a lot of redstone and 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.319
 will get eyes 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:02.150
 all of this just damn it I probably 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.799
 I will leave the farm today for the night because 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.680
 i want a bunch of gunpowder gosh i want 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:11.609
 a bunch of glow stone i want a coachman stone and i 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.269
 I will be rich in the morning with all these resources 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:18.030
 and now I just have to pull 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.729
 All chests on the base of the actual resources 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.330
 hide a and firms can use in 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.400
 full height 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.130
 about unity that as i said cave 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.230
 but this 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.550
 optional in general, and some 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:33.640
 time to dispense in a tower of blocks like 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.560
 would just stand there on top and this 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.680
 will be quite enough for me by 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.740
 least so there again is this here 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:47.580
 the channel is going on yes it is 5 by ironing 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:52.510
 spider they don't get this skeleton 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.640
 loshara on this episode 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.170
 coming to an end because the last 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.100
 stream we were doing just that 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:02.470
 dug up here a pit tormented with 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.120
 the construction of the farm itself was connected here 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.880
 lighting i mean i can turn on and 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:12.120
 turn off the farm let's show and then 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:15.250
 I 'm already going upstairs to press a button 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.950
 push out the blocks glow 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.080
 lamps so they touch stone 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:24.120
 block moan blocks here absolutely not 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.560
 necessarily but I decided to make it so 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.260
 tribute to the original this is fine delusion you 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.730

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:36.780
 enable the firm how it will work on 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.310

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.940
 We will soon build a farm

 endorphins and and farm someone else there 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:49.180
