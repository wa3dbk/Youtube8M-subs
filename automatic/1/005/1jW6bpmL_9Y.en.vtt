00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.020
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.110
 woke up and we're in a news of 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.360
 xbox one and is that when good they usually 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.810
 leave the consoles at any 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.820
 generation then we wonder how much 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.160
 is going to last that console because I go back to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.740
 talk about reid and has said and commented 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.789
 in a videogamer interview that the xbox 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.470
 one can last up to 12 years this is what 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.650
 what the creators of the game think 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.230
 kinect sports rivals during this 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.470
 interview with videogamer where dan isaack 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.470
 de reid has talked about xbox one and the 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.360
 durability of the console in the market 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.269
 according to the isaac himself the study 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.059
 responsible for other kinect games 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.680
 rival sports has the opinion that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.129
 the microsoft console will last 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.589
 approximately about 12 years and says so 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.390
 as we went to e3 ya darwins com 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.519
 and we take a look at the times 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.710
 after the launch 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.010
 we just were not sure anymore 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.230
 tastes with what we were going to 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.050
 to consumers was not what 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.360
 we wanted for ourselves or for 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.840
 well of a franchise that has 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.000
 characterized we made the decision to 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.700
 delay the game what is always 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.790
 difficult and there were very few opportunities 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.360
 to be there on day 1 this console can 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.760
 last 12 years but more has affirmed in 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.580
 relationship to the life of xbox one but 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.750
 We had the feeling that what 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.250
 we had launched it was not 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:43.760
 finished so what does it say 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.590
 isaac that well that is very much 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.170
 time ahead I was consoled 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.300
 they last approximately between 10 and 12 years 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.540
 of life or at least it is durability 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.190
 that in the study itself the age and that there 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.620
 more than enough time to not 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.210
 make mistakes so you know how to 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.250
 always forming the last 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.810
 say I want you to tell me if 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.299
 you also think that this 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.050
 generation will last so long I do not 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:13.560
 I see nothing good comparing it with previous 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.780
 that lasted between 7 and 8 years I see it 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.870
 too much in ten years but good and more 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.480
 as it progresses throughout the growing 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.220
 times are going to be cut or at least 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.760
 they are going to try 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.030
 as I would say not lengthen it but of course 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.640
 have to have this hardware because 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.080
 a time no but good let's see what 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.910
 you know as always informing the last 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.560
 nike and favorites and see you in the 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.560
 next thanks for being there chao
