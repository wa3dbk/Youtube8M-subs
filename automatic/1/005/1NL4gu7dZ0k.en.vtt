00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi to all the boys and welcome back with 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.090
 pom skies 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.889
 today we are going to see a little program 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.259
 interesting so very interesting 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.809
 for our mac then patient that 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.660
 can be any mac 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.760
 I also think I am very much in Tuscany 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.740
 safe because in any case less known status 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.380
 so i don't know if you find a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.410
 hackintosh you see anyway this is it 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.189
 programmino is called sm csm si fa 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.960
 meeting and allows you to adjust 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.200
 fans of our computer 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.430
 our mac is simply precisely 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.170
 using the mouse 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.270
 so if the computer is playing 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.180
 a lot so the case is playing 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.680
 some games been a movie I'm not 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.230
 been your network by working on a 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.699
 video editing project not so co 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.270
 autocad autocad for mac however been 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.199
 engaging time he died 82 trials 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.430
 through kings and therefore I advise you to 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.540
 download this path because then 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.360
 maybe the fan does not start 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.340
 automatically normally leave 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.200
 but I advise you to download it 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.710
 in control downloaded here from the button 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.900
 download 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.210
 the site is idahc point to open it right away 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.540
 oh well let's move the application inside 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.549
 of applied our applications and it 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.280
 we open where he is here I was already 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.450
 open or excess thus centers on 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.250
 ours on ours on our desktop 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.930
 I'm writing on our bar which one 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.360
 above that I don't know what it's called but for 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.579
 patience anyway you see that there are 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.670
 enrolled degrees so at the temperature of 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.680
 professor in this case 65 degrees and then 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.659
 the speed of enrico ameri fans 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.869
 in the wind the left and right in the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.450
 my case here is precisely if we work 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.340
 we will have the possibility of 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:09.729
 just see the current speed two 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:11.170
 fans and abandoned if you want time 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.879
 not figured however you go up 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.190
 preferences and in these ne in favorit 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:21.760
 found mostly these two these 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.980
 two default modes and fire rpm that 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.940
 precisely serves the laps on the second lap at 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.299
 second minute after many laps to 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.810
 second 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.970
 however, I imposed by 3 2 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.829
 sorry I set the good ways 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.379
 in addition to default and air because 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:44.620
 default remains 2000 degrees while instead 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:47.019
 fire reach 4,000 that for four months 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.360
 and expense grants to appreciate physics 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.599
 sorry however , bayern arrives 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.810
 up to 4,000 I introduced medium that 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:59.829
 He arrives in 3000 and also cools up to 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:06.910
 5,000 and then you can mind in mind 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:08.170
 increase up to 5.000 9 40 anyway the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:15.819
 city for only then obviously not 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:17.829
 while wayne chelsea so farenheit thing 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:24.410
 here is this here if you want to see 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:28.160
 what to show on this thing 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:37.070
 thanks to the fact that more is called 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:38.800
 so let's put the cloth in excuse me anyway 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.960
 and I was saying 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.450
 so if you're jumping like you want 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.630
 well your wind and a bed 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.130
 ok some parameters if you want mine 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.050
 inter it if you want activated only 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.990
 when the battery is attached or 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:58.340
 I don't know what to do again anyway 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:01.010
 it is precisely this once you skip these 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.020
 parameters here you can choose the 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.570
 how to run the fans 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.040
 default you see that the fans here have 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:12.640
 written a lot small however they arrive 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:20.900
 comes to dominate at 2100 rpm 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:29.710
 but I think I know what it can be 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:29.710
 call for a moment on the fly rpm rpm ie 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.360
 revolution although minimal precisely i 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.880
 rpm 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.550
 sorry, however, here if this is precisely the 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.590
 your default value is your da 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.690
 values issued depressed because it is not 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.000
 engaging motogp one however is 65 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.530
 grades so I 'll take it to medium then 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.840
 when the star or for example giovanna di 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.730
 hubble between a very very nice game 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.520
 it is not particularly challenging in the 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.710
 graphics card however the temperature 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.000
 it can even reach 80 degrees e 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.860
 so I advise you to increase 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.590
 quickly in your computer and 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.920
 citing precisely on 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.290
 yes yes yes higher value because we have 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.200
 and then they returned to 5,000 49 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.560
 revolutions per minute and therefore this is not 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.090
 all guys 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.440
 the other gravina interests 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.430
 an interesting application remained 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:29.070
 mind that will enable then not talk about it 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:31.810
 so it's all for any doubt 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:35.100
 contact me so much I'm here 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.100
 See you soon
