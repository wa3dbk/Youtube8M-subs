 nanometers of oil pressure

 complete the interior panoply but the 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.020
 most beautiful piece remains his elite 6

 golf engine captivates the senses a 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.969
 real fury capable of throbbing at 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.439
 7000 rpm is a diet up to 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.710
 there reserved for race mechanics 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.240
 in 1982 and what music she 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.590
 boiler well helped by his excellent 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.729
 5-speed gearbox 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.950
 this golf in hell and the most 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.460
 performant of the three with a 0 to 100 in 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.420
 7 seconds 6 % 95 km h peak 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.240
 all with a behavior 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.509
 deliciously vintage with 7.9 the year 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.189
 and its depreciation rather equally 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.229
 without power steering like the 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.080
 golf gt turbo asked brave lumberjack 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.729
 in maneuver but not on the road to 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.679
 soul and 2000 minute rpm the little 1 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.630
 liter 4 are getting stronger and stronger 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.180
 with a big turbo before sitting down 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.860
 a little after 5000 rpm 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.110
 embellished with escapades 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.970
 agile and precise the train before crate 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.579
 pretty cool and the rear knew before 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.769
 to keep quiet wisely with his 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.030
 flexible motor like an elastic the 205 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.860
 gti is gentle 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.569
 but at the time of raising the pace the 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.310
 precise steering and the front axle 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.299
 sharpened allow to jump to the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.739
 rope 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.989
 suddenly the back for mobile is 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.850
 watch like milk on fire then 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.739
 yes this 205 is certainly the most 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.989
 demanding but also the most rewarding 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.109
 and the most effective for who knows 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.250
 exploit his exceptional chassis 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.230
 true bath of youth despite their 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.090
 twenty spring sometimes well enough this 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.769
 brelan d'a gives you a smile and 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.100
 a real pleasure and strings behind the 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.019
 flying 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.540
 facing sportswomen today more 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.299
 sanitized impossible to choose between the 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.220
 chassis the 205 the turbo effect the super 5 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.250
 or race mechanics and scarcity 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.000
 of golf gti 16s so finally I 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.000
 go back with the rights
