are see ARX 160 160 more 16 mm which
looks<00:01:21.150> quite<00:01:21.450> interesting<00:01:22.759> by<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> way<00:01:23.970> I'm

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
looks quite interesting by the way I'm

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.660 
looks quite interesting by the way I'm
no<00:01:24.240> gun<00:01:24.540> specialist<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.799> no<00:01:26.100> idea<00:01:26.280> what

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
no gun specialist so I have no idea what

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.670 
no gun specialist so I have no idea what
these<00:01:26.790> guns<00:01:27.060> are<00:01:27.240> unless<00:01:27.900> I've<00:01:28.110> seen<00:01:28.439> them<00:01:28.590> in

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
these guns are unless I've seen them in

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.850 
these guns are unless I've seen them in
the<00:01:28.770> game<00:01:28.890> before<00:01:29.720> then<00:01:30.720> there's<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.259> tar-21

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the game before then there's the tar-21

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.890 
the game before then there's the tar-21
which<00:01:32.340> obviously<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.970> seen<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.390> modern

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
which obviously was seen in modern

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.370 
which obviously was seen in modern
warfare<00:01:34.229> 2<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.189> i<00:01:35.490> believe<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.090> tar<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:37.229> in

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
warfare 2 and i believe the tar was in

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.080 
warfare 2 and i believe the tar was in
black<00:01:37.530> ops<00:01:37.680> 2<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.220> i<00:01:38.369> don't<00:01:38.670> play<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> games

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
black ops 2 but i don't play the games

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.210 
black ops 2 but i don't play the games
that<00:01:39.240> don't<00:01:39.420> quote<00:01:39.600> me<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.979> then<00:01:40.979> there's

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
that don't quote me on that then there's

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.260 
that don't quote me on that then there's
the<00:01:41.310> fal<00:01:42.110> dsw<00:01:43.110> or<00:01:43.320> FAL<00:01:43.890> sa<00:01:44.729> 50<00:01:45.180> 80<00:01:45.540> s<00:01:46.020> W<00:01:47.060> which<00:01:48.060> is

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the fal dsw or FAL sa 50 80 s W which is

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.910 
the fal dsw or FAL sa 50 80 s W which is
pretty<00:01:48.420> much<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.659> same<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:49.110> which<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.500> been

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
pretty much the same one which is been

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.399 
pretty much the same one which is been
in<00:01:50.750> black<00:01:51.750> ops<00:01:51.899> 2<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.380> modern<00:01:53.040> warfare<00:01:53.270> two

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
in black ops 2 and modern warfare two

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.109 
in black ops 2 and modern warfare two
obviously<00:01:55.409> black<00:01:56.100> ops<00:01:56.310> was<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> bit<00:01:56.700> for<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
obviously black ops was a bit for a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.899 
obviously black ops was a bit for a
different<00:01:57.479> time<00:01:57.600> era<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.020> same<00:01:58.290> kind<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.590> gun

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
different time era but same kind of gun

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.429 
different time era but same kind of gun
then<00:01:59.909> there's<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.149> aps<00:02:00.600> underwater<00:02:01.079> assault

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
then there's the aps underwater assault

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.969 
then there's the aps underwater assault
rifle<00:02:01.770> which<00:02:02.399> looks<00:02:02.820> fairly<00:02:03.689> interesting<00:02:04.469> so

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
rifle which looks fairly interesting so

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.330 
rifle which looks fairly interesting so
I<00:02:05.009> don't<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.310> ever<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:07.560> know

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
I don't know ever that just be you know

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
actually in the mall Erik as if it's in

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.790 
actually in the mall Erik as if it's in
the<00:02:12.360> morgue<00:02:12.599> lair<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.140> should<00:02:13.349> mean<00:02:13.530> that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the morgue lair that should mean that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.210 
the morgue lair that should mean that
there<00:02:14.129> is<00:02:14.250> underwater<00:02:14.879> maps<00:02:15.239> which<00:02:15.840> will<00:02:16.050> be

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
there is underwater maps which will be

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.580 
there is underwater maps which will be
interesting<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.250> say<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.879> least<00:02:18.440> by<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.500> way

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
interesting to say the least by the way

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.650 
interesting to say the least by the way
these<00:02:19.709> are<00:02:19.890> odious<00:02:20.220> our<00:02:20.400> rivals<00:02:20.760> mmm<00:02:21.180> then

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
these are odious our rivals mmm then

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.259 
these are odious our rivals mmm then
there<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.110> m4a1<00:02:22.920> which<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.879> a<00:02:23.970> possible

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
there is the m4a1 which is a possible

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.690 
there is the m4a1 which is a possible
place<00:02:24.450> holder<00:02:24.750> which<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.560> gun<00:02:26.190> identical

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
place holder which is the gun identical

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.589 
place holder which is the gun identical
to<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.970> one<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.209> modern<00:02:27.780> warfare<00:02:27.930> free<00:02:29.599> then

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
to the one in modern warfare free then

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.210 
to the one in modern warfare free then
we're<00:02:30.780> going<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.930> move<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.379> SMGs<00:02:31.950> which

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
we're going to move on to the SMGs which

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.589 
we're going to move on to the SMGs which
there<00:02:32.430> are<00:02:32.549> only<00:02:32.670> two<00:02:32.879> of<00:02:33.000> them<00:02:33.150> at<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.299> moment

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
there are only two of them at the moment

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.660 
there are only two of them at the moment
and<00:02:33.690> that's<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.349> end<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.099> weapon<00:02:35.340> list

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
and that's the end of this weapon list

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.309 
and that's the end of this weapon list
but<00:02:35.879> remember<00:02:36.209> it's<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.450> work<00:02:36.629> in<00:02:36.720> progress<00:02:36.930> so

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
but remember it's a work in progress so

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.800 
but remember it's a work in progress so
soon<00:02:37.560> as<00:02:37.680> it's<00:02:37.799> updated<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.340> will<00:02:38.700> be<00:02:38.940> making<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
soon as it's updated I will be making a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.559 
soon as it's updated I will be making a
new<00:02:39.930> video<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.290> inform<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.769> new<00:02:41.130> weapons

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
new video to inform you of new weapons

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.880 
new video to inform you of new weapons
okay<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.590> let's<00:02:43.769> go<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:45.299> ump45<00:02:46.079> which<00:02:46.650> was

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
okay so let's go the ump45 which was

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.580 
okay so let's go the ump45 which was
seeing<00:02:47.599> sorry<00:02:48.599> Bella<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:48.959> was<00:02:49.110> assisting<00:02:49.500> my

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
seeing sorry Bella I was assisting my

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.220 
seeing sorry Bella I was assisting my
ear<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.920> had<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.069> move<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.310> mic<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:51.599> ump45

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
ear so I had to move the mic the ump45

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.400 
ear so I had to move the mic the ump45
which<00:02:52.680> was<00:02:52.860> seen<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.160> modern<00:02:53.280> warfare<00:02:53.430> 2<00:02:53.849> and

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
which was seen in modern warfare 2 and

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.300 
which was seen in modern warfare 2 and
what<00:02:55.410> were<00:02:55.560> for<00:02:55.680> free<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:58.170> know<00:02:58.290> that's<00:02:58.500> an

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
what were for free so you know that's an

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.309 
what were for free so you know that's an
old<00:02:59.579> one<00:02:59.700> for<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.209> modern<00:03:00.690> warfare<00:03:00.900> sorry

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
old one for the modern warfare sorry

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.750 
old one for the modern warfare sorry
it's<00:03:01.440> at<00:03:01.530> least<00:03:01.650> but<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.069> guess<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:02.610> going

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
it's at least but I guess it's going

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.190 
it's at least but I guess it's going
back<00:03:02.910> for<00:03:03.060> ghosts<00:03:03.420> which<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:03.870> always<00:03:04.019> good

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
back for ghosts which is always good

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.350 
back for ghosts which is always good
then<00:03:04.620> there's<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.010> Kriss<00:03:05.340> vector<00:03:05.519> which<00:03:06.180> is

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
then there's the Kriss vector which is

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.240 
then there's the Kriss vector which is
basically<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.959> same<00:03:06.989> vector<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.890> was<00:03:08.069> in

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
basically the same vector that was in

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.890 
basically the same vector that was in
but<00:03:08.879> I<00:03:08.970> hope<00:03:09.120> still<00:03:09.329> I<00:03:09.420> believe<00:03:09.629> there<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.840> a

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
but I hope still I believe there is a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.449 
but I hope still I believe there is a
vector<00:03:10.049> of<00:03:10.170> black<00:03:10.379> ops<00:03:10.500> 2<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.799> I'm<00:03:11.190> modern

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
vector of black ops 2 and I'm modern

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.539 
vector of black ops 2 and I'm modern
warfare<00:03:11.610> 2<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.780> know<00:03:13.139> it's<00:03:14.100> kind<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
warfare 2 so you know it's kind of the

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.000 
warfare 2 so you know it's kind of the
same<00:03:14.730> thing<00:03:15.090> so<00:03:16.019> that's<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.380> for<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.650> weapons

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
same thing so that's it for the weapons

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.250 
same thing so that's it for the weapons
at<00:03:17.489> least<00:03:17.730> but<00:03:18.209> what<00:03:18.389> do<00:03:18.600> what<00:03:18.810> weapons<00:03:19.079> do<00:03:19.200> you

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
at least but what do what weapons do you

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.140 
at least but what do what weapons do you
want<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.560> see<00:03:19.680> do<00:03:19.889> you<00:03:19.980> want<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.190> see<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.609> old

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
want to see do you want to see the old

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.599 
want to see do you want to see the old
ones<00:03:21.569> which<00:03:21.780> were<00:03:21.810> in<00:03:22.560> modern<00:03:23.130> warfare<00:03:23.280> free

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
ones which were in modern warfare free

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.229 
ones which were in modern warfare free
or<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.810> old<00:03:24.959> ones<00:03:25.290> while<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.700> newest<00:03:27.030> ones

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
or the old ones while the newest ones

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.690 
or the old ones while the newest ones
which<00:03:27.510> are<00:03:27.660> in<00:03:27.840> black<00:03:28.380> ops<00:03:28.560> 2<00:03:28.829> because<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.579> mean

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
which are in black ops 2 because I mean

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.979 
which are in black ops 2 because I mean
it's<00:03:29.849> that<00:03:29.940> in<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.120> future<00:03:30.239> but<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.720> don't<00:03:30.900> know

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
it's that in the future but I don't know

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.349 
it's that in the future but I don't know
how<00:03:31.109> far<00:03:31.380> in<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.560> future<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:32.040> haven't<00:03:33.030> really

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
how far in the future I haven't really

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.080 
how far in the future I haven't really
spent<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.959> lot<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.139> time<00:03:34.230> looking<00:03:34.590> at<00:03:34.889> this<00:03:35.099> game

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
spent a lot of time looking at this game

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.890
