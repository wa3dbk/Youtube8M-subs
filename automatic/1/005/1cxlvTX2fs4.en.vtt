00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 today the battle we all participate to 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:11.160
 the accent we take the fret of the prior sedan 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.530
 hatchback as you can see no difference well, let's start 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.250
 on us frets priors as you see this 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.720
 modern domestic car 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.970
 sorry that such different angles plus y 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.850
 I'm always the owner of the car drive off 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.390
 I didn't take anything from her but you 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.210
 the master got stuck in there under a little 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.940
 tell about the advantages and disadvantages 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.450
 priors about the very first major flaw 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.750
 this is a big enough gap 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.100
 which can push the optical finger 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.489
 not even one but several 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.440
 about the shortcomings can talk forever 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.399
 so let's go to 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.559
 a few dignity of course 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.920
 the most important advantage is 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.770
 engine power of this car is like 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.949
 I would be the focus here was not standing next to type 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.260
 of course she will break well anyway 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.890
 almost any accent would be me 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.760
 jupiter only draws complete of course 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.409
 only now we go to the test 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.210
 the hosts of real men were sent to 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.759
 rude form take me a walk therefore 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.430
 will have to use 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.770
 photos I think it's okay to 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.810
 speed does not affect 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.080
 well, so we see us dynamic 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.700
 combination of combined super devices 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.430
 modern ones like cassette deck 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:40.850
 for example whether the built-in clock 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:45.079
 do not work normally and so let's say 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.090
 semi modern instrument panel 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.970
 as we see from priory skype least 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:57.240
 very different therefore as if in this 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:01.250
 sbu discrimination then housing lights all 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.250
 so so if you 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.190
 hesitated that he buy fret priora 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.660
 leaps and I in your place would take 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.660
 fret grant
