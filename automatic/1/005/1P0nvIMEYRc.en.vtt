00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.750
 I am out of focus and I wrote the children's book week gift this year 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.439
 breakage of the sprout 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.519
 in addition, the telegraaf wrote sandwiches and other food items 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.929
 a book that has everything to do with food and drink 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.339
 it's not for nothing that the children's book week has the theme on 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.339
 eat a table and eat in children's books 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.339
 for my books fines know everything about the ether 9 by a lot 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:31.439
 experts 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.439
 like here 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.020
 click here in the restaurant of the future in wageningen 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.329
 it may look like a company canteen ordinary canteen 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.140
 but that is not the haircut because everything and then everything that I will go 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.810
 food 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.930
 that is filmed through choir cameras 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.820
 everything for everything is tracked of how often I can also what I did 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.170
 what i don't know 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.600
 what I like 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.490
 and that does not only apply to me but that applies to everyone present here 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.300
 this restaurant 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.750
 all that information that is jointly managed 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.730
 so if i have anything about it 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.740
 food is a bit tasty just isn't tasty then find out 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.740
 in it 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.550
 and I am not here when the dentist is still in wageningen 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.800
 but see here thijssen well actually not as much as possible but the chain too 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.800
 for example, here comes a certain odor 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.730
 maybe they will provide us with wind energy tubes and 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.370
 osn then she gets for example or if you something close the quiet tractebel 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.910
 rented from blissful or see your teeth that would taste in your food 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.700
 funny if you use the same amount of salt 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.300
 it didn't count chatinier i think you wouldn't need that at all 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.109
 this works the same with sound 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:11.620
 So you have discovered that if you like the sound of crackling spectacle 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:14.319
 answer you also need more piece 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.319
 this way your senses sometimes fool you 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.689
 I'm sitting here in a kind of bare meter 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:31.049
 in the collective labor agreement of the human being healed how much how often you keep cold and whether you like 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.699
 cold instantly dead 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:35.380
 all school species 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.439
 so you can come here on the cards to get in your mouth 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.620
 and on those ride-along viewers, for example, how often you can eat a piece of cheese 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.049
 until that diagnosis 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.589
 and method of chewing and dusting it is therefore possible to make ma 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.839
 well I hope to find out more about this and I succeeded now 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:18.049
 much much more I now know, for example, why children do not like vegetables 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.299
 then find fruit 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.139
 I also do not know why you like things and that it is not only with 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.259
 what you taste in your mouth 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:29.059
 that also has to do with color that it has to do with sound it has to do with 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.659
 wimp 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:30.869
 that you put in your mouth 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:32.589
 must have to do 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:35.449
 and I haven't discovered anything yet, click here for a nice meal
