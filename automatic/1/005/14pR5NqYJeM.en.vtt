I'm going to talk to you about
non-surgical<00:00:10.500> facial<00:00:10.740> rejuvenation<00:00:11.240> very

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
non-surgical facial rejuvenation very

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.570 
non-surgical facial rejuvenation very
often<00:00:12.660> we<00:00:13.230> get<00:00:13.410> people<00:00:13.710> coming<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.429> us

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
often we get people coming in to us

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.939 
often we get people coming in to us
saying<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.480> they<00:00:15.690> just<00:00:15.719> want<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.440> freshen<00:00:16.680> up

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
saying that they just want to freshen up

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.800 
saying that they just want to freshen up
with<00:00:17.220> their<00:00:17.400> look<00:00:17.640> they're<00:00:18.060> not<00:00:18.180> exactly<00:00:18.570> sure

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
with their look they're not exactly sure

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.330 
with their look they're not exactly sure
what<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.560> they're<00:00:19.710> not<00:00:19.890> happy<00:00:20.250> about

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
what it is that they're not happy about

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.279 
what it is that they're not happy about
with<00:00:20.670> their<00:00:20.850> face<00:00:21.029> but<00:00:21.330> maybe<00:00:21.510> they<00:00:21.810> feel<00:00:22.080> that

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
with their face but maybe they feel that

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.099 
with their face but maybe they feel that
they<00:00:22.410> look<00:00:22.590> tired<00:00:22.920> or<00:00:23.340> they<00:00:23.820> look<00:00:24.000> cranky<00:00:24.960> or

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
they look tired or they look cranky or

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.500 
they look tired or they look cranky or
their<00:00:25.289> skin<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.949> not<00:00:26.550> behaving<00:00:26.730> how<00:00:27.150> they<00:00:27.300> like

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
their skin is not behaving how they like

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.290 
their skin is not behaving how they like
so<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.769> tend<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.310> take<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> holistic

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
so we tend to just take a holistic

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.810 
so we tend to just take a holistic
approach<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> face<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.160> look<00:00:32.369> at<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
approach to the face and look at all the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.510 
approach to the face and look at all the
different<00:00:32.969> components<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
different components that we can do a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.040 
different components that we can do a
little<00:00:35.730> bit<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.000> work<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.210> will<00:00:36.600> help<00:00:36.780> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
little bit of work that will help to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.979 
little bit of work that will help to
freshen<00:00:37.440> up<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.890> whole<00:00:38.129> overall<00:00:38.670> appearance

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
freshen up the whole overall appearance

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.750 
freshen up the whole overall appearance

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
face and look at different aspects that

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.740 
face and look at different aspects that
we<00:00:46.710> may<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:46.950> able<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.430> work<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.879> either<00:00:48.450> with

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
we may be able to work on either with

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.380 
we may be able to work on either with
anti<00:00:49.079> wrinkle<00:00:49.260> injections<00:00:50.000> dermal<00:00:51.000> fillers

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
laser treatment or perhaps even

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.459 
laser treatment or perhaps even
radiofrequency<00:00:56.300> removal<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.449> lumps<00:00:58.320> and

radiofrequency removal of lumps and

moles so when I'm looking at somebody's
face<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.910> break<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.390> down<00:01:03.629> into

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
face I like to break it down into

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.070 
face I like to break it down into
different<00:01:04.580> components<00:01:05.580> first<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.450> all<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.630> have

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
different components first of all I have

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.120 
different components first of all I have
a<00:01:07.110> look<00:01:07.409> at<00:01:07.680> lines<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.790> expression<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.040> we

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
a look at lines of expression so that we

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.770 
a look at lines of expression so that we
could<00:01:11.280> perhaps<00:01:11.460> work<00:01:11.850> with<00:01:12.119> anti<00:01:12.600> wrinkle

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
could perhaps work with anti wrinkle

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.830 
could perhaps work with anti wrinkle
injections<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.830> first<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.880> all<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.509> having

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
injections and first of all just having

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
whole lot there in terms of strong

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.429 
whole lot there in terms of strong

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.319 
Yvonne's had some anti wrinkle
injections<00:01:55.500> before<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.460> her<00:01:56.640> frown<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
injections before in her frown but you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.639 
injections before in her frown but you
can<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.659> there's<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.899> little<00:01:58.140> bit<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.469> movement

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
can see there's a little bit of movement

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.620 
can see there's a little bit of movement
coming<00:01:59.070> back<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.670> perhaps<00:01:59.790> like<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.119> soften

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
coming back so it perhaps like to soften

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.249 
coming back so it perhaps like to soften
that<00:02:00.780> as<00:02:00.990> well<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.060> nice<00:02:03.240> cheesy<00:02:03.600> smile<00:02:03.960> for

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
that as well and a nice cheesy smile for

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.289 
that as well and a nice cheesy smile for
me<00:02:04.469> you've<00:02:05.460> almost<00:02:05.729> certainly<00:02:05.909> got<00:02:06.270> some

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
me you've almost certainly got some

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.900 
me you've almost certainly got some
lines<00:02:06.810> coming<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.439> around<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.610> crow's

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
lines coming in around the the crow's

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.420 
lines coming in around the the crow's
feet<00:02:08.940> area<00:02:09.629> again<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.709> don't<00:02:10.890> like<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.250> wipe

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
feet area again I don't like to wipe

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.280 
feet area again I don't like to wipe
these<00:02:11.640> out<00:02:11.910> completely<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.690> think<00:02:12.959> we<00:02:13.110> can

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
these out completely but I think we can

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.880 
these out completely but I think we can
soften

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
soften

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.800 
soften
so<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.430> she's<00:02:14.610> still<00:02:14.880> got<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> lovely<00:02:15.360> smile

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
so that she's still got a lovely smile

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.480 
so that she's still got a lovely smile
and<00:02:16.020> her<00:02:16.110> eyes<00:02:16.290> still<00:02:16.590> sparkle<00:02:17.190> when<00:02:17.280> she

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
and her eyes still sparkle when she

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.010 
and her eyes still sparkle when she
smiles<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.120> lines<00:02:18.330> are<00:02:18.540> just<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.780> little

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
smiles but the lines are just a little

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.360 
smiles but the lines are just a little
bit<00:02:19.110> softer<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.590> lower<00:02:22.770> half<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.220> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
bit softer and in the lower half of the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.220 
bit softer and in the lower half of the
face<00:02:23.550> we<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.300> use<00:02:24.510> anti-wrinkle<00:02:25.170> injections

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
face we can use anti-wrinkle injections

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.890 
face we can use anti-wrinkle injections
just<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.100> soften<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.700> pool<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.240> these<00:02:27.420> muscles

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
just to soften the pool of these muscles

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.870 
just to soften the pool of these muscles
here<00:02:28.110> which<00:02:28.260> contend<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.010> cause<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.520> little

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
here which contend to cause that little

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.670 
here which contend to cause that little
fold<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.660> we<00:02:30.780> get<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.170> corner<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
fold that we get in the corner of the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.330 
fold that we get in the corner of the
mouth<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.240> also<00:02:33.240> in<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:34.020> chin<00:02:34.320> just<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.160> can

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
mouth and also in the chin just you can

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.880 
mouth and also in the chin just you can
see<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:36.090> evens<00:02:36.810> are<00:02:37.020> starting<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.680> get<00:02:37.830> a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
see that evens are starting to get a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.220 
see that evens are starting to get a
little<00:02:38.130> bit<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.520> fold<00:02:38.850> in<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.810> above<00:02:40.080> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
little bit of a fold in just above the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.590 
little bit of a fold in just above the
chin<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:40.980> we<00:02:41.100> can<00:02:41.250> actually<00:02:41.430> use<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> little<00:02:42.510> bit

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
chin so we can actually use a little bit

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.000 
chin so we can actually use a little bit
of<00:02:42.660> anti-wrinkle<00:02:43.290> injection<00:02:43.739> there<00:02:43.890> which

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
of anti-wrinkle injection there which

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.820 
of anti-wrinkle injection there which
relaxes<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.700> muscle<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.830> actually

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
relaxes the muscle and that actually

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.770 
relaxes the muscle and that actually
softens<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.459> opens<00:02:47.970> out<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.270> face<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.720> it

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
softens and opens out the face and it

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.050 
softens and opens out the face and it
has<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.959> younger<00:02:49.739> fresher<00:02:50.160> look<00:02:50.430> as<00:02:50.580> well<00:02:50.790> and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
has a younger fresher look as well and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.540 
has a younger fresher look as well and
the<00:02:51.570> next<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:52.140> all<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.320> like<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.769> look<00:02:52.890> at<00:02:53.070> facial

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
the next of all I like to look at facial

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.479 
the next of all I like to look at facial
volume<00:02:53.700> as<00:02:54.150> we<00:02:54.870> age<00:02:55.050> we<00:02:55.080> all<00:02:55.709> lose<00:02:55.980> weight<00:02:56.310> from

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
volume as we age we all lose weight from

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.930 
volume as we age we all lose weight from
the<00:02:56.700> face<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:58.200> often<00:02:58.739> happens<00:02:59.070> probably<00:02:59.820> from

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
the face it often happens probably from

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.660 
the face it often happens probably from
about<00:03:00.000> mid<00:03:00.390> 30s<00:03:00.900> onwards<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.650> doesn't<00:03:02.550> matter

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
about mid 30s onwards and doesn't matter

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.800 
about mid 30s onwards and doesn't matter
what's<00:03:02.940> happening<00:03:03.269> with<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.450> weight<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:03.630> the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
what's happening with the weight in the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.150 
what's happening with the weight in the
rest<00:03:04.019> of<00:03:04.170> your<00:03:04.260> body<00:03:04.410> I've<00:03:04.680> got<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.890> theory

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
rest of your body I've got a theory

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.770 
rest of your body I've got a theory
sometimes<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.700> goes<00:03:05.850> south<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.150> multiplies

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
sometimes it goes south and multiplies

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.020 
sometimes it goes south and multiplies
when<00:03:07.470> we<00:03:07.620> start<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.130> lose<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.580> fat<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:08.910> the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
when we start to lose the fat in the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.810 
when we start to lose the fat in the
face<00:03:09.239> what<00:03:09.840> happens<00:03:10.170> is<00:03:10.320> we<00:03:10.440> start<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.950> get<00:03:11.310> the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
face what happens is we start to get the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.120 
face what happens is we start to get the
appearance<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.720> these<00:03:13.170> lines<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:14.010> are

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
appearance of these lines that are

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.670 
appearance of these lines that are
coming<00:03:14.400> down<00:03:14.610> like<00:03:15.209> diagonal<00:03:15.870> stripes<00:03:16.260> coming

down<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.190> face<00:03:17.510> what<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.720> tends<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.170> do

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
down in the face what that tends to do

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.490 
down in the face what that tends to do
is<00:03:19.320> it<00:03:19.829> draws<00:03:20.160> your<00:03:20.430> eye<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:21.209> those<00:03:21.420> lines<00:03:21.870> it's

up when you're looking at a face you
want<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.840> bring<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.230> attention<00:03:34.680> up<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.850> the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
want to bring the attention up to the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.420 
want to bring the attention up to the
eyes<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.959> personality<00:03:37.410> rather<00:03:38.160> than

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
eyes to the personality rather than

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.199 
eyes to the personality rather than
seeing<00:03:38.700> these<00:03:38.940> lines<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.660> are<00:03:39.900> drawing<00:03:40.440> down

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
seeing these lines that are drawing down

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.720 
seeing these lines that are drawing down
so<00:03:42.209> what<00:03:43.170> we<00:03:43.350> need<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.620> do<00:03:44.040> or<00:03:44.430> what<00:03:44.489> we<00:03:44.610> can

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
so what we need to do or what we can

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.750 
so what we need to do or what we can
look<00:03:44.970> at<00:03:45.150> doing<00:03:45.360> is<00:03:45.739> replacing<00:03:46.739> volume<00:03:47.190> so

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
look at doing is replacing volume so

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.449 
look at doing is replacing volume so
that<00:03:47.970> we're<00:03:48.150> just<00:03:48.660> disguising<00:03:49.530> these<00:03:50.130> lines

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
that we're just disguising these lines

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.390 
that we're just disguising these lines
very<00:03:51.299> subtly<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.230> bringing<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:53.010> bit<00:03:53.220> more

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
very subtly and bringing a bit more

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.270 
very subtly and bringing a bit more
volume<00:03:53.640> back<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.420> cheek<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:55.070> that<00:03:56.070> the

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
volume back to the cheek so that the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.930 
volume back to the cheek so that the
light<00:03:56.610> hits<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.540> face<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.079> bounces<00:03:58.920> up<00:03:59.160> so

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
light hits the face and bounces up so

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.580 
light hits the face and bounces up so
that<00:04:00.120> we're<00:04:00.269> drawn<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.140> part<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.530> the

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
that we're drawn to that part of the

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.360 
that we're drawn to that part of the
face<00:04:02.450> taking<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.540> look<00:04:03.750> at<00:04:03.959> Evon<00:04:04.350> skin<00:04:04.829> there's

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
face taking a look at Evon skin there's

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.520 
face taking a look at Evon skin there's
a<00:04:05.519> few<00:04:05.910> things<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:06.660> I<00:04:06.690> would<00:04:06.930> like<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.350> work

a little bit of sun damage which we can
also<00:04:24.990> work<00:04:25.349> on<00:04:25.530> with<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.890> laser

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
can actually do all of them in a very

can actually do all of them in a very
short<00:04:38.580> space<00:04:38.850> of<00:04:38.910> time<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.900> get<00:04:40.230> a<00:04:40.260> total<00:04:40.920> sort

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
short space of time and get a total sort

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.090 
short space of time and get a total sort
of<00:04:41.640> rejuvenation<00:04:42.390> in<00:04:42.720> in<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.530> short<00:04:43.800> period<00:04:43.980> of

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
of rejuvenation in in a short period of

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.430 
of rejuvenation in in a short period of
time<00:04:44.160> or<00:04:44.460> you<00:04:45.000> can<00:04:45.270> actually<00:04:45.750> pick<00:04:46.020> which

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
time or you can actually pick which

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.050 
time or you can actually pick which
little<00:04:46.710> bits<00:04:46.920> that<00:04:47.040> you<00:04:47.190> want<00:04:47.370> to<00:04:47.490> focus<00:04:47.700> on

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
little bits that you want to focus on

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.660 
little bits that you want to focus on
and<00:04:48.300> just<00:04:48.750> do<00:04:49.020> them<00:04:49.290> you<00:04:49.710> know<00:04:49.860> a<00:04:49.890> few<00:04:50.190> weeks<00:04:50.370> at

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
and just do them you know a few weeks at

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.820 
and just do them you know a few weeks at
a<00:04:50.700> time<00:04:50.760> and<00:04:50.970> actually<00:04:51.660> improve<00:04:52.080> the

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
a time and actually improve the

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.010 
a time and actually improve the
appearance<00:04:53.340> over<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.090> period<00:04:54.420> of<00:04:54.720> several

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
appearance over a period of several

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.500 
appearance over a period of several
months<00:04:55.400> it's<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.550> slow<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.120> steady<00:04:57.210> approach

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
months it's the slow and steady approach

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.190 
months it's the slow and steady approach
so<00:04:58.170> it's<00:04:58.200> really<00:04:58.650> very<00:04:59.310> much<00:04:59.580> based<00:04:59.910> on<00:05:00.210> what

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
so it's really very much based on what

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.990 
so it's really very much based on what
you<00:05:01.380> want<00:05:01.620> to<00:05:01.740> achieve<00:05:01.860> what<00:05:02.730> sort<00:05:02.970> of

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
you want to achieve what sort of

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.600 
you want to achieve what sort of
timeframe<00:05:03.300> how<00:05:04.080> much<00:05:04.260> downtime<00:05:04.890> you<00:05:04.920> want<00:05:05.310> all

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
timeframe how much downtime you want all

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.880 
timeframe how much downtime you want all
of<00:05:05.670> those<00:05:06.030> factors<00:05:06.570> are<00:05:06.720> part<00:05:07.230> of<00:05:07.410> what<00:05:07.860> we

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
of those factors are part of what we

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.440 
of those factors are part of what we
take<00:05:08.190> into<00:05:08.520> consideration

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
take into consideration

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.580 
take into consideration
