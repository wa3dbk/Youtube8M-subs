Here at the end of grain it crumbles, but here after its good.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I think we need a thinner shaft

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
thinner?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and all is going well, but...

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.500

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
