00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 Talk to me, same video and good. 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.240
 today this video I wanna show 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.929
 you do not know yet or for 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.790
 Who knows if I do not know how to look there? 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.890
 but I do not know how much 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.180
 People already know, a lot of people do not know. 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:26.820
 how to modify the spray of the game because 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:31.050
 how to take where the game spray is 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.059
 in fact it just seems like pratt the others do not 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.190
 they can see the modification of the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.780
 you did your spray but I do not like 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.730
 to know if most people are 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.989
 people know how to do or do not know 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.870
 so I'll explain to those who do not 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.670
 know how to modify the spray of the game to 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.800
 to seal a little modify the game is 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.739
 cooler everything feels better and by 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.360
 example here I modified the spray to 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:01.500
 stay at taiga no I think this rate 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.939
 arrives the isaca of the anime taker that is 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.200
 what I 'm looking at now and I'll go 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.630
 explain to you how you are going 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.450
 modify your spray 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.180
 so let's go good first that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.060
 you download the paint.net program 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.450
 What is this program that I'm going to leave? 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.070
 in description download link for it 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.930
 after downloading the paint.net program 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.650
 extra flights on it to the area 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.049
 It works and is for now that's all 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.020
 then you see here on the crash icon 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.420
 fine click with the right button or 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.540
 chin firewall or open local 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:45.090
 file is there you go in the square rui after 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.950
 in the spray folder here will have several 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.290
 mirrors of the game will be priced not 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.070
 There's another 3/3 game in the game. 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.770
 I have to choose some 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.590
 I modified in case choose the spray and 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.880
 42 which is the spray of the zeno mutant that has 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.619
 in the store to buy 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.270
 so today you know a spray and 42 and it goes 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.119
 open a little screen if you already have 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.709
 downloaded paint.net you can see that 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.360
 the spray that I left in the game he already 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.420
 is here but he will be with a 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.330
 image of the 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.580
 what they are going to do to change this 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.900
 image of the world saying 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.870
 first you have to choose one 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.480
 png point image to change 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.489
 So that's what you're going to google and 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.349
 then we'll google the images and put 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.870
 for example I wanted an image of the 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.870
 targa it's the girl they wanted to spray 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.700
 so I put Taiga point png 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.280
 we'll assume you have a picture of 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.250
 a ball bola.pt mg 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.510
 here are several balls points and lg 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.260
 but for example will bring us here 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.850
 which is easier to explain 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.250
 You can see that there are several 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.709
 images to taiga the image that I chose 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.980
 that's how I identify 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.140
 whether it is a png image or not by those 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.060
 square gray and white ac around 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.860
 and in the background of the image 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.019
 You can see that he has gray courage. 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.630
 college river white gray gray white 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.540
 white if you find an image 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.620
 so the background is all white is not 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.690
 png point 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.640
 she's only png point if she has some 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.970
 squares gray white gray white and 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.450
 gray white gray white and gray white 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:29.650
 op this background here just because so much time 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.239
 to actually load bugged google 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.250
 that this shit does not load 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.709
 here are gray squares gray white 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.750
 white then only those who have pictures 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.850
 a png white point 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.459
 So, for example, let's go because I want to 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:47.739
 change my spray for this afternoon here 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.790
 so save the image and I've saved you 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.160
 beauty 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.329
 We go back to the sprays folder and open 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.100
 the spray and 42 will have the image of the 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.900
 amount saying here that they will do 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.150
 Now up here for those who have in 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.209
 Portuguese will be written file or 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:08.590
 fire was reelected in English 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:12.090
 There you go in open or another choose 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.090
 the image you downloaded 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:22.580
 I think it was from here. 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:24.080
 it's ready but the image you downloaded 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.980
 she will not really be that big 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.260
 he here 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.640
 this was the image that I found it right 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.800
 was great to understand that the image 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.540
 It will be great when you put 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.300
 here, what are you going to do to change the 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:40.340
 size of it you do not hear up here 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:43.000
 image or imad and we will put the size 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.130
 or resize something like this in Portuguese 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.670
 and here you will see the pixels of it goes 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:58.160
 being in my case is 734 10,089 you have 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:05:01.070
 that change to 128% 28 and from okay she will 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.710
 stay small so stay small 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.760
 so you'll have to file again 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:12.170
 file and save as or without bias and I will 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.500
 change the image to the right point and I'll 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:19.960
 put the name of the spray image 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:22.340
 underline and 42 and saved from desktop 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.470
 Ok it 's how on the desktop that are 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.050
 close to work the same thing 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.520
 good after saving here on desktop or 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.820
 on the same thing desktop 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:36.770
 You will come here to copy her and paste it into the 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:39.560
 Spray paste paste and copy and paste 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.890
 replace and ready you are ready 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:48.200
 to use your modified spray on the 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:50.000
 Sef said youssef then and when you arrive 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.040
 In the game I'll show you how 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.660
 It's good, I 've got a game here. 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.980
 I'll show you how the 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.680
 you 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.350
 Oh the image I took, she got 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.970
 my spray and you can see that this 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.730
 image that I took the opposite of 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.550
 another one streaked up to the 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.890
 side to side and down and do not 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.590
 ask the reason I do not know but this 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:15.200
 image is thus the other image is 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.150
 normal is only the character so I do not 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.390
 I know the reason for this may have some 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.530
 images are judged as spray am 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.780
