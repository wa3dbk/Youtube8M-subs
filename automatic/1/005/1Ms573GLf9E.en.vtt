00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.439 

here's<00:00:00.810> a<00:00:01.040> 1936<00:00:02.040> chrysler<00:00:02.610> airflow<00:00:03.060> now<00:00:03.389> I

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
here's a 1936 chrysler airflow now I

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.480 
here's a 1936 chrysler airflow now I
sure<00:00:03.899> wish<00:00:04.140> I<00:00:04.290> could<00:00:04.470> get<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.799> that<00:00:04.950> car<00:00:05.190> but

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
sure wish I could get to that car but

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.250 
sure wish I could get to that car but
again<00:00:06.330> we<00:00:06.569> have<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:07.309> barrier<00:00:08.309> here<00:00:08.870> and<00:00:09.870> it's

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
again we have a barrier here and it's

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.009 
again we have a barrier here and it's
right<00:00:10.559> here<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.160> see<00:00:11.370> it's<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.700> pipe<00:00:11.990> so<00:00:12.990> I

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
right here you see it's a pipe so I

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.049 
right here you see it's a pipe so I
really<00:00:13.469> can't<00:00:13.679> get<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.070> but<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.460> gave<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.759> an

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
really can't get to it but I gave you an

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.480 
really can't get to it but I gave you an
idea<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.630> what<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:15.960> car<00:00:16.230> looks<00:00:16.440> like<00:00:16.619> this

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
idea of what this car looks like this

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.380 
idea of what this car looks like this
was<00:00:17.730> an<00:00:17.850> attempt<00:00:18.180> by<00:00:18.240> Chrysler<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:20.390> rear

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
was an attempt by Chrysler to the rear

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.460 
was an attempt by Chrysler to the rear
of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.720> Namek<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:23.880> can<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.260> was

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
of the Namek and can see that it was

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.339 
of the Namek and can see that it was
compared<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.519> other<00:00:26.640> cars<00:00:27.000> when<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.869> first<00:00:28.170> came

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
compared to other cars when I first came

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.900 
compared to other cars when I first came
out<00:00:28.560> they<00:00:28.800> had<00:00:29.900> a<00:00:30.900> much<00:00:31.529> less<00:00:32.489> pronounced

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
out they had a much less pronounced

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.350 
out they had a much less pronounced
grille<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.250> idea<00:00:35.250> was<00:00:35.520> they<00:00:35.790> really

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
grille and the idea was they really

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.780 
grille and the idea was they really
didn't<00:00:36.600> sell<00:00:36.809> well<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.320> they<00:00:37.590> were<00:00:37.730> saying<00:00:38.730> it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
didn't sell well and they were saying it

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.590 
didn't sell well and they were saying it
looked<00:00:38.969> too<00:00:39.149> unconventional<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.200> Chrysler

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
looked too unconventional so Chrysler

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.119 
looked too unconventional so Chrysler
developed<00:00:42.600> his<00:00:42.719> grille<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.890> was

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
developed his grille for it that was

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.110 
developed his grille for it that was
much<00:00:44.399> more<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> typical<00:00:45.600> grill<00:00:47.120> notice

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
much more like a typical grill notice

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.010 
much more like a typical grill notice
that<00:00:48.300> has<00:00:48.450> dual<00:00:48.870> cowl<00:00:49.440> Vince<00:00:50.809> purple<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.930> the

let's<00:01:31.570> go<00:01:31.930> round<00:01:32.230> okay<00:01:33.160> I'll<00:01:33.310> try<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.670> if<00:01:34.600> I

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
let's go round okay I'll try the if I

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.640 
let's go round okay I'll try the if I
get<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.020> back<00:01:35.200> end<00:01:35.230> and<00:01:35.620> from<00:01:35.950> this<00:01:36.580> side<00:01:36.850> here

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
get the back end and from this side here

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.410 
get the back end and from this side here
is<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.890> very<00:01:39.070> big<00:01:41.640> driving<00:01:42.640> lights<00:01:43.030> on<00:01:43.300> either

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.020 

and<00:01:47.450> I<00:01:47.600> could<00:01:47.810> believe<00:01:48.140> this<00:01:48.760> we've<00:01:49.760> got<00:01:50.000> a

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
and I could believe this we've got a

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.890 
and I could believe this we've got a
parking<00:01:50.600> light<00:01:50.840> in<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.680> center<00:01:52.190> of<00:01:52.220> this

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900

and see a little bit in the back and

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.990 
and see a little bit in the back and
there<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.909> can<00:02:01.090> see<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.390> shade<00:02:01.840> in<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.200> back

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
there you can see a shade in the back

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.709 
there you can see a shade in the back
