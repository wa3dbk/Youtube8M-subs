 ashamed 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.440
 spring sales start updated 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.870
 ford skew the current model is produced 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.910
 already four years that is by the standards 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.619
 modern car industry has come 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.089
 update time 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:18.710
 during the explosion in germany we 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.349
 tried to figure out what 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.349
 the renovated facade is different from 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.339
 no special external changes you 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:28.140
 will not find 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.150
 all newest is it three 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.420
 car selection 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.520
 headquarters nearby hamsters 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.350
 thinks that even baby 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.440
 her appearance on the streets 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.940
 from this seed happened 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.690
 and because such a course design 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.430
 hold on for another couple of years but a couple stuffing 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.640
 shake up so all the funds went to 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.480
 finalization of equipment 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.050
 engineer upgraded 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.930
 engine suspension and steering 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.180
 car gamma engines 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.770
 proposed for Russia is not significantly 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.350
 changed this series of stubborn gasoline 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.650
 motors with a capacity of sixty five years 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:03.590
 dostoevsky 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.900
 as well as a turbocharged unit 1 6 outstanding 150 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.430
 horses option press 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.300
 or 190,200 in the most extreme version 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.700
 signatures and diesel engines submitted 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.640
 Engine 1 of 3 is available in two 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.640
 options forcing 75 or 96 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.870
 new petrol appeared in the competition 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.060
 become a strong engine 1 4 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.130
 this is the time set under 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.270
 the hood of our cars almost everyone 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.380
 petrol engines power rose in 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.360
 average of 5 horses according to 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.990
 manufacturer fuel consumption decreased by 10 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.200
 13 percent 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.729
 also reduced dioxide emissions 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.500
 carbon this applies to engines 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.500
 working pensioners 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.250
 the dynamics of our candidate is quite 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.210
 acceptable 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.440
 Acceleration to a hundred takes about 12 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.400
 thousand tons so the car was 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.180
 constantly in tune motor need 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.660
 twist 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.670
 at least 1400 he likes high speed 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.090
 its power is enough if 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.560
 pacific highway but the fastest on the road 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.270
 such a fursenko 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.969
 but refueling is not necessary often 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.449
 spare part 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.199
 posing the question is 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.889
 to the instrument cluster of so 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:12.700
 called 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.160
 Medvedev this system allows drivers 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.099
 save fuel besides he 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.900
 talked about interconnectedness 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.900
 gear change moment 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.379
 t 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:25.819
 even 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.749
 also prevent the conjured over 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.819
 suspension and steering settings 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.980
 control steel automation 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.349
 more supple soft but not to 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.439
 allow time I would have a good behavior on the road 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.469
 had to increase the thickness of the front 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.200
 stabilizer and also change 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.540
 rear axle beam location 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.099
 result increased george 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.919
 lateral loads 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.799
 and the effect of inadequate decreased 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.589
 understeer 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:52.049
 for example reconfigured 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.839
 suspension making it a bit comfortable 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:57.189
 m now a new portion softer delicate 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.529
 fulfills road bumps 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:00.679
 however, this did not affect the change 

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:03.449
 sustainability exchange manageability 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.999
 young shaking is not a trace 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.859
 chassis now more complex cyprus life 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.499
 fears the car copes with 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:12.090
 passing joints on asphalt 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.690
 in overcoming bumps now 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.109
 less disturbing driver and passengers 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.999
 the car became obedient 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.059
 you always know where you are from 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.750
 wheels 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.470
 just made a decent performance on 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.790
 winding path showed itself more 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.480
 clear management or predecessor 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.440
 there is direct automates very 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.470
 good riding at high speeds 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.470
 movement does not strain 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.949
 the salon is all familiar nothing new here 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.309
 you'll find 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:44.759
 options like heated steering wheel or 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.739
 large color screen on which are displayed 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.079
 board computer readings 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.779
 climate sound systems 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:51.919
 navigation setup it was all her 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.919
 former record m 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:57.919
 mechanical adjustment 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.369
 stiffness genius work on saturdays 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:02.339
 in the back row 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:05.029
 adults will be crowded but that's fine because 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:06.479
 we are dealing with compact 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.469
 subcompacts 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:08.949
 not changed and two hundred eighty 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.999
 five liter trunk which 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:12.599
 still has its own school 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.399
 it can be installed on several levels 

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:15.549
 what will be organized 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.129
 cargo compartment of goods 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:20.639
 2 so they decided not to trade for 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.739
 little things like easy make up looks or 

00:04:22.739 --> 00:04:24.429
 adding trinkets finally 

00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:26.879
 car and so good look indecent 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:28.909
 staffed engineers brought to 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:30.980
 Mind the most important technical school 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.730
 they tried to fix the car about 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.050
 major flaws of the previous version and 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.130
 refreshed the engine process line 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.320
 rejuvenation passed on German neatly and 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.980
 pragmatic that is all in the case and 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.070
 modernization did not affect the prices 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.990
 from four hundred eighty five 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.990
 thousand rubles for the basic version 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:51.879
 in project 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:53.830
 f 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.629
 but 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.590
 f 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.510
 but
