 TERRY GILLIAM RECOGNIZED 

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:34.600
 WE BECOME THE BORDER OF ALL KNOWN, 

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:38.500
 ALL THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND 

00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:42.000
 TO DISCOVER THE WORLD ... 

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.500
 FOR BORDER INTRODUCTION 

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:49.600
 Hello, here I am. But be quiet. We shouldn't be here. 

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:54.500
 I'm Terry Gilliam, and I'd like to show you a little bit about filming my movie. 

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:59.000
 Dr. Imaginarium Parnasse is probably the best picture I made. 

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.800
 It is not unlike the films I made in my young years. 

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:05.600
 Like Time Thieves is full of spells and wonders 

00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:08.000
 thus, the substance from which dreams are spun. 

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:13.000
 The film begins in contemporary London. Parnassus is thousands of years old. 

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:16.700
 Parnassus has the ability to develop your imagination further, 

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:18.300
 than you ever dreamed of. 

00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:25.600
 For centuries, he has been traveling the Earth with his theater, his imaginarium. 

00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:30.000
 But Parnassus has a problem. A long time ago he made a secret pact with the Devil, 

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:34.400
 and this secret threatens to destroy or save his life. 

00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:36.500
 It just depends on who he meets. 

00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:40.200
 Then he meets Tony, a man hanging from a bridge in London, 

00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:43.000
 to save his life. But Tony is to save them, 

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:45.000
 or is he working for the Devil? 

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:48.000
 These are mysteries that the story gradually reveals. 

00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:54.300
 The film is full of humor, tragic, beauty and romance, 

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:58.800
 therefore, the basic elements on which our imagination is built. 

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:26.300
