take the other ones stick it on top and
then

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
then

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.260 
then
going<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.500> take<00:02:07.650> your<00:02:07.860> Dollar<00:02:08.160> Tree<00:02:08.310> boss<00:02:08.880> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
each pack and taking your hot glue

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.870 
each pack and taking your hot glue
you're<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.260> going<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.470> glue<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.950> all<00:02:17.160> over

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
tiny sections at a time the smaller the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.810 
tiny sections at a time the smaller the
sections<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.560> more<00:02:25.980> beautiful<00:02:26.190> it's<00:02:26.610> going
