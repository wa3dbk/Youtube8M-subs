00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:03.509
 good 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.429
 you can also us the troops 690 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:25.279
 here we are today for a video or a little bit special 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.289
 so as you know the vow from time to time a little bit the same as 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.430
 for a little while and yesterday the doctor I will present you a 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.679
 new attempt has already posted an aria not very long 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.980
 so we end up on west london a class with sierre 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.910
 the Internet 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.989
 n 4 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.420
 dominique with laser sight 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.770
 so there I now pose that your installer a little bit on the left 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.460
 of my face and more we can align 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.150
 but to find out because that's what happens pretty much all the time 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.850
 6 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.280
 the best sense he denies separately from the week preacher 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.970
 there are people who feed sports director green 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.200
 and so then returning to the group to secure air transport 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.540
 course 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.250
 eliminated and the guy who goes out at the same time 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.460
 the duo of the tunnel whose carnage since this morning died after an intermission 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.030
 I move his movement 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.750
 e 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.470
 the edge of a lake alone the head 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.260
 Sunday to retrieve the bag there is deposited and heather morris below 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.340
 authier miled who is one of those and out in the world 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.100
 it allows me to protect myself 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.880
 and since helium the opponents go to make sign a priori 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.880
 since hold 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.840
 dd you are now we have not jumped on Sunday to come here and 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.000
 to do this very careful 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.880
 to people who want you who can come on my left 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.980
 knowing full well that there are people who can get out of the north tunnel 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.750
 in front of me 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.860
 and for his unique I start to watch the scores know England 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.690
 there I thought I had a head that goes over etc 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.840
 and percent 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.990
 by software 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.990
 commenting on the action e we will lose if I am by the way you see the 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:16.289
 the arrow that blink so I go there he adds that the sector so that does not 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.569
 do not believe a defense 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.149
 a third and katherine pradeau 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:24.010
 since the maximum to fart 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.369
 I do not know who it was. 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:29.089
 so reacted against his own to an opponent who tries to go into the 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:30.069
 tunnel 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.069
 read the file also to recover from ammunition storage 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.559
 but I have not found and percent 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:38.899
 so to avoid getting turned on 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:43.169
 I do not go to the center because I see sustained shots of city sneakers 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.719
 iti passed 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.379
 so here I am still to see if we learn on the account of BP but they 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.659
 do not have one at all 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.109
 two had hid behind the tree that germain just the hand besides there 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.309
 you see the cost of what's going on 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:03:00.069
 there I can not locate it so urgency that I do that I continue my 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.419
 tower 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.060
 and by that there are bullets 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.669
 I am sure that at 5% 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.669
 seen from the power of sound 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.359
 So here is the 2nd Clement 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.959
 so here I start to move forward anyway seriously 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.939
 but I have to be at 25 6 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.409
 so I continue 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.820
 and they are advancing cautiously because I know that here 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.129
 he is sponsor in the bay les gras my priority 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.599
 so i stay well protect der maelen my house is going 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.700
 and I try to see Roma in Europe where are the people so before sector I 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:37.889
 want some guys 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.239
 I saw that there was a small teammates who continues to move forward 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.759
 apparently he was killed by a friend of mine 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.759
 so I will continue 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:52.319
 so I take the opportunity to reload 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.619
 there I was wondering if I was going to have enough ammo for weapons to finish 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.790
 the neck because she likes nothing with bullets by ten but I believe that 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:04.089
 it's one of my opponents now 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.829
 I saw the world and so I waited 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.079
 kill the opponent 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.269
 continue to bypass 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.780
 and to judge fernand heinis jacky henin any advice that i've seen on 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:16.340
 internet these lines of palmares 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.959
 China s 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.729
 the bet is right now 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.729
 but to do another year or two fractures 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.090
 before 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.600
 before advancing a beach it's exactly if it was for them 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.520
 a race guilty double guilty yesterday 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.120
 in any case it has advanced well since loose I must be a frag 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.699
 in the case of duel very tight neck 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.960
 I arrange to protect myself with the house so it's not camping when 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.139
 even you saw I did a tour of the entire map once 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.039
 the jura goes stupidly to one place 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.229
 but I also do not want part of the Turkish position 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.039
 and there, since I hear that we are going to lose his words, I am going to 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.860
 his runners 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.509
 Ben to try to clear for his opponent who could be here 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.580
 so I got a little lost but I cut a little bit further 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.419
 it's a little bit darker 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.370
 and there I know that I congratulate so 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.720
 I chose this reprieve and on what 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.370
 since they just take it is in my opinion the responsible not so see it 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.650
 I see on no 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.169
 and the bombing race 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.169
 I have my first ride world I will put 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.569
 eliott so percent and that me when we know that I had heard and seven 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.180
 helps arrange to swing their allies is the gunner 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.400
 at the same time 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.400
 did the opponents get there? 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.879
 10% 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:52.449
 anti-aircraft missiles will therefore remain to play 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.830
 I have limited institutes shot at 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.159
 these are anti-aircraft missiles will look in December first 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:02.839
 you work so it's true that it's a little silly because the 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:05.559
 danger comes mostly from across 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:09.069
 especially you'll see - he'll be knocked out in not long 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:14.589
 and so 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.809
 begin to destroy the groom was quite simple in some miss 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:19.659
 it's easier 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:22.349
 Firstly 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:23.900
 my first line 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.900
 so here I said I have one wants to keep moving forward 

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:31.249
 and elsewhere I continue to make sentences because anyway the part 

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:34.680
 is far from over 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.030
 and percent by cons you can all you could see 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.350
 because of a portfolio for a little bit in every sense of the blow I do not 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.210
 am not good 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.210
 to keep one to assume 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.860
 still, I'm passionate 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:55.689
 so that's done 

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:00.590
 the steppe my first reaction I hope you liked it and then yes 

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:03.430
 I hope we will meet again and that this video 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.190
 we brought a lot of noise to the site
