00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
they have also confirmed that it will be

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.190 
they have also confirmed that it will be
available<00:02:59.580> for<00:03:00.060> pc<00:03:00.480> ps3<00:03:01.170> xbox<00:03:01.820> 360<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.030> the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
available for pc ps3 xbox 360 and the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.890 
available for pc ps3 xbox 360 and the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
next-gen consoles except for Wii Wii U

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.930 
next-gen consoles except for Wii Wii U
has<00:03:07.170> been<00:03:07.470> excluded<00:03:07.920> from<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.280> lot<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:08.730> games

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
has been excluded from a lot of games

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.460 
has been excluded from a lot of games
and<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.180> think<00:03:09.390> it's<00:03:09.510> because<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.990> started<00:03:10.320> off

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
and I think it's because it started off

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.710 
and I think it's because it started off
solid<00:03:11.010> with<00:03:11.130> sales<00:03:11.400> but<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.210> really<00:03:12.420> started

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
solid with sales but it really started

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.450 
solid with sales but it really started
to<00:03:12.900> slow<00:03:13.140> down<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.680> think<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.160> lot<00:03:14.400> of

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
to slow down so I think that a lot of

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.610 
to slow down so I think that a lot of

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
factions in the game Russia China and I

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.719

and<00:06:28.610> kind<00:06:28.849> of<00:06:28.940> mix<00:06:29.090> it<00:06:29.180> up<00:06:29.240> a<00:06:29.330> little<00:06:29.360> bit<00:06:29.570> like

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
and kind of mix it up a little bit like

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.060 
and kind of mix it up a little bit like
you<00:06:30.139> know<00:06:30.229> the<00:06:30.380> courage<00:06:30.590> in<00:06:30.740> right<00:06:30.889> now<00:06:31.039> with
