00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.959
 Karl Diallo here is the Raue misfortune sees him with own small 

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:08.620
 multiplayer-game PHS 00 clock Erich Goer 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.000
 you do not see that cut me up a bit because it was 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.160
 succeeded in giving gameplay their goal but because this is the others like this 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.140
 together this one 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.680
 Target of the campaign Groothuis percent did not want to smoke 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.759
 so 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.630
 three additional players 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.829
 It was about Lazio 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.780
 m in the comments simply reported here 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.340
 wanted to play 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.120
 furthermore, the ability to act the businesses could be well tested 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.600
 Campaign in HunsrÃ¼ck Bibles 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.070
 or of course over 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.820
 we should have the mode 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.820
 the ton in the network of Vodafone 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.420
 Of course, it is very important that 3 percent explicitly 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.430
 Compagnie or the zombie mode 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.410
 German player definitely the answer session main because otherwise 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.470
 does it work 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.470
 so percent I can not tell you the number exactly 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 or can one approach oneself that one concerns all 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.450
 Best of all Frank Peters in the comments below the video if we 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.670
 wanted to join 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.220
 or we ask percent 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.220
 you do not hope to do that 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.520
 basically everyone can get involved 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.960
 then you could do different mission 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.290
 our supreme for the last stop percent 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.870
 but example is not a problem 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.280
 definitely come back or school life together 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.280
 So I had to DaaS 4 somehow 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.110
 today numerous reports 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.450
 and then have a lot of fun playing percent to 14 really nice 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.500
 and percent 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.000
 thus counts 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.870
 As I said the request remained finally supplies 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.130
 Heat suffer 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.390
 today paper is announced 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.020
 okay it does not matter 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.020
 Percent more wanted to change that in the air 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.819
 they are online more often 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.819
 Jarchow 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.599
 8th 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.239
 continue 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.499
 8 Fr 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.039
 convinced 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.699
 Fri.
