 she 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.789
 but I am grateful gdf needs to avoid the image of lg 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.429
 the first division of the Brazilian market with the capacity to record 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.130
 your favorite movies and shows 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.409
 this one 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:23.019
 functioning as simple as setting a clock 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.029
 a lg targino tie automatically to suapi last hour of programming 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.180
 Do you know that scene from the novel?

 your game that you would very much like to see again at that very moment 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.740
 because all this 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.080
 the distance the touch of a button 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.670
 but it's not just the last hour of programming you can watch 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.640
 again if you want you can record excerpts immediately by pressing the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.609
 rec or by programming

 to catherine ashton record automatically 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.780
 even if you are not around the same as the television is not 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.580
 connected 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.920
 at the moment the program 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.140
 she records without any intervention 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.870
 among many possibilities shortcuts time you can also for example 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.830
 filming that movie that is the goal and did not have time to watch 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.680
 so you return a rental store I watched later as you please 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.620
 during our tests we found interesting also give this tip 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.210
 How about you leave recorded 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.900

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.580
 for those interested 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.460
 it is worth remembering that it attracts but it works with the coitus response time 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.240
 milliseconds 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.710
 at a very reasonable time for those who enjoy a video game 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.510
 about the technology and image quality of taag in the team 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.520
 maybe it's not so obvious 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.200
 much of your ass 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.520
 mainly due to the quality of the recording generated by our equipment 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.570
 but it's worth remembering 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.899
 that peace but it has resolution of 1024 pixels 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.990
 by 768 pixels 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.300
 a real system in your house 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.470
 the seat is in boston also have entrance vga air 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.670

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.509
 on your living room tv 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.939
 she also have tickets to pay 'daily 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:15.839
 from sexy 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:17.109
 and initiate 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.599
 survived and I saw that the competitor 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.620
 in the afternoon but still has a contrast ratio of 10,000 per month 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.370
 and its brightness of 120 seats per square meter, 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.379
 level and then certainly guarantee moments of great joy in your home 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.409
 however it is worth a reservation 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.439
 many people think this kind of forecast this production with the 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.010
 picture quality when watching normal TV 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.869
 even from cable tv 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.000
 this is because the landscape 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.439
 displays one thousand and twenty four light points your way more crimes 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:58.380
 while TV programming coming to your home with a maximum of 1 480 pixels 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.069
 that is instead of having a better image 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.069
 you can only give by counting the imperfections 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.290
 but leaving that aside 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.370
 if you want the best quality when watching the video 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.549
 and also want to be ready for the future of the image 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.079
