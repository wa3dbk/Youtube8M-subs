00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.070
 hello my love yes like him maybe 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.230
 really a huge pokémon far from the 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.930
 all this nonsense already went in 1996 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.179
 in japan we did not arrive until the end of 1999 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.859
 with it in touch and there it went 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.570
 Of course, really , I have pokémon 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.419
 red gambled but of course also pokémon 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.769
 blue and also pokémon yellow and you know 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.050
 still there you have right in this earlier 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.849
 pokémon trainer skype themselves all behind 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.560
 pokémon you have or not he has 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.450
 somehow enlisted and then it 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.220
 go on then you have pokémon gold 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.050
 and silver gambled and then always came 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.270
 again and again totally horny 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.250
 extensions out everything has 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.950
 you somehow played the game and became one 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.120
 keep getting better the goods are always good 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.880
 and then you can do that too 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.470
 funny special edition out there and there 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.270
 then came out partly real games 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.270
 which is not really super good 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.140
 but then there was it again 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.120
 games 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.500
 they were really really good 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.820
 might not have on the chit 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.130
 like these exploration teams pokémon or 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.870
 pokémon coliseum or of course this one 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.480
 still totally underrated pokémon 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.060
 snap but then of course there was still before 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.100
 all a title one has not 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.250
 on the big gray gameboy told her 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.630
 yes, we went with him at that time 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.610
 threesome set behind it and pokemon 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.740
 pulled because we were happy as the 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.380
 small came out and the game that I 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.330
 my came embarrassed the kaller time 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.130
 out and that goes without saying 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.130
 pokémon trading card game 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.810
 yes in the pokémon trading card game it works 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.640
 of course, that you first 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.260
 looking for a name and that you then 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.690
 Talk to the professor and it 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.290
 That's what the legendary pokémon cards are all about 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.230
 capture 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.600
 These are one- act centers of a lava dos 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.100
 and a legendary drago rahn and these 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.830
 cards jokes then has to bring for 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.570
 only then do you have the ultimate deck yes 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.070
 and you want to have a test game first 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.570
 play in the taught so 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.340
 it 's the whole game at all 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.690
 Of course you have to work around that 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.070
 understand how to understand the game 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.780
 the pokémon trading card game 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.430
 works now it is actually right 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.470
 simple, it is just as simple as that 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.790
 view which is nothing bad 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.180
 because that's what these games do 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.500
 fun 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.390
 so you can not compare it with 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.870
 something like magic does not matter 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.010
 so you have your base pokémon and 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.140
 after everyone has seven cards 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.880
 has pulled a coin throw is made 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.470
 and to see who starts and there it is 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.360
 unfortunately to balance because who starts 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.920
 has a huge advantage because achieved 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.470
 both a card and he can 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.590
 Immediately attack and processor 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.470
 So you start at this first 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.880
 play and your pokemon had to 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.410
 First of all, do it on the bench 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.940
 comdirect into the game and then you can 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.130
 a lot on the bank and how you want but 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.890
 then of course only the base pokémon the 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.209
 development must first be on hand 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.800
 yes and you need it too 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.970
 Energy cards also with these pokémon 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.799
 to be able to attack at all 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.989
 You can card an energy card every round 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.620
 single pokémon pack is important 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.700
 that the color also holds the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.200
 cost must correspond so if to 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.019
 example on a map is two 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.340
 blue energy cards then this needs 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.750
 pokémon on at least two blue 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.739
 energy cards you can also do more 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.840
 lay the pokémon 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.760
 maybe so you later developed 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.530
 can also use other colors if 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.390
 for example, this colorless symbol 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.250
 yes, if there are colorless symbols 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.170
 then it does not matter what kind of energy card 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.030
 but the elemental energy kathi the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.610
 definitely needs in quantity 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.260
 be available again on it 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.400
 yes you have enough you can do with it 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.630
 already attack for the first time 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.940
 you're doing so much harm 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.799
 it shows weakness and resistance 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.500
 also rated here in resistance exists 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.019
 30 less harms not half 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.430
 and in case of weakness it will hurt 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.860
 here are the ratios doubled 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.840
 actually relatively well known is water 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.770
 effective against fire fire against plant 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.610
 Plant against stone stone went electro 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.350
 and electro against water and fight 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.720
 effective against normal around the clock against 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.190
 fight and psychologists psycho have that 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.240
 they installed the ghosts with the 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.720
 psyche if you look a bit 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.250
 balanced yes is not normal 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.980
 as effective as it is in normal 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.000
 play yes and you have, of course 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.160
 still trainer cards 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.930
 that means you have to run your game 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.940
 actually loud that you yours 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.320
 send pokémon into the fight you can 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.360
 win the game by stopping 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.030
 either the opponent all his price 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.550
 cards and blogs so there are four so 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.120
 3 4 and 6 price cards will be on the 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.830
 brought 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.090
 if you kill a pokémon of the opponent 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.830
 may you of you in the price map 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.430
 Did you take all you did that 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.110
 won the game 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.060
 but you can also lose the game 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.920
 if you either no base pokémon on 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.050
 But the bank has everything in it 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.940
 would then have you lost or if 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.490
 all cards of his stack were drawn 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.780
 then you have also lost what happens 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.160
 but really only in the really 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.670
 long fight and if both really 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.170
 shit play yes and so used one 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.110
 few skills of a pokemon is 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.550
 pokémon pokémon skills reactivated 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.870
 your trainer cards around the opponent 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.210
 to hurt or to hurt yourself 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.800
 need to set up powerful cards like 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.310
 professor eich used seven new ones 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.810
 cards and so on and so on 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.160
 Do you have to run all those clubs? 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.810
 Of course a little bit the club 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.550
 defeat member may otherwise master the 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.750
 But it's a few problems around 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.940
 of course later in the pokémon 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.560
 challenge to come and there you play 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.360
 then against the top 4, so to speak 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.460
 again against Vocation opponents as well 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.440
 always so surprises and a christ 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.550
 legendary pokémon cards male enough 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.890
 good enough 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.770
 There are still some funny extra things 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.180
 how i makoun i what that with the on itself 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.440
 I would like that but at this point 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.490
 Do not betray that's pretty much 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.080
 funny in the game 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.360
 There is still such a small duel tom 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.430
 and some more extra gags in the 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.690
 You can hide this game 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.580
 his deck of course as in the right one 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.290
 pokémon did play Assemble 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.940
 can it all sorts of cards in there 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.010
 and can do it out completely 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.290
 type of his stacks change so if you am 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.490
 start with a wrong one the wrong type 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.710
 then you can just do it 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.280
 somehow change everything is yourself 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.830
 leave 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.270
 yes, that's the attraction of this game 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.340
 of course the connection to the pokémon 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.540
 even it makes such fun everything 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.960
 possible to try out the 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.550
 different pokémon cards 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.949
 Partially you just go totally wrap 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.660
 and take everything away with his blood 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:18.220
 sometimes time does not go that well either 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.560
 and the game is also very open 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.449
 happiness desired 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.490
 because it is completely thrown on the coin 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.110
 and if you have bad luck with head and number 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.090
 can be frustrating, but first 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.620
 all in one just because of this 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.440
 pokémon trading card know so simple 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.780
 holding power is such a pleasure 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.310
 So if you have this game at some point 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.360
 have seen you and you think something 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.620
 should that be 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.810
 that's one of those things again 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.880
 pokémon pin is not really hot if 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.229
 her somehow was something with this pokémon 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.509
 trading card games had to do or 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:47.620
 Pokemon loves being easy yourself 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:49.570
 It really explains the game 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.180
 mood too simple too 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.620
 became and year is the same 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.370
 opinion longer and I say now 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.020
 every time bye 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.280
 I hope this quickie has you 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.960
 please and see you next time 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.000
 video yes and if you still have it 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.680
 see more videos what I somehow 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.780
 can be of course then have someone 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.819
 two videos that we can suggest to you 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.849
 we have an ip video review 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:15.250
 by martin who parked pro at the time 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:17.669
 presented for the clock and a video 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.690
 I have a kick-off concert 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:21.990
 presented and that's really 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.060
 two very contrary ones you watch games 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:27.099
 I also have a look what's up there 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.449
 really quite a lot of great pokémon 

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:30.880
 here you can play two times 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:32.259
 look at what we think of it and 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.919
 already you can do something there 

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:35.229
 recommend 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:37.979
 the simple a little we'll see each other 

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:37.979
 next time too
