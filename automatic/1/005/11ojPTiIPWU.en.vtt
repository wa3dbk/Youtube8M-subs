examples of knitting pins I use this is
you<00:01:41.600> know<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.289> regular<00:01:42.679> little<00:01:42.860> pin<00:01:43.250> and

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
they all work and actually you don't

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.389 
they all work and actually you don't
need<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.869> pin<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.380> could<00:01:48.590> put<00:01:48.800> just<00:01:48.830> around

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
need the pin you could put just around

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.309 
need the pin you could put just around
your<00:01:49.610> neck<00:01:49.789> okay<00:01:50.090> well<00:01:50.869> how<00:01:50.990> do<00:01:51.050> you<00:01:51.140> put<00:01:51.259> them

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
your neck okay well how do you put them

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.109 
your neck okay well how do you put them
on<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.530> pin<00:01:51.709> like<00:01:51.979> that<00:01:52.220> yeah<00:01:52.369> so<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.940> yarn

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
on the pin like that yeah so the yarn

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.210 
on the pin like that yeah so the yarn
would<00:01:53.360> come<00:01:53.569> from<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.929> work<00:01:54.140> okay<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:54.920> then

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
would come from the work okay and then

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.160 
would come from the work okay and then
you<00:01:55.399> would<00:01:55.610> hang<00:01:55.850> around<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.270> pin<00:01:56.509> alright

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
you would hang around the pin alright

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.139 
you would hang around the pin alright
and<00:01:57.440> you<00:01:57.619> would<00:01:57.770> tension<00:01:58.310> around<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.729> finger

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
and you would tension around the finger

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.090 
and you would tension around the finger
any<00:01:59.390> finger<00:01:59.840> would<00:02:00.020> do<00:02:00.229> but<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.590> need<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.920> keep

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
any finger would do but you need to keep

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.520 
any finger would do but you need to keep
the<00:02:01.280> tension<00:02:01.520> constant<00:02:02.240> that's<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.200> secret

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
the tension constant that's the secret

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.710 
the tension constant that's the secret
of<00:02:03.709> this<00:02:03.860> technique<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:04.789> you<00:02:05.330> don't<00:02:05.539> put<00:02:05.660> the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
of this technique so you don't put the

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.900 
of this technique so you don't put the
tension<00:02:05.929> on<00:02:06.110> your<00:02:06.170> hands<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:07.009> tension<00:02:07.459> is<00:02:07.610> on

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
tension on your hands the tension is on

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.730 
tension on your hands the tension is on
the<00:02:08.149> yarn<00:02:08.390> at<00:02:08.569> all<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:09.020> then<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.170> put<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.530> red

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
the yarn at all and then you put the red

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.220 
the yarn at all and then you put the red
color<00:02:10.160> on<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.640> other<00:02:10.670> pin<00:02:11.120> that's<00:02:11.599> correct<00:02:11.959> I

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
color on the other pin that's correct I

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.900 
color on the other pin that's correct I
will<00:02:12.319> put<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.770> other<00:02:12.950> color<00:02:13.400> on<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.880> other

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
couple more times so there would be the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.110 
couple more times so there would be the
pro<00:02:48.590> stitch<00:02:48.950> okay

okay<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.519> could<00:03:13.850> use<00:03:14.209> for<00:03:14.239> example<00:03:14.890> one

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
okay so I could use for example one

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.580 
okay so I could use for example one
stitch<00:03:16.670> on<00:03:16.820> main<00:03:17.060> color

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590

one stitch in background okay and now

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.820 
one stitch in background okay and now
how<00:03:22.730> does<00:03:22.790> that<00:03:23.060> look<00:03:23.239> on<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.510> back<00:03:23.720> in<00:03:24.530> the

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
how does that look on the back in the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.240 
how does that look on the back in the
back<00:03:25.190> that's<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:26.060> advantage<00:03:26.709> when<00:03:27.709> you<00:03:27.950> keep

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
back that's the advantage when you keep

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.580 
back that's the advantage when you keep
your<00:03:28.519> floats<00:03:28.970> or<00:03:29.420> carrying<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.110> yarn<00:03:30.440> on

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
your floats or carrying the yarn on

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.870 
your floats or carrying the yarn on
outside<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.819> head<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:33.590> know<00:03:33.650> you<00:03:34.190> tend<00:03:34.519> to

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
outside the head you know you tend to

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.150 
outside the head you know you tend to
have<00:03:35.209> a<00:03:35.510> very<00:03:35.569> even<00:03:36.260> tension<00:03:36.890> from<00:03:37.100> the

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
have a very even tension from the

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.870 
have a very even tension from the
beginning<00:03:37.819> you<00:03:38.540> know<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:39.310> fabric<00:03:40.310> wouldn't

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
beginning you know the fabric wouldn't

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.289 
beginning you know the fabric wouldn't
pucker<00:03:41.120> all<00:03:41.390> together<00:03:42.310> now<00:03:43.310> there<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.120> one

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
pucker all together now there is one

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.819
