actually right here is stepping on an

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.380 
actually right here is stepping on an
ace<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.600> clubs<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.520> an<00:00:59.579> ace<00:00:59.699> clubs<00:01:00.000> reveal

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and here's the ace of spades um I think

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.210

the<00:01:06.900> little<00:01:07.080> ribbon<00:01:07.409> around<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.890> makes<00:01:08.100> it

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the little ribbon around here makes it

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
the little ribbon around here makes it
look<00:01:08.310> really<00:01:08.400> cool<00:01:08.700> cuts<00:01:09.060> all<00:01:09.270> wait<00:01:09.600> me<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
look really cool cuts all wait me and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.620 
look really cool cuts all wait me and
feels<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> ghost<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.240> think<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.510> did

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
feels like a ghost and I think they did

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.830 
feels like a ghost and I think they did
a<00:01:12.689> really<00:01:12.720> good<00:01:12.960> job<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.689> a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
a really good job with it and so that a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.490 
a really good job with it and so that a
is<00:01:16.710> actually<00:01:17.159> inside<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.610> Spade<00:01:18.380> unlike<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
is actually inside the Spade unlike the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.420 
is actually inside the Spade unlike the
other<00:01:19.619> cards<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:21.270> that's<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:23.220> black

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
other cards so that's that and the black

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.630 
other cards so that's that and the black
cards<00:01:23.939> normal

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.760 

and<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:28.590> face<00:01:28.740> cause<00:01:29.010> i<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.550> grayed<00:01:29.790> out

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
and the face cause i think is grayed out

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.990 
and the face cause i think is grayed out
as<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.370> see<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.860> red<00:01:35.040> cards<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
as you can see and the red cards the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.399 
as you can see and the red cards the
pivot<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.390> middle<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.750> actually<00:01:37.140> black

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
pivot in the middle is actually black

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.609 
pivot in the middle is actually black
and<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.640> pips<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.030> corner<00:01:39.330> here<00:01:39.360> are<00:01:39.750> red

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.800 
and the pips in the corner here are red
and<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.430> also<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.880> line<00:01:42.119> around<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.600> red

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
and they also have a line around the red

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:52.930 
and they also have a line around the red
and<00:01:42.930> black<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.880> think<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.000> looks<00:01:45.150> really<00:01:45.300> cool

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.310 

again<00:01:53.940> everything's<00:01:54.420> great<00:01:54.690> out<00:01:54.870> in<00:01:55.200> the

again everything's great out in the
middle<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:57.270> red<00:01:57.420> pips<00:01:57.660> in<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.870> corner

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
middle and the red pips in the corner

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.850 
middle and the red pips in the corner
it's<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.370> black<00:01:59.550> hide<00:01:59.790> around<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.120> red<00:02:00.860> near

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
it's a black hide around the red near

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.420 
it's a black hide around the red near
the<00:02:01.980> clubs

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:15.900 

and<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:07.240> hearts

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.650 

so<00:02:16.910> there<00:02:17.090> we<00:02:17.180> go<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.790> as<00:02:19.790> far<00:02:19.970> as<00:02:20.030> flourishes

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
so there we go and as far as flourishes

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.080 
so there we go and as far as flourishes
actually<00:02:21.380> really<00:02:21.680> good<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.250> fan<00:02:22.550> them<00:02:22.790> great

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
actually really good and fan them great

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.250 
actually really good and fan them great
and<00:02:24.910> great<00:02:25.910> for<00:02:26.090> springing<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.810> you're

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
and great for springing and you're

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.530 
and great for springing and you're
boring<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:28.150> also<00:02:29.150> bait<00:02:29.390> for<00:02:29.540> ribbon<00:02:29.810> threats

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.360 

and<00:02:35.540> they're<00:02:36.320> actually<00:02:36.590> really<00:02:36.620> cheap<00:02:37.040> off<00:02:37.220> of

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
and they're actually really cheap off of

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.270 
and they're actually really cheap off of
illusion<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:37.790> simpler<00:02:38.150> for<00:02:38.420> 95<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.070> think

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
illusion is simpler for 95 so I think

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.620 
illusion is simpler for 95 so I think
she<00:02:40.550> definitely<00:02:40.670> Peppa<00:02:41.150> not<00:02:41.300> just<00:02:41.510> because

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
she definitely Peppa not just because

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.890 
she definitely Peppa not just because
they're<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.050> cheap<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:44.090> think<00:02:44.330> they<00:02:44.480> hold

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
they're so cheap and I think they hold

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.270 
they're so cheap and I think they hold
up<00:02:45.020> really<00:02:45.050> well<00:02:45.440> these<00:02:45.770> are<00:02:45.920> about<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.130> month
