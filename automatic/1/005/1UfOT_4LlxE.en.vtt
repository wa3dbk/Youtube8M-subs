going<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:39.880> sniper<00:03:40.239> he<00:03:40.600> would<00:03:40.750> go<00:03:40.870> from<00:03:41.110> Archer

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
going to sniper he would go from Archer

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.449 
going to sniper he would go from Archer
to<00:03:41.799> sniper<00:03:42.130> it's<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.519> marksman<00:03:43.120> it's<00:03:43.989> a<00:03:44.140> great

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
to sniper it's a marksman it's a great

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.280 
to sniper it's a marksman it's a great
addition<00:03:45.459> especially<00:03:45.850> since<00:03:46.569> it<00:03:46.720> adds<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:47.049> ton

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
addition especially since it adds a ton

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.270 
addition especially since it adds a ton
more<00:03:47.560> classes<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.580> original<00:03:49.090> amounts<00:03:50.280> but

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
more classes to the original amounts but

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.250 
more classes to the original amounts but
now<00:03:51.459> I<00:03:51.489> think<00:03:51.730> I've<00:03:52.090> explained<00:03:52.600> enough<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:53.110> the

now I think I've explained enough of the
gameplay<00:03:53.799> so<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:54.430> think<00:03:54.549> I'll<00:03:54.910> start<00:03:55.180> on<00:03:55.330> the
