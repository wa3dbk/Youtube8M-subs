00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 Hello everyone, Andrei Andrei Andrei 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.109
 My site is 3 by 5 dot ru 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.330
 last week we talked about you 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.820
 addition subtraction is positive and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.759
 negative numbers assorted different 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.740
 options but very easy to repeat for 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.580
 me the decision when I explain only 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.050
 one topic 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.730
 and when you need to immediately choose to solve a lot 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.189
 different examples from different topics 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.619
 then there are difficulties so let's 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.900
 to fix try to hold such 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.219
 little experiment today i won't 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.340
 explain a new topic 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.739
 Today we solve examples from 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.460
 previous topics and but we will solve them in 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.829
 shuffle 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.020
 that is, when I explain one topic she 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.539
 very simple it can be solved very easily and 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.980
 when we have several topics at once 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.030
 mixed together 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.710
 then it is a little harder it is now i 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.690
 I will comment on these examples 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.300
 then you try to solve them 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.750
 on my own and then see how I am 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.940
 I will solve them for you and we will make sure that 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:10.380
 you got all the examples right 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:16.860
 So examples are minus 9 plus minus 11 8 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:23.159
 minus 20 minus 15 minus 16 17 minus 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:29.579
 minus seven minus 14 minus minus 5 13 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:31.320
 plus minus 3 minus 17 plus 5 try 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.079
 pause and all examples 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.450
 count if you suddenly have 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.000
 difficulties with some examples i 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.939
 I recommend to review previous videos 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.619
 in which I explained in detail 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.170
 addition of negative subtraction numbers 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.329
 negative numbers subtract from 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.900
 lesser poland and so on that is all 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.140
 these examples I myself 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.810
 I told you this week I hope 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.660
 you are not lazy and despite the rather 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.540
 just today sunday is a day off 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:06.810
 find all the examples let's all together 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:10.180
 we will consider this as the sum of the negative and 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.450
 negative numbers when we have a sum 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.700
 negative and negative then we 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.000
 take the module 1 module take honors 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.610
 add another number and get 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.790
 new value write it in with sign 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.140
 minus that is when we add two 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.210
 negative numbers we are moduli of numbers 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.890
 add 9 and 11 and write with 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.660
 minus 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:40.660
 more than 8 minus 20 because you need out 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.230
 fewer subtract more 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.340
 then we can do the opposite we can from 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.780
 20 subtract 8 and will be 12 but we will write with 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.400
 opposite sign minus 12 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.360
 following example 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.090
 minus 15 minus 16 is the same as u 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.190
 we had in the first example the first feeling 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.459
 wax as if negative and second 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.860
 negative they are like a woman with a minus 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:13.870
 then we take module 1 sense 15 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.780
 module 2 numbers 16 15 to 1631 and write with 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.930
 minus sign is actually the first example 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.980
 let's rewrite it separately minus 9 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.290
 plus or minus 11 could be rewritten in 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.540
 like this 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:32.650
 plus minus u will be minus then this 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.910
 minus 9 -11 it turns out minus 20 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.180
 that is, we add the modules 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.170
 do not write with minus 1 example 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:49.400
 and the third example is the same example 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:54.160
 further minus to minus gives plus minus to 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:58.400
 minus gives plus 17 plus 7 it turns out 24 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:02.960
 following example -4 rewrite later 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.220
 here -4 rewrote then minus minus 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.340
 gives plus and write Peter minus to minus x 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.430
 plus so write plus such an example 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.760
 in my opinion today there is no such thing today 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.680
 have you been saying that if one 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.070
 us number is negative other 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.070
 positive 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:28.820
 how can we assume we take the module 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.380
 one of them is 5 take the module of another 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.330
 4 of them 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.640
 if it is again the number is negative 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.280
 another positive find the module 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.900
 each one 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:44.600
 subtract from the larger module less 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.770
 module we get 11 write back with what 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.860
 sign write raspberries 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.880
 modulo was more than five it was with 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.700
 plus so in response we write plus 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:05:00.890
 the following example 13 plus minus 3 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:05.030
 but you can leave it so you can rewrite - 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:08.360
 you actually we know what's plus on 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:12.380
 minus gives minus that is if there are two in a row 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:17.720
 plus minus sign can be changed to -13 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:19.310
 minus 3 will be 10 can be explained here by 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.500
 same principle as previous 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.490
 example because one number 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.060
 positively 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:29.690
 and the other is negative we need these 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:35.150
 sums then we find the modulus 1 of the number 13 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:36.979
 mod of the second number 3 subtracting from 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.720
 larger module less module subtract 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.440
 because they have different signs here, plus 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.360
 and here minus we get 10 and write in 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.910
 answer 10 with what sign do we write 10 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.060
 with the sign of the one that was modulo 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:55.509
 more than 13 can be changed, we and 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:59.659
 write as you can through subtraction and 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:02.300
 last example he is exactly 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:04.569
 counted through subtracting one sense 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.240
 negative other positive 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.830
 we find the module 1 number we find the module 2 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.039
 numbers 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:16.340
 subtract less water from a larger module 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:21.650
 we get 12 12 van wines we write with what 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:24.650
 sign 17 modulo was more minus 17 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:28.370
 modulo 17 it is more modulo than from 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:32.080
 peter but 17 was minus so in 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:34.789
 We write the answer with a minus 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.560
 Please write in comments 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:39.289
 comments how many examples do you have 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.180
 it turned out and sew correctly here if everything 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:43.849
 examples it turned out right otshit 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.190
 very good it means that we will go 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:48.320
 to more complex topics we can 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.860
 add and subtract no longer integers 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.620
 and for example decimal fractions usual 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.569
 fractions mixed numbers and then adds 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.719
 includes positive and negative 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:03.500
 the numbers will be already . not whole but wilder 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:07.870
 difficult options on this all advise 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.870
 my videos to my friends bye bye
