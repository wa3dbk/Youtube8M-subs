you right here right so us yeah we have
a<00:02:25.050> cooking<00:02:25.440> pot<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.070> I'm<00:02:26.370> cooking<00:02:26.760> a

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
a cooking pot in it I'm cooking a

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.730 
a cooking pot in it I'm cooking a
chicken<00:02:26.880> now<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.780> probably<00:02:28.200> would<00:02:28.590> say

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
chicken now you probably would say

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.680 
chicken now you probably would say
that's<00:02:29.040> no<00:02:29.250> big<00:02:29.459> deal<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.000> now<00:02:30.209> what<00:02:30.570> do<00:02:30.660> you

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
that's no big deal but now what do you

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.850 
that's no big deal but now what do you
see<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:30.990> in<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.170> chickens<00:02:31.440> cooking<00:02:31.709> it

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
see you in this chickens cooking it

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.830 
see you in this chickens cooking it
steams<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.550> where<00:02:32.820> does<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.150> steam<00:02:33.390> go<00:02:33.570> well

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
steams and where does the steam go well

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.690 
steams and where does the steam go well
everywhere<00:02:34.380> on<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.709> cupboards<00:02:35.160> on<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.400> walls

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
everywhere on the cupboards on the walls

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.550 
everywhere on the cupboards on the walls
the<00:02:35.970> steam<00:02:36.209> goes<00:02:36.390> everywhere<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.290> means

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
the steam goes everywhere that means

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.980 
the steam goes everywhere that means
down<00:02:37.980> here<00:02:38.400> we're<00:02:38.550> generating<00:02:38.940> an<00:02:39.209> incredible

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
down here we're generating an incredible

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.930 
down here we're generating an incredible
amount<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.320> energy<00:02:40.770> but<00:02:41.040> at<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.280> top<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.790> heat

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
amount of energy but at the top the heat

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.100 
amount of energy but at the top the heat
rises<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.570> escapes

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
rises and escapes

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.590 
rises and escapes
now<00:02:43.410> that's<00:02:43.740> history<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.670> powerful<00:02:45.120> steam

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
now that's history this powerful steam

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.170 
now that's history this powerful steam
this<00:02:45.930> energy<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.800> lost<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.430> wasted<00:02:47.910> can

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
this energy that is lost and wasted can

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.260 
this energy that is lost and wasted can
finally<00:02:48.720> be<00:02:48.930> used<00:02:49.550> it's<00:02:50.550> really<00:02:50.820> very<00:02:50.940> simple

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
finally be used it's really very simple

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.020 
finally be used it's really very simple
by<00:02:51.780> cooking<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.260> second<00:02:52.770> dish<00:02:53.010> here<00:02:53.459> on<00:02:53.640> Todd

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
by cooking a second dish here on Todd

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.759 
by cooking a second dish here on Todd
you<00:02:54.360> simply<00:02:54.660> put<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.959> on<00:02:55.080> top<00:02:55.230> correct

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
you simply put that on top correct

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.890 
you simply put that on top correct
do<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:55.980> see<00:02:56.220> these<00:02:56.340> holes<00:02:56.610> up<00:02:57.000> here<00:02:57.209> yes<00:02:57.510> well

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
do you see these holes up here yes well

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.660 
do you see these holes up here yes well
these<00:02:58.080> holes<00:02:58.350> are<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.769> so-called<00:02:58.980> steam

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
these holes are the so-called steam

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.180 
these holes are the so-called steam
conduction<00:03:00.480> holes<00:03:00.750> through<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.650> innovative

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
conduction holes through this innovative

conduction holes through this innovative
chimney<00:03:02.850> system<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.630> steam<00:03:03.900> goes<00:03:04.140> directly

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
chimney system the steam goes directly

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.040 
chimney system the steam goes directly
to<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.950> food<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.790> means<00:03:06.060> all<00:03:06.269> dishes<00:03:06.870> are

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
to the food this means all dishes are

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.259 
to the food this means all dishes are
skewed<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.800> perfection<00:03:08.280> all<00:03:08.580> tasting<00:03:09.120> really

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
skewed to perfection all tasting really

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.759 
skewed to perfection all tasting really
great<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:09.720> there's<00:03:09.900> no<00:03:10.019> flavor<00:03:10.290> mixing

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
great and there's no flavor mixing

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.890 
great and there's no flavor mixing
between<00:03:10.860> dishes<00:03:11.489> no<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:12.150> also<00:03:12.269> can't<00:03:12.630> burn

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
between dishes no you also can't burn

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.509 
between dishes no you also can't burn
anything<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.530> then<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.769> not<00:03:14.010> happened

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
anything and then it not happened

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.949
