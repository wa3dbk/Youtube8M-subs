00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.620 

now<00:00:09.710> we're<00:00:09.950> at<00:00:10.130> the<00:00:10.280> Clausing<00:00:10.730> 12<00:00:11.030> inch<00:00:11.330> lathe

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
now we're at the Clausing 12 inch lathe

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.710 
now we're at the Clausing 12 inch lathe
and<00:00:12.020> we're<00:00:12.170> going<00:00:12.410> to

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:13.720 
and we're going to

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.070 
and we're going to
check<00:00:14.410> the<00:00:14.560> tailstock<00:00:14.950> offset<00:00:15.760> by<00:00:16.570> another

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
check the tailstock offset by another

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.130 
check the tailstock offset by another
method<00:00:17.530> shown<00:00:18.070> to<00:00:18.310> me<00:00:18.430> by<00:00:18.460> my<00:00:19.180> brother<00:00:19.240> JN<00:00:19.930> this

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
method shown to me by my brother JN this

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.810 
method shown to me by my brother JN this
isn't<00:00:20.500> one<00:00:20.650> that<00:00:20.830> you<00:00:20.920> read<00:00:21.100> about<00:00:21.220> in<00:00:21.520> a<00:00:21.610> book

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
isn't one that you read about in a book

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.120 
isn't one that you read about in a book
but<00:00:22.060> it's<00:00:22.090> really<00:00:22.900> a<00:00:22.930> good<00:00:23.200> method<00:00:23.410> I'm<00:00:23.740> hoping

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
but it's really a good method I'm hoping

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.269 
but it's really a good method I'm hoping
it<00:00:24.279> shows<00:00:24.550> up<00:00:24.880> I<00:00:25.270> do<00:00:26.050> have<00:00:26.380> a<00:00:26.410> mirror<00:00:26.770> mounted

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
it shows up I do have a mirror mounted

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.980 
it shows up I do have a mirror mounted
behind<00:00:27.910> there<00:00:28.180> so<00:00:28.360> you<00:00:28.420> can<00:00:28.660> see<00:00:28.840> the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
behind there so you can see the

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.240 
behind there so you can see the
indicator<00:00:29.320> and<00:00:30.390> I've<00:00:31.390> got<00:00:31.720> two<00:00:32.410> wrenches<00:00:32.710> in

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
indicator and I've got two wrenches in

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.910 
indicator and I've got two wrenches in
the<00:00:34.120> tailstock<00:00:34.510> same<00:00:34.960> as<00:00:35.140> what<00:00:35.350> you<00:00:35.500> saw<00:00:35.680> at

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
the tailstock same as what you saw at

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.220 
the tailstock same as what you saw at
the<00:00:35.950> bench<00:00:36.480> because<00:00:37.480> if<00:00:37.810> you<00:00:37.900> use<00:00:37.989> two

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
the bench because if you use two

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.840 
the bench because if you use two
wrenches<00:00:38.620> you<00:00:38.739> can<00:00:38.860> work<00:00:39.040> one<00:00:39.280> against<00:00:39.610> the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
wrenches you can work one against the

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.760 
wrenches you can work one against the
other<00:00:40.030> and<00:00:40.180> it<00:00:40.450> it<00:00:40.930> makes<00:00:41.290> for<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.560> quick

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
other and it it makes for a quick

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.460 
other and it it makes for a quick
alignment<00:00:42.430> now<00:00:43.239> there<00:00:43.660> are<00:00:43.810> many<00:00:43.989> different

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
alignment now there are many different

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.730 
alignment now there are many different
ways<00:00:44.530> that<00:00:44.980> you<00:00:45.130> can<00:00:45.280> hold<00:00:45.550> an<00:00:45.850> indicator<00:00:46.330> for

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
ways that you can hold an indicator for

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.390 
ways that you can hold an indicator for
this<00:00:47.740> and<00:00:49.110> I'm<00:00:50.110> using<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.500> little<00:00:50.650> stearic<00:00:51.100> back

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
this and I'm using a little stearic back

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.460 
this and I'm using a little stearic back
plunger<00:00:52.000> type<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.540> works<00:00:52.690> real<00:00:53.020> good<00:00:53.050> there

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
plunger type that works real good there

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.440 
plunger type that works real good there
are<00:00:53.500> other<00:00:53.770> indicators<00:00:54.610> that<00:00:54.640> you<00:00:54.910> can<00:00:55.060> use<00:00:55.240> as

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
are other indicators that you can use as

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.080 
are other indicators that you can use as
well<00:00:55.480> and<00:00:56.110> you<00:00:56.860> might<00:00:57.040> have<00:00:57.250> a<00:00:57.280> much<00:00:57.880> better

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
well and you might have a much better

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.690 
well and you might have a much better
way<00:00:58.360> of<00:00:58.510> holding<00:00:58.720> this<00:00:59.110> but<00:00:59.350> I<00:00:59.460> this<00:01:00.460> is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
way of holding this but I this is

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.700 
way of holding this but I this is
something<00:01:00.850> that<00:01:01.330> I<00:01:01.360> did<00:01:01.510> in<00:01:02.020> about<00:01:02.500> two<00:01:02.680> or

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
something that I did in about two or

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.380 
something that I did in about two or
three<00:01:02.860> minutes<00:01:03.130> it's<00:01:03.460> just<00:01:03.610> a<00:01:03.730> piece<00:01:03.910> of<00:01:03.940> 2x4

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
three minutes it's just a piece of 2x4

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.499 
three minutes it's just a piece of 2x4
three<00:01:05.350> inches<00:01:05.680> in<00:01:05.860> diameter<00:01:06.009> with<00:01:06.970> holes

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
three inches in diameter with holes

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.810 
three inches in diameter with holes
drilled<00:01:07.810> in<00:01:08.259> it<00:01:08.409> and<00:01:08.590> they're<00:01:09.280> quarter<00:01:09.640> inch

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
drilled in it and they're quarter inch

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.200 
drilled in it and they're quarter inch
holes<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:11.040> indicator<00:01:12.040> fits<00:01:12.939> in<00:01:13.090> there

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
holes and the indicator fits in there

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.840 
holes and the indicator fits in there
nicely<00:01:13.450> by<00:01:13.780> friction<00:01:14.259> fit<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.799> I<00:01:15.520> can<00:01:15.700> throw

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
nicely by friction fit and I can throw

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.609 
nicely by friction fit and I can throw
that<00:01:16.090> away<00:01:16.240> when<00:01:16.509> I'm<00:01:16.630> done<00:01:16.840> didn't<00:01:17.170> cost<00:01:17.409> a

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
that away when I'm done didn't cost a

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.360 
that away when I'm done didn't cost a
dime<00:01:17.800> now<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:19.810> are<00:01:19.960> two<00:01:20.260> different<00:01:20.650> ways<00:01:20.860> to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
dime now there are two different ways to

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.930 
dime now there are two different ways to
different<00:01:21.880> thoughts<00:01:22.330> on<00:01:23.370> what<00:01:24.370> to<00:01:24.520> do<00:01:24.670> here

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
different thoughts on what to do here

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.570 
different thoughts on what to do here
now<00:01:25.090> what<00:01:25.510> we're<00:01:25.630> going<00:01:25.750> to<00:01:25.780> do<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.200> indicate

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
now what we're going to do is indicate

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.399 
now what we're going to do is indicate
we're<00:01:27.580> gonna<00:01:27.670> run<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.060> indicator<00:01:28.570> around<00:01:28.840> the

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
we're gonna run the indicator around the

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.890 
we're gonna run the indicator around the
tailstock<00:01:29.860> quill<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:30.670> see<00:01:31.240> if<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.540> reading

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
tailstock quill and see if the reading

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.870 
tailstock quill and see if the reading
is<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.170> same<00:01:32.409> on<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.740> front<00:01:32.770> as<00:01:33.190> it<00:01:33.430> is<00:01:33.550> on<00:01:33.760> the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
is the same on the front as it is on the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.590 
is the same on the front as it is on the
back<00:01:34.500> now<00:01:35.500> that<00:01:36.010> is<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.340> good<00:01:36.610> method<00:01:36.880> if<00:01:37.330> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
back now that is a good method if the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.870 
back now that is a good method if the
hole<00:01:40.600> in<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.140> quill<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.710> tapered<00:01:42.700> hole

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
hole in the quill the tapered hole

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.000 
hole in the quill the tapered hole
number<00:01:43.180> three<00:01:43.510> Morse<00:01:43.840> taper<00:01:44.049> is<00:01:44.440> truly

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
number three Morse taper is truly

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.500 
number three Morse taper is truly
concentric<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.049> outside<00:01:47.979> if<00:01:48.549> it's<00:01:49.330> not

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
concentric with the outside if it's not

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.240 
concentric with the outside if it's not
concentric<00:01:50.260> of<00:01:50.380> course<00:01:50.620> you're<00:01:50.799> gonna<00:01:50.979> get<00:01:51.190> a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
concentric of course you're gonna get a

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.390 
concentric of course you're gonna get a
false<00:01:51.610> reading<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.590> I'm<00:01:53.860> gonna<00:01:53.950> do<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.250> both

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
false reading so I'm gonna do it both

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.719 
false reading so I'm gonna do it both
ways<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.840> other<00:01:56.020> way<00:01:56.260> is<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.619> use<00:01:57.190> a<00:01:57.220> very<00:01:57.460> nice

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
ways the other way is to use a very nice

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.990 
ways the other way is to use a very nice
accurate<00:01:58.090> Center<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:58.869> make<00:01:59.770> sure<00:01:59.950> your<00:02:00.130> quill

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
accurate Center and make sure your quill

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.060 
accurate Center and make sure your quill
hole<00:02:01.299> is<00:02:01.570> clean<00:02:01.810> when<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.110> install<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.560> and

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
hole is clean when you install that and

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.730 
hole is clean when you install that and
we're<00:02:03.340> going<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.670> indicate<00:02:04.000> around<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
we're going to indicate around the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.230 
we're going to indicate around the
center<00:02:06.159> and<00:02:06.280> I<00:02:06.310> think<00:02:06.520> that's<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.880> preferred

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
center and I think that's the preferred

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.749 
center and I think that's the preferred
method<00:02:07.750> now<00:02:08.470> should<00:02:08.799> you<00:02:08.830> run<00:02:09.099> the<00:02:09.250> indicator

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
method now should you run the indicator

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.880 
method now should you run the indicator
around<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.420> quill<00:02:10.689> here<00:02:11.080> remember<00:02:11.650> there's<00:02:11.830> a

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
around the quill here remember there's a

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.979 
around the quill here remember there's a
key<00:02:12.129> way<00:02:12.370> in<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.670> bottom<00:02:12.790> so<00:02:13.569> you<00:02:13.599> don't<00:02:13.689> want

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
key way in the bottom so you don't want

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.860 
key way in the bottom so you don't want
the<00:02:14.110> key<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.920> plunger<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.610> go<00:02:16.150> into<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.540> and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
the key the plunger to go into that and

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.350 
the key the plunger to go into that and
break<00:02:17.200> off<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:18.189> you<00:02:18.250> really<00:02:18.610> are<00:02:19.120> only

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
break off so you really are only

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.900 
break off so you really are only
interested<00:02:20.110> in<00:02:20.200> 180<00:02:20.769> degrees<00:02:21.159> of<00:02:21.189> rotation

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
interested in 180 degrees of rotation

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.570 
interested in 180 degrees of rotation
from<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.120> front<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.140> back

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
from the front to the back

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.550 
from the front to the back
also<00:02:25.580> when<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.880> do<00:02:26.090> these<00:02:26.840> make<00:02:27.170> sure<00:02:27.200> that

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
also when you do these make sure that

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.470 
also when you do these make sure that
your<00:02:27.740> tail<00:02:27.920> stock<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.610> locked<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.300> bed

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
with this and that you lock the quill

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.960 
with this and that you lock the quill
because<00:02:35.810> up<00:02:36.280> surprisingly<00:02:37.280> enough<00:02:37.640> as<00:02:37.940> you

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
because up surprisingly enough as you

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
we've got the setup made here and this

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.380 
we've got the setup made here and this
indicator<00:02:56.840> is<00:02:57.140> in<00:02:57.350> contact<00:02:57.920> with<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.910> outside

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
indicator is in contact with the outside

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.330 
indicator is in contact with the outside
of<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.690> quill<00:02:59.960> and<00:03:00.320> I<00:03:01.310> set<00:03:01.640> this<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.180> zero<00:03:03.340> like

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
of the quill and I set this to zero like

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.940 
of the quill and I set this to zero like
Wow<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:05.450> I'm<00:03:06.170> going<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.560> revolve<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:08.950> spindle

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
Wow and I'm going to revolve the spindle

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.130 
Wow and I'm going to revolve the spindle
180<00:03:10.700> degrees<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.480> we'll<00:03:11.630> see<00:03:11.810> what<00:03:11.990> the

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
180 degrees and we'll see what the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.770 
180 degrees and we'll see what the
reading<00:03:12.500> is<00:03:12.650> on<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.070> back<00:03:13.250> side<00:03:13.480> I'm<00:03:14.480> going<00:03:14.720> to

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
reading is on the back side I'm going to

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.000 
reading is on the back side I'm going to
look<00:03:14.930> in<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.170> mirror<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:15.530> don't<00:03:15.650> know<00:03:15.890> if

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
look in the mirror I don't know if

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.130 
look in the mirror I don't know if
that's<00:03:16.160> gonna<00:03:16.310> show<00:03:16.550> or<00:03:16.760> not<00:03:16.880> never<00:03:17.570> turn<00:03:17.990> the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
that's gonna show or not never turn the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.130 
that's gonna show or not never turn the
switch<00:03:18.350> on<00:03:18.560> now<00:03:19.240> so<00:03:20.240> we're<00:03:20.390> gonna<00:03:20.480> rotate<00:03:20.720> this

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
switch on now so we're gonna rotate this

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.240 
switch on now so we're gonna rotate this
around<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:23.570> it's<00:03:23.750> exactly<00:03:24.380> on<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.680> other<00:03:24.860> side

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
around so it's exactly on the other side

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.500 
around so it's exactly on the other side
and<00:03:25.870> we<00:03:26.870> are<00:03:27.080> getting<00:03:27.350> in<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:28.820> mirror<00:03:29.060> there

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.830 

five<00:03:32.510> thousands<00:03:33.140> off<00:03:33.290> so<00:03:34.010> using<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.790> two<00:03:35.030> key

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
five thousands off so using the two key

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.930 
five thousands off so using the two key
method<00:03:36.350> here<00:03:36.560> I'm<00:03:36.770> going<00:03:37.160> to<00:03:39.670> work<00:03:40.670> one

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
method here I'm going to work one

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.330 
method here I'm going to work one
against<00:03:41.300> the<00:03:41.480> other<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:41.960> move<00:03:42.170> move<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.190> two

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
against the other and move move it two

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.640 
against the other and move move it two
and<00:03:43.490> a<00:03:43.550> half<00:03:43.700> thousands<00:03:44.270> which<00:03:45.230> isn't<00:03:45.440> much

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
and a half thousands which isn't much

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:55.060 
and a half thousands which isn't much
okay<00:03:48.650> now<00:03:49.310> I'm<00:03:49.400> gonna<00:03:49.520> bring<00:03:49.700> it<00:03:49.850> back<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:54.070> put

okay now I'm gonna bring it back and put
that<00:03:55.100> on<00:03:55.400> zero<00:03:55.760> I<00:03:56.090> don't<00:03:56.420> expect<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:56.930> be

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
that on zero I don't expect it to be

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.550 
that on zero I don't expect it to be
perfect<00:03:57.500> yet<00:03:57.680> rook<00:03:58.030> rotate<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.270> spindle<00:04:00.580> and

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
perfect yet rook rotate the spindle and

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.600 
perfect yet rook rotate the spindle and
we<00:04:03.560> are<00:04:04.450> 1000th<00:04:05.450> off<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:06.650> I'm<00:04:07.250> gonna<00:04:07.430> take

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:16.530 
we are 1000th off and I'm gonna take
half<00:04:07.880> of<00:04:08.030> that

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.350 

and<00:04:18.090> tada<00:04:19.120> it's<00:04:19.630> right<00:04:20.170> on<00:04:20.670> now<00:04:21.670> I<00:04:21.700> would<00:04:22.150> then

tighten these not real tight one against

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.520 
tighten these not real tight one against
the<00:04:24.880> other<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:25.360> take<00:04:25.510> another<00:04:25.780> reading<00:04:26.110> to

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
the other and take another reading to

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.420 
the other and take another reading to
make<00:04:26.710> sure<00:04:26.920> that<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.280> has<00:04:27.760> not<00:04:27.970> moved<00:04:29.430> I'm

nice high speed center that's in a real
good<00:04:45.820> condition<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.480> move<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.170> indicator<00:04:47.620> and

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
good condition I move the indicator and

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.360 
good condition I move the indicator and
my<00:04:49.570> expensive<00:04:50.290> holder<00:04:50.650> here<00:04:50.860> from<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.220> inch

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
my expensive holder here from the inch

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.820 
my expensive holder here from the inch
and<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.640> half<00:04:51.670> or<00:04:52.540> inch<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:52.930> quarter<00:04:53.110> hole<00:04:53.470> to

a what a hole this one inch from the

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.860 
a what a hole this one inch from the
center<00:04:58.350> now<00:04:59.350> I<00:04:59.910> brought<00:05:00.910> that<00:05:01.120> up<00:05:01.180> into<00:05:01.570> about

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
center now I brought that up into about

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.160 
center now I brought that up into about
the<00:05:02.050> horizontal<00:05:02.740> position<00:05:02.890> I<00:05:03.460> have<00:05:04.450> locked<00:05:04.840> to

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
the horizontal position I have locked to

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.910 
the horizontal position I have locked to
my<00:05:05.350> tail<00:05:06.250> stock<00:05:06.670> and<00:05:07.090> I've<00:05:08.020> locked<00:05:08.290> to<00:05:08.620> quill

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
my tail stock and I've locked to quill

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
my tail stock and I've locked to quill
and<00:05:10.170> let's<00:05:11.170> revolve<00:05:11.620> this<00:05:12.010> around<00:05:12.430> now<00:05:12.730> and

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
and let's revolve this around now and

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.260 
and let's revolve this around now and
see<00:05:13.180> if<00:05:13.300> it's<00:05:13.480> the<00:05:13.660> same<00:05:13.690> where<00:05:14.560> on<00:05:14.740> zero<00:05:15.040> as<00:05:15.310> it

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
see if it's the same where on zero as it

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.400 
see if it's the same where on zero as it
was<00:05:17.490> using<00:05:18.490> the<00:05:18.790> other<00:05:18.910> method<00:05:19.060> of<00:05:19.840> all<00:05:20.050> that

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
was using the other method of all that

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.440 
was using the other method of all that
around<00:05:20.710> and<00:05:23.610> bring<00:05:24.610> that<00:05:24.760> over<00:05:24.820> to<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.210> mirror

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
around and bring that over to the mirror

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.120 
around and bring that over to the mirror
to<00:05:25.600> show<00:05:25.840> me<00:05:26.170> I'm<00:05:26.290> not<00:05:26.620> lying<00:05:26.950> and<00:05:28.800> it's<00:05:29.800> right

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
to show me I'm not lying and it's right

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.330 
to show me I'm not lying and it's right
on<00:05:30.370> zero<00:05:31.590> if<00:05:32.590> that<00:05:32.890> shows<00:05:33.460> up<00:05:33.760> I<00:05:34.000> hope<00:05:34.180> it<00:05:34.390> does

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
on zero if that shows up I hope it does

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.880 
on zero if that shows up I hope it does
and<00:05:36.340> I'm<00:05:36.520> very<00:05:36.820> satisfied<00:05:37.330> now<00:05:38.050> that<00:05:38.080> those

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:47.520 

centers<00:05:41.890> are<00:05:42.130> in<00:05:42.400> alignment<00:05:42.730> now<00:05:43.200> and<00:05:44.460> I<00:05:46.530> think

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
centers are in alignment now and I think

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.830 
centers are in alignment now and I think
this<00:05:47.710> is<00:05:47.860> a<00:05:47.890> very<00:05:48.100> good<00:05:48.460> method<00:05:48.700> to<00:05:48.910> use<00:05:49.150> also

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
this is a very good method to use also

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.100 
this is a very good method to use also
this<00:05:50.350> shows<00:05:50.620> that<00:05:50.890> the<00:05:52.080> my<00:05:53.080> fears<00:05:54.540> about<00:05:55.540> this

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
this shows that the my fears about this

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.810 
this shows that the my fears about this
whole<00:05:56.620> being<00:05:58.770> not<00:05:59.770> concentric<00:06:00.550> with<00:06:00.760> the

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
whole being not concentric with the

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.800 
whole being not concentric with the
outside<00:06:01.360> of<00:06:01.510> the<00:06:01.600> quill<00:06:01.810> we're<00:06:02.590> all<00:06:02.880> false<00:06:03.880> and

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
outside of the quill we're all false and

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.990 
outside of the quill we're all false and
it<00:06:04.960> truly<00:06:05.350> is<00:06:05.470> concentric<00:06:06.100> and<00:06:06.250> well-built

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
it truly is concentric and well-built

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.110 
it truly is concentric and well-built
this<00:06:07.840> is<00:06:07.960> a<00:06:07.990> good<00:06:08.170> lathe<00:06:08.410> so<00:06:08.770> now<00:06:09.700> we<00:06:09.760> know<00:06:10.090> that

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
this is a good lathe so now we know that

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.720 
this is a good lathe so now we know that
Sun<00:06:10.600> Center<00:06:11.050> it<00:06:11.620> doesn't<00:06:11.980> really<00:06:12.100> do<00:06:12.340> any<00:06:12.550> good

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
Sun Center it doesn't really do any good

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.690 
Sun Center it doesn't really do any good
to<00:06:12.910> look<00:06:13.120> down<00:06:13.360> here<00:06:13.870> at<00:06:14.710> the<00:06:14.950> witness<00:06:15.340> marks

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
to look down here at the witness marks

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.910 
to look down here at the witness marks
because<00:06:16.000> they're<00:06:16.120> gonna<00:06:16.270> show<00:06:16.540> zero<00:06:16.930> even<00:06:17.710> if

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
because they're gonna show zero even if

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.980 
because they're gonna show zero even if
they<00:06:18.100> are<00:06:18.280> as<00:06:18.820> close<00:06:19.000> as<00:06:19.330> you<00:06:19.480> can<00:06:19.600> get<00:06:19.780> with

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
they are as close as you can get with

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.710 
they are as close as you can get with
the<00:06:20.080> eyeball<00:06:21.060> it<00:06:22.060> will<00:06:22.270> be<00:06:22.420> a<00:06:22.450> different

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
the eyeball it will be a different

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.150 
the eyeball it will be a different
reading<00:06:23.080> than<00:06:23.380> what<00:06:23.530> you<00:06:23.680> get<00:06:23.860> with<00:06:24.040> an

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
reading than what you get with an

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.030 
reading than what you get with an
indicator<00:06:24.960> this<00:06:25.960> is<00:06:26.140> a<00:06:26.170> very<00:06:26.530> good<00:06:26.830> method

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
indicator this is a very good method

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.280 
indicator this is a very good method
many<00:06:27.910> different<00:06:28.300> kinds<00:06:28.570> of<00:06:28.630> indicators<00:06:29.080> are

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290 
many different kinds of indicators are
