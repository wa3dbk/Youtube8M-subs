block low and then block the second him
it<00:01:11.640> got<00:01:11.909> actually<00:01:12.240> optus<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:12.689> sand<00:01:12.840> blocks

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
it got actually optus like sand blocks

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.359 
it got actually optus like sand blocks
almost<00:01:13.350> every<00:01:13.530> street<00:01:13.680> as<00:01:13.830> she<00:01:13.950> could<00:01:14.070> use<00:01:14.220> on

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
almost every street as she could use on

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.830 
almost every street as she could use on
her<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.119> one<00:01:15.240> good<00:01:15.390> way<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.570> get<00:01:15.720> out<00:01:15.810> of

her so it's one good way to get out of
her<00:01:15.990> mix<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.470> she<00:01:16.530> doesn't<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:16.920> have

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
her mix up so she doesn't really have

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.160 
her mix up so she doesn't really have
any<00:01:17.310> second<00:01:17.670> hit<00:01:17.759> lows<00:01:17.939> she<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.600> mean<00:01:18.630> she<00:01:18.840> does
