 tachograph and today representatives 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.230
 businesses that are concerned 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.689
 innovations collected manufacturers 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.550
 equipment good deal at first glance 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.740
 causes a lot of questions and disturbances 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.359
 Juliana Tretyak learned how much 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.370
 will cost safe fun under 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.140
 name tachograph

 here it is on the station square here 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.860

 setting drivers on high tones 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.720
 seasoning all the censorship vocabulary 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.000
 discuss the new law from April 1 all 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.190
 carriers and safe because tachographs 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.180
 on foreign cars they already have on Russian 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.489
 officials require 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.900
 Domestic device Why do you need 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.460
 route is not needed schedule respected 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.070
 speed limit exceed road compare 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.589
 allow on the guard frame leading multiple 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.540
 time we have buses go busuluk 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.490
 Orenburg eagle Jarno we transport 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.620
 passengers on the register us a document from 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.650
 ministries deviation from the route 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.320
 we are unacceptable and we have a tachograph 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.480
 determines the mode of operation of the driver 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.280
 the mode of operation is one we drive one by one and 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.210
 the same route then there are four hours in 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.520
 2 hours journey 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.230
 the driver is resting and again 4 hours back 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.050
 we all have one all day 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.270
 but this wonderful device that will save 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.460
 Russian roads from the accident he fixes 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.470
 speed route is the main running time 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.960
 driver's four and a half hours in let 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.700
 her 45 minutes of rest check execution 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.170
 labor regime and road rules 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.990
 movement can every employee 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.000
 traffic police simply taking the device 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.490
 listing is like a check for 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.280
 use of these devices in other 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.160
 countries shows that the accident rate 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.050
 cause driver fatigue decreases 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.260
 about thirty percent that is it 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.080
 really need it necessary 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.140
 the time has come 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.060
 lead these norms to our country here only 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.700
 tachographs device is not cheap 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.480
 one device costs about 50 thousand 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.880
 rubles 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.920
 participants say that money is hard 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.110
 find against devices made even 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.300
 large companies such as water canal 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.890
 one burgo energy and gas for several years 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.290
 they were also obliged to set back 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.040
 system glonass the entire fleet for 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.830
 of control 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.630
 this is enough to be equipped 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.150
 tachographs those vehicles 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.350
 who deduct commercial traffic 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.110
 cargo and passengers 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.450
 Our company does not send commercial 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.250
 transportation of goods and passengers, and the point 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.760
 We believe that our tachographs are not 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.000
 are needed 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.070
 however, representatives of the authorities 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.930
 to a slightly different opinion on the new law 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.030
 truckers complain about many 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.550
 Russian trucks install tachograph 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.280
 no technical possibility fines 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.220
 they say they will not let the driver survive from 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.550
 thousand to three 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.900
 host cars from 5 to 10 thousand 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.130
 for sli unrealistic rates for 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.880
 trucking 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.880
 very low unjustified what to do 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:12.800
 shut down and everything is nothing like a bridge stocking 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.790
 Well, it's impossible to live like that 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.190
 no one 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.430
 shipping freight is low again 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.430
 repeat hergana treyak to hand
