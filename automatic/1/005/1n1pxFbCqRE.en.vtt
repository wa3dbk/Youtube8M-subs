00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
I laid down on the first table and on

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.349 
I laid down on the first table and on
that<00:02:51.440> first<00:02:51.650> table<00:02:52.069> this<00:02:52.220> was<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.700> procedure

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
that first table this was the procedure

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.390 
that first table this was the procedure
that<00:02:53.599> they<00:02:53.720> used<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.139> actually<00:02:54.410> create<00:02:55.250> the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
that they used to actually create the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.759 
that they used to actually create the
flap<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:56.030> access<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.720> cornea<00:02:57.109> one<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.680> the

flap to access the cornea one of the

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.440 
flap to access the cornea one of the
reasons<00:02:57.919> that<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.430> particularly<00:02:58.940> wanted<00:02:59.329> to

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
reasons that I particularly wanted to

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.449 
reasons that I particularly wanted to
use<00:02:59.599> dr.<00:02:59.989> blue<00:03:00.200> was<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.560> ability<00:03:00.919> on<00:03:01.310> this

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
use dr. blue was the ability on this

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.659 
use dr. blue was the ability on this
first<00:03:01.700> table<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.329> access<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.500> cornea<00:03:04.250> by

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:04.669 
first table to access the cornea by

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.360 
first table to access the cornea by
accessing<00:03:05.569> through<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.049> lens<00:03:06.319> and<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:06.799> fact

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
accessing through the lens and the fact

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.870 
accessing through the lens and the fact
that<00:03:07.459> he<00:03:07.639> used<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.180> laser<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:09.260> access<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.459> area

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
that he used a laser to access that area

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.729 
that he used a laser to access that area
as<00:03:11.060> opposed<00:03:11.389> to<00:03:11.660> some<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:12.169> other<00:03:12.200> doctors

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
as opposed to some of the other doctors

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.409 
as opposed to some of the other doctors
that<00:03:12.829> are<00:03:12.980> researched<00:03:13.310> use<00:03:13.700> old<00:03:13.940> machines

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
that are researched use old machines

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.180 
that are researched use old machines
that<00:03:14.720> actually<00:03:15.079> access<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:15.650> with<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:15.799> blade

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
that actually access it with a blade

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.460 
that actually access it with a blade
that<00:03:16.549> made<00:03:17.120> me<00:03:17.239> feel<00:03:17.389> a<00:03:17.450> lot<00:03:17.690> better<00:03:17.750> we<00:03:18.230> moved

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
that made me feel a lot better we moved

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.289 
that made me feel a lot better we moved
on<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:19.040> second<00:03:19.430> laser<00:03:19.579> which<00:03:20.030> actually

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
on to the second laser which actually
