important thing to do for for because of

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
an earthquake because if you're if it

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.170 
an earthquake because if you're if it
tips<00:00:19.650> over<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.130> can<00:00:20.279> actually<00:00:20.460> start<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.939> fire

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
tips over it can actually start a fire

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.269 
tips over it can actually start a fire
whether<00:00:21.869> it's<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.140> gas<00:00:22.320> or<00:00:22.590> an<00:00:22.650> electric<00:00:23.070> unit

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
whether it's a gas or an electric unit

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.429 
whether it's a gas or an electric unit
and<00:00:23.640> also<00:00:24.180> because<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.840> could<00:00:24.960> potentially<00:00:24.990> be

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
and also because it could potentially be

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.380 
and also because it could potentially be
a<00:00:25.590> source<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.099> water<00:00:26.340> for<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.119> want<00:00:27.330> to

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
a source of water for you so you want to

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.490 
a source of water for you so you want to
make<00:00:27.510> sure<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.140> good<00:00:28.170> working

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
make sure that it's in good working

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.109 
make sure that it's in good working
order<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.519> not<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.910> fall<00:00:30.090> down

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
order that it's not going to fall down

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.790 
order that it's not going to fall down
and<00:00:30.630> crash<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> water<00:00:31.410> goes<00:00:31.619> everywhere

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
and crash and the water goes everywhere

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.290 
and crash and the water goes everywhere
so<00:00:32.279> that's<00:00:32.399> something<00:00:32.700> that's<00:00:32.850> an<00:00:32.940> important

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
so that's something that's an important

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.549 
so that's something that's an important
thing<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.510> keep<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.750> mind<00:00:33.809> as<00:00:34.140> well

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
thing to keep in mind as well

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.560 
thing to keep in mind as well
so<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.520> strap<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.940> you'd<00:00:36.059> go<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.270> your<00:00:36.360> local

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
so to strap it you'd go to your local

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.959 
so to strap it you'd go to your local
hardware<00:00:37.079> store<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.680> buy<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> kit<00:00:38.250> if<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.520> ask

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
hardware store and buy a kit if you ask

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.459 
hardware store and buy a kit if you ask
the<00:00:39.270> staff<00:00:39.480> there<00:00:39.750> they'll<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.050> able<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> point

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the staff there they'll be able to point

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.569 
the staff there they'll be able to point
you<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> right<00:00:40.860> direction

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you in the right direction

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.910 
you in the right direction
it's<00:00:42.090> pretty<00:00:42.329> easy<00:00:42.600> we're<00:00:43.590> not<00:00:43.739> actually

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
it's pretty easy we're not actually

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.619 
it's pretty easy we're not actually
going<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.340> attach<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.180> sort<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.450> give

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
going to attach it so just sort of give

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.290 
going to attach it so just sort of give
you<00:00:45.750> an<00:00:45.899> idea<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.820> I've<00:00:47.820> got<00:00:47.969> my<00:00:48.090> lovely

loop it through the piece that you
already<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:37.259> we're<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.680> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
already have and then we're going to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.410 
already have and then we're going to
bolt<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.220> women<00:01:38.640> into<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> wall<00:01:39.240> once

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
bolt this women into the wall once

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.330 
bolt this women into the wall once
you've<00:01:39.570> gotten<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> right<00:01:40.380> length<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
you've gotten it to the right length and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.280 
you've gotten it to the right length and
then<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.939> repeat<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.360> twice<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.200> up

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
then you repeat that twice you do it up

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.749 
then you repeat that twice you do it up
here<00:01:43.500> at<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> bottom<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.130> also<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.579> the
