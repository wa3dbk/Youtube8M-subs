00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
is about half of right

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.270 
is about half of right
now<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.450> you're<00:04:15.960> driven<00:04:16.140> on<00:04:16.410> most<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
now and you're driven on most of the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.280

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
know that that we didn't do as well the

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.670 
know that that we didn't do as well the
first<00:04:54.450> time<00:04:54.630> because<00:04:54.840> it<00:04:55.110> was<00:04:55.230> early<00:04:55.350> in<00:04:55.590> the

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
first time because it was early in the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.280 
first time because it was early in the
season<00:04:55.919> and<00:04:56.340> I've<00:04:57.180> learned<00:04:57.480> a<00:04:57.600> lot<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:58.020> team's

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
season and I've learned a lot the team's

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.130 
season and I've learned a lot the team's
learned<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.770> lot<00:04:58.919> and<00:04:59.340> we've<00:04:59.940> got<00:05:00.120> a<00:05:00.150> lot<00:05:01.110> to

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
learned a lot and we've got a lot to

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.090 
learned a lot and we've got a lot to
come<00:05:01.890> back<00:05:02.100> with

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.590 

rest<00:05:06.100> it<00:05:06.250> would<00:05:06.370> be<00:05:06.520> too<00:05:06.700> surprising<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.420> see

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
rest it would be too surprising to see

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.090 
rest it would be too surprising to see

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
Westar cut pretty soon maybe well

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.640 
Westar cut pretty soon maybe well
there's<00:05:10.690> no<00:05:10.780> doubt<00:05:10.930> about<00:05:10.990> it<00:05:11.200> Ned

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
there's no doubt about it Ned
