00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
mister it's the fresh fog cooling mist

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.600 
mister it's the fresh fog cooling mist
system<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:08.780> bought<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:09.900> off<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.710> bottle<00:00:11.580> of

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
system and bought it off of a bottle of

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.180 
system and bought it off of a bottle of
a<00:00:11.730> VM<00:00:12.059> innovations<00:00:12.559> website<00:00:13.559> directly<00:00:13.950> but

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
a VM innovations website directly but

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.560 
a VM innovations website directly but
they<00:00:14.250> also<00:00:14.370> sell<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:14.790> eBay<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.389> think

they also sell on eBay and I think
Amazon<00:00:16.020> as<00:00:16.170> well<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:17.100> they<00:00:17.460> have<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.760> best

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029

mister is actually a lot cheaper than

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.939 
mister is actually a lot cheaper than
pretty<00:00:26.939> much<00:00:27.029> any<00:00:27.330> mister<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.470> could<00:00:28.680> find

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
pretty much any mister that I could find

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.160 
pretty much any mister that I could find
that<00:00:29.250> uses<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.210> actually<00:00:30.539> as<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.660> compressor

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
that uses that actually as a compressor

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.340 
that uses that actually as a compressor
on<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.730> pumps<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.390> higher<00:00:34.020> pressure

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
on it and pumps out a higher pressure

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.819 
on it and pumps out a higher pressure
stream<00:00:34.980> if<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.090> guys<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.590> seen<00:00:37.590> my<00:00:37.800> other

videos<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:40.230> misting<00:00:40.559> system<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.129> is

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
videos and the misting system in here is

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.950 
videos and the misting system in here is
just<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.460> cheap<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.690> those<00:00:42.750> cheap

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
just a cheap like one of those cheap

patio misters that just just use this

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.920 
patio misters that just just use this
hose<00:00:46.770> pressure<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.460> it's<00:00:48.149> more<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.629> kind<00:00:48.870> of

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
hose pressure so it's more like kind of

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.240 
hose pressure so it's more like kind of
like<00:00:49.020> an<00:00:49.110> upside<00:00:49.379> down<00:00:49.410> sprinkler<00:00:49.980> than<00:00:50.160> an

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
these high-pressure hoses and I just got

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.060 
these high-pressure hoses and I just got
it<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:03.059> one<00:01:03.239> actually<00:01:03.420> has<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:04.320> enough<00:01:04.619> to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
it this one actually has just enough to

run all the way down to one end and all
the<00:01:08.010> way<00:01:08.189> back<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.820> end

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the way back to this end

need in here gets there and how much it

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.480 
need in here gets there and how much it
puts<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:15.890> greenhouse<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.070> 24

like<00:01:42.659> they're<00:01:42.869> kind<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.110> frail<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.649> they<00:01:43.829> are

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
like they're kind of frail but they are

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.899 
like they're kind of frail but they are
they're<00:01:44.430> doing<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:44.820> fine<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.360> far<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:46.909> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
they're doing just fine so far of the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.039 
they're doing just fine so far of the
other<00:01:48.060> nice<00:01:48.270> thing<00:01:48.450> about<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.750> thing<00:01:48.899> is

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
other nice thing about this thing is

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.389 
other nice thing about this thing is
portable<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:50.009> all<00:01:50.430> fits<00:01:50.790> into<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> little

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
portable it all fits into like a little

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.950 
portable it all fits into like a little
toolbox<00:01:53.399> that's<00:01:53.610> about<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:53.970> 1<00:01:54.570> foot<00:01:54.780> by<00:01:54.899> 2

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
toolbox that's about like 1 foot by 2

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.289 
toolbox that's about like 1 foot by 2
foot<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.590> dimension<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:57.030> kind<00:01:57.270> of

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
foot and dimension so that's kind of

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.429 
foot and dimension so that's kind of
neat<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.689> could<00:01:57.810> actually<00:01:57.930> take<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.320> with

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
neat so you could actually take it with

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.190

is a little noisy but it's not like you
know<00:03:27.409> ridiculously<00:03:28.040> loud<00:03:28.340> especially

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
know ridiculously loud especially

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.089 
know ridiculously loud especially
compared<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.329> all<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:29.599> other<00:03:29.930> noise<00:03:30.199> of<00:03:30.409> the

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
compared to all the other noise of the

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.619 
compared to all the other noise of the
water<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.579> running<00:03:31.819> water<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.180> yours<00:03:32.299> making

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
water the running water and yours making

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.839 
water the running water and yours making
anyway<00:03:33.010> but<00:03:34.010> as<00:03:34.129> you<00:03:34.250> can<00:03:34.340> see<00:03:34.400> this<00:03:34.579> thing<00:03:34.819> is

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
anyway but as you can see this thing is

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.939 
anyway but as you can see this thing is
like<00:03:35.799> filling<00:03:36.799> up<00:03:36.949> the<00:03:37.189> greenhouse<00:03:37.909> with<00:03:38.239> fog

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
like filling up the greenhouse with fog

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.250 
like filling up the greenhouse with fog
which<00:03:39.949> is<00:03:40.099> awesome<00:03:40.569> so<00:03:41.569> I've<00:03:41.750> really<00:03:41.870> only<00:03:41.989> got

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
which is awesome so I've really only got

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.050 
which is awesome so I've really only got
to<00:03:42.349> run<00:03:42.500> it<00:03:42.680> for<00:03:42.949> just<00:03:43.129> a<00:03:43.219> few<00:03:43.370> minutes<00:03:43.519> even

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
to run it for just a few minutes even

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.599 
to run it for just a few minutes even
though<00:03:44.239> my<00:03:45.019> timers<00:03:45.530> like<00:03:45.889> on<00:03:46.069> 30-minute

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
though my timers like on 30-minute

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.189 
though my timers like on 30-minute
intervals<00:03:46.939> I'm<00:03:47.359> probably<00:03:47.629> only<00:03:47.810> gonna<00:03:47.959> run<00:03:48.139> it

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199 
intervals I'm probably only gonna run it

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.709 
intervals I'm probably only gonna run it
for<00:03:48.319> thirty<00:03:48.500> minutes<00:03:48.829> every<00:03:49.449> couple<00:03:50.449> hours

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:50.719 
for thirty minutes every couple hours

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:53.020 
for thirty minutes every couple hours
during<00:03:51.049> the<00:03:51.199> hottest<00:03:51.409> part<00:03:51.739> of<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:51.859> day<00:03:52.030> and

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
during the hottest part of the day and

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.240 
during the hottest part of the day and
right<00:03:53.389> now<00:03:53.540> I've<00:03:53.689> actually<00:03:53.840> got<00:03:54.639> I've<00:03:55.639> got<00:03:55.699> the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
right now I've actually got I've got the

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.089 
right now I've actually got I've got the
flaps<00:03:58.250> open<00:03:58.669> on<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.970> greenhouse<00:03:59.720> so<00:04:00.079> a<00:04:00.379> lot<00:04:01.069> of

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
flaps open on the greenhouse so a lot of

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:09.110 
flaps open on the greenhouse so a lot of
the<00:04:01.310> fog<00:04:01.609> is<00:04:01.790> coming<00:04:01.909> out<00:04:02.209> but

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.970 

so<00:04:10.739> now<00:04:11.739> that<00:04:11.799> one's<00:04:13.049> closed<00:04:14.049> up<00:04:14.349> in<00:04:14.650> this

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
so now that one's closed up in this

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.670 
so now that one's closed up in this
other<00:04:15.190> hand<00:04:15.459> is<00:04:15.930> beginning<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:16.959> get<00:04:17.169> closed<00:04:17.410> up

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
other hand is beginning to get closed up
