00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.410 
100 1600 ISO film
and<00:03:42.700> so<00:03:43.700> it's<00:03:43.819> very<00:03:44.480> convenient

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420

tool<00:03:50.360> it's<00:03:51.230> very<00:03:51.349> useful<00:03:51.890> because<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:53.620> lot<00:03:54.620> of

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
tool it's very useful because a lot of

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.580 
tool it's very useful because a lot of
times<00:03:54.890> I<00:03:55.069> have<00:03:55.580> to<00:03:55.760> switch<00:03:55.970> between<00:03:56.150> ISOs<00:03:57.140> so

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
times I have to switch between ISOs so

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.920 
times I have to switch between ISOs so
this<00:03:57.800> allows<00:03:58.040> me<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.430> change<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:59.739> change<00:04:00.739> a
