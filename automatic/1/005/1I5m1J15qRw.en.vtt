be<00:01:11.840> all<00:01:11.990> bloody<00:01:12.290> particularly<00:01:13.220> as<00:01:13.280> we<00:01:13.430> go<00:01:13.580> into

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
be all bloody particularly as we go into

be all bloody particularly as we go into
the<00:01:14.000> short<00:01:14.240> days<00:01:14.710> he<00:01:15.710> becomes<00:01:16.100> more

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
the short days he becomes more

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.859 
the short days he becomes more
aggressive<00:01:16.990> with<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.110> others<00:01:19.390> whenever<00:01:20.390> one

handles the Rams this is I have a roll
with<00:01:24.050> all<00:01:24.170> my<00:01:24.380> interns<00:01:24.830> right<00:01:25.160> now<00:01:25.369> that<00:01:26.000> no

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
with all my interns right now that no

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.660 
with all my interns right now that no
one<00:01:26.390> can<00:01:26.539> go<00:01:26.690> into<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.020> ramp<00:01:27.229> in<00:01:27.500> alone<00:01:27.979> just

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
one can go into the ramp in alone just

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.580 
one can go into the ramp in alone just
because<00:01:29.000> as<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.330> day's<00:01:29.539> become<00:01:29.960> shorter<00:01:30.020> they

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
because as the day's become shorter they

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.580 
because as the day's become shorter they
become<00:01:30.950> more<00:01:31.130> aggressive<00:01:31.600> I<00:01:32.600> wouldn't<00:01:33.140> advise

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
become more aggressive I wouldn't advise

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.920 
become more aggressive I wouldn't advise
anyone<00:01:34.190> probably<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.700> handle<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:35.119> ram<00:01:35.390> other

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
anyone probably to handle this ram other

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.650 
anyone probably to handle this ram other
than<00:01:36.259> myself<00:01:36.740> I've<00:01:36.950> raised<00:01:37.280> him<00:01:37.550> but<00:01:38.240> even<00:01:38.420> I

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
than myself I've raised him but even I

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.650 
than myself I've raised him but even I
don't<00:01:38.720> go<00:01:39.259> into<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.649> pens<00:01:39.860> by<00:01:40.070> myself<00:01:40.660> during

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
don't go into the pens by myself during

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.540 
don't go into the pens by myself during
the<00:01:41.810> breeding<00:01:42.110> season<00:01:42.259> they<00:01:42.740> just<00:01:43.009> a<00:01:43.160> really

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
the breeding season they just a really

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.749 
the breeding season they just a really
rough<00:01:44.500> their<00:01:45.500> minds<00:01:45.860> are<00:01:45.950> on<00:01:46.070> hormones<00:01:46.520> and

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
rough their minds are on hormones and

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.219 
rough their minds are on hormones and
that's<00:01:46.940> about<00:01:47.149> all<00:01:47.300> that<00:01:47.479> they're<00:01:47.840> thinking

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
that's about all that they're thinking

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.580 
that's about all that they're thinking
about<00:01:48.320> whenever<00:01:49.250> we're<00:01:49.490> housing<00:01:49.910> Rams<00:01:50.590> but

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
about whenever we're housing Rams but

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.070 
about whenever we're housing Rams but
usually<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:53.060> normal<00:01:53.300> fencing<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:53.959> we

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
usually the the normal fencing that we

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.230 
usually the the normal fencing that we
would<00:01:54.289> use<00:01:54.470> for<00:01:54.500> use<00:01:54.950> is<00:01:55.250> not<00:01:55.610> sufficient

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
would use for use is not sufficient

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.029 
would use for use is not sufficient
because<00:01:56.330> they're<00:01:56.899> they're<00:01:57.890> always<00:01:58.479> fighting

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
because they're they're always fighting

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.919 
because they're they're always fighting
establishing<00:02:01.039> dominance<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.729> I<00:02:02.209> try<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.539> put

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
establishing dominance and I try to put

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.589 
establishing dominance and I try to put
in<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:03.170> stronger<00:02:03.619> fence<00:02:04.000> maybe<00:02:05.000> even<00:02:05.300> stronger

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
in a stronger fence maybe even stronger

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:10.120 
in a stronger fence maybe even stronger
that<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.869> candle<00:02:06.229> panel<00:02:07.149> use<00:02:08.740> livestock<00:02:09.740> panels

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
that a candle panel use livestock panels

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.900 
that a candle panel use livestock panels
to<00:02:10.670> hold<00:02:10.849> them<00:02:11.000> in<00:02:11.180> or<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.930> permanent<00:02:12.410> fence

to hold them in or a permanent fence

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.980 
to hold them in or a permanent fence
particularly<00:02:13.910> during<00:02:14.150> breeding<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.660> have<00:02:14.840> to

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
particularly during breeding you have to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.100 
particularly during breeding you have to
have<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.620> animals<00:02:16.599> separated<00:02:17.599> because<00:02:17.959> if

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
have the animals separated because if

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.050 
have the animals separated because if
you<00:02:18.230> have<00:02:18.349> two<00:02:18.560> Rams<00:02:18.800> side-by-side<00:02:19.550> one<00:02:19.849> ram

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
you have two Rams side-by-side one ram

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.690 
you have two Rams side-by-side one ram
will<00:02:20.300> be<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:20.840> with<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.110> other<00:02:21.260> Ram<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.800> they

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
will be and with the other Ram and they

it onto your property it there is a

novel pathogens and maybe not anything

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.319 
novel pathogens and maybe not anything
that's<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:19.949> danger<00:04:20.489> but<00:04:20.729> something<00:04:21.299> that
