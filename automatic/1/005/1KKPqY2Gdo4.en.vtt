felt like they attempted to do that with

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.350 
felt like they attempted to do that with

that the environment is none of that

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.280 
that the environment is none of that
stuff<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:59.150> like<00:03:00.150> come<00:03:00.630> it's<00:03:00.930> bad<00:03:01.260> hit

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
stuff is like come it's bad hit

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.890 
stuff is like come it's bad hit
detection<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:02.519> your<00:03:02.790> connection<00:03:03.150> going<00:03:03.600> up

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
detection is your connection going up

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.789 
detection is your connection going up
and<00:03:04.080> down<00:03:04.170> it's<00:03:04.650> ridiculous<00:03:05.750> funds<00:03:06.799> the

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
and down it's ridiculous funds the

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.460 
and down it's ridiculous funds the
spawns<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.610> game<00:03:08.850> are<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.450> bad<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:10.140> I'm

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
spawns in this game are so bad that I'm

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.819 
spawns in this game are so bad that I'm
convinced<00:03:11.360> it<00:03:12.360> can't<00:03:12.600> be<00:03:12.720> an<00:03:12.810> accident<00:03:13.019> you

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
convinced it can't be an accident you

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.130 
convinced it can't be an accident you
don't<00:03:14.010> accidentally<00:03:14.880> get<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.239> sponsors<00:03:15.900> back

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
don't accidentally get the sponsors back

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.560 
don't accidentally get the sponsors back
so<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:17.100> believe<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.850> whole<00:03:18.000> idea<00:03:18.239> with

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
so I believe that the whole idea with

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.470 
so I believe that the whole idea with
responses<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.350> try<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.739> encourage<00:03:20.489> movement<00:03:21.239> I

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
responses to try to encourage movement I

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.000 
responses to try to encourage movement I
think<00:03:22.049> that's<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.290> deal<00:03:22.500> because<00:03:22.739> we

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
think that's the deal because we

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.550 
think that's the deal because we
complain<00:03:23.370> about<00:03:23.519> cameras<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:24.269> much<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:25.470> they

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
complain about cameras so much that they

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.319 
complain about cameras so much that they
tried<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.799> make<00:03:25.950> camping<00:03:26.519> heart<00:03:26.790> in<00:03:26.970> your<00:03:27.060> game

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
tried to make camping heart in your game

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.870 
tried to make camping heart in your game
and<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.540> think<00:03:27.840> they've<00:03:28.019> succeeded<00:03:28.579> the<00:03:29.579> only

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
and I think they've succeeded the only

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.170 
and I think they've succeeded the only
problem<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:31.200> spawns<00:03:31.560> are<00:03:31.799> also<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:32.609> random

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
problem is the spawns are also so random

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.030 
problem is the spawns are also so random
that<00:03:33.329> sometimes<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.049> punishes<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.650> when<00:03:34.890> your

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
that sometimes it punishes you when your

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.190 
that sometimes it punishes you when your
night<00:03:35.280> camping<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:36.329> can<00:03:36.540> be<00:03:36.690> moving<00:03:36.959> around

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
night camping you can be moving around

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.990 
night camping you can be moving around
and<00:03:37.680> feel<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.190> just<00:03:38.340> randomly<00:03:38.700> pop

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
and feel that it just randomly pop

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.509 
and feel that it just randomly pop
somebody<00:03:39.359> behind<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.989> so<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.739> don't<00:03:41.220> know<00:03:41.430> I

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
somebody behind you so I don't know I

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.090 
somebody behind you so I don't know I
guess<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:42.359> want<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.019> applaud<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.530> effort<00:03:43.950> the

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
guess I want to applaud the effort the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.099 
guess I want to applaud the effort the
effort<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.579> definitely<00:03:45.120> there<00:03:45.359> to<00:03:45.930> encourage

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
the maps the maps let me just say this

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.550 
the maps the maps let me just say this
depending<00:05:25.490> on<00:05:25.610> you<00:05:25.850> ask<00:05:26.120> a<00:05:26.510> lot<00:05:26.990> of<00:05:27.260> people

will take our food is the best kind the
way<00:05:29.600> I<00:05:29.630> get<00:05:29.900> to<00:05:29.930> no<00:05:30.110> matter<00:05:30.320> what<00:05:30.500> they<00:05:30.620> say<00:05:30.650> I

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
way I get to no matter what they say I

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.490 
way I get to no matter what they say I
say<00:05:31.850> that<00:05:32.000> car<00:05:32.210> for<00:05:32.539> was<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:32.870> best<00:05:33.110> card<00:05:33.380> ever

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
say that car for was the best card ever

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.940 
say that car for was the best card ever
and<00:05:34.010> if<00:05:34.310> you<00:05:34.490> look<00:05:34.700> back<00:05:35.000> it<00:05:35.990> was<00:05:36.260> probably<00:05:36.500> one

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
and if you look back it was probably one

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.279 
and if you look back it was probably one
of<00:05:36.979> the<00:05:37.190> more<00:05:37.370> simple<00:05:37.760> call<00:05:38.150> of<00:05:38.300> duty<00:05:38.570> the

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
of the more simple call of duty the

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.600 
of the more simple call of duty the
killstreaks<00:05:39.889> was<00:05:40.039> just<00:05:40.190> three<00:05:40.400> five<00:05:40.580> and

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
killstreaks was just three five and

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.510 
killstreaks was just three five and
seven<00:05:40.850> they<00:05:41.389> didn't<00:05:41.600> get<00:05:41.720> to<00:05:41.930> too<00:05:42.800> crazy<00:05:43.130> there

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
seven they didn't get to too crazy there

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.360 
seven they didn't get to too crazy there
and<00:05:43.789> the<00:05:44.330> maps<00:05:44.630> a<00:05:44.870> lot<00:05:45.110> of<00:05:45.260> maps<00:05:45.470> was<00:05:45.770> one<00:05:46.130> and

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
and the maps a lot of maps was one and

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.940 
and the maps a lot of maps was one and
two<00:05:46.639> level<00:05:47.030> maps<00:05:47.270> and<00:05:47.570> I<00:05:47.660> felt<00:05:47.960> like<00:05:48.110> that's

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
two level maps and I felt like that's

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.219 
two level maps and I felt like that's
what<00:05:49.160> I<00:05:49.220> liked<00:05:49.580> about<00:05:49.760> it<00:05:49.970> with<00:05:50.630> these<00:05:50.840> math

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
what I liked about it with these math

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.089 
what I liked about it with these math
pounds<00:05:51.710> three<00:05:52.130> four<00:05:52.490> five<00:05:52.910> levels<00:05:54.099> things

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
pounds three four five levels things

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:58.360 
pounds three four five levels things
moving<00:05:55.940> stuff<00:05:56.360> all<00:05:56.570> over<00:05:56.599> the<00:05:57.080> place<00:05:57.349> I<00:05:57.680> don't

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
moving stuff all over the place I don't

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.820 
moving stuff all over the place I don't
know<00:05:58.460> it's<00:05:58.639> just<00:05:58.789> tough<00:05:59.180> for<00:05:59.210> me<00:05:59.539> to<00:05:59.690> to<00:06:00.530> play

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
know it's just tough for me to to play

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.719 
know it's just tough for me to to play
my<00:06:01.220> style<00:06:01.610> on<00:06:02.360> these<00:06:02.660> maps<00:06:02.930> so<00:06:03.650> I<00:06:03.889> guess<00:06:04.250> it's

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
my style on these maps so I guess it's

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.879 
my style on these maps so I guess it's
time<00:06:04.910> for<00:06:04.970> me<00:06:05.180> to<00:06:05.360> retire<00:06:05.660> that<00:06:05.720> style<00:06:06.169> I<00:06:06.410> need

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
time for me to retire that style I need

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.670 
time for me to retire that style I need
to<00:06:07.010> be<00:06:07.190> more<00:06:07.490> cautious<00:06:08.330> more<00:06:08.930> cloaking<00:06:09.410> dagger

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
to be more cautious more cloaking dagger

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.390 
to be more cautious more cloaking dagger
and<00:06:10.099> make<00:06:10.700> you<00:06:11.389> know<00:06:11.539> more<00:06:12.139> calculated<00:06:12.889> move<00:06:13.070> I

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
and make you know more calculated move I

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.339 
and make you know more calculated move I
like<00:06:13.760> to<00:06:13.880> just<00:06:14.060> strap<00:06:14.360> up<00:06:14.539> with<00:06:14.690> an<00:06:14.780> SMG<00:06:15.110> and

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:19.659 
doing that out there are some smaller

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:21.480 
doing that out there are some smaller
maps<00:06:19.990> one<00:06:20.409> map<00:06:20.590> I<00:06:20.740> don't<00:06:20.889> know<00:06:20.979> the<00:06:21.069> name<00:06:21.219> of<00:06:21.250> it

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
maps one map I don't know the name of it

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.969 
maps one map I don't know the name of it
but<00:06:21.550> it<00:06:21.759> once<00:06:22.000> map<00:06:22.270> map<00:06:22.990> is<00:06:23.199> super<00:06:23.469> small<00:06:23.680> I

but it once map map is super small I
like<00:06:24.550> that<00:06:24.759> map<00:06:25.030> I<00:06:25.240> usually<00:06:25.449> get<00:06:25.750> the<00:06:25.870> shotgun

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
like that map I usually get the shotgun

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.749 
like that map I usually get the shotgun
out<00:06:26.530> there<00:06:26.770> and<00:06:26.889> I<00:06:26.949> have<00:06:26.979> a<00:06:27.129> pretty<00:06:27.340> good<00:06:27.460> time

we've been asking for we've been saying

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:49.619 
we've been asking for we've been saying
we<00:06:47.500> want<00:06:47.620> something<00:06:48.009> different<00:06:48.219> and<00:06:48.629> it's

we want something different and it's

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:52.170 
we want something different and it's
definitely<00:06:50.169> different<00:06:50.560> I<00:06:51.009> if<00:06:51.550> they<00:06:51.759> could<00:06:51.969> get

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
definitely different I if they could get

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.439 
definitely different I if they could get
the<00:06:53.110> hit<00:06:53.349> detection<00:06:53.729> fix<00:06:54.729> the<00:06:54.969> hit<00:06:55.330> detection

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:55.449 
the hit detection fix the hit detection

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:57.209 
the hit detection fix the hit detection
is<00:06:55.900> a<00:06:55.930> big<00:06:56.259> one<00:06:56.439> you<00:06:56.560> got<00:06:56.770> to<00:06:56.889> get<00:06:56.979> the<00:06:57.069> hit

00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:57.219 
is a big one you got to get the hit

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:59.490 
is a big one you got to get the hit
detection<00:06:57.340> fixed<00:06:58.060> and<00:06:58.449> get<00:06:58.810> the<00:06:58.930> connections

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
detection fixed and get the connections

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.080 
detection fixed and get the connections
to<00:06:59.710> hold<00:06:59.919> more<00:07:00.159> steady<00:07:00.580> where<00:07:00.849> they're<00:07:00.969> not

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.090 
to hold more steady where they're not

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.300 
to hold more steady where they're not
fluctuating<00:07:01.779> like<00:07:02.020> they<00:07:02.199> are<00:07:02.379> and<00:07:02.620> this<00:07:03.069> could
