this<00:00:00.659> is<00:00:00.840> my<00:00:01.079> Cooper<00:00:01.920> lighting<00:00:02.159> 70<00:00:03.090> watt<00:00:03.270> metal

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
this is my Cooper lighting 70 watt metal

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.480 
this is my Cooper lighting 70 watt metal
halide<00:00:04.170> area<00:00:04.950> light<00:00:05.220> with<00:00:05.850> 10<00:00:06.180> inch<00:00:06.390> reflector

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
halide area light with 10 inch reflector

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.860 
halide area light with 10 inch reflector
now<00:00:08.490> as<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.790> can<00:00:08.940> see<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.360> reflector<00:00:10.050> has<00:00:10.920> a

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
now as you can see this reflector has a

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.980 
now as you can see this reflector has a
cover<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:13.170> its<00:00:13.349> lens<00:00:13.969> that<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.240> for<00:00:15.540> when<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
cover on its lens that is for when the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.950 
cover on its lens that is for when the
metal<00:00:16.470> halide<00:00:17.060> explodes<00:00:18.060> at<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.510> end<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.810> its

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
metal halide explodes at the end of its

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.759 
metal halide explodes at the end of its
life<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:20.750> ballast<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.050> here<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.529> course

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
life the ballast is in here of course

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.279 
life the ballast is in here of course
and<00:00:24.289> this<00:00:25.289> fixture<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.039> 120<00:00:26.730> volt<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.359> has<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
and this fixture is 120 volt it has a

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.720 
and this fixture is 120 volt it has a
twist<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.070> lock<00:00:29.250> photocell<00:00:30.769> now<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:32.279> might<00:00:32.520> as

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
twist and lock photocell now we might as

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:42.040 
twist and lock photocell now we might as
well<00:00:32.759> plug<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:34.520> here<00:00:35.520> we<00:00:35.670> go

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.840 

it's<00:00:42.560> very<00:00:42.920> quiet<00:00:44.440> it<00:00:45.440> has<00:00:45.560> a<00:00:45.770> clear<00:00:46.250> bulb<00:00:46.580> in

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
it's very quiet it has a clear bulb in
