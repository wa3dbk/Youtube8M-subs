00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.660
 today I'm going to start a tutorial on 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.559
 how 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:12.790
 good as on how to use the trainer in 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:15.250
 just the 3 because it is not the trainer that is 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.390
 super wonder but it is a trainer 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.070
 simple is a strange little trainer 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.060
 it's simple really again the 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.630
 Mantra is very simple 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.720
 we start by opening them in level 3 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.590
 everything normal, if it came from the engine 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:37.520
 here was because I did the hack to 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.440
 get the money in mercenaries that 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.440
 they do not know then soon 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.470
 I would be uploading the video 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:55.920
 this is the trailer I'm going to leave you the 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:00.950
 country down here in the description of 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:05.290
 video the link where you can download the 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.290
 the good trainer 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.240
 with a gun 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.610
 and does not do anything that gun 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.540
 is very very slow is not as effective in 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.830
 change that here obviously obviously all 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.830
 they know the strong of the hand 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.350
 this acquires a good back one 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.659
 recommendation when you already read in 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.520
 the mind I do not know what it means have 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.159
 to give it out later because if not 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.819
 when in the new close without if 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.329
 I know if you forget them in what we put 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:52.100
 problems because really that's where 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.950
 one realizes 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.670
 calamaro because they start to come out 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.560
 magnum example of mole and it appears many 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.650
 many many many many more things 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.100
 consecutive and after that I do not know 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.979
 can do anything really this and good 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.090
 we continue with the description means 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.750
 that is safe 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.380
 and ours have taken the whole city 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:25.830
 but good let's continue 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:29.340
 excuse me good since we have the map 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.200
 we choose good we will not lose the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.200
 time really because 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.760
 a little limited 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:47.700
 well we go really fast this 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.090
 good for example I need with the 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.670
 trailer I need it like that very difficult 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.670
 you have never been what you are 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.560
 white box 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.220
 they have to give it to you because if it does not happen it 's what 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.720
 I just happened to appear two or 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.720
 many consecutive 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.010
 good that you I'm wrong I 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:24.050
 first aid as well as this this 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.460
 This and good have welcomed him Peruvian 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.350
 I think my tutorial ends here 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.590
