00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello here is at Amazon and today 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.180
 I would like to briefly with you 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.069
 talk about what she thinks about it 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.769
 that the xp pig is now in the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.830
 distance mode I is not finds 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.210
 so good for the simple reason that others 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.180
 pig in my opinion meaningful 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.220
 are and now I exist now 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.490
 the chance that I get a franchise 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.080
 I do not need it at all I am too 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.990
 very much surprised that blizzard now 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.269
 give the experts a boat out of the simple one 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.980
 Because she's about two-three 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.850
 weeks have said no they want 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.680
 do not install 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.570
 other pigs are in full as well 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.360
 example rage or the protection 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.140
 yell yeah i was totally the one 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.730
 same opinion 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.079
 Now you have your opinion 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.750
 changed the xp screaming comes in 1.05 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.059
 that means for me I have one 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.390
 second additional I scream 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.820
 actually do not need why 2 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.079
 For the simple reason 2 I need 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.440
 For example, do not shout the ms 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.799
 yes someday everyone will be in the level 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.350
 be where he max mf where he xp the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.420
 pig I needed and then it will be like that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.220
 be your run through the map that comes 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.580
 in and then you have an experiment 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.680
 everything does not help me much better 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.369
 would be rage or protection 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.439
 you think 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.020
 I do not think much of that one 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.950
 exploit is installed 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.720
 I would also like to know what you are 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.220
 think about whether you like it or not 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.840
 if you find it bad, I know completely 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.210
 it's just that people have little time 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.820
 to let and no 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.780
 items have the more xp bring 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.280
 that will be good 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.780
 but i believe in endcontent this one has 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.880
 absolutely nothing at all 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.689
 search 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.000
 There will also be two additional ones 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.310
 stones implemented in the game 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 I think that is very good that is once 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.159
 a letter from you with speed and 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.810
 Pickup radius increased and the second 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.710
 screaming is resources regeneration and 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.439
 how cool it down 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.110
 these are two good carpenter should there 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.960
 good job says but with the xp 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.700
 yell yes yes I know I ok 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.099
 look forward to your comments that was 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.900

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.709
