00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
happy that her whole face was basically

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.620 
happy that her whole face was basically
in<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> jelly<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.060> there<00:01:42.390> was<00:01:42.509> no

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
in the jelly and that there was no

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.289 
in the jelly and that there was no
bubbles<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.259> then<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.189> kind<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.670> bent<00:01:44.880> her<00:01:45.060> legs

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
bubbles and then I kind of bent her legs

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.510 
bubbles and then I kind of bent her legs
up<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.200> she<00:01:46.500> couldn't<00:01:46.950> stay<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.310> that

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
up so that she couldn't stay in that

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.330 
up so that she couldn't stay in that
position<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.270> basically<00:01:49.020> placed<00:01:49.920> her<00:01:50.100> legs

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
position and I basically placed her legs

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.690 
position and I basically placed her legs
against<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:51.299> think<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.869> jug<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.110> water<00:01:52.700> so

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
against I think it's a jug of water so

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.219 
against I think it's a jug of water so
there<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.390> go<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.720> resting<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
there there you go it's resting on the

part I knew some skin colored fondant
and<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:36.300> use<00:02:36.990> some<00:02:37.440> cauliflower<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:38.040> dust<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.180 
and I use some cauliflower to dust the
mold<00:02:39.000> first<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.870> then<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.470> just<00:02:40.650> press<00:02:40.920> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
mold first and then I just press the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.630 
mold first and then I just press the
fondant<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.200> then<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.320> peeled<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.160> out<00:02:44.340> it

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
fondant in and then I peeled it out it

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.240 
fondant in and then I peeled it out it
came<00:02:45.000> out<00:02:45.150> fairly<00:02:45.510> easily<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:46.860> just<00:02:46.890> had<00:02:47.160> to

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
came out fairly easily you just had to

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.800 
came out fairly easily you just had to
make<00:02:47.370> sure<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.790> pressed<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.240> far<00:02:48.660> enough

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
make sure that you pressed it far enough

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.540 
make sure that you pressed it far enough
so<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.350> got<00:02:49.500> all<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.680> little<00:02:49.890> details<00:02:50.430> of

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
so that it got all the little details of

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.670 
so that it got all the little details of
the<00:02:50.700> face<00:02:50.850> like<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.300> nose<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.810> mouth<00:02:51.840> and

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
the face like the nose and the mouth and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.040 
the face like the nose and the mouth and
then<00:02:53.340> if<00:02:53.430> there<00:02:53.580> was<00:02:53.700> any<00:02:53.850> excess<00:02:54.240> left<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.750> just

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
then if there was any excess left I just

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.840 
then if there was any excess left I just
trim<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.470> excess<00:02:55.770> off<00:02:55.950> with<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.190> with<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.610> knife

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
trim the excess off with a with a knife

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.630 
trim the excess off with a with a knife
I<00:02:57.350> find<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.560> need<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.800> do<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.950> few<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.400> them

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
I find that you need to do a few of them

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.120 
I find that you need to do a few of them
just<00:03:00.390> in<00:03:00.510> case<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.440> mess<00:03:01.680> one<00:03:01.830> up<00:03:01.980> when

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130
