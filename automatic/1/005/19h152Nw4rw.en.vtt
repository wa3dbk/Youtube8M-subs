00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello to six hairs from this one 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.569
 week candy Wednesday a video every week 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.300
 upload 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.280
 with a tip about her this week 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.889
 are we going to talk about curls or about 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.230
 flags stomach lays they are a lot of flight in 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.720
 the but still you know and like me 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.480
 shows, however, she has curls 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.699
 and she really likes that 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.070
 often wants to build them in on a lot 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.840
 I had other places out then 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.510
 at first a little bit on dark 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.620
 see oil or another product and this is 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.260
 to make sure the curls or the flag 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.960
 stick well and that yes that 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.059
 I actually get better divorced 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.420
 use quite large for that 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.920
 Products 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.200
 I don't want to have noticed that and one 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.670
 product is better than the other you need 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.710
 lucky enough that you do super 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.949
 great think leave it here for a while 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.180
 when I get to the bottom I am too tired 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.270
 the products I use in 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.949
 for example the elvive extraordinary 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.859
 euro and then I really have a very small one 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.780
 little then also the products about cooking 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:10.140
 with polio formula so actually just 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:14.430
 pasty axis than I have to in yet 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:21.630
 unite i really read good mint too 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:25.619
 with you like the Christmas 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.909
 then i still have the gliss kur disc hour 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.299
 me again 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.369
 and last but not least the paul mitchell 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.150
 smoothing then I really use it whole 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.190
 small 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.130
 the only thing that does this , for example 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:43.350
 quite because of really a pressure on all 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.240
 birds not that in my hands and this 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.940
 holds by the bottom found her 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.400
 actually sat after that I can do it whole 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.970
 quietly through a very wide comb 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.890
 so actually the only thing i do i do 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.310
 take you to grow then you can 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.440
 see here the 4 strands of braid with ribbon 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.850
 a coma of beautiful curls 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.130
 and as you can see it is now one 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.560
 bit of a mess 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.670
 I'm going to get this out and then I'm going late 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.670
 see what you should be able to do 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.450
 I now have the four strands of braids 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.400
 pulled out 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.740
 as you can see it is pretty fluffy here 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.400
 Now if you will go with a brush 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.230
 to comb 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.350
 like showing a piece you have here 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.860
 who wants curls then you can 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.990
 it actually a yes a bit off 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.520
 each other and fruit fluffy 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.990
 a kind of work from the actually one 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.000
 kind of sin 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.830
 So what do I do then you can 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.180
 of course , a normal one was also different 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.130
 comb from other skein grab these here 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.620
 I did it come true but actually 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.630
 divided into it very much 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.200
 and then south strict for strict too 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:12.460
 have to do so what do i do i take one 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.240
 little bit this case 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.770
 disc hour hair repair cream oil 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.540
 from me it doesn't matter which 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.690
 taking oil 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.870
 glam this really a drop 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:31.150
 I rub both hands and with that 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.650
 I go through the curls and so not really 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.840
 on top of the head 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.820
 they are naturally scraps of greasy hair 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:45.760
 nothing needed above us 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:48.220
 so and then I take the broad comb 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.680
 really coarse may still be cool I just have one 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.670
 other group can and now I can 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.670
 just keep it on so that all the fluff is covered 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.830
 you mainly see that on top 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.770
 to disappear 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.330
 so you have curly hair that you 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.760
 then can use again for one 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.350
 on a different hairstyle memory and hair 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.930
 make mouth worse for it 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.630
 that can be absorbed by the criminals 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.130
 you this week if you own a tip or 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.739
