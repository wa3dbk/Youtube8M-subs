 Hello is against the wedding advisor thank you 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.850
 Today, before you are driven by all means 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:18.560
 I think you'll be able to rescue gasoline and put in sand 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:21.650
 Software I have work that I would like you to do us the day as the same work at the timing 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.160
 An adjustment of air pressure in car tires 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:29.900
 Please try to do it is amazing so easy will teach ways 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.380
 First of all, please borrow such equipment in the stand and think that you can lend it for free 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.700
 I will 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.329
 Or a 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:39.470
 There may be mechanical connection, so please check with Sanji 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.250
 It is a standard that how much air should be put in 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.970
 That in the case of current domestic cars do not do up 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.970
 it's here 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:56.480
 Driver's or passenger's door pillar 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.780
 Sure this Iue around the anterior column of the front of the door 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.540
 Please take a look at this a 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.870
 Check incisor seal of Miyazu are affixed to 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.460
 Numbers are written all the silver gun 24 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:13.299
 There are written 2.5 brackets, but after all 2.4 kg 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:17.810
 Please refer to this figure as it is a standard of putting in air. 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.210
 No, let's actually put it in a little too easy for women 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.080
 eh 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.080
 I'm doing a little bit 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.210
 First of all 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.979
 Bike a little entered users had that 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.640
 It is easy to lose it by removing the cap of the air inlet 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:38.650
 Don't lose it , hold it with your hand and point to the nozzle as it is 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.890
 Thus pointing bent when referring to nozzle 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.860
 Straight refers to because it is you missing more and more air 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.900
 It will also be non-stop in the state by loosening the bracket 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.500
 Well then how long do you really need it? 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.500
 I am doing 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.140
 Please refer to this gauge now If the gauge is a little bit gas station 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:07.380
 There is also If you are crazy, but is fine rule of thumb 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:12.060
 The needle is pointing at 2.2 places right now, so it is not enough for a good evening until 4 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.240
 When the nozzle am press this lever is air enters the hand 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.690
 It is such a form 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.140
 Woman has a little Ippei 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.470
 If you put too much and put in too much 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.470
 For example 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.780
 You have 2.55 qualification . 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.130
 I'm sorry if you can go ahead for a little while, so take it out and put it back once more 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.760
 Do 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.760
 I will be back 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.780
 2.4 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.860
 Please faces suit room It is perfect this number 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.610
 And the adjustment in such form because that would much or If you do not unplug Panashi Ya leakage 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.510
 Please 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.810
 Do not forget to tighten the cap at the end 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.510
 This same task 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:58.640
 You can adjust the air pressure if it is possible to go advent both before 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.750
 It is roughly in this bear actually form that had little left EiYoshi months coat to the operation 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.610
 I do not have 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.299
 It depends on the weather in just one month, but now from Marnie to comma 4 dark air is directed towards nature 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.190
 To go 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:12.480
 There is also a problem with the outside air 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.190
 By adjusting this and crying, of course it becomes easier to operate the steering wheel 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.110
 The actual item changes 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.300
 Since it improves fuel economy which always is able to become incidentally put the Sun Wei or Sorin 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.060
 And has become effective 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.350
 It's so easy it doesn't take 5 minutes so please go 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.550
 Still there 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.550
 We introduce in person video
