like that now we're cool with this right
we're<00:01:27.600> totally<00:01:27.780> fine<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.380> fact<00:01:28.560> I

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
we're totally fine with it in fact I

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.620 
we're totally fine with it in fact I
think<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.250> lite<00:01:29.610> version<00:01:29.850> isn't<00:01:30.420> it

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
think that is the lite version isn't it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.999 
think that is the lite version isn't it
when<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.960> won't<00:01:31.110> let<00:01:31.229> me<00:01:31.350> bring<00:01:31.710> anything

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
when you won't let me bring anything

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.830 
when you won't let me bring anything
else<00:01:32.280> into<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> kitchen<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.240> has<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> be

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
to make in our sauce how much longer

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.110 
to make in our sauce how much longer
were<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:26.980> take<00:02:27.129> it<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.459> didn't<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:28.000> it

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
were to take it we didn't have it

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.050 
were to take it we didn't have it
covered<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:29.620> would<00:02:29.829> take<00:02:30.060> considerably

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
covered it would take considerably

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.210 
covered it would take considerably
longer<00:02:31.150> actually<00:02:31.690> by<00:02:32.349> putting<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.739> lid<00:02:32.950> on<00:02:33.069> it

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
longer actually by putting the lid on it

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.250 
longer actually by putting the lid on it
what<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:33.519> doing<00:02:33.760> is<00:02:33.849> it's<00:02:34.060> creating<00:02:34.269> steam<00:02:35.200> a

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
what it's doing is it's creating steam a

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.720 
what it's doing is it's creating steam a
lot<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.709> steam<00:02:35.920> though<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.370> line<00:02:36.549> is

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
lot of steam though the line is

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.220 
lot of steam though the line is
evaporating<00:02:37.299> through<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.540> little<00:02:37.690> hole<00:02:37.780> in

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
evaporating through the little hole in

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.460 
evaporating through the little hole in
the<00:02:38.379> lid<00:02:38.560> but<00:02:39.489> it's<00:02:39.640> not<00:02:39.849> evaporating<00:02:40.599> all<00:02:41.170> of

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
the lid but it's not evaporating all of

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.140 
the lid but it's not evaporating all of
it<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.739> it's<00:02:41.799> really<00:02:42.370> slow<00:02:42.700> cooking

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
it and it's really slow cooking

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.990 
it and it's really slow cooking
condensing<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:43.930> flavors<00:02:44.319> of<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.500> wine<00:02:44.680> and

very nicely and cook much more rapidly
very<00:02:49.930> popular<00:02:50.440> popular<00:02:50.739> technique<00:02:51.430> we're

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
very popular popular technique we're

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.449 
very popular popular technique we're
going<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.060> give<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.329> another<00:02:52.569> I<00:02:53.310> would<00:02:54.310> say

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
going to give this another I would say

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.300 
going to give this another I would say
10<00:02:54.760> minutes<00:02:55.150> maximum<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> pan<00:02:56.560> all<00:02:56.980> these

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
10 minutes maximum in the pan all these

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.650 
10 minutes maximum in the pan all these
flavors<00:02:57.519> will<00:02:57.790> come<00:02:57.910> together<00:02:58.150> nicely<00:02:58.299> and

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
flavors will come together nicely and

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.449 
flavors will come together nicely and
that's<00:02:58.780> actually<00:02:59.139> going<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.380> make<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.680> sauce<00:03:00.099> in

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
that's actually going to make a sauce in

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.650 
that's actually going to make a sauce in
the<00:03:00.700> pan<00:03:00.880> that's<00:03:01.180> all<00:03:01.269> going<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.510> cook

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
the pan that's all going to cook
