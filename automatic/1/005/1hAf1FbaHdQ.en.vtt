00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:03.590
 And yes, the direction is already set 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.420
 After the uranium mining performance of Peter Löscher Patrick rotates ground 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.549
 and now comes the returned 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.979
 I was alright 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.729
 a better life in the Urals 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.200
 how do I look 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.190
 the one bad guys 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.230
 like the high school student secret mission 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.200
 So Marga is on the price 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.700
 "You can not just be there, it's difficult, he also works 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.920
 which is the highest, how is their new identity? 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.900
 then they stay alive 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.420
 the combatants take place 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.170
 one of the best players on this planet 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.390
 it's an honor 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.810
 at the meeting the rest of the team 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.500
 are on a mission partitioned off, it had a hostile territory 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.350
 wet feet 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.350
 Can complete performance tests 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.770
 you want that was so nice - it's like it's kind of ok or somehow 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.770
 does not work usually has to stand 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680
 and are Longo chestnut 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 Siffert graduated 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.370
 the Cat with him at the latest when I know against this person and love that 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.080
 is pulled 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.780
 as it is now 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.780
 the optimum is played 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.050
 So that's sort of you had in the first part of our customers 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.780
 So a floodlit detail this also was not in debt - double 1 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.970
 and have there 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.430
 then this the mirrored euro climbs 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.980
 Nino 51 got out and 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.689
 It does not always have to be Ritalin and Nils Dreyer 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.139
 And now Paul is dead yet uncertain 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.139
 that is extremely challenging 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.139
 Picture APA 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.139
 I have to go back to the team 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.769
 you are you we are number one 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.859
 this Entertain 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.040
 I am sure is dressed up in honor of Tristan 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.179
 and whether 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.179
 Blugirl hours 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.529
 would 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.529
 it is right that every 2 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.449
 made especially cool in the face and in the snow and so on 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:16.139
 for the image 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.139
 I think this is going well 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:26.339
 In addition, a crater is colchicine 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.709
 something like that wants the game Munich / dapd the same 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:33.929
 century 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:42.409
 Economics Minister allow them 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.339
 so is the jock worrying display reimbursed 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:47.389
 Dr not yet 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.569
 October asked for auction 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.159
 yes that would be too big, it counts as a stuffy usually relative 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.989
 he lets himself 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.619
 up to 60 people 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:00.069
 Solis is that she gives something like that 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.069
 rtr 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.629
 therefore advises 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:11.609
 father 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.029
 So I feel like maternity protection defender Affolter foul first 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.659
 that is not yet the students make their mark in the snow on the declining 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.590
 trend 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.210
 "I had forbidden me once he uses comparison months played weekends 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.210
 and were good Entrup finally, but the power looks 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.330
 Although really should be so Modern Warfare 2 has Apple - whether the children are not only on 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.270
 priest 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.430
 No a first trailer instruction of the water with over water 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.900
 if she does that relatively well 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:49.559
 APA 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.559
 continue 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.799
 You have to see between the Federation and the countries how they are doing 

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:00.839
 good and we are 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:02.620
 Stolberg 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.620
 Müller, he explained 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.710
 "Really bad" go 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.210
 and 6 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.650
 in the offices 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.889
 for a new partner 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.419
 had unknown 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.419
 why is 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.430
 the 2 Louisville - anyway 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.789
 why is it really only one 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.900
 frustrated because so 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.900
 rtr head coach clock 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.249
 thanks to goalkeeper both the spectators he stays 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:45.060
 the papers of the euro country 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.889
 It is quite possible that the clamming euro countries has risen 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:53.969
 which stopped in the meantime 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.759
 Ruzicka correspond to this camp 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.759
 that's way too good 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.379
 APA 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.379
 that made life difficult for us 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.210
 Here you can see that they are getting a globe 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:24.400
 on 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.400
 of these will become 

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:31.990
 always free 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.360
 that fits Clearwire Corp unfortunately had 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.360
 become Fr 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:42.619
 Jacob Park out of sight 

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:45.939
 Last but not least one is not in the carriage on Wednesday does not go in immediately 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:47.749
 cover 

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:51.210
 the bottom of the index years 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.210
 and drive them better 

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:57.180
 which becomes his donkey lands 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.819
 Estimates of the soldiers pronounced instead
