well<00:01:31.920> made<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.370> well<00:01:32.520> engineered<00:01:36.200> now<00:01:37.200> here's

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
well made so well engineered now here's

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.740 
well made so well engineered now here's
a<00:01:37.470> look<00:01:37.620> at<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.830> home<00:01:37.980> plot<00:01:38.250> now<00:01:41.480> and<00:01:42.480> it's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
a look at the home plot now and it's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.450 
a look at the home plot now and it's
running<00:01:43.050> away<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.380> gas<00:01:43.590> actually<00:01:43.920> makes<00:01:44.280> more

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
running away the gas actually makes more

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.990 
running away the gas actually makes more
noise<00:01:44.520> than<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:44.910> the<00:01:45.000> engine<00:01:45.270> does<00:01:45.420> yeah<00:01:47.000> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
noise than what the engine does yeah the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:06.100 
noise than what the engine does yeah the
engine<00:01:48.150> source<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.350> well-balanced
