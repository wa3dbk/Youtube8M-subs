00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
of that but you know the sort of the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.780 
of that but you know the sort of the
thought<00:03:32.650> is<00:03:32.860> always<00:03:33.100> that<00:03:33.250> when<00:03:33.640> it's

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
thought is always that when it's
