can really say if you've made it all the
way<00:00:04.500> up<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:04.920> point<00:00:05.190> yeah<00:00:05.580> we<00:00:06.089> have<00:00:06.299> been

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
way up to this point yeah we have been

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.339 
way up to this point yeah we have been
looking<00:00:07.020> at<00:00:07.259> tools<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.250> options<00:00:08.670> like<00:00:09.570> crazy

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
looking at tools and options like crazy

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.799 
looking at tools and options like crazy
I<00:00:11.280> mean<00:00:11.849> we've<00:00:12.000> now<00:00:12.179> gone<00:00:12.389> through<00:00:12.630> all

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
I mean we've now gone through all

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.410 
I mean we've now gone through all
polygons<00:00:13.290> tools<00:00:13.620> all<00:00:14.309> polygons<00:00:14.910> workflows

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
polygons tools all polygons workflows

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.260 
polygons tools all polygons workflows
options<00:00:16.350> etc<00:00:16.619> we<00:00:17.160> moved<00:00:17.430> into<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.820> polygon

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
options etc we moved into the polygon

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.359 
options etc we moved into the polygon
gun<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:18.720> had<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> lot<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.109> fun<00:00:19.380> with<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.740> from

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
gun we had a lot of fun with that from

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.519 
gun we had a lot of fun with that from
there<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:20.820> took<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.060> look<00:00:21.270> at<00:00:21.510> all<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.199> NURBS

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
there we took a look at all of the NURBS

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.189 
there we took a look at all of the NURBS
tools<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.250> things<00:00:23.279> got<00:00:23.939> technical<00:00:24.840> yes<00:00:25.050> they

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
tools and things got technical yes they

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.779 
tools and things got technical yes they
did<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.380> lot<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.740> cool<00:00:26.010> stuff<00:00:26.039> there<00:00:26.430> but<00:00:26.490> then

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
did a lot of cool stuff there but then

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.490 
did a lot of cool stuff there but then
we<00:00:26.970> wrapped<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.330> all<00:00:27.449> up<00:00:27.510> with<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.869> lot<00:00:28.230> of

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
we wrapped it all up with a lot of

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.230 
we wrapped it all up with a lot of
nerves<00:00:28.830> workflow<00:00:29.369> stuff<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.880> was<00:00:30.000> nice<00:00:30.210> and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
nerves workflow stuff that was nice and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.020 
nerves workflow stuff that was nice and
smooth<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.019> made<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.070> not<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:32.730> feel<00:00:33.000> that

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
smooth and made it not really feel that

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.110 
smooth and made it not really feel that
bad<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.110> nerve<00:00:34.559> does<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:34.920> that

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
bad you know nerve does not that

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.190 
bad you know nerve does not that
something<00:00:36.120> else<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.360> get<00:00:36.480> used<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.989> then

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
something else to get used to and then

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.319 
something else to get used to and then
from<00:00:37.350> there<00:00:37.410> what<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.370> moved<00:00:38.640> into<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
from there what we do we moved into the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.750 
from there what we do we moved into the
the<00:00:39.780> goggles<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.260> little<00:00:40.530> nvg<00:00:41.070> action<00:00:41.460> will<00:00:41.670> be

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the goggles a little nvg action will be

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.400 
the goggles a little nvg action will be
using<00:00:42.000> for<00:00:42.180> our<00:00:42.450> character<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> little<00:00:43.200> bit

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
using for our character a little bit

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.380 
using for our character a little bit
later<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.620> things<00:00:44.309> are<00:00:44.520> cool<00:00:44.700> man<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.000> want<00:00:45.329> some

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
later on things are cool man I want some

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.900 
later on things are cool man I want some
mr.<00:00:45.809> mega<00:00:46.050> spy<00:00:46.379> with<00:00:46.770> his<00:00:46.980> groovy<00:00:47.489> little<00:00:47.610> toys

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
mr. mega spy with his groovy little toys

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.580 
mr. mega spy with his groovy little toys
and<00:00:48.210> all<00:00:48.300> yeah<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.020> was<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> lot<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.350> fun

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
and all yeah and that was a lot of fun

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.900 
and all yeah and that was a lot of fun
and<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.980> allowed<00:00:50.250> us<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.760> there<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
and it allowed us to get in there and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.760 
and it allowed us to get in there and
make<00:00:51.300> use<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.809> lot<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> different<00:00:52.350> NURBS

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
make use of a lot of the different NURBS

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.319 
make use of a lot of the different NURBS
tools<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.370> were<00:00:53.460> available<00:00:53.489> when<00:00:54.120> working

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
tools that were available when working

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.119 
tools that were available when working
with<00:00:54.480> curves<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.110> course<00:00:55.320> generating

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
with curves and of course generating

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.299 
with curves and of course generating
surfaces<00:00:56.730> now<00:00:57.600> before<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.620> move<00:00:58.890> into<00:00:59.129> our

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
surfaces now before we move into our

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.520 
surfaces now before we move into our
first<00:00:59.670> character<00:01:00.329> dash<00:01:00.719> which<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.350> guys

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
first character dash which as you guys

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.080 
first character dash which as you guys
know<00:01:01.559> will<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.039> completely<00:01:02.460> modeled<00:01:02.940> through

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
know will be completely modeled through

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.020 
know will be completely modeled through
NURBS<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.979> kind<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.369> mix<00:01:05.760> these

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
NURBS we are going to kind of mix these

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.630 
NURBS we are going to kind of mix these
two<00:01:06.299> worlds<00:01:06.659> together<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.380> get<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
two worlds together and get you just a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.870 
two worlds together and get you just a
little<00:01:09.119> bit<00:01:09.330> more<00:01:09.960> comfortable<00:01:10.860> pushing<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
little bit more comfortable pushing and

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.260 
little bit more comfortable pushing and
pulling<00:01:12.260> vertices<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.500> CVS<00:01:14.430> that's<00:01:15.090> right

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
pulling vertices and CVS that's right

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.399 
pulling vertices and CVS that's right
what<00:01:15.479> we're<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.869> now<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.049> we're

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
what we're going to do now is we're

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.870 
what we're going to do now is we're
going<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> model<00:01:16.950> out<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.310> Lamborghini

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
going to model out this Lamborghini

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.359 
going to model out this Lamborghini
murciélago<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.770> kind<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.100> pans

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
murciélago and is that kind of pans

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.219 
murciélago and is that kind of pans
around<00:01:20.580> it'll<00:01:20.909> kind<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.090> give<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.299> an<00:01:21.390> idea<00:01:21.630> of

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
around it'll kind of give you an idea of

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.820 
around it'll kind of give you an idea of
what's<00:01:22.799> going<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.280> there's<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.580> bad<00:01:24.170> 35<00:01:25.170> hours

going<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.939> want<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.210> tweak<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.689> know<00:01:39.810> what

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
going to want to tweak you know what

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.620 
going to want to tweak you know what
that's<00:01:40.290> fine<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.740> respect<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
that's fine I respect that but the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.719 
that's fine I respect that but the
bottom<00:01:42.990> line<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.229> here's<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.799> car<00:01:44.040> now<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.579> he

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
bottom line is here's the car now if he

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.370 
bottom line is here's the car now if he
wants<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.000> tweak<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.450> later<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:45.840> perfection

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
wants to tweak it later for perfection

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.260 
wants to tweak it later for perfection
that's<00:01:46.740> cool<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.369> encourage<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.909> guys<00:01:48.060> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that's cool and I encourage you guys to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.359 
that's cool and I encourage you guys to
tweak<00:01:48.659> as<00:01:48.810> well<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.070> love

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
tweak as well because that is the love

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.760 
tweak as well because that is the love
of<00:01:50.610> modeling<00:01:51.180> oh<00:01:51.299> yeah<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.810> about<00:01:52.439> tweaking

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
of modeling oh yeah all about tweaking

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.859 
of modeling oh yeah all about tweaking
you'll<00:01:53.369> notice<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.000> we've<00:01:54.420> not<00:01:54.630> put<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
you'll notice here that we've not put a

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.590 
you'll notice here that we've not put a
lot<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.049> detail<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.950> engine<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
lot of detail in the engine and the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.359 
lot of detail in the engine and the
undercarriage<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.780> even<00:01:58.439> less<00:01:58.710> d<00:01:58.920> well<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
undercarriage is even less d well the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.039 
undercarriage is even less d well the
undercarriage<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.880> kind<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.240> there<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
undercarriage is kind of there it's a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.719 
undercarriage is kind of there it's a
filler<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.710> nobody<00:02:01.860> logos<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.430> oh<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
filler so that nobody logos like oh the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.910 
filler so that nobody logos like oh the
cars<00:02:02.939> hollow<00:02:03.210> exactly<00:02:04.170> which<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.350> what<00:02:04.829> it

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
cars hollow exactly which is what it

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.410 
cars hollow exactly which is what it
pretty<00:02:05.189> much<00:02:05.310> was<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.759> begin<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.119> fright

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
pretty much was to begin with fright

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.710 
pretty much was to begin with fright
there<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> complete<00:02:07.259> interior<00:02:07.590> inside<00:02:08.190> and

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
there is a complete interior inside and

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.420 
there is a complete interior inside and
the<00:02:09.720> exterior<00:02:10.140> has<00:02:10.470> all<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.069> pieces<00:02:11.280> that

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the exterior has all the pieces that

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.740 
the exterior has all the pieces that
you're<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.849> find<00:02:12.060> on<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.420> real

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
you're going to find on a real

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.580 
you're going to find on a real
Lamborghini<00:02:13.349> mer

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
Lamborghini mer

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.449 
Lamborghini mer
elago<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.849> it's<00:02:15.629> been<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.200> lot<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:16.860> fun<00:02:17.040> putting

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
elago so it's been a lot of fun putting

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.509 
elago so it's been a lot of fun putting
this<00:02:17.700> together<00:02:17.849> there's<00:02:18.420> been<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.780> lot<00:02:19.319> lot<00:02:20.280> of

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
this together there's been a lot lot of

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.250 
this together there's been a lot lot of
modeling<00:02:20.940> that's<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.690> lot<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.900> time

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
modeling that's going on a lot of time

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.860 
modeling that's going on a lot of time
and<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:23.849> going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.030> mix<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.390> methods<00:02:24.750> as

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
and and it's going to mix the methods as

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.570 
and and it's going to mix the methods as
I<00:02:24.989> was<00:02:25.170> saying<00:02:25.440> basically<00:02:25.739> what<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.310> guys<00:02:26.430> are

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
I was saying basically what you guys are

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.750 
I was saying basically what you guys are
going<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.760> be<00:02:26.819> looking<00:02:27.030> at<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.690> going<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.260> be

going to be looking at is going to be

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.150 
going to be looking at is going to be

nerves at the same time as a matter of
fact<00:02:37.560> we're<00:02:37.799> going<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:37.980> begin<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.580> model<00:02:39.000> by

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
fact we're going to begin this model by

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.660 
fact we're going to begin this model by
creating<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.870> curved<00:02:40.530> network<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.580> we're

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
creating a curved network and we're

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.220 
creating a curved network and we're
going<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.849> use<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.150> NURBS<00:02:42.390> curve<00:02:42.629> network<00:02:43.019> as

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
going to use this NURBS curve network as

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.140 
going to use this NURBS curve network as
an<00:02:43.739> interesting<00:02:44.280> means<00:02:44.519> for<00:02:44.849> snapping

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
an interesting means for snapping

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.390 
an interesting means for snapping
polygons<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.319> that<00:02:46.440> we<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.680> create<00:02:46.860> raw

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
polygons so that we can create raw

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.550 
polygons so that we can create raw
polygons<00:02:48.090> which<00:02:48.599> will<00:02:48.780> allow<00:02:48.870> us<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.200> generate

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
polygons which will allow us to generate

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.740 
polygons which will allow us to generate
our<00:02:50.040> model<00:02:50.400> even<00:02:50.790> faster<00:02:51.209> than<00:02:51.360> if<00:02:51.450> we<00:02:51.540> start

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
our model even faster than if we start

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.000 
our model even faster than if we start
out<00:02:51.810> with<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.930> box<00:02:52.170> essentially<00:02:52.739> we're<00:02:52.890> going

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
out with a box essentially we're going

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.910 
out with a box essentially we're going
to<00:02:53.069> take<00:02:53.310> our<00:02:53.519> image<00:02:54.299> planes<00:02:54.750> are<00:02:55.500> drawn

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
to take our image planes are drawn

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.949 
to take our image planes are drawn
images<00:02:56.160> we're<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:56.970> create<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.510> curved

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
images we're going to create a curved

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.869 
images we're going to create a curved
Network<00:02:58.410> derived<00:02:58.920> from<00:02:59.190> those<00:02:59.430> so<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.640> we

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
Network derived from those so that we

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.319 
Network derived from those so that we
have<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:00.299> 3d<00:03:01.290> cage<00:03:01.739> or<00:03:02.340> structure<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.090> we<00:03:03.209> can

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
have a 3d cage or structure that we can

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.600 
have a 3d cage or structure that we can
snap<00:03:03.629> polygons<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.500> more<00:03:04.709> quickly<00:03:04.980> create

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
snap polygons to to more quickly create

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.119 
snap polygons to to more quickly create
our<00:03:05.819> model<00:03:06.209> that's<00:03:06.510> right<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.200> it's<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.799> really

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
our model that's right so it's a really

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.619 
our model that's right so it's a really
interesting<00:03:08.489> workflow<00:03:09.060> it's<00:03:09.269> something<00:03:09.510> that

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
interesting workflow it's something that

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.360 
interesting workflow it's something that
a<00:03:09.660> lot<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.840> people<00:03:10.140> don't<00:03:10.440> do<00:03:10.680> but<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.069> think<00:03:11.310> you

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
a lot of people don't do but I think you

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.559 
a lot of people don't do but I think you
guys<00:03:11.489> are<00:03:11.610> going<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.790> completely<00:03:12.090> dig<00:03:12.329> it<00:03:12.450> and

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
guys are going to completely dig it and

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.720 
guys are going to completely dig it and
