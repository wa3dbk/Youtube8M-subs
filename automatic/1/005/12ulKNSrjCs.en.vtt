Arsenal<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.300> doubt<00:01:00.570> he's<00:01:00.780> gonna<00:01:00.930> score<00:01:01.260> that

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590

Arsenal I doubt he's gonna score that
many<00:01:01.620> goals

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
many goals

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.100 
many goals
mainly<00:01:02.940> because<00:01:03.090> they've<00:01:03.420> started<00:01:03.629> what<00:01:03.870> two

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
mainly because they've started what two

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.170 
mainly because they've started what two
or<00:01:04.260> three<00:01:04.500> more<00:01:04.680> strikers<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.460> after<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.060> he

said<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.689> done<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.110> doubt<00:01:07.350> they're<00:01:07.560> gonna<00:01:07.619> play

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.950 
said and done I doubt they're gonna play
him<00:01:08.010> up<00:01:08.159> top<00:01:08.460> by<00:01:08.700> himself<00:01:09.150> especially<00:01:09.810> with

him up top by himself especially with
their<00:01:10.170> new<00:01:10.350> acquisitions<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.430> he<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:11.970> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
their new acquisitions but he is a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.969 
their new acquisitions but he is a
clinical<00:01:12.600> finisher<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.320> can't<00:01:13.560> argue<00:01:13.830> with

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
clinical finisher you can't argue with

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.070 
clinical finisher you can't argue with
that<00:01:14.100> which<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.820> why<00:01:14.939> he<00:01:15.150> always<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> choice

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that which is why he always is a choice

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.230 
that which is why he always is a choice
on<00:01:16.320> my<00:01:16.439> short<00:01:16.710> list<00:01:16.890> however<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.850> person<00:01:18.030> I

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
on my short list however the person I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.910 
on my short list however the person I
think<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.540> gonna<00:01:18.780> score<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.229> most<00:01:19.500> number<00:01:19.799> of

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
think is gonna score the most number of

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.760 
think is gonna score the most number of
goals<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.659> Sergio<00:01:21.659> agüero<00:01:22.049> mainly<00:01:22.619> because

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
goals is Sergio agüero mainly because

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.920 
goals is Sergio agüero mainly because
Rooney<00:01:23.310> isn't<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.880> consistent<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.659> don't

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
Rooney isn't that consistent I don't

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.840 
Rooney isn't that consistent I don't
know<00:01:25.049> what's<00:01:25.229> happening<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:25.710> van<00:01:25.860> Persie<00:01:26.340> so

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
know what's happening with van Persie so

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.660 
know what's happening with van Persie so
agüero<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.630> my<00:01:28.080> choice<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.189> top<00:01:29.369> scorer

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
agüero is my choice to be the top scorer

this season now on to the bottom three
the<00:01:32.520> first<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.630> an<00:01:33.750> order<00:01:33.990> by

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the first one this is not an order by

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.620 
the first one this is not an order by
the<00:01:34.170> way<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.530> Swansea<00:01:35.130> City<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:36.150> they<00:01:36.329> really

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the way is Swansea City but they really

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.120 
the way is Swansea City but they really
impress<00:01:36.990> critics<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.650> know<00:01:37.770> with<00:01:37.950> their

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
impress critics you know with their

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.460 
impress critics you know with their
passing<00:01:38.610> style<00:01:38.880> however<00:01:39.540> I'm<00:01:39.840> not<00:01:40.049> sure<00:01:40.110> if

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
passing style however I'm not sure if

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.260 
passing style however I'm not sure if
they'll<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.740> able<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.040> maintain<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:42.119> with

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
they'll be able to maintain that with

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.389 
they'll be able to maintain that with
their<00:01:42.450> new<00:01:42.659> manager<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.259> mean<00:01:43.860> they<00:01:44.009> might<00:01:44.220> get

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
their new manager I mean they might get

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.190 
their new manager I mean they might get
second<00:01:44.880> season<00:01:45.210> syndrome<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:45.780> never<00:01:45.930> know

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
second season syndrome and we never know

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.289

the comment section below
now<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.640> second<00:01:54.149> team<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> think<00:01:54.960> might

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
now the second team that I think might

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.590 
now the second team that I think might
get<00:01:55.350> relegated<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.040> Southampton<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:57.360> came

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
get relegated is Southampton they came

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.840 
get relegated is Southampton they came
second<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.380> championship<00:01:58.579> but<00:01:59.579> I'm<00:01:59.700> not

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
second in the championship but I'm not

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.249 
second in the championship but I'm not
sure<00:02:00.030> how<00:02:00.180> they'll<00:02:00.390> cope<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.840> Premier

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
sure how they'll cope in the Premier

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.480 
sure how they'll cope in the Premier
League<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.560> don't<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:01.920> they<00:02:02.009> have<00:02:02.130> too<00:02:02.340> many

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
League I don't think they have too many

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.850 
League I don't think they have too many
huge<00:02:02.969> stars<00:02:03.329> I'll<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:03.930> making<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.320> video<00:02:04.469> later

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
huge stars I'll be making a video later

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.410 
huge stars I'll be making a video later
on<00:02:05.040> talking<00:02:05.460> about<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.700> three<00:02:05.969> teams<00:02:06.180> coming

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
on talking about the three teams coming

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.760 
on talking about the three teams coming
up<00:02:06.600> from<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> championship<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:07.560> at<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
up from the championship but at the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.559 
up from the championship but at the
moment<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.160> think<00:02:08.220> Southampton<00:02:09.000> or<00:02:09.149> one<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
moment I think Southampton or one of the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.960 
moment I think Southampton or one of the
weakest<00:02:09.929> teams<00:02:10.110> coming<00:02:10.440> up<00:02:10.590> now<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.340> final

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
weakest teams coming up now the final

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.640 
weakest teams coming up now the final
team<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.540> think<00:02:12.750> might<00:02:12.900> get<00:02:13.080> relegated

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
team that I think might get relegated

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.830 
team that I think might get relegated
is<00:02:13.829> Wigan<00:02:14.310> Athletic<00:02:14.430> don't<00:02:15.239> hate<00:02:15.450> me<00:02:15.569> for<00:02:15.599> this

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
is Wigan Athletic don't hate me for this

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.660 
is Wigan Athletic don't hate me for this
I<00:02:16.019> know<00:02:16.079> everybody<00:02:16.739> lost<00:02:16.950> wig<00:02:17.189> and<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.519> do<00:02:17.579> i

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
I know everybody lost wig and so do i

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.789 
I know everybody lost wig and so do i
but<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.239> think<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.659> main<00:02:18.870> player<00:02:19.170> who<00:02:19.439> provided

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
but I think the main player who provided

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.440 
but I think the main player who provided
the<00:02:20.040> spark<00:02:20.280> for<00:02:20.519> them<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.849> made<00:02:21.060> them<00:02:21.239> stay

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
the spark for them that made them stay

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.509 
the spark for them that made them stay
up<00:02:21.599> his<00:02:21.780> victim<00:02:22.110> osis<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.799> that<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.040> moment

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
up his victim osis and that the moment

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.800 
up his victim osis and that the moment
Chelsea<00:02:24.000> are<00:02:24.120> looking<00:02:24.360> for<00:02:24.540> him

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
Chelsea are looking for him

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.690 
Chelsea are looking for him
so<00:02:25.049> if<00:02:25.140> they<00:02:25.260> keep<00:02:25.530> on<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.920> Moses<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.459> think

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
so if they keep on to Moses and I think

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.399 
so if they keep on to Moses and I think
they'll<00:02:26.819> stay<00:02:27.030> up<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:27.569> if<00:02:27.659> they<00:02:27.780> do<00:02:27.840> sell<00:02:28.260> him

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
they'll stay up but if they do sell him

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.289 
they'll stay up but if they do sell him
I<00:02:28.500> think<00:02:28.799> relegation<00:02:29.430> will<00:02:29.579> happen<00:02:29.879> for<00:02:30.030> Wigan

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
I think relegation will happen for Wigan

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.330 
I think relegation will happen for Wigan
and<00:02:30.359> unfortunately<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.010> bottom

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
and unfortunately and so the bottom

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.849 
and unfortunately and so the bottom
three<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.879> Swansea<00:02:33.450> Southampton<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.409> Wigan

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
three is Swansea Southampton and Wigan

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.250 
three is Swansea Southampton and Wigan
in<00:02:35.010> my<00:02:35.280> opinion<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.209> now<00:02:36.420> we'll<00:02:36.659> be<00:02:36.840> moving<00:02:36.989> on

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
in my opinion and now we'll be moving on

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.319 
in my opinion and now we'll be moving on
to<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:37.530> top<00:02:37.769> six<00:02:38.099> this<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.489> in<00:02:38.609> order<00:02:38.849> of<00:02:39.120> what

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
to the top six this is in order of what

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.270 
to the top six this is in order of what
I<00:02:39.359> think<00:02:39.480> will<00:02:39.720> happen<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.709> sixth<00:02:41.129> place

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
I think will happen and in sixth place

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.309 
I think will happen and in sixth place
is<00:02:41.609> Liverpool<00:02:42.239> they<00:02:42.390> had<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> disastrous

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
is Liverpool they had a disastrous

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.740 
is Liverpool they had a disastrous
season<00:02:43.590> last<00:02:44.010> season<00:02:44.459> but<00:02:45.000> with<00:02:45.239> Brendan

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
season last season but with Brendan

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.569 
season last season but with Brendan
Rodgers<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.440> know<00:02:46.560> he's<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.829> good<00:02:47.040> manager<00:02:47.489> if

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
Rodgers you know he's a good manager if

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.670 
Rodgers you know he's a good manager if
he's<00:02:47.760> able<00:02:47.909> to<00:02:48.090> recreate<00:02:48.569> that<00:02:48.659> passing<00:02:49.230> style

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
he's able to recreate that passing style

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.259 
he's able to recreate that passing style
with<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.129> top<00:02:50.310> class<00:02:50.579> players<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.120> live<00:02:51.239> a

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
with the top class players that live a

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.119 
with the top class players that live a
full<00:02:51.480> house<00:02:51.720> such<00:02:51.989> as<00:02:52.019> Gerrard<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.769> Suarez

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
full house such as Gerrard and Suarez

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.920 
full house such as Gerrard and Suarez
and<00:02:53.639> I<00:02:53.730> think<00:02:53.970> they<00:02:54.090> should<00:02:54.299> be<00:02:54.389> able<00:02:54.569> to<00:02:54.720> get

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
and I think they should be able to get

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.559 
and I think they should be able to get
6th<00:02:55.319> place<00:02:55.650> now<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.609> 5th<00:02:56.849> place<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.329> think

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
6th place now in 5th place I think

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.330 
6th place now in 5th place I think
Tottenham<00:02:58.049> Hotspur<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.709> don't<00:02:59.040> think<00:02:59.220> they'll

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
Tottenham Hotspur I don't think they'll

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.250 
Tottenham Hotspur I don't think they'll
finish<00:02:59.489> any<00:02:59.730> higher<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.180> season<00:03:00.569> I<00:03:00.720> mean<00:03:01.139> they

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
finish any higher the season I mean they

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.349 
finish any higher the season I mean they
haven't<00:03:01.470> managed<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.040> grab<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> strike<00:03:02.819> yet<00:03:03.030> so

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
haven't managed to grab a strike yet so

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.759 
haven't managed to grab a strike yet so
at<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.540> moment<00:03:03.689> or<00:03:03.959> they<00:03:04.049> have<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.319> Defoe

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
at the moment or they have this Defoe

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.589 
at the moment or they have this Defoe
and<00:03:04.799> Harry<00:03:05.189> Kane<00:03:05.549> so<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.239> could<00:03:06.450> be<00:03:06.480> a

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
and Harry Kane so it could be a

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.390 
and Harry Kane so it could be a
troubling<00:03:07.049> season<00:03:07.439> for<00:03:07.560> them<00:03:07.650> but<00:03:08.129> I<00:03:08.189> think

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
troubling season for them but I think

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.429 
troubling season for them but I think
for<00:03:08.579> tongan<00:03:08.909> and<00:03:09.060> siga<00:03:09.299> cenar<00:03:09.689> great<00:03:09.930> signings

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
for tongan and siga cenar great signings

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.289 
for tongan and siga cenar great signings
and<00:03:10.590> even<00:03:10.829> if<00:03:10.950> they<00:03:11.099> lose<00:03:11.340> mod<00:03:11.700> Rich<00:03:11.909> they

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
and even if they lose mod Rich they

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.849 
and even if they lose mod Rich they
still<00:03:12.689> have<00:03:12.900> enough<00:03:12.930> strength<00:03:13.139> in<00:03:13.650> other

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
still have enough strength in other

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.190 
still have enough strength in other
positions<00:03:14.099> to<00:03:14.519> cope<00:03:14.790> now<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.780> snow<00:03:16.079> I<00:03:16.109> think

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
positions to cope now a snow I think

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.409 
positions to cope now a snow I think
will<00:03:16.500> easily<00:03:17.069> finish<00:03:17.370> fourth<00:03:17.669> they've<00:03:18.239> made

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
will easily finish fourth they've made

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.720 
will easily finish fourth they've made
some<00:03:18.599> really<00:03:18.810> impressive<00:03:19.379> signings<00:03:19.889> such<00:03:20.519> as

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
well as all these youth players coming

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.920 
well as all these youth players coming
through<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.859> ranks<00:03:26.190> like<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.489> ox<00:03:26.780> but<00:03:27.780> you

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
through the ranks like the ox but you

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.599 
through the ranks like the ox but you
know<00:03:28.049> they<00:03:28.230> still<00:03:28.440> have<00:03:28.500> defensive<00:03:29.220> problems

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
know they still have defensive problems

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.770 
know they still have defensive problems
which<00:03:29.819> is<00:03:29.940> why<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.120> don't<00:03:30.449> think<00:03:30.659> they'll

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
which is why I don't think they'll

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.479 
which is why I don't think they'll
finish<00:03:30.930> any<00:03:31.199> higher<00:03:31.470> in<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.799> table<00:03:32.220> now

a force next season to be reckoned with

a force next season to be reckoned with

victory<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.979> mean<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.549> think<00:03:44.609> they'll<00:03:44.879> compete

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
victory I mean I think they'll compete

victory I mean I think they'll compete
with<00:03:45.449> the<00:03:45.599> Manchester<00:03:45.780> clubs<00:03:46.349> it's<00:03:46.560> just<00:03:46.769> I

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
with the Manchester clubs it's just I

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.409 
with the Manchester clubs it's just I
don't<00:03:46.919> think<00:03:47.280> they<00:03:47.370> have<00:03:47.489> enough<00:03:47.519> depth<00:03:48.209> in

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
don't think they have enough depth in

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.809 
don't think they have enough depth in
their<00:03:48.690> squad<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.260> be<00:03:49.379> able<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.769> beat<00:03:50.010> them<00:03:50.250> so

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
their squad to be able to beat them so

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.909 
their squad to be able to beat them so
which<00:03:51.120> manchester<00:03:51.900> club<00:03:52.139> will<00:03:52.530> get<00:03:52.769> the

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
which manchester club will get the

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.819 
which manchester club will get the
Premier<00:03:53.280> League<00:03:53.430> trophy<00:03:53.879> this<00:03:54.120> year<00:03:54.260> for<00:03:55.260> me<00:03:55.590> I

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
Premier League trophy this year for me I

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.680 
Premier League trophy this year for me I
think<00:03:56.190> Manchester<00:03:56.849> City<00:03:57.090> will<00:03:57.359> fall<00:03:57.659> just

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
think Manchester City will fall just

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.559 
think Manchester City will fall just
short<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.859> come<00:03:59.069> second<00:03:59.639> mainly<00:04:00.419> because

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
short and come second mainly because

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.270 
short and come second mainly because
they<00:04:00.840> haven't<00:04:01.169> really<00:04:01.470> made<00:04:01.650> any<00:04:01.889> new

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
they haven't really made any new

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.550 
they haven't really made any new
signings<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:02.909> their<00:04:03.120> squad<00:04:03.449> some<00:04:04.019> people<00:04:04.319> say

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
signings to their squad some people say

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.219 
signings to their squad some people say
they<00:04:04.769> didn't<00:04:05.159> need<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.669> however<00:04:06.419> I<00:04:06.569> just<00:04:06.599> don't

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
they didn't need to however I just don't

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:08.899 
they didn't need to however I just don't
think<00:04:07.440> they<00:04:07.530> have<00:04:07.709> enough<00:04:07.979> players<00:04:08.280> supposing

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
think they have enough players supposing

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.759 
think they have enough players supposing
when<00:04:09.329> Yaya<00:04:09.690> touré<00:04:09.989> was<00:04:10.079> at<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.500> Cup<00:04:10.650> of

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
when Yaya touré was at the Cup of

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.890 
when Yaya touré was at the Cup of
Nations<00:04:10.829> last<00:04:11.370> season<00:04:11.760> they<00:04:11.909> struggled<00:04:12.419> a<00:04:12.569> lot

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
Nations last season they struggled a lot

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.680 
Nations last season they struggled a lot
and<00:04:13.139> so<00:04:13.500> if<00:04:13.680> like<00:04:14.069> any<00:04:14.370> of<00:04:15.000> their<00:04:15.209> main<00:04:15.389> players

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
and so if like any of their main players

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.379 
and so if like any of their main players
get<00:04:15.900> injured<00:04:16.349> such<00:04:16.650> as<00:04:16.829> Vincent<00:04:17.280> Kompany<00:04:17.489> Yaya

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
get injured such as Vincent Kompany Yaya

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.479 
get injured such as Vincent Kompany Yaya
Toure<00:04:18.659> and<00:04:18.930> agüero<00:04:19.349> I'm<00:04:19.650> not<00:04:20.130> sure<00:04:20.310> how

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
Toure and agüero I'm not sure how

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.580 
Toure and agüero I'm not sure how
they'll<00:04:20.699> cope<00:04:20.909> with<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.329> now<00:04:21.900> Manchester

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
they'll cope with that now Manchester

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.890 
they'll cope with that now Manchester
United<00:04:23.130> they<00:04:23.430> have<00:04:23.639> lots<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.240> depth<00:04:24.539> in<00:04:24.750> their

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
United they have lots of depth in their

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.399 
United they have lots of depth in their
squad

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
squad

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.350 
squad
I<00:04:25.440> think<00:04:25.740> Kagawa<00:04:26.190> will<00:04:26.370> add<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.760> little<00:04:27.180> bit

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
I think Kagawa will add that little bit

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.420 
I think Kagawa will add that little bit
penetration<00:04:28.139> that<00:04:28.259> they<00:04:28.409> lacked<00:04:28.680> last<00:04:28.979> season

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
penetration that they lacked last season

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.309 
penetration that they lacked last season
he<00:04:29.699> can<00:04:29.879> be<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.150> creative<00:04:30.539> outlet<00:04:31.020> for<00:04:31.050> them

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
he can be the creative outlet for them

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:32.570 
he can be the creative outlet for them
and<00:04:31.560> because<00:04:31.889> they<00:04:31.979> didn't<00:04:32.219> really<00:04:32.340> have<00:04:32.430> a

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
and because they didn't really have a

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.309 
and because they didn't really have a
player<00:04:32.879> to<00:04:33.060> do<00:04:33.270> that<00:04:33.449> last<00:04:33.659> season<00:04:34.110> they<00:04:34.229> were

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
player to do that last season they were

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.529 
player to do that last season they were
always<00:04:34.530> missing<00:04:35.069> that<00:04:35.250> little<00:04:35.520> something<00:04:35.879> so

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
always missing that little something so

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.300 
always missing that little something so
I<00:04:36.569> think<00:04:36.659> he<00:04:36.990> could<00:04:37.169> be<00:04:37.199> the<00:04:37.349> main<00:04:37.740> player<00:04:38.099> for

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
I think he could be the main player for

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.249 
I think he could be the main player for
them<00:04:38.400> this<00:04:38.610> season<00:04:38.819> also<00:04:39.719> if<00:04:39.810> they<00:04:39.930> saw<00:04:40.139> him

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
them this season also if they saw him

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.110 
them this season also if they saw him
vampire<00:04:40.650> see<00:04:40.830> they<00:04:40.979> really<00:04:41.250> will<00:04:41.580> be<00:04:41.789> a<00:04:41.819> force

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
vampire see they really will be a force

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.909

to<00:04:42.270> be<00:04:42.300> reckoned<00:04:42.389> with<00:04:42.780> but<00:04:43.349> overall<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:43.740> think

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
to be reckoned with but overall I think

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.610 
to be reckoned with but overall I think
Manchester<00:04:44.849> United<00:04:45.360> will<00:04:45.870> take<00:04:46.139> home<00:04:46.409> their
