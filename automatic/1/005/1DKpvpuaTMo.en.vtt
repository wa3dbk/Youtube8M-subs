more strength in it already got an

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.670

but<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.400> looks<00:02:26.640> really<00:02:26.940> good<00:02:27.300> this<00:02:27.540> time<00:02:27.810> that

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
but it looks really good this time that

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.790 
but it looks really good this time that
thing<00:02:29.690> but<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.840> seems<00:02:31.140> like<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.440> have<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.680> be

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
thing but it seems like you have to be

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.199 
thing but it seems like you have to be
pressure<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.430> use<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:33.030> now<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:35.459> teleporters

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
pressure to use it now the teleporters

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.750 
pressure to use it now the teleporters
are<00:02:36.450> look<00:02:36.750> badass<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.800> they're<00:02:38.010> gonna<00:02:38.220> be<00:02:38.400> so

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
are look badass and they're gonna be so

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.550 
are look badass and they're gonna be so
hopeful<00:02:39.240> but<00:02:39.900> there's<00:02:40.170> apparently

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
hopeful but there's apparently

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.559 
hopeful but there's apparently
objectives<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.550> need<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.910> do<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.209> turn<00:02:42.390> them

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
objectives you need to do to turn them

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.920 
objectives you need to do to turn them
on

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
on

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.150 
on
just<00:02:43.080> like<00:02:43.290> in<00:02:43.530> Luke<00:02:44.010> or<00:02:44.640> yeah<00:02:45.950> rather<00:02:46.950> turn

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
just like in Luke or yeah rather turn

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.590 
just like in Luke or yeah rather turn
the<00:02:47.280> power<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.790> use<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.150> protocol

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
the power on to use the protocol

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.240 
the power on to use the protocol
machining<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.200> there's<00:02:49.410> something<00:02:49.680> else<00:02:49.860> in

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
machining so there's something else in

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.080 
machining so there's something else in
this<00:02:51.349> that's<00:02:52.349> I'm<00:02:53.099> getting<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.700> machine

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
this that's I'm getting in the machine

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.020 
this that's I'm getting in the machine
then<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.110> got<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.319> nice<00:02:55.500> close<00:02:55.860> up<00:02:56.159> or<00:02:57.090> did<00:02:57.450> I

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
then I got a nice close up or did I

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.720 
then I got a nice close up or did I
is<00:02:58.120> that<00:02:58.450> that's<00:02:58.780> when<00:02:58.990> you'd<00:02:59.140> buy<00:02:59.319> it<00:02:59.700> then<00:03:00.700> I

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
is that that's when you'd buy it then I

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.830 
is that that's when you'd buy it then I
got<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.050> nice<00:03:02.050> close-up<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.610> how<00:03:04.540> much<00:03:04.690> it

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
got a nice close-up of the how much it

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.660 
got a nice close-up of the how much it
cost<00:03:05.080> is<00:03:05.260> only<00:03:05.350> fifteen<00:03:05.830> hundred<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.220> teleport

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
cost is only fifteen hundred to teleport

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.940 
cost is only fifteen hundred to teleport
I<00:03:06.880> would<00:03:07.000> kind<00:03:07.180> of<00:03:07.209> surprised<00:03:07.569> about<00:03:07.750> that

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
I would kind of surprised about that

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.280 
I would kind of surprised about that
then<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.069> go<00:03:09.220> through<00:03:09.250> one<00:03:09.670> hell<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:09.940> a

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
then you go through one hell of a

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.650 
then you go through one hell of a
teleport<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.430> did<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.670> pretty<00:03:12.910> shitty<00:03:13.090> job<00:03:13.450> I

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
teleport and I did a pretty shitty job I

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.380 
teleport and I did a pretty shitty job I
had<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:14.040> game<00:03:15.040> picture<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.459> this<00:03:15.610> but<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.120> says

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
had a game picture of this but it says

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.940 
had a game picture of this but it says
ascend<00:03:17.080> from<00:03:17.530> darkness

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
ascend from darkness

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.070 
ascend from darkness
and<00:03:20.950> now<00:03:21.100> when<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.120> teleport<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:22.780> just<00:03:22.930> got<00:03:23.050> a

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
and now when you teleport I just got a

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.840 
and now when you teleport I just got a
quick<00:03:23.290> picture<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.770> it<00:03:24.069> because<00:03:24.489> they<00:03:24.610> weren't

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
quick picture of it because they weren't

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.150 
quick picture of it because they weren't
looking<00:03:25.030> at<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:26.230> outsides<00:03:26.709> but<00:03:28.560> it's<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.739> huge

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
looking at the outsides but it's a huge

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.000 
looking at the outsides but it's a huge
huge<00:03:30.580> Factory<00:03:31.330> I<00:03:31.630> think<00:03:32.290> you<00:03:32.380> start<00:03:32.680> from<00:03:32.860> the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
huge Factory I think you start from the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.340 
huge Factory I think you start from the
top<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.670> go<00:03:33.820> down<00:03:33.850> or<00:03:34.810> you<00:03:34.900> start<00:03:35.170> from<00:03:35.260> the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
top and go down or you start from the

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.220 
top and go down or you start from the
outside<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.860> work<00:03:36.160> your<00:03:36.190> way<00:03:36.370> inside<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:37.540> also

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
outside and work your way inside I also

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.449 
outside and work your way inside I also
noticed<00:03:38.769> when<00:03:38.890> i<00:03:38.920> teleported<00:03:39.730> they<00:03:41.459> they

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
noticed when i teleported they they

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.680 
noticed when i teleported they they
teleport<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.030> in<00:03:43.120> front<00:03:43.239> of<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.390> pack<00:03:43.540> of

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
teleport it in front of the pack of

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.360 
teleport it in front of the pack of
punch<00:03:43.900> machine<00:03:44.110> which<00:03:44.980> means<00:03:45.190> the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
punch machine which means the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.490 
punch machine which means the
teleporters<00:03:46.120> want<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.600> teleport<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:47.290> don't

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
teleporters want to teleport I don't

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.620 
teleporters want to teleport I don't
think<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:47.830> can<00:03:48.010> backtrack<00:03:48.400> away<00:03:49.060> from<00:03:49.390> where

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
think you can backtrack away from where

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.930 
think you can backtrack away from where
you<00:03:49.720> just<00:03:49.870> teleported<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:51.340> have<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.580> find<00:03:51.790> the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
you just teleported you have to find the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.900 
you just teleported you have to find the
next<00:03:52.120> teleporter<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.920> again<00:03:54.250> it's<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.730> pack

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
next teleporter and again it's the pack

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.050 
next teleporter and again it's the pack
of<00:03:55.090> punch<00:03:55.330> machine<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.739> it<00:03:57.220> said<00:03:57.430> teleport<00:03:57.940> to

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
of punch machine and it said teleport to

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.660 
of punch machine and it said teleport to
the<00:03:58.180> main<00:03:58.420> back<00:03:58.870> in<00:03:59.680> the<00:04:00.190> first<00:04:00.489> picture<00:04:02.670> so

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
the main back in the first picture so

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.110 
the main back in the first picture so
yep<00:04:04.209> there's<00:04:04.570> more<00:04:04.870> footage<00:04:05.260> all<00:04:06.130> four<00:04:06.910> guys

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
yep there's more footage all four guys

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.350 
yep there's more footage all four guys
are<00:04:07.390> in<00:04:07.510> this<00:04:07.690> so<00:04:08.470> that<00:04:08.680> means<00:04:09.120> none<00:04:10.120> of<00:04:10.239> them

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
are in this so that means none of them

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.830 
are in this so that means none of them
died<00:04:10.600> which<00:04:10.959> means<00:04:11.230> they<00:04:11.380> all<00:04:11.620> can<00:04:12.840> all

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
died which means they all can all

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.630 
died which means they all can all
survive<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:15.870> that's<00:04:16.870> pretty<00:04:17.140> big<00:04:17.890> every<00:04:18.459> one

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
survive so that's pretty big every one

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.029 
survive so that's pretty big every one
of<00:04:18.669> them<00:04:18.820> survived<00:04:19.239> cousin

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
of them survived cousin

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.380 
of them survived cousin
not<00:04:21.760> today<00:04:21.940> orange<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:23.250> Luke<00:04:24.250> it<00:04:24.910> seemed<00:04:25.210> like

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
not today orange and Luke it seemed like

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.980 
not today orange and Luke it seemed like
nobody<00:04:25.600> survived<00:04:27.000> an<00:04:28.000> apparently<00:04:28.510> Treyarch

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
nobody survived an apparently Treyarch

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.450 
nobody survived an apparently Treyarch
said<00:04:29.229> since<00:04:29.560> so<00:04:29.740> many<00:04:29.860> people<00:04:30.280> have<00:04:30.430> been

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
said since so many people have been

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.770 
said since so many people have been
looking<00:04:30.729> into<00:04:31.150> this

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
looking into this

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.630 
looking into this
they<00:04:32.460> put<00:04:33.460> a<00:04:33.640> ton<00:04:34.030> more<00:04:34.539> in<00:04:34.900> this<00:04:35.080> game<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.640> in

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
they put a ton more in this game and in

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.170 
they put a ton more in this game and in
my<00:04:36.880> opinion<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.630> think<00:04:37.740> either<00:04:38.740> it's<00:04:39.669> gonna<00:04:39.850> end

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
my opinion I think either it's gonna end
