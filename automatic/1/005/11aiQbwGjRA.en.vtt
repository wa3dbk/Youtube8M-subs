theory<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.539> fascinating<00:01:04.409> because<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:05.369> does

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
theory is fascinating because it does

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.899 
theory is fascinating because it does
give<00:01:06.390> some<00:01:06.830> reason<00:01:07.830> why<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> pyramids<00:01:08.790> may

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
give some reason why the pyramids may

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.450
