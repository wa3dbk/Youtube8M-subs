your camera and rotated you'll see that

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.850 
your camera and rotated you'll see that
these<00:01:08.700> two<00:01:09.000> vertical<00:01:09.540> lines<00:01:09.570> appear<00:01:10.410> to<00:01:10.710> move

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
these two vertical lines appear to move

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
move your camera position forwards and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.990 
move your camera position forwards and
then<00:01:27.560> look<00:01:27.770> again<00:01:28.070> see<00:01:28.640> if<00:01:28.670> they're<00:01:28.850> still

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
then look again see if they're still

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.210 
then look again see if they're still
moving<00:01:29.240> in<00:01:29.480> relation<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.930> each<00:01:30.080> other

as<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.480> see<00:01:39.690> this<00:01:39.900> time<00:01:40.200> they<00:01:40.410> are<00:01:40.590> but

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
as you can see this time they are but

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.980 
as you can see this time they are but
there's<00:01:41.280> less<00:01:41.490> apparent<00:01:41.820> movement<00:01:42.480> which

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
there's less apparent movement which

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.230 
there's less apparent movement which
shows<00:01:43.230> were<00:01:43.380> going<00:01:43.620> the<00:01:43.710> right<00:01:43.860> way<00:01:50.240> we're

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
shows were going the right way we're

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:03.310 
shows were going the right way we're
going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.480> move<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.870> little<00:01:52.080> further

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.980 

when<00:02:03.950> we<00:02:04.040> take<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.280> look<00:02:04.490> this<00:02:04.670> time<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.390> rotate

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
when we take a look this time and rotate

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.889 
when we take a look this time and rotate
the<00:02:06.140> camera<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:07.400> two<00:02:07.640> lines<00:02:07.940> don't<00:02:08.509> appear<00:02:08.869> to

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
the camera the two lines don't appear to

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.150 
the camera the two lines don't appear to
move<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:10.300> means<00:02:11.560> we've<00:02:12.560> moved<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.950> camera

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
move that means we've moved the camera

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.580 
move that means we've moved the camera
to<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.400> exact<00:02:13.850> position<00:02:14.330> that<00:02:14.360> we<00:02:14.570> need<00:02:14.780> and

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
to the exact position that we need and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.680 
to the exact position that we need and
we<00:02:15.620> need<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.040> tighten<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.670> up<00:02:16.820> on<00:02:17.090> the

we need to tighten it up on the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.760 
we need to tighten it up on the
horizontal<00:02:18.200> arm<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.230> it's<00:02:21.410> locked<00:02:21.590> in

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770
