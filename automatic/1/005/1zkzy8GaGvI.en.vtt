okay I really think that it would be a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.940 
okay I really think that it would be a
lot<00:02:15.269> better<00:02:15.300> if<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:16.230> was<00:02:16.379> just<00:02:16.409> a<00:02:16.769> little

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
lot better if it was just a little

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.880 
lot better if it was just a little
smaller<00:02:17.430> because<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:19.019> just<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.769> just

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
smaller because this is just it's just

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.710 
smaller because this is just it's just
too<00:02:20.220> big<00:02:20.400> for<00:02:20.430> me<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.940> mean<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.120> figured<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.629> out

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
too big for me I mean I figured it out

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.420 
too big for me I mean I figured it out
you<00:02:21.959> just<00:02:22.110> have<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.500> be<00:02:22.739> really<00:02:23.010> careful

very difficult to use and honestly it

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.080 
very difficult to use and honestly it
takes<00:02:40.440> me<00:02:40.590> longer<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:40.950> use<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.459> because<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.849> have

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
takes me longer to use it because I have

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.940 
takes me longer to use it because I have

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
sure over time if I used it I'd get over

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.780 
sure over time if I used it I'd get over
that<00:02:46.379> issue<00:02:46.530> it's<00:02:46.950> not<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.310> big<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.519> a<00:02:47.610> deal

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
no idea this was scented because I would

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.220 
no idea this was scented because I would

have never bought it um about the
formula<00:04:13.709> it's<00:04:14.069> not<00:04:14.280> bad<00:04:14.609> it<00:04:14.910> is<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.150> little<00:04:15.510> bit

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720

on<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.109> thicker<00:04:16.380> side<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:17.070> I<00:04:17.549> do<00:04:17.609> find<00:04:18.060> that

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
on the thicker side and I do find that

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.990 
on the thicker side and I do find that
it<00:04:18.449> is<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.900> little<00:04:19.169> bit<00:04:19.289> dry<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.889> usually<00:04:20.729> prefer

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
it is a little bit dry I usually prefer

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.630 
it is a little bit dry I usually prefer
more<00:04:21.750> kind<00:04:22.079> of<00:04:22.140> wet<00:04:22.409> formulas<00:04:23.039> I<00:04:23.190> don't<00:04:23.400> mind

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.969 
more kind of wet formulas I don't mind
Jerry<00:04:23.849> formulas<00:04:24.390> but<00:04:24.659> this<00:04:24.870> one<00:04:25.110> I<00:04:25.349> can

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
Jerry formulas but this one I can

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:26.990 
Jerry formulas but this one I can
already<00:04:26.340> feel<00:04:26.490> it

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
already feel it

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.820 
already feel it
drying-out<00:04:27.510> I've<00:04:27.690> only<00:04:27.840> had<00:04:28.140> this<00:04:28.380> for<00:04:28.440> like

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
drying-out I've only had this for like

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.640 
drying-out I've only had this for like
two<00:04:29.610> weeks<00:04:29.640> and<00:04:30.270> I<00:04:30.390> can<00:04:30.540> already<00:04:30.780> notice<00:04:31.290> the

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
two weeks and I can already notice the

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.530 
two weeks and I can already notice the
formula<00:04:31.920> is<00:04:32.220> really<00:04:32.670> starting<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.150> dry<00:04:33.360> out

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
formula is really starting to dry out

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.500 
formula is really starting to dry out
and<00:04:34.250> lots<00:04:35.250> of<00:04:35.370> my<00:04:35.460> other<00:04:35.610> mascaras<00:04:36.210> even

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
and lots of my other mascaras even

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.030 
and lots of my other mascaras even
high-end<00:04:36.690> don't<00:04:37.110> start<00:04:37.380> drying<00:04:37.620> out<00:04:37.830> until

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
high-end don't start drying out until

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.430 
high-end don't start drying out until
like<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.220> month<00:04:38.340> or<00:04:38.730> two<00:04:38.940> but<00:04:39.570> this<00:04:39.780> formula<00:04:40.140> is

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
like a month or two but this formula is

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.500 
like a month or two but this formula is
already<00:04:40.890> kind<00:04:41.130> of<00:04:41.220> dry<00:04:41.490> to<00:04:41.550> begin<00:04:42.030> with<00:04:42.210> so<00:04:42.480> I

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
already kind of dry to begin with so I

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.300 
already kind of dry to begin with so I
feel<00:04:42.810> like<00:04:42.840> it<00:04:43.080> dries<00:04:43.320> out<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.590> lot<00:04:43.920> quicker

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
feel like it dries out a lot quicker

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.090 
feel like it dries out a lot quicker
than<00:04:44.430> other<00:04:45.000> mascaras<00:04:45.720> so<00:04:46.410> I<00:04:46.440> don't<00:04:46.890> like<00:04:47.040> that

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
than other mascaras so I don't like that

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.570 
than other mascaras so I don't like that
about<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.520> because<00:04:47.910> this<00:04:48.090> was<00:04:48.360> like<00:04:48.890> $26<00:04:49.890> with

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
about it because this was like $26 with

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.150 
about it because this was like $26 with
taxes<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.450> I<00:04:51.780> mean<00:04:51.990> if<00:04:52.200> I<00:04:52.410> were<00:04:52.710> to<00:04:52.890> go<00:04:53.010> buy

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
taxes and I mean if I were to go buy

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.130 
taxes and I mean if I were to go buy
another<00:04:53.190> one<00:04:53.640> every<00:04:54.030> two<00:04:54.420> weeks<00:04:54.600> like<00:04:54.810> that<00:04:55.020> is

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
another one every two weeks like that is

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.530 
another one every two weeks like that is
just<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.440> ridiculous<00:04:55.860> amount<00:04:56.280> of<00:04:56.340> money<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.820> I

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
just a ridiculous amount of money and I

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.390 
just a ridiculous amount of money and I

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
think that you know you can find cheaper

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.250 
think that you know you can find cheaper
alternatives<00:05:00.000> or<00:05:00.180> even<00:05:00.630> cheaper<00:05:00.810> high-end

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
alternatives or even cheaper high-end

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.680 
alternatives or even cheaper high-end

much what I get with the mascara and if

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.050 
much what I get with the mascara and if
I<00:05:30.840> go<00:05:31.110> any<00:05:31.440> more<00:05:31.740> than<00:05:31.800> this<00:05:32.190> it<00:05:32.520> usually

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
I go any more than this it usually

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.450 
I go any more than this it usually
clumps<00:05:33.570> so<00:05:33.750> I<00:05:33.900> like<00:05:34.260> to<00:05:34.440> stop<00:05:34.770> here<00:05:35.100> at<00:05:35.280> like

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
clumps so I like to stop here at like

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.430 
clumps so I like to stop here at like
two<00:05:35.880> three<00:05:36.150> coats<00:05:36.360> because<00:05:36.750> like<00:05:36.930> I<00:05:37.050> said<00:05:37.229> if<00:05:37.350> I

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
two three coats because like I said if I

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.170 
two three coats because like I said if I
do<00:05:37.500> any<00:05:37.860> more<00:05:38.190> then<00:05:38.580> it<00:05:38.729> starts<00:05:39.060> getting

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
do any more then it starts getting

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.930 
do any more then it starts getting
clumpy<00:05:39.720> I<00:05:40.410> can<00:05:40.890> put<00:05:41.100> more<00:05:41.310> just<00:05:41.580> to<00:05:41.669> show<00:05:41.880> you

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
clumpy I can put more just to show you

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.000 
clumpy I can put more just to show you
what<00:05:42.330> that<00:05:42.360> looks<00:05:42.750> like<00:05:42.840> it's<00:05:43.440> kind<00:05:43.710> of<00:05:43.770> hard

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
what that looks like it's kind of hard

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.830 
what that looks like it's kind of hard
to<00:05:44.070> layer<00:05:44.370> this<00:05:44.580> mascara<00:05:45.090> a<00:05:45.360> lot<00:05:45.600> though

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
to layer this mascara a lot though

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.350 
to layer this mascara a lot though
because<00:05:46.050> the<00:05:46.470> formula<00:05:46.919> dries<00:05:47.220> so<00:05:47.460> quickly<00:05:47.760> so

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
because the formula dries so quickly so

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.090 
because the formula dries so quickly so
generally<00:05:48.810> when<00:05:48.990> I<00:05:49.050> apply<00:05:49.350> this<00:05:49.410> mascara<00:05:49.919> I

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
generally when I apply this mascara I

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.380 
generally when I apply this mascara I
only<00:05:50.280> like<00:05:50.550> to<00:05:50.669> do<00:05:50.790> about<00:05:50.940> three<00:05:51.150> coats

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
only like to do about three coats

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.659 
only like to do about three coats
because<00:05:51.780> any<00:05:51.990> more<00:05:52.290> than<00:05:52.470> that<00:05:52.650> and<00:05:52.919> it<00:05:53.640> just

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
because any more than that and it just

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.210 
because any more than that and it just
starts<00:05:54.090> looking<00:05:54.360> clumpy<00:05:54.840> and<00:05:55.080> it<00:05:55.560> does<00:05:55.800> flake

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
starts looking clumpy and it does flake

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.219 
starts looking clumpy and it does flake
off<00:05:56.460> if<00:05:56.760> you<00:05:56.880> put<00:05:57.090> on<00:05:57.180> a<00:05:57.210> lot<00:05:57.450> of<00:05:57.570> coats<00:05:57.810> it<00:05:58.050> will

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
off if you put on a lot of coats it will

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.530 
off if you put on a lot of coats it will
flake<00:05:58.500> off<00:05:58.710> during<00:05:58.950> the<00:05:59.070> day<00:05:59.340> I<00:05:59.580> noticed<00:06:00.360> that

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
flake off during the day I noticed that

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.270 
flake off during the day I noticed that
this<00:06:00.690> doesn't<00:06:00.990> really<00:06:01.200> hold<00:06:01.470> a<00:06:01.620> curl<00:06:01.890> for<00:06:02.130> me

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
this doesn't really hold a curl for me

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.460 
this doesn't really hold a curl for me
so<00:06:02.820> I<00:06:02.880> always<00:06:03.150> had<00:06:03.419> to<00:06:03.540> curl<00:06:03.750> my<00:06:03.780> lashes<00:06:03.900> really

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
so I always had to curl my lashes really

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.159 
so I always had to curl my lashes really
well<00:06:04.800> before<00:06:05.190> applying<00:06:05.490> this<00:06:05.930> the<00:06:06.930> things

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
well before applying this the things

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.110 
well before applying this the things
that<00:06:07.380> it's<00:06:07.530> good<00:06:07.710> at<00:06:07.890> is<00:06:08.160> giving<00:06:08.550> you<00:06:08.700> really

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
that it's good at is giving you really

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.960 
that it's good at is giving you really
nice<00:06:09.360> definition<00:06:10.140> and<00:06:10.380> I<00:06:10.860> would<00:06:11.010> say<00:06:11.190> fullness

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
nice definition and I would say fullness

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.090 
nice definition and I would say fullness
this<00:06:12.330> really<00:06:12.720> had<00:06:12.930> a<00:06:12.960> way<00:06:13.229> of<00:06:13.260> making<00:06:13.530> them

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
this really had a way of making them

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.219 
this really had a way of making them
look<00:06:14.580> fuller<00:06:15.000> than<00:06:15.240> they<00:06:15.390> actually<00:06:15.840> are<00:06:16.020> but

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
look fuller than they actually are but

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.960 
look fuller than they actually are but
it<00:06:16.440> doesn't<00:06:16.770> necessarily<00:06:17.460> make<00:06:17.610> them<00:06:17.820> look

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
it doesn't necessarily make them look

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.350 
it doesn't necessarily make them look
longer<00:06:18.360> or<00:06:18.840> you<00:06:19.290> know<00:06:19.919> more<00:06:20.520> volume<00:06:20.940> eyes<00:06:21.060> door

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
longer or you know more volume eyes door

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.210 
longer or you know more volume eyes door
curled<00:06:21.630> it<00:06:21.810> just<00:06:21.990> makes<00:06:22.169> them<00:06:22.410> it<00:06:22.710> just<00:06:22.950> really

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
curled it just makes them it just really

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.159 
curled it just makes them it just really
defines<00:06:23.669> the<00:06:23.910> lashes<00:06:24.300> that<00:06:24.330> you<00:06:24.510> already<00:06:24.750> have

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
defines the lashes that you already have

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.380 
defines the lashes that you already have
so<00:06:25.860> really<00:06:26.130> I<00:06:26.160> think<00:06:26.310> this<00:06:26.610> is<00:06:26.760> a<00:06:26.940> mascara

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390 
so really I think this is a mascara

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.050 
so really I think this is a mascara
that's<00:06:27.690> best<00:06:27.990> for<00:06:28.290> a<00:06:28.320> natural<00:06:29.100> look<00:06:29.310> if<00:06:29.580> you

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
that's best for a natural look if you

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.820 
that's best for a natural look if you
want<00:06:30.240> something<00:06:30.510> very<00:06:30.960> dramatic<00:06:31.169> I<00:06:31.680> don't

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
want something very dramatic I don't

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.260 
want something very dramatic I don't
think<00:06:32.010> this<00:06:32.130> is<00:06:32.190> going<00:06:32.490> to<00:06:32.580> really<00:06:32.820> give<00:06:33.030> it<00:06:33.150> to

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
think this is going to really give it to

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.730 
think this is going to really give it to
you<00:06:33.360> because<00:06:33.720> I'm<00:06:33.930> a<00:06:33.990> person<00:06:34.440> who<00:06:34.590> really

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.420 
droop throughout the day the formula is
kind<00:06:48.350> of<00:06:48.440> heavy<00:06:48.650> I<00:06:48.770> mean<00:06:49.070> that's<00:06:49.250> what<00:06:49.400> I

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
kind of heavy I mean that's what I

noticed and another thing is that I

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.950 
noticed and another thing is that I
don't<00:06:52.070> think<00:06:52.460> the<00:06:52.610> wiper<00:06:52.850> is<00:06:53.150> that<00:06:53.389> good<00:06:53.690> in

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960

$25 I really was expecting more from
this<00:07:10.250> overall<00:07:10.850> this<00:07:11.000> mascara<00:07:11.480> I<00:07:11.720> think<00:07:11.930> is

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
this overall this mascara I think is

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.900 
this overall this mascara I think is
good<00:07:12.230> for<00:07:12.260> like<00:07:12.680> I<00:07:12.770> said<00:07:12.830> really<00:07:13.370> natural

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:13.910 
good for like I said really natural

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.420 
good for like I said really natural
defying<00:07:14.330> lashes<00:07:14.900> other<00:07:15.560> than<00:07:15.890> that<00:07:16.070> if<00:07:16.280> you

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
defying lashes other than that if you

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.430 
defying lashes other than that if you
want<00:07:16.669> anything<00:07:17.060> else<00:07:17.390> like<00:07:17.570> this<00:07:18.169> doesn't

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 
want anything else like this doesn't

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.560 
want anything else like this doesn't
really<00:07:18.650> build<00:07:19.040> well<00:07:19.430> I<00:07:19.730> mean<00:07:19.880> I<00:07:19.940> tried<00:07:20.390> to

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:20.570 
really build well I mean I tried to

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.110 
really build well I mean I tried to
layer<00:07:20.780> to<00:07:21.080> get<00:07:21.200> more<00:07:21.530> on<00:07:21.620> drama<00:07:22.010> but<00:07:22.880> it

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 
layer to get more on drama but it

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.180 
layer to get more on drama but it
doesn't<00:07:23.510> layer<00:07:23.690> well<00:07:24.020> the<00:07:24.410> formula<00:07:24.710> dries

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.190 
doesn't layer well the formula dries

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.030 
doesn't layer well the formula dries
quickly<00:07:25.790> so<00:07:26.330> it<00:07:27.320> I<00:07:27.500> mean<00:07:27.650> I<00:07:27.710> wouldn't

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:28.040 
quickly so it I mean I wouldn't

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.620 
quickly so it I mean I wouldn't
recommend<00:07:28.280> putting<00:07:28.490> on<00:07:28.820> Coast<00:07:29.120> after<00:07:29.510> it

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630 
recommend putting on Coast after it

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.180 
recommend putting on Coast after it
dries<00:07:29.900> already<00:07:30.260> because<00:07:30.590> that's<00:07:30.770> how<00:07:30.950> it<00:07:31.070> gets

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:31.190 
dries already because that's how it gets

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.060 
dries already because that's how it gets
flaky<00:07:31.660> you<00:07:32.660> can<00:07:32.900> do<00:07:33.050> those<00:07:33.200> other<00:07:33.410> mascaras
