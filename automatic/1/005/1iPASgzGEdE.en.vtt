00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.030
 hello everybody 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.040
 the new sport my name is carlos zaga 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.400
 I'm going to give you a tip here. 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.020
 how to lubricate the door hinges 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.130
 of the back cover 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.080
 including this mechanism here as well 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.990
 is a source of noise 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.810
 It's then we have to do it here. 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.949
 in first on the street well this alms here 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.660
 okay she comes back here these lives also 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:40.620
 can use a better brush use a 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.300
 brush on some multipurpose cleaner to which 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.300
 removes fat ok 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.409
 then pour plenty of water and let it dry 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.570
 and it is here that I put this paper 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:54.180
 towel back to when to spray 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.089
 in an ina 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.659
 have to stay cleaning, okay, we'll go 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.920
 for the now spraying process 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.850
 right now we'll process 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.010
 Publication 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.590
 I always use wd-40 which I think is the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.420
 best product for this kind of attention 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.289
 for poverty but I live here and now 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:23.369
 behind her with this piece that she too 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:26.460
 slide on top too 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.619
 ready enough is going to run a 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.420
 little wait a little bit then take 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:37.280
 access with paper towels and then 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.280
 do one more thing I'll put here 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:47.390
 Brazilian is there on the star farm 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.390
 I will have clear 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.859
 I love you this subject and now I'm going 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.390
 pass then vaseline this is 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.770
 important that the base does not help 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.590
 credibility 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.590
 this species here is just a little bit okay 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.369
 good enough 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.850
 and now we're going to make the hinges 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.460
 the back cover okay this one is 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.670
 less than 1 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:35.880
 I put it will also propose the exchange 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:41.740
 It does not work because it 's just a little bit 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:46.270
 that down here and down here 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:49.090
 also wait a little after 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.970
 know the contact the line is avoiding 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.430
 that all that glass I suggest doing 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.920
 this every three months at least 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.150
 both here and that cup I just 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.080
 to do 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:08.290
 and here is the top part is a process 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:10.630
 Just to show the people I do not care 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.270
 Here I will now tried to move to 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:18.880
 you see your activity that is and 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:21.130
 stay after you listen get ready 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.260
 put everything in order 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:28.420
 in about three months, do it again 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:31.350
 It's really that, like it until then. 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.350
 next arm
