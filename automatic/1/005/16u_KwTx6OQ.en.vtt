00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.460
 most times the chromosome that goes unchanged from father to son as a 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.729
 appetite 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.729
 but sometimes a small difference is filtered 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.089
 like the spelling of a beep that change over time 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.479
 with some frequency a harmless mutation appears on the chromosome 

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:28.419
 he wants a man 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.909
 all of your children inherit that mutation and the children of those children 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.640
 and points to all of its descendants as a brand 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.820
 well he discovered vs that 16 million men are cousins 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.820
 its chromosomes that is ours in the same mutations 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.770
 that means that all descend from one man 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.770
 a super ancestor of the center of asia 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.380
 but if in it 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.220
 questioned that genetic detectives analyze the signs 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.140
 the mutations are grouped around a single concord site 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.140
 go back to almost a thousand years ago 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.670
 scientists believe that he must have been a powerful man 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.670
 with many children that he would perpetuate in his surname 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.530
 all the signs point to a man 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.330
 the fiscal 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
 the evidence is circumstantial but compelling 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.200
 the empire of kan extended from kazakhstan to korea 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.270
 he ruled a dynasty that club several generations 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.810
 your children and the children of your children 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.210
 they had the power and the opposition to spread their chromosome that 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.850
 their armies or toured central Asia defeating their enemies and with 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.270
 often it is said 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.840
 raping his women 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.160
 the result 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.730
 more children with the chromosome than the one of gengis khan and the lineage of other men 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.730
 destroyed forever 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.579
 The NECG and prosecutors are buried with him in some unknown tomb but 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.650
 mutations of your chromosome that survive as their descendants say 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.389
 Research indicates that the chromosome arrives can take us 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.949
 hundreds of years to the past 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.439
 but to find the so scientific 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.869
 we want to track a man of our ancestors 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.099
 that procreated 1 million individuals 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.099
 if not billions 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.510
 the reward is almost unimaginable jonathan who could be the first human 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.949
 really modern 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:50.979
 just the time we can locate 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.310
 whose face 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.310
 we can rebuild 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:03.439
 this is a scientific search but the idea that inspires us was consigned by 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.439
 first time in a document of faith 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:12.629
 thousands of years before genetics the book of genesis speaks of a man 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.559
 who was the father of all of us 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:18.559
 the bible gives us no physical description of age 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:22.029
 says only that it was created from dust for the image and likeness of God 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.689
 the rib of adam provides the raw material for the first woman pepa 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:32.909
 God gives them a home 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.179
 the garden of Eden 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:39.699
 but soon tempted by a snake adam and eva komen from the tree of the 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.949
 wisdom 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.949
 and they are expelled from paradise 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.829
 Adam and Eve have children 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.259
 and according to the bible his family grew up to create all the inhabitants of the 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.259
 land 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.930
 the gospel of lucas the new testament after the family tree 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.930
 of adam generation for generations 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.569
 and if we would test someone who 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.659
 affirms to have relation with that lineage 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.590
 most people that the bible influences the family tree of ata 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.590
 they have disappeared without a trace 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.599
 however, a person stands out as a significant historical figure 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.599
 Solomon the third king of Israel 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.110
 even today there are people who claim to be direct descendants of Solomon 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.979
 the Ethiopian royal family 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:43.990
 it seems unlikely 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.119
 the Jerusalem of Solomon is 2 thousand 400 kilometers from it pía 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.350
 but the Ethiopians claim to have extraordinary physical evidence 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.309
 that relates them to holy ground 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:01.789
 ooooohhh 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.020
 as it was believed that the ark of the covenant contained the tables of the ten 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.020
 commandments oo the word of God 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.520
 1 the deficit milk that was kept in a temple built by Solomon in 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.520
 Jerusalem 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.740
 until the son of Solomon 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.590
 Millennium appropriated it and then took it to a small church in the 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:36.690
 pack sum in northern Ethiopia percent to 111 the Ethiopian royal family 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.370
 He claimed to be a direct descendant of 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.879
 and therefore of Solomon 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:46.300
 if that is true, your family tree connects directly with the lineage 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.370
 theatrical critic 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.970
 to prove that lineage 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.970
 we will need a member of the royal family with the pole 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:59.839
 in 1974 the emperor tried them utility was dethroned 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.289
 the royal family whose exile 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.729
 we found a prince who agreed to participate in our search with a 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.089
 condition 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:14.089
 We can not reveal your identity 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.740
 wants to avoid accusations that he used his relationship with Solomon to claim the 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.589
 throne 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:26.789
 the prince undergoes a DNA test and secret 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:30.969
 a few tiny cells inside your mouth 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:32.999
 take us to a remote past 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:35.999
 the bird can not reveal the origin of its ancestors 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.529
 I would relate it to Solomon 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.529
 the results are tempting 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.939
 mutations of chromosome 7 the prince support his assertion 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:52.119
 indicate an ancestor of the Middle East 

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:55.119
 but this is not definitive proof 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:59.889
 with jenkins candie's and 6 million men indicated towards a man 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.560
 with solomon 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.560
 maybe we have a prince of uncle pepe 

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:10.089
 there is not enough evidence to move forward 

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:15.289
 the experiment shows how difficult it can be to trace the genealogy of the 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:16.879
 Bible 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:18.460
 it's a book the f 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.610
 there is no forensic evidence 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.400
 what the bible says about creation surpasses the scope of science not 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.579
 it's about lady di it's about who fumes like people 

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:35.529
 in Hebrew the name adam also means people 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:39.779
 the important thing about adam is that this is the people 

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:44.469
 the bible gave us the idea of ​​high 

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:50.089
 but in contrast the scientific version will require modern genetics 

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:55.759
 if we are successful we will relate all the men of today with one so 

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:57.649
 scientific 

00:07:57.649 --> 00:08:00.699
 and perhaps even ubic we have your garden of Eden
