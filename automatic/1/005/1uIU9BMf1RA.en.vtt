00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:52.219 
United States and can I believe they

outside<00:06:55.039> of<00:06:55.789> Canada<00:06:56.300> or<00:06:56.419> the<00:06:56.449> US<00:06:56.870> I<00:06:57.050> think<00:06:57.319> it

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:57.409 
outside of Canada or the US I think it

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:59.529 
outside of Canada or the US I think it
goes<00:06:57.500> up<00:06:57.650> to<00:06:57.770> $15<00:06:58.490> or<00:06:58.610> more<00:06:58.759> so<00:06:58.940> it<00:06:59.030> can<00:06:59.210> be<00:06:59.330> kind

00:06:59.529 --> 00:06:59.539 
goes up to $15 or more so it can be kind

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:01.029 
goes up to $15 or more so it can be kind
of<00:06:59.569> pricey<00:06:59.780> but<00:07:00.139> just<00:07:00.289> remember<00:07:00.710> if<00:07:00.860> you're
