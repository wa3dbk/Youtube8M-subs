hello<00:00:04.500> everyone<00:00:05.010> now<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.370> March<00:00:06.139> 2012<00:00:07.139> I<00:00:08.179> just

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
hello everyone now is March 2012 I just

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.759 
hello everyone now is March 2012 I just
got<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:11.510> olive<00:00:12.510> plant<00:00:15.109> you<00:00:16.109> know<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.260> always

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:16.769 
got this olive plant you know I always

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.239 
got this olive plant you know I always
have<00:00:17.010> wanted<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.460> have<00:00:17.699> olive<00:00:18.300> bonsai<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.589> I'm

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:20.249 
have wanted to have olive bonsai and I'm

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.880 
have wanted to have olive bonsai and I'm
working<00:00:20.490> one<00:00:20.960> going<00:00:21.960> one<00:00:22.109> from<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.470> seedling

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
working one going one from the seedling

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.120 
working one going one from the seedling
but<00:00:23.730> that's<00:00:23.909> going<00:00:24.089> to<00:00:24.179> take<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.329> while<00:00:24.599> so

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
but that's going to take a while so

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.929 
but that's going to take a while so
meanwhile<00:00:26.130> got<00:00:26.339> this<00:00:26.489> one

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
meanwhile got this one

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.389 
meanwhile got this one
so<00:00:27.239> this<00:00:27.419> one<00:00:27.599> would<00:00:27.810> do<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.159> probably

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:29.399 
so this one would do this is probably

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.569 
so this one would do this is probably
some<00:00:29.579> kind<00:00:29.759> of<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.119> dwarf<00:00:30.569> type<00:00:31.079> of<00:00:31.439> all<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
some kind of a dwarf type of all the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.049 
some kind of a dwarf type of all the
fruitless<00:00:33.390> olives<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:35.519> been<00:00:35.789> trained

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
fruitless olives and it's been trained

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.450 
fruitless olives and it's been trained
as<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> topiary<00:00:36.840> right<00:00:37.199> now<00:00:39.829> you<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.949> see<00:00:41.250> that

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
as a topiary right now you can see that

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.869 
as a topiary right now you can see that
the<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.300> trunks<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.899> kind<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.469> straight<00:00:43.890> not

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the the trunks are kind of straight not

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.029 
the the trunks are kind of straight not
as<00:00:45.170> as<00:00:46.460> impressive<00:00:47.539> as<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.690> want<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.410> know<00:00:49.559> but

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
as as impressive as I want you know but

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.529 
as as impressive as I want you know but
but<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.489> would<00:00:50.670> do<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.210> will<00:00:51.390> give<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
but this would do this will give a

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:59.100 
but this would do this will give a
practice<00:00:53.660> view<00:00:54.660> from<00:00:54.929> the<00:00:55.050> top

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.310 

first<00:00:59.620> thing<00:00:59.830> I<00:00:59.950> want<00:01:00.130> to<00:01:00.190> do<00:01:00.340> is<00:01:00.550> to<00:01:00.850> see<00:01:01.330> any

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
first thing I want to do is to see any

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.450 
first thing I want to do is to see any
major<00:01:02.650> crossing<00:01:03.340> branches<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:04.750> this<00:01:04.930> one

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
major crossing branches like this one

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.770 
major crossing branches like this one
should<00:01:06.460> we<00:01:06.550> remove<00:01:06.910> you<00:01:07.480> know<00:01:07.600> they're

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
should we remove you know they're

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:18.030 
should we remove you know they're
crossing<00:01:08.020> so<00:01:08.560> it's<00:01:09.310> not<00:01:09.400> easy<00:01:09.580> calls<00:01:16.860> look<00:01:17.860> at

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
crossing so it's not easy calls look at

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.490 
crossing so it's not easy calls look at
that<00:01:18.220> here<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.920> one<00:01:21.190> is<00:01:21.310> going<00:01:21.550> straight<00:01:22.060> up

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
that here this one is going straight up

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.370 
that here this one is going straight up
probably<00:01:23.500> don't<00:01:23.680> like<00:01:23.830> that<00:01:25.170> there's<00:01:26.170> another

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
probably don't like that there's another

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.070 
probably don't like that there's another
one<00:01:26.590> here<00:01:26.770> going<00:01:27.190> kind<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.580> low<00:01:27.910> down

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
one here going kind of low down

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.800 
one here going kind of low down
usually<00:01:29.590> I<00:01:29.650> like<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:30.010> keep<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.370> lower<00:01:30.520> ones<00:01:30.880> by

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
usually I like to keep the lower ones by

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.660 
usually I like to keep the lower ones by
in<00:01:31.870> this<00:01:32.110> case<00:01:32.350> this<00:01:32.530> is<00:01:32.590> this<00:01:33.400> one's<00:01:33.580> just

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
in this case this is this one's just

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.990 
in this case this is this one's just
going<00:01:34.060> too<00:01:34.360> low<00:01:34.570> I<00:01:34.840> don't<00:01:35.140> think<00:01:35.970> well<00:01:36.970> maybe

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
going too low I don't think well maybe

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.460 
going too low I don't think well maybe
I'll<00:01:37.330> keep<00:01:37.479> it<00:01:37.630> man<00:01:37.900> let<00:01:38.080> me<00:01:38.140> just<00:01:38.320> remember

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
I'll keep it man let me just remember

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.270 
I'll keep it man let me just remember
this<00:01:38.710> one<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:40.390> maybe<00:01:40.690> I'll<00:01:40.840> keep<00:01:41.050> this<00:01:41.200> one

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
this one and maybe I'll keep this one

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.620 
this one and maybe I'll keep this one
but<00:01:42.510> this<00:01:43.510> one<00:01:43.720> going<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:46.030> down<00:01:46.240> on<00:01:46.270> top<00:01:46.630> I<00:01:46.840> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
but this one going like down on top I I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.790 
but this one going like down on top I I
remove<00:01:49.630> it<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.510> have<00:01:52.660> to<00:01:52.750> use<00:01:52.900> a<00:01:52.930> thicker

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
remove it and I have to use a thicker

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.700 
remove it and I have to use a thicker
cutter<00:01:57.510> so<00:01:58.510> the<00:01:58.660> idea<00:01:58.900> is<00:01:59.020> try<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.200> open<00:01:59.560> up<00:01:59.680> a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
cutter so the idea is try to open up a

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:07.320 
cutter so the idea is try to open up a
tree

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:17.500 

finish<00:02:08.330> off<00:02:08.539> with<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:09.759> concave<00:02:10.759> cutter<00:02:16.510> better

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
finish off with a concave cutter better

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.309 
finish off with a concave cutter better
view<00:02:17.690> here

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.319 

sometimes<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.500> acquire<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:27.099> couple<00:02:27.819> cuts<00:02:28.000> in

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
sometimes you acquire a couple cuts in

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.240 
sometimes you acquire a couple cuts in
order<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:28.719> get<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.019> right<00:02:29.409> but<00:02:29.739> that's<00:02:29.890> alright

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
order to get it right but that's alright

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.339 
order to get it right but that's alright
you<00:02:30.489> know<00:02:30.579> I<00:02:30.790> want<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.629> do<00:02:31.930> everything<00:02:32.140> with

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
you know I want to do everything with

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:42.569 
you know I want to do everything with
just<00:02:32.590> one<00:02:32.829> cut<00:02:33.159> so<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:41.500> as<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.799> can<00:02:41.920> see<00:02:41.980> it

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
just one cut so and as you can see it

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.420 
just one cut so and as you can see it
was<00:02:42.730> just<00:02:42.969> you<00:02:43.209> know<00:02:43.239> two<00:02:43.629> cuts<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:45.159> plan

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
was just you know two cuts and the plan

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.490 
was just you know two cuts and the plan
is<00:02:45.609> already<00:02:45.939> opening<00:02:46.719> up<00:02:47.069> so<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:50.170> let's<00:02:50.349> move

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
is already opening up so so let's move

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.199 
is already opening up so so let's move
on<00:02:50.650> let's<00:02:50.829> look<00:02:50.980> what<00:02:51.459> other<00:02:51.639> branches<00:02:52.060> are

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
on let's look what other branches are

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.929 
on let's look what other branches are
crossing<00:02:52.629> I<00:02:55.319> can<00:02:56.319> see<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.799> this<00:02:57.159> part<00:02:57.819> is

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
crossing I can see that this part is

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.569 
crossing I can see that this part is
just<00:02:57.970> way<00:02:58.419> too<00:02:58.480> dense<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.579> something

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
just way too dense so something

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:06.390 
just way too dense so something
something<00:03:01.060> has<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.359> be<00:03:01.450> clear<00:03:01.659> up<00:03:01.840> here<00:03:05.340> how<00:03:06.340> do

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
something has to be clear up here how do

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.339 
something has to be clear up here how do
you<00:03:06.489> see<00:03:08.129> but<00:03:09.239> from<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.389> top<00:03:10.599> you<00:03:10.900> can<00:03:11.079> see

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
you see but from the top you can see

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.580 
you see but from the top you can see
this<00:03:11.680> whole<00:03:11.919> bunch<00:03:12.129> of<00:03:12.340> branches<00:03:13.200> on<00:03:14.200> the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
this whole bunch of branches on the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.979 
this whole bunch of branches on the
right<00:03:14.799> side<00:03:15.069> and<00:03:15.810> there's<00:03:16.810> some<00:03:16.959> more

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
branches from the left side so they're

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.020 
branches from the left side so they're
crossing<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:19.569> I<00:03:19.599> had<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.109> try<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.319> remove<00:03:20.680> them

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030

they<00:04:18.350> already<00:04:18.500> have<00:04:18.799> some<00:04:19.010> branches<00:04:19.430> going

they already have some branches going

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:27.460 
they already have some branches going
here<00:04:20.359> so<00:04:23.530> one<00:04:24.530> more<00:04:24.890> place<00:04:25.160> here<00:04:25.850> you<00:04:26.260> can<00:04:27.260> see

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
here so one more place here you can see

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.920 
here so one more place here you can see
a<00:04:27.500> lot<00:04:27.680> of<00:04:27.830> branches<00:04:28.100> to<00:04:29.000> concentrate<00:04:29.720> in<00:04:29.810> this

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
a lot of branches to concentrate in this

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.120 
a lot of branches to concentrate in this
area<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:31.580> know<00:04:31.669> behind<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.450> to<00:04:32.660> in<00:04:32.960> front<00:04:33.260> this

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
area you know behind it to in front this

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:41.050 
area you know behind it to in front this
one<00:04:34.340> I<00:04:34.370> can<00:04:34.640> I<00:04:35.590> give<00:04:36.590> cut<00:04:39.370> okay<00:04:40.370> that's<00:04:40.730> that's

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
one I can I give cut okay that's that's

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.060 
one I can I give cut okay that's that's
I<00:04:41.330> think<00:04:41.390> that's<00:04:41.750> all<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.110> major<00:04:42.470> branch

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
I think that's all the major branch

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.640 
I think that's all the major branch
pruning<00:04:43.610> that<00:04:43.790> I<00:04:44.210> want<00:04:44.419> to<00:04:44.480> do<00:04:44.630> I<00:04:44.930> mean<00:04:45.530> the

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
pruning that I want to do I mean the

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.730 
pruning that I want to do I mean the
major<00:04:45.830> branches<00:04:46.630> as<00:04:47.630> you<00:04:47.840> do<00:04:47.990> more<00:04:48.350> pruning

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
major branches as you do more pruning

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.290 
major branches as you do more pruning
but<00:04:48.919> now<00:04:49.130> I'm<00:04:49.280> going<00:04:49.430> to<00:04:49.520> move<00:04:49.640> on<00:04:49.820> to<00:04:49.940> the

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
but now I'm going to move on to the

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.920 
but now I'm going to move on to the
smaller<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:51.560> secondary<00:04:52.040> branches<00:04:52.310> now<00:04:52.930> of

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
smaller the secondary branches now of

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.219 
smaller the secondary branches now of
course<00:04:54.169> try<00:04:54.500> to<00:04:54.560> make<00:04:54.979> it<00:04:55.100> shorter<00:04:56.050> we<00:04:57.050> can

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
course try to make it shorter we can

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.010 
course try to make it shorter we can
start<00:04:57.530> one<00:04:57.800> by<00:04:57.950> one<00:04:58.190> I<00:04:58.540> think<00:04:59.540> there's<00:04:59.870> this

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
start one by one I think there's this

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.930 
start one by one I think there's this
big<00:05:00.940> branch<00:05:01.940> on<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.360> left<00:05:02.870> side<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:04.130> this<00:05:04.880> is

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
big branch on the left side and this is

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.760 
big branch on the left side and this is
going<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.390> be<00:05:05.570> a<00:05:07.210> path<00:05:08.210> here<00:05:08.570> this<00:05:09.169> way<00:05:09.350> so<00:05:09.650> I'm

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
going to be a path here this way so I'm

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.860 
going to be a path here this way so I'm
going<00:05:09.919> to<00:05:09.979> try<00:05:10.070> to<00:05:10.100> walk<00:05:10.310> on<00:05:10.430> this<00:05:10.640> side<00:05:10.910> first

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
going to try to walk on this side first

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.370 
going to try to walk on this side first
you<00:05:12.680> know<00:05:12.910> and<00:05:13.910> this<00:05:14.450> very<00:05:14.720> simple<00:05:14.990> just<00:05:15.200> try

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
you know and this very simple just try

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.820 
you know and this very simple just try
to<00:05:15.440> reduce<00:05:15.890> everything<00:05:16.070> in<00:05:17.060> length<00:05:17.710> you<00:05:18.710> know

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
to reduce everything in length you know

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.770 
to reduce everything in length you know
probably<00:05:19.070> cut<00:05:19.370> everything<00:05:19.760> down<00:05:19.940> to<00:05:21.370> two<00:05:22.780> or

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
probably cut everything down to two or

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:35.480 
probably cut everything down to two or
three<00:05:24.380> pair<00:05:24.680> of<00:05:24.830> leaves

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
you know if you're not sure you can

00:05:37.780 --> 00:06:01.820 
you know if you're not sure you can
always<00:05:37.930> leave<00:05:38.290> more<00:05:38.590> now<00:05:39.340> five<00:05:39.640> pair<00:05:39.940> of<00:05:40.240> bees

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
trying to form this pad here I'm gonna

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.690 
trying to form this pad here I'm gonna
do<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.240> same<00:06:10.420> thing<00:06:10.600> with<00:06:10.830> with<00:06:11.830> this<00:06:11.980> this

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
do the same thing with with this this

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.340 
do the same thing with with this this
side<00:06:12.970> of<00:06:13.150> the<00:06:13.270> branch<00:06:13.450> just<00:06:14.050> reduce

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
side of the branch just reduce

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.870 
side of the branch just reduce
everything<00:06:14.620> small<00:06:15.360> shorter<00:06:16.390> okay<00:06:17.580> okay<00:06:18.580> I'll

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
everything small shorter okay okay I'll

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.730 
everything small shorter okay okay I'll
shorten<00:06:19.090> this<00:06:19.360> side<00:06:19.600> now<00:06:19.810> now<00:06:20.350> I'm<00:06:20.440> just<00:06:20.620> going

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
shorten this side now now I'm just going

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.170 
shorten this side now now I'm just going
to<00:06:20.860> do<00:06:20.920> the<00:06:21.010> same<00:06:21.160> thing<00:06:21.460> throughout<00:06:21.970> the

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
to do the same thing throughout the

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.730 
to do the same thing throughout the
whole<00:06:22.390> tree<00:06:22.690> you<00:06:23.050> know<00:06:23.230> all<00:06:23.350> the<00:06:23.530> length

whole tree you know all the length
longer<00:06:25.140> branches<00:06:26.140> I<00:06:26.680> just<00:06:27.010> gonna<00:06:27.160> reduce<00:06:27.520> it

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
longer branches I just gonna reduce it

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.520 
longer branches I just gonna reduce it
now<00:06:30.730> just<00:06:31.150> repeat<00:06:31.720> the<00:06:31.960> process<00:06:31.990> and<00:06:32.440> I'll

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
now just repeat the process and I'll

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.520 
now just repeat the process and I'll
show<00:06:32.710> you<00:06:32.800> the<00:06:32.970> okay<00:06:33.970> now<00:06:34.600> after<00:06:35.200> the<00:06:35.350> haircut

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
show you the okay now after the haircut

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.300 
show you the okay now after the haircut
everything<00:06:36.010> shorter<00:06:37.560> less<00:06:38.560> branches<00:06:39.070> now<00:06:39.250> you

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
everything shorter less branches now you

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.470 
everything shorter less branches now you
can<00:06:39.640> definitely<00:06:39.760> get<00:06:40.120> a<00:06:40.180> better<00:06:40.540> view<00:06:40.840> of<00:06:41.460> the

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.580 

so<00:06:52.530> I'm<00:06:52.650> sure<00:06:52.830> actually<00:06:53.040> going<00:06:53.400> to<00:06:53.550> a<00:06:53.580> further

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
so I'm sure actually going to a further

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.390 
so I'm sure actually going to a further
