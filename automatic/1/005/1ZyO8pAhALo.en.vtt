00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
times in that's normal so let's assume

that you'll be Prakriti to the main page
which<00:00:38.850> looks<00:00:39.120> like<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.100> there<00:00:41.100> are<00:00:41.160> two

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
which looks like this and there are two

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.729 
which looks like this and there are two
ways<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.640> viewing<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.590> might

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
ways of viewing it one is in what might

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.139 
ways of viewing it one is in what might
be<00:00:43.890> called<00:00:44.040> normal<00:00:44.219> view<00:00:44.610> which<00:00:44.879> looks<00:00:45.090> like

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
be called normal view which looks like

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.410 
be called normal view which looks like
this<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.079> there<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.559> another<00:00:46.829> view<00:00:47.030> which<00:00:48.030> is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
this and there is another view which is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.630 
this and there is another view which is
they<00:00:48.660> call<00:00:48.840> easy<00:00:49.110> view<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.219> that's<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.460> view<00:00:50.610> I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
they call easy view and that's a view I

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.310 
they call easy view and that's a view I
prefer<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.180> user<00:00:51.360> because<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> think<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.170> much
