00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.509
 the psol 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.309
 My name is Pedro, go to heaven and in this 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.410
 video let's show you how you guys 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.990
 can google through prostitute 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.710
 put a part of a movie on camera 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.859
 slow 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.230
 then I'll save you from 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.939
 importation and confectionery and even because I 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.489
 I already saw a tutorial about this 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.300
 if you want to know how to do it 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.700
 They can go to my palace to realize 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 dunga that the next video and are the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.210
 tutorials all inclusive this is so much 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.129
 I already the invitation here and now I'm just going 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.410
 drag to the image then only falls 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.809
 to do this now will choose that 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.940
 The zone I want to put on the camera 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.359
 slow then track 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.059
 this yellow bar to the site 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.970
 Do you want to put it where I want it? 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.590
 start by slow motion 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.220
 I'm launching a helicopter from my 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.740
 son 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.080
 a toy helicopter can be the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.000
 from here and now I'm going to give a 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.000
 corto create two segments 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:35.189
 Now I'll see how much I want to 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:37.680
 slow motion may be that of the east consul 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.780
 my core segment is is what I want 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.820
 put the other two in slow motion 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.250
 I do not want to stay in speed 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.509
 normal 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.340
 then just select the segment 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.340
 center is already in berlin is not 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.600
 change the image or floor and with history 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.469
 on point or get here and put even 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.570
 the percentage by 20 percent is 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.159
 now in which purpose in this new with the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.530
 near and was much more consulted 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.649
 informs us everything that was the old 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.530
 old software version 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.230
 it was not so simple but now 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.090
 it's quite a lot simpler 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.260
 work is now already worth 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.370
 I start it in the movie and I go for a 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.579
 I would rush to see how it is that 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.579
 stay 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.349
 therefore they have seen this for this part 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.890
 stayed in slow motion is transition was 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.569
 good 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.580
 there were no problems and it is the process is 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.310
 this is very simple 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.010
 Now let's just solarize something else. 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.459
 let's take this to another prime level 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.400
 so just here and pay the newspaper segments 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.730
 not to suffer and now I will adjust 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.780
 again this is my video here for 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.519
 a year and I'll put some 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.670
 Try to be a little ride. 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.360
 I'll put it here it can be here in this 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.970
 site 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:26.239
 I'll cut because you want to simulate something. 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.360
 I I I I stop in to have a 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:33.860
 situation so you know that when 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.620
 you've been a cool year own virus with 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.840
 one a very large extension and we have 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:44.690
 Time to stage she shares the movie in 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.500
 two files are left with two files in the 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.720
 card that happens because you have to 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.049
 pay in these two files come here and 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.569
 yes to the next and convert them falls pass 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.569
 to step 2 which is where I am right 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:02.359
 Let's show up here today, imagine it here. 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.549
 one building and another in my case I do not have 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.109
 two tanks is ours puts this 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.450
 This attitude has been very 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.870
 climate 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.209
 imagine that I have here 22 here to 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.070
 My mother did not like the first one and I 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.200
 that the segment was a second 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.209
 I created the other segment and that was it. 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.270
 I want to live here, imagine that you are 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.039
 an extremely long film that this is the 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.639
 first file of this is the 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:31.070
 second round of the event and by chance 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.919
 Do I want to create a slow motion? 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.500
 here, but precisely in the zone of the 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:41.750
 cutting ie in the area where the goal 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:47.289
 Looked for the movie that I do the same 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:49.490
 something here so a little more here 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.080
 I came from here so much in that 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.610
 this type of movie 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.689
 no longer because this segment is so 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.189
 Little boy, let's see what's around here. 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.379
 so from here I want you to 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:05.340
 stay in slow motion how much is going to 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:09.439
 cutting against physical segment is 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:13.409
 end of my first segment is that 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:15.599
 this is the end of this and now goes to the 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.039
 south and I'll see how much I want 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.289
 lead to slow motion 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.960
 to walk a little bit more to the 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:25.500
 right can be here and sleep a 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.360
 Short again and I'll get a room 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:33.509
 Santana segment that two elements 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:36.539
 central is is the final opart of my 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:38.580
 first segment this is an initial part 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.900
 of my second segment did not fall into 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.620
 second segment created by google 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:49.650
 promotes is not now what I do if 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:51.629
 if I put one 20% in the other and 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.150
 also have to pay attention 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:56.159
 that the percentage here nevada city has 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.550
 to be an event which at the time was not 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:01.050
 to deceive is easy to deceive is if you 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.669
 analyzed her parents but went here 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.870
 same is this box and put the 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.870
 correct number 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.940
 the correct percentage and never cheat 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.279
 It is but of course if there was a 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.069
 speed offset. 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:19.289
 movement here in the passage 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.839
 from one to the other you will notice a 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.330
 difference is considered to be logical. 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:25.710
 just be aware and ready your team 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.750
 in the last four segments 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.069
 these two plants now cocaine is 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.250
 possible and I'll see if I can 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:33.300
 this couple focused on again in the 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:38.810
 movie start 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.810
 I'll do it there and see how it goes. 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.129
 it did not work out more was to join it is not is 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.129
 and ready 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:58.870
 basically this is what I hope the 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:02.520
 video has been I have that was 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.520
 Thank you for watching and until the next
