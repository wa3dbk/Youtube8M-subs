00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.660 
so and then now this is actually a
little<00:01:03.989> bigger<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.830> might<00:01:05.010> may<00:01:05.369> even<00:01:05.489> get

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
little bigger so we might may even get

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.310 
little bigger so we might may even get
more<00:01:05.909> out<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.930> we're<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
slant like this one and then in half so

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.730 
slant like this one and then in half so
now<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.549> can<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:15.119> even<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.420> half<00:01:15.540> again

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
now I can do this one even in half again

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.649 
now I can do this one even in half again
you<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.040> mean<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.210> actually<00:01:18.299> even

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
you see what I mean so and actually even

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.760 
you see what I mean so and actually even
one<00:01:18.869> more<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.860> want<00:01:20.040> smaller<00:01:20.490> pieces

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
one more we just want smaller pieces

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.570 
one more we just want smaller pieces
like<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.960> throw<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.380> there<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.799> do
