I've just had a chance to look through

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.479 
I've just had a chance to look through
them<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.870> kind<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.230> weak<00:00:46.469> sauce<00:00:46.800> actually

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
them it's kind of weak sauce actually

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.360 
them it's kind of weak sauce actually
and<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:47.989> I<00:00:48.989> don't<00:00:49.500> know<00:00:49.620> what<00:00:49.800> he's<00:00:49.950> exactly

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and so I don't know what he's exactly

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.900 
and so I don't know what he's exactly

getting the legislation through is going

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.369 
getting the legislation through is going
to<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.370> difficult<00:00:56.610> impossible<00:00:57.570> Melissa<00:00:58.230> leave

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
to be difficult impossible Melissa leave

want politicians in Washington to accept

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.170 
want politicians in Washington to accept
these<00:01:05.460> gun<00:01:05.760> reforms<00:01:07.430> now<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.700> course<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.119> don't

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
these gun reforms now of course I don't

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.620 
these gun reforms now of course I don't
I<00:01:09.630> mean<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.939> laws<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.210> he's

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
I mean this is the the laws that he's

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.630 
I mean this is the the laws that he's
talking<00:01:13.080> about<00:01:13.170> passing<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.159> even<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
talking about passing and even the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.070 
talking about passing and even the
executive<00:01:15.150> actions<00:01:15.630> wouldn't<00:01:15.930> have

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
executive actions wouldn't have

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.700 
executive actions wouldn't have
prevented<00:01:16.320> sandy<00:01:17.100> hook<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.490> example<00:01:18.000> his<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
prevented sandy hook for example his the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.310 
prevented sandy hook for example his the
guns<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.340> were<00:01:20.490> used<00:01:20.820> were<00:01:21.299> stolen<00:01:21.990> first

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
guns that were used were stolen first

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.130 
guns that were used were stolen first
before<00:01:22.860> they<00:01:23.009> were<00:01:23.070> used<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.900> guy<00:01:25.080> who

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
before they were used and so the guy who

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.249 
before they were used and so the guy who
made<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:26.790> know<00:01:26.909> took<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.360> guns<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> school

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
made you know took the guns to a school

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.560 
made you know took the guns to a school
took<00:01:29.009> them<00:01:29.250> from<00:01:29.400> his<00:01:29.610> mother<00:01:29.909> first<00:01:30.299> and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
took them from his mother first and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.710 
took them from his mother first and
killed<00:01:31.200> her<00:01:31.500> first<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.159> background<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.299> mental

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
killed her first a background a mental

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.300 
killed her first a background a mental
health<00:01:33.900> background<00:01:34.229> check<00:01:34.740> wouldn't<00:01:35.189> have

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
health background check wouldn't have

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.190 
health background check wouldn't have
stopped<00:01:35.549> Sandy<00:01:36.030> Hook<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> person

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
stopped Sandy Hook because the person

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.130 
stopped Sandy Hook because the person
who<00:01:37.979> committed<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.520> crimes<00:01:38.880> wasn't<00:01:39.840> using

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
who committed the crimes wasn't using

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.530 
who committed the crimes wasn't using
his<00:01:40.170> own<00:01:40.470> guns<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.009> that's<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> same<00:01:42.299> case

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
his own guns and that's the same case

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.280 
his own guns and that's the same case
for<00:01:42.570> Columbine<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.710> example<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.689> find

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
for Columbine for example and so I find

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.420 
for Columbine for example and so I find
these<00:01:47.149> reforms<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.259> impractical<00:01:50.220> and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
these reforms you know impractical and

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.670 
these reforms you know impractical and
not<00:01:51.000> really<00:01:51.210> useful<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.170> worth<00:01:52.320> noting

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
not really useful and it's worth noting

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.560 
not really useful and it's worth noting
isn't<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:52.979> Joe<00:01:53.490> Biden<00:01:53.700> taught<00:01:54.119> about<00:01:54.390> there

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
isn't it Joe Biden taught about there

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.090 
isn't it Joe Biden taught about there
being<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.780> moral<00:01:55.079> obligation<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.770> act<00:01:55.860> all

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
being a moral obligation to act all

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.590 
being a moral obligation to act all
sides<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.640> argument<00:01:56.820> are<00:01:57.180> saying<00:01:57.390> yes

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
sides of this argument are saying yes

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.690 
sides of this argument are saying yes
