00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.910
 hello to you dzhonik and today 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.639
 we mod park I will say at once modpak 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.590
 turned out awesome let's not superfluous 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.720
 gossip let's get down to business first 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.730
 turn we have a clock in the hangar which 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.980
 won't let us sit deep behind 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.020
 midnight and skip work or lessons 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.300
 then we have a tank sorter in the hangar 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.130
 can be sorted by level as a pair 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.790
 fame and so and by gender 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.800
 so 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.900
 make the most successful sample will be 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.430
 very easy but be careful mod 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.040
 has a glitch if you use 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.410
 tick off all ticks then tanks 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.840
 from the hangar completely disappear at 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.730
 least I personally had it so we are in battle 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.160
 I will use the screenshots to be 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.810
 easier to explain the damage panel I have 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.810
 old standard which was he 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.450
 nothing updates 086 and 087 I think on 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.340
 pretty cute and interesting sight 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.410
 if you hover the crosshair on an ally then 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.989
 will reflect its recharge time and 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.000
 distance to it when we direct 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.290
 sight on the enemy then displayed 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.659
 distance to it 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.330
 probability of percentages how likely 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.909
 that he will shine you also below we see 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.840
 armor penetration indicator of your projectile and 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.780
 his armor 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.729
 as well as its recharge time during 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.560
 recharge sight becomes yellow and 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.960
 when gd ends then it becomes 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.970
 blue sniper mode with us 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.310
 a vertical bar appears which 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.950
 helps a bit to aim as well 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.470
 green arrow direction 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.510
 meeting armor with a projectile sight very 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.400
 convenient and if set up correctly and 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.740
 use then there will be no problems 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.930
 just in case I attach 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.150
 screenshot with my sight settings 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.680
 so that each of you can ease 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.500
 adjust the scope exactly as it does 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.630
 I have set up further what is this for 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.520
 black little cinema numbers and blue background 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.860
 and this is nothing more than a given armor 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.479
 upper armor plate and board when we 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.490
 turn the body that value 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.560
 changing I think is quite convenient for 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.780
 lovers on tank rhombus 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.240
 also added a new graphic 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.979
 perk light bulb or sixth 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.560
 a feeling that is colored bright red 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.860
 color with a large white exclamation 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.200
 sign to not 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.760
 and not missed when we are in the light of plus 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.890
 all this is accompanied by a small 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.750
 sound gu daughters also if by us 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.090
 hit the enemy shell then up we 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.040
 see the arrow with the report timer if 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.020
 the projectile inflicted damage to the arrow 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.960
 will be red if the armor is not broken 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.610
 then the arrow will be yellow it is very convenient 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.890
 for those who know recharge time 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.870
 tanks to know when the enemy can 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.940
 shoot next time on minimap 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.200
 everything is pretty standard it's ordinary 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.020
 Kurovskaya mini map showing 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.390
 maximum range markers 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.520
 in 445 meters and round rendering 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.500
 kilometer per kilometer if that 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.270
 added pointer which will allow especially 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.940
 tricky to shoot for the radius of the circle 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.220
 drawing and also no time to be lighted 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.320
 capture and capture base has a timer 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.840
 and opponents who were not in the highlight 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.790
 marked with small asterisks well 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.290
 Of course there is a log applied by us 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.390
 where is the damage without him 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.370
 and of course there are such standard ones 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.650
 things like maximum camera distance 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.709
 or commander's camera as well 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.970
 black and sniper mode removal 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.500
 more about the functionality of how 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.019
 configure install mod pack 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.580

 turntable it is best to switch to 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.130
 youtube by the way who are tired of the standard 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.840
 hangar there not on the channel there is a video in
