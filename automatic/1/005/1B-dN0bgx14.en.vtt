superhuman I suppose what you'll notice

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.100 
superhuman I suppose what you'll notice
is<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.189> there's<00:00:32.489> no<00:00:32.700> late<00:00:32.940> joining<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.480> super

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
is that there's no late joining in super

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.020 
is that there's no late joining in super
human<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.649> if<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:35.100> deploy<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> team

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
human so if you deploy with the team

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.639 
human so if you deploy with the team
that<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.270> are<00:00:36.390> forced<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.840> finish<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.500> game

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
that you are forced to finish the game

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.530 
that you are forced to finish the game
with<00:00:37.829> um<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.610> puts<00:00:38.820> an<00:00:38.940> added<00:00:39.210> amount<00:00:39.390> of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
with um this puts an added amount of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.630 
with um this puts an added amount of
pressure<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.469> team<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.920> survive<00:00:41.219> through

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
pressure on the team to survive through

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.840 
pressure on the team to survive through
the<00:00:41.730> match<00:00:41.879> also<00:00:42.540> there's<00:00:43.500> no<00:00:43.770> Auto<00:00:44.250> respawn

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the match also there's no Auto respawn

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.299 
the match also there's no Auto respawn
so<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.570> must<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.230> revived<00:00:46.559> by<00:00:46.800> another<00:00:47.039> player

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
so you must be revived by another player

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.639 
so you must be revived by another player
this<00:00:48.270> really<00:00:48.600> puts<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> pressure<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
this really puts the pressure on the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.310 
this really puts the pressure on the
team<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.070> stay<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.730> work<00:00:51.120> together<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:52.199> again

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
team to stay to work together but again

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.250 
team to stay to work together but again
the<00:00:52.800> rewards<00:00:53.309> are<00:00:53.489> doubled<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.840> incentive

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the rewards are doubled so the incentive

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.410 
the rewards are doubled so the incentive
should<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.559> high<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.640> also<00:00:56.850> provides<00:00:57.239> an

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
should be high this also provides an

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.119 
should be high this also provides an
opportunity<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.989> more<00:00:58.320> experienced<00:00:59.039> players

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
opportunity for more experienced players

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.700 
opportunity for more experienced players
to<00:00:59.609> bring<00:00:59.930> their<00:01:00.930> friends<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.379> who<00:01:01.530> haven't

this is very important it's not

this is very important it's not

really makes things challenging you have
to<00:02:39.099> play<00:02:39.280> more<00:02:39.459> defensively<00:02:39.910> also<00:02:40.360> because<00:02:40.690> if

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
to play more defensively also because if

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.750 
to play more defensively also because if
you're<00:02:41.170> too<00:02:41.319> aggressive<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.980> can<00:02:42.310> wipe<00:02:42.489> and

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
you're too aggressive you can wipe and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
if you wipe in super human it's pretty

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.710 
if you wipe in super human it's pretty
much<00:02:44.709> game<00:02:44.920> over<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.150> stakes<00:02:46.390> are<00:02:46.540> higher

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
much game over so the stakes are higher

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.960 
much game over so the stakes are higher
the<00:02:46.989> odds<00:02:47.110> are<00:02:47.349> higher<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:48.489> rewards<00:02:48.880> are

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
the odds are higher and the rewards are

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.770 
the odds are higher and the rewards are
higher<00:02:49.120> as<00:02:49.299> well<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:52.000> my<00:02:52.150> friend<00:02:52.420> here<00:02:52.660> there

talking about co-op I'm one of the great
things<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.370> we<00:03:12.609> got<00:03:12.760> in<00:03:12.910> was<00:03:13.060> the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
things that we got in was the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.300 
things that we got in was the
variability<00:03:13.540> in<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.840> randomization<00:03:14.500> it

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
variability in the randomization it

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.309 
variability in the randomization it
should<00:03:15.459> be<00:03:15.549> different<00:03:15.790> every<00:03:15.940> time<00:03:16.079> as<00:03:17.079> well

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
should be different every time as well

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.550 
should be different every time as well

you<00:04:06.450> play<00:04:06.660> it<00:04:06.810> stand<00:04:07.290> in<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.530> standard<00:04:07.890> way<00:04:07.920> I

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
you play it stand in a standard way I

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.130 
you play it stand in a standard way I
think<00:04:08.790> it's<00:04:09.240> just<00:04:09.420> basically<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.840> rush<00:04:10.020> of

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
think it's just basically a rush of

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.030 
think it's just basically a rush of
enemies<00:04:10.500> but<00:04:10.710> when<00:04:11.310> you<00:04:11.370> get<00:04:11.550> it<00:04:11.670> as<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:13.650> final

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
enemies but when you get it as the final

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.620 
enemies but when you get it as the final
encounter<00:04:14.310> we<00:04:15.060> give<00:04:15.270> you<00:04:15.330> a<00:04:15.390> special

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
encounter which is what we call the

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.479

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
motherly / or the Queen Lee / the Queen

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.260 
motherly / or the Queen Lee / the Queen
Lee<00:04:20.609> /<00:04:20.760> is<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:20.940> boss<00:04:22.190> it<00:04:23.190> was<00:04:23.310> basically<00:04:23.700> a<00:04:23.820> more

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
Lee / is a boss it was basically a more

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.120 
Lee / is a boss it was basically a more
powerful<00:04:24.480> version<00:04:24.780> of<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.170> leapers<00:04:25.470> she's

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
powerful version of the leapers she's

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.900 
powerful version of the leapers she's
around<00:04:26.310> here<00:04:26.490> somewhere

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
around here somewhere

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.900 
around here somewhere
I<00:04:27.860> think<00:04:28.860> she's<00:04:28.980> marked<00:04:29.280> by<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.460> starters

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
I think she's marked by the starters

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.070 
I think she's marked by the starters
back<00:04:30.090> let's<00:04:30.360> see<00:04:30.450> if<00:04:30.510> I<00:04:30.570> can<00:04:30.720> go<00:04:30.810> back<00:04:30.840> there

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
back let's see if I can go back there

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:38.790 
back let's see if I can go back there
and<00:04:31.200> find<00:04:31.410> her<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:33.720> there<00:04:33.870> she<00:04:34.050> is

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.570 

blowing<00:04:39.729> things<00:04:39.910> up<00:04:40.030> apparently

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.559 

she<00:04:44.580> is<00:04:44.730> a<00:04:44.760> spider<00:04:45.060> monkey<00:04:45.270> I<00:04:45.450> tell<00:04:45.660> you

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:52.700 

this<00:04:51.569> is<00:04:51.720> just<00:04:51.870> an<00:04:51.930> example<00:04:52.020> of<00:04:52.380> how<00:04:52.470> it<00:04:52.590> got

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
this is just an example of how it got

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.040 
this is just an example of how it got
more<00:04:52.830> variability<00:04:53.430> in<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.580> coop<00:04:53.880> so<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:54.990> you

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
more variability in the coop so that you

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.570 
more variability in the coop so that you
didn't<00:04:55.289> know<00:04:55.410> what<00:04:55.620> quite<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:55.979> it<00:04:56.069> can<00:04:56.220> expect

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
didn't know what quite to it can expect

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.279 
didn't know what quite to it can expect
to<00:04:56.819> increase<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.240> replay<00:04:57.569> value<00:04:57.599> as<00:04:58.080> well<00:04:58.229> as

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
to increase the replay value as well as

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.050 
to increase the replay value as well as
it's<00:04:58.560> kind<00:04:58.710> of<00:04:58.800> in<00:04:59.069> the<00:04:59.190> anticipation<00:04:59.400> value

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
it's kind of in the anticipation value

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.370 
it's kind of in the anticipation value
it's<00:05:00.479> just<00:05:00.509> fun<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.870> get<00:05:00.960> something<00:05:01.259> different

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
it's just fun to get something different

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.770 
it's just fun to get something different
but<00:05:01.590> you<00:05:01.680> don't<00:05:01.830> usually<00:05:01.949> expect<00:05:02.430> so<00:05:03.419> if<00:05:03.690> you

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
but you don't usually expect so if you

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.089 
but you don't usually expect so if you
get<00:05:03.900> this<00:05:04.020> as<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.289> end<00:05:04.440> zone<00:05:04.620> this<00:05:04.770> is<00:05:04.949> an

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
get this as the end zone this is an

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:06.890 
get this as the end zone this is an
example<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.729> what<00:05:06.060> you<00:05:06.120> might<00:05:06.240> be<00:05:06.720> able<00:05:06.780> to
