jug with the Joe Powell so right now I
got<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> trolling<00:01:09.780> motor<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.670> use<00:01:11.850> your

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
got the trolling motor you can use your

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.270 
got the trolling motor you can use your
regular<00:01:12.450> motor<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.080> your<00:01:13.380> -<00:01:13.590> motor<00:01:13.950> are<00:01:14.190> you

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
regular motor you your - motor are you

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.620 
regular motor you your - motor are you
trolling<00:01:14.580> motor<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.120> approach<00:01:15.390> them

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
trolling motor to approach them

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.840 
trolling motor to approach them
therefore<00:01:16.560> cells<00:01:16.770> using<00:01:17.010> trolling<00:01:17.490> motor<00:01:17.700> you

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
therefore cells using trolling motor you

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.870 
therefore cells using trolling motor you
approach<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.600> slower<00:01:18.900> pace<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.880> using

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
approach it at a slower pace and using

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.940 
approach it at a slower pace and using
your<00:01:20.939> gas<00:01:21.180> motor<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.780> approach<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.079> a<00:01:22.380> lot

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
your gas motor you approach it a lot

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.319 
your gas motor you approach it a lot
faster<00:01:23.310> pace<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:26.490> that's<00:01:26.820> something<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.180> have

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
faster pace so that's something you have

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.260 
faster pace so that's something you have
to<00:01:27.390> get<00:01:27.540> used<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> doing<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:28.350> well<00:01:29.280> as<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
to get used to doing as well as a the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.690 
to get used to doing as well as a the
distance<00:01:30.479> by<00:01:31.140> approaching<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.369> noodle

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
distance by approaching the the noodle

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.219 
distance by approaching the the noodle
sometimes<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.240> may<00:01:33.360> think<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.719> pole<00:01:33.899> is<00:01:34.049> too

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
sometimes you may think the pole is too

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.350 
sometimes you may think the pole is too
short<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.799> well<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.759> gloma<00:01:36.180> that's

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
short as well as to gloma that's

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.270 
short as well as to gloma that's
basically<00:01:36.810> how<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.229> approach<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.979> noodle

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
basically how you approach the noodle

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.940 
basically how you approach the noodle
and<00:01:38.899> that's<00:01:39.899> something<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.289> you<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.740> used

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
and that's something that you get used

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.380 
and that's something that you get used
to<00:01:41.100> doing<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.789> then<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.039> know<00:01:44.039> the<00:01:44.939> distance

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
to doing and then you know the distance

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.300 
to doing and then you know the distance
to<00:01:45.450> approach<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.960> course<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.590> lot<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.859> times<00:01:47.130> you

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
to approach of course a lot of times you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.270 
to approach of course a lot of times you
have<00:01:47.430> no<00:01:47.670> choice<00:01:48.600> because<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.259> feesh<00:01:49.469> could

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
have no choice because the feesh could

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.219 
have no choice because the feesh could
be<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> pretty<00:01:50.700> strong<00:01:50.969> piece<00:01:51.359> you<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.020> take

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
be a pretty strong piece you can take

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.230 
be a pretty strong piece you can take
off<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.710> way<00:01:52.859> or<00:01:53.039> the<00:01:53.130> other<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.119> just

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
off one way or the other and you just

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.090 
off one way or the other and you just
may<00:01:54.539> have<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.840> take<00:01:54.990> up<00:01:55.170> make<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> couple<00:01:55.920> tries

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
may have to take up make a couple tries

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.999 
may have to take up make a couple tries
to<00:01:56.399> catch<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:57.439> but<00:01:58.439> basically<00:01:58.560> we're<00:01:58.979> just

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
to catch it but basically we're just

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.590 
to catch it but basically we're just
trying<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.429> catch<00:01:59.579> up<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.030> right<00:02:00.119> now<00:02:00.270> we're

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
trying to catch up to it right now we're

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.560 
trying to catch up to it right now we're
using<00:02:00.630> our<00:02:02.659> trolling<00:02:03.659> motor<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.850> up<00:02:06.090> pins<00:02:06.359> on

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
using our trolling motor and up pins on

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.120 
using our trolling motor and up pins on
how<00:02:06.719> strong<00:02:07.049> your<00:02:07.229> trolling<00:02:07.469> motor<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.950> how
