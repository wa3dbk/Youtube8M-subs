00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello together today I wanted completely 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.210
 like to wear a small park 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.290
 I also have a little fresh show 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.840
 a little bit on youtube 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.980
 looked at like other people who 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.510
 she wants to look at color feature films 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.460
 Of course, it's all very much 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.529
 chic and elaborate things here 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.720
 and yes , everything would be nice 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.519
 answer names like this one here 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.119
 I have no name for that is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.940
 at that time 40 years ago about by the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.630
 family were served 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.550
 fight from somewhere disappeared again 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.040
 if anyone knows the team then took 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.750
 I can know that there any 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.539
 Write that is really right 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.969
 easy and very few movement and 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.469
 just enough for little boy 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.059
 children a bit to impress the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.320
 find that really exciting so far 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.860
 now I had to do that too 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.989
 learn 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.460
 That's how I learned that, and so did I. 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.840
 I'm left-handed but I'll do it right away 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.890
 again with right before 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.130
 but first of all with left it starts 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.409
 ask vaster here about the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.049
 hand is placed at the root so over it 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.790
 and the other hand almost back process 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.710
 were the end 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.770
 because you can finger the right hand 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.720
 finally in spit countries is after 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.610
 brought in front 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:36.659
 I run then the left hand is 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.290
 if turn in keeps and 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.310
 wrap that around your thumb 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.869
 ie that rides the end of the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.750
 forefinger is located above 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.299
 that's what they thought and plans come from 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.479
 below and is still one today 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.560
 theatrical rotation is about the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.560
 little finger to hang 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:02.420
 that's the one under van der ven in small 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.420
 maybe another turn 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:18.470
 and we recognize that and we show it there 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:22.730
 purely maintained so far in that 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:27.200
 This place came here once more relaxed 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:33.290
 goal yes, everything depends on the hand 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:35.720
 lamp accurately covered and then with 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.130
 the thumb taken out that here in 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.840
 the middle of the right loops 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.459
 in principle , that movement is the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.519
 that dissolves corruption or that one must 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.720
 Do not tell the youthful audience 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:52.670
 so it looks in any case first as 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.120
 impressive one can say audience 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:01.310
 ask here to take this case 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:04.120
 to go behind it and pull anti and 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.120
 then that should happen 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:17.709
 actually it all was that again 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:19.750
 try with right then so always ran 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.860
 roots obviously the hand is laid 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.890
 like a kite festival, the same 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.580
 Freedom with you the bend after 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.739
 can lay forward 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.770
 a turn of the hand that one is in 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:39.880
 then lie around the cathedral and find out about it 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:43.540
 index finger is also about one more 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:47.260
 turn it around the small one 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.790
 the examiner can thumb his finger on his thumb 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:58.300
 should have lain down here 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:04:04.150
 These questions are still a turn and 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:10.780
 all over the index finger away now 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:15.299
 Here you can have a nice theatral and so on 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:20.290
 Do everything as firm knots in the 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:22.380
 play-off and then put both loops 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.979
 so backwards 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:30.729
 if you are here in this case now 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:33.720
 first one was great, of course one leaves 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.720
 everything back up 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.730
 the other way, have fun with it
