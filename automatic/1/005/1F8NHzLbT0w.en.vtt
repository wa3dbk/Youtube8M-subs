00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
quads so I don't get injured while I'm

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.080 
quads so I don't get injured while I'm
running<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:30.280> can't<00:01:30.520> forget<00:01:30.729> about<00:01:30.789> those

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
running and you can't forget about those

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.200 
running and you can't forget about those
lunges<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:32.979> must<00:01:33.399> for<00:01:33.640> me<00:01:33.700> when<00:01:33.969> I'm<00:01:34.060> running

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
lunges so a must for me when I'm running

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.870 
lunges so a must for me when I'm running
is<00:01:34.539> to<00:01:34.570> listen<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.109> music<00:01:35.229> so<00:01:35.649> I<00:01:35.679> just<00:01:36.039> use<00:01:36.670> my

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
is to listen to music so I just use my

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.300 
is to listen to music so I just use my
Spotify<00:01:37.270> Premium<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:38.109> put<00:01:38.590> my<00:01:38.679> earbuds<00:01:39.100> in

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
Spotify Premium and put my earbuds in

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.080 
Spotify Premium and put my earbuds in
and<00:01:39.549> then<00:01:40.270> I'm<00:01:40.420> off

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.459 

so<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.240> distance<00:01:46.630> I<00:01:46.780> do<00:01:46.840> really<00:01:47.289> actually

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
so the distance I do really actually

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.499 
so the distance I do really actually
depends<00:01:48.009> on<00:01:48.100> how<00:01:48.219> I<00:01:48.249> feel<00:01:48.340> that<00:01:48.729> day<00:01:48.789> but<00:01:49.179> I

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
depends on how I feel that day but I

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.599 
depends on how I feel that day but I
usually<00:01:49.659> do<00:01:49.899> around<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.469> mile<00:01:50.859> or<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.340> little

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
usually do around a mile or a little

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:54.179 
usually do around a mile or a little
more<00:01:51.640> than<00:01:51.789> that<00:01:52.119> and<00:01:52.799> make<00:01:53.799> sure<00:01:53.829> when<00:01:54.100> you

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
more than that and make sure when you

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.459 
more than that and make sure when you
guys<00:01:54.399> work<00:01:54.819> out<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.270> drink<00:01:55.479> a<00:01:55.600> lot<00:01:55.749> of<00:01:55.929> water<00:01:56.109> so

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
guys work out to drink a lot of water so

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.499 
guys work out to drink a lot of water so
you<00:01:56.590> don't<00:01:56.799> get<00:01:56.920> dehydrated<00:01:57.159> so<00:01:57.909> after<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.270> ran

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
you don't get dehydrated so after I ran

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.090 
you don't get dehydrated so after I ran
I<00:01:58.719> just<00:01:58.899> drank<00:01:59.200> some<00:01:59.530> water<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.649> then<00:02:02.829> right

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
I just drank some water so then right

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.249 
I just drank some water so then right
after<00:02:03.429> I<00:02:03.460> run<00:02:03.789> I<00:02:04.030> stretch<00:02:04.600> which<00:02:04.869> is<00:02:04.899> really

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
after I run I stretch which is really

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.599 
after I run I stretch which is really
important<00:02:05.770> because<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.219> don't<00:02:06.340> want<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.520> get

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
important because you don't want to get

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.639 
important because you don't want to get

doing are these leg lifts and these

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.229 
doing are these leg lifts and these
helped<00:04:06.350> a<00:04:06.500> lot<00:04:06.709> in<00:04:06.980> your<00:04:07.130> upper<00:04:07.489> thigh<00:04:07.760> in<00:04:08.090> your

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
helped a lot in your upper thigh in your

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.900 
helped a lot in your upper thigh in your
lower<00:04:08.390> butt<00:04:08.660> area<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.230> I'm<00:04:09.829> just<00:04:09.860> doing<00:04:10.280> 30<00:04:10.640> on

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
lower butt area and I'm just doing 30 on

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.789 
lower butt area and I'm just doing 30 on
each<00:04:11.150> side<00:04:11.660> and<00:04:12.049> yeah<00:04:14.140> so<00:04:15.140> just<00:04:15.380> put<00:04:15.560> your<00:04:15.680> leg

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
each side and yeah so just put your leg

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.500 
each side and yeah so just put your leg
under<00:04:15.980> your<00:04:16.280> stomach<00:04:16.789> and<00:04:16.970> then<00:04:17.090> up<00:04:17.269> in<00:04:17.419> the

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
under your stomach and then up in the

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.280 
under your stomach and then up in the
air<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:18.019> just<00:04:18.200> repeat<00:04:18.470> that<00:04:18.590> on<00:04:18.650> both<00:04:18.950> sides

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.780 

so<00:04:23.290> this<00:04:23.470> exercise<00:04:23.979> might<00:04:24.220> also<00:04:24.430> look<00:04:24.699> a

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
so this exercise might also look a

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.370 
so this exercise might also look a
little<00:04:24.940> awkward<00:04:25.120> but<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.570> really<00:04:25.810> helps<00:04:26.199> that

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
little awkward but it really helps that

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.040 
little awkward but it really helps that
