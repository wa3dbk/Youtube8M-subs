decide that my services could probably

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.050 
decide that my services could probably
be<00:02:26.690> used<00:02:26.900> elsewhere<00:02:27.670> thankfully<00:02:28.670> Lady<00:02:28.880> Anne

a<00:03:18.010> little<00:03:18.160> bit<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.580> can<00:03:18.670> see<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:19.000> score<00:03:19.330> has

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
a little bit you can see the score has

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.050 
a little bit you can see the score has
changed<00:03:20.170> both<00:03:20.350> teams<00:03:20.710> are<00:03:20.860> over<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.310> thousand

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
changed both teams are over a thousand

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.540 
changed both teams are over a thousand
which<00:03:22.570> means<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:23.020> both<00:03:23.230> teams<00:03:23.530> are<00:03:23.860> breaking

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
which means that both teams are breaking

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.340 
which means that both teams are breaking
the<00:03:24.850> enemy<00:03:25.270> team<00:03:25.540> preventing<00:03:26.170> them<00:03:26.320> from
