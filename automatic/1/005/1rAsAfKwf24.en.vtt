 at the routine on youtube was as well 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.820
 One asked but I 'm never there 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.590
 has come to turn off 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.330
 and if I did it once 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.059
 did not like the video and this 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.220
 and there is and blablabla but is common 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.750
 finally made it and in this video 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.449
 i'll show you what products i like 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.510
 So use all my nail torture 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.109
 with base nail polish and so on and so on 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.750
 on 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.779
 and yes this is then the result so 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.099
 I learned how turned up and 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.840
 will cut it now and 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.660
 then you will see that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.160
 I hope you like this video 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.379
 and if that's the case I would be very happy 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.050
 I know about a thumbs up friend 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.760
 that it was more profitable and you 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.890
 Become a products in the infobox yet 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.809
 For times so modest is their which 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.370
 I have used products if it is 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.230
 video was unclear 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.600
 and yes as I said I wish you much 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.949
 fun with the video and then hopefully 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.420
 Until next time 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.030
 first and foremost we need 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.539
 nail polish remover then I have here 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.949
 another elf from p 2 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.580
 Of course we still need to get close 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.390
 then a cuticle tailor pleases 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.390
 we need a mainstream then 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.850
 Of course, a base nail polish is allowed 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.970
 Of course not much then 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.220
 a coat and last but not least 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.650
 her the noble cotton pads around ours 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.230
 remove nail polish and that was it 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.420
 already 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.700
 First of all, we give 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.520
 nail polish remover 1 is waiting with the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.470
 remote connect our succeeded then 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.600
 Trendy remove is absurd 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.450
 of course, our nail is drying out 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.640
 and to prevent that 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:53.840
 creamy still my nails with a box 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:55.970
 one and the mailbox of pim 2 if 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.330
 I'm growing a goal that takes care of her 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.250
 I form a nail and then yes 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.250
 because I bring my nails to him 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.920
 and last but not least, I'm removing 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.780
 my cuticles with this 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.190
 lace dresses but be careful because 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.920
 you can cut very easily with it 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.570
 if everything fits I could mean mine 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.880
 nails but not only my lengths 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.370
 but my whole nail world because 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.380
 if your new bed is bedded yours 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.440
 Nail polish on it much longer and that 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.830
 I am now preparing for this sport 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.830
 I would say 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.800
 before we get to the next corner of p2 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.770
 I remove with a wad 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.640
 pettis excess wax the maelstrom 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.500
 Hadeler otherwise not be stored in our 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.870
 can penetrate because it is such a liquid 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.660
 part of that is in the nail so well 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.130
 Do not be surprised how come in 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.530
 recognize this a bit too 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.620
 It's still slightly damp because we said 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.280
 to get this product in our halls 1 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.280
 and stove 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.270
 When the product is fed use 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.920
 Of course I still have a base around 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.640
 our nail against discoloration too 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.460
 protect 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.770
 and I have the feeling that ours 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.770
 nail polish by a base longer lasts 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.970
 I lay down for a meal 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.370
 decided to wait for the cas 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.620
 not now for the season but me 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.810
 really love this sound very much and that 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.570
 order is really very pleasant 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.550
 So the sii blanket are expensive though 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.550
 I like it very much 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.450
 if one is well dried it still comes 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.930
 a Ãœberack over it and that is mine 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.400
 dearest overpaint of p2 genrefilm me 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.530
 know that this nail polish actually 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.319
 for the hedgehog is but receives easy 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.599
 bombproof and your money just longer 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.599
 by doing so and strengthening your fog additionally 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.610
 and here's a little tip from me 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.799
 I always thumb my thumb here as last 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.739
 if I miss something to eat in 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.169
 my thumb away because yes 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.669
 then you just have to make a brand new one 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:27.220
 and do not risk that you 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.220
 somehow the others still missed and 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.300
 the water with my routine i hope 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.560

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.570
