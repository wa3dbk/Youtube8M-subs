00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.150
 in parallel with the well known series of platform bars there is the 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.389
 series of adventure games 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.030
 it all started on super nintendo in 1996 with a super mario rpg that has 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.059
 marked his time by his exceptional graphics and his universe 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.169
 generous 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.730
 it is in 2001 that the series of firecrackers mario really begins it is 

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:22.859
 still an adventure game but this time all the characters 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.960
 appear in beauty with a workforce was irretrievably think of 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.429
 characters all in paper 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.270
 the success a leak of water at the day of 1400 gamecube but necessarily with its 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:36.960
 past mario definitely can not give up the platform and even though 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.010
 the day offering the big base of the adventure game means it does not say no 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.160
 plus what makes the charm of Marie 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.930
 wanting to stand out from the crowd the developers managed to create 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.740
 interactive fights with enough event we need to not 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.540
 do not get tired too quickly 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.270
 weird thing then an audience 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.610
 and the more you are gifted the more the public supports us and you practice bonuses 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.160
 important 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.770
 sometimes a channel where the time to throw a stone but you can also 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.540
 return the favor 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.320
 the evolution is done in decors neat but of which one reproaches 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.970
 always relaxing first goal for 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.840
 with the exception of one or two places it is the sad and dull colors that 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.270
 premium and it plumbs a bit 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.219
 fortunately the favored scenario the hard-nosed 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.169
 with particularly naughty villains and funny passages 

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:18.700
 like when the group designed the public loop or as originally planned by 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.010
 inadvertently the mantide contact of the inhabitants of the port the quality 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.470
 whether in combat or on the move the controls are simple 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.790
 very appreciable since they allow a quick version in the 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.450
 Thu 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.110
 the attacks still requires a bit of coordinating rivals but we can 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.860
 also by the offensives of the enemy the whole is very often a 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.270
 size issue 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.450
 for good sound we are at the same level as the graphics we left the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.310
 mushroom kingdom and although it feels good sometimes to see something else 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.300
 it's also more weird of varied products for december not always 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.300
 very much at heart 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.400
 in its entirety the game is very well done it hangs very quickly to 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.250
 the sacred union that closed state of fantasy as the power of 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.120
 turn into an airplane than that of doing all this to sneak into 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.310
 narrow places 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.220
 we just regret the lack of visual creativity in the big ones 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.639
 attacks his fight 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.819
 as often in this type of game riders will join you 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.529
 all have very useful qualities as blacks face has occurred 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.409
 when blowing on the sets to reveal secret passages 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.760
 we also appreciate the delicate classical principle and the variety of chapters 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.379
 they sometimes force room in the sun 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.379
 all in a good spirit is always a devastating humor 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.239
 you really have to play the game to participate the young system has made the 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:33.879
 good job 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.959
 we find bodies that are all the fighters of the super ski camp 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.299
 initiative powers against the variety of orders action it is 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.649
 difficult to do without 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.569
 after that it's obviously turn-based to all the parameters we have 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.260
 used to see that points of life the magic points of the goals 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
 and the ability to do combat 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:59.859
 this is one of the most annoying points with this game despite the 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.859
 real iron will of the various chapters that the developers have committed 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.619
 some mistakes like the pedestrian crossing that drags everything seems 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:06.810
 never want to stand 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.590
 or the episode with marion superstars wrestling that finds nothing 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.110
 more interesting to do than align components following the 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.640
 other it is also a lot of back and forth but it's a 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.449
 must-have with adventure games 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.879
 as soon as you arrive in the harbor that will serve as a crossroads between all 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.549
 members of the game we can feel uncomfortable in the introduction of the game mario 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.709
 is at home in a very pastel universe is very nice and so for 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.719
 the project into some sort of harmful waste 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:32.749
 it does not mean that it's ugly graphics are neat, she wrote. 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:35.759
 bodies are not often going to explore the sewers of the city visit 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.609
 places that are not very popular we finally benefit from very few 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.609
 beautiful scenery that unfortunately rarely offers Egypt 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.090
 well we were not going to expect miracles that a game 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.319
 Mario scene once again his princess he is kidnapped 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.259
 for the small end point kind of arrangement of the current part of 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:54.259
 road it will not stand anyone at the end on this ad 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.049
 the story will expand as the game progresses but the uefa during 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.449
 which would I tell you the princess have spent with others 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.560
 more when we see the presentation page 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.640
 we have almost the impression of the end of 2008 especially the similarities are 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.519
 striking 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.519
 but hey that's not it that will still play 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.799
 even if it comes off the beaten track it is difficult to sulk a 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:17.859
 mario adventure 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.329
 from the perspective of adventure, we are served 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.840
 the game is very complete all the odds proposed by the day 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.270
 we do not take too much head it is almost the possible provoked on a 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.629
 minimum common sense 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:31.779
 the powers of friends bring a lot to play since they allow to do 

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:34.700
 facing situations that promotes reflection and intelligence 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.099
 compared to the aptitudes usually asked against the pandore 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.179
 even if some passages are partners for the montpelliÃ©rains 

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:44.860
 that accompanies the quality of the first action fighting worthy of the name 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.030
 it is a problem 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.789
 he has a good game of forwards 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:48.669
 I advise
