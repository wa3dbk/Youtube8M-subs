 because opposition is one of the most important concepts in the texas 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.000
 young poker 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.610
 below the answers 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.309
 the oti read button marks the position 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.850
 the position indicates your game turn 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.500
 In texas hold'em poker the player who has more information has the advantage 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.579
 a player who acted last 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.420
 has the information that the movement has made all its 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.540
 rivals 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.700
 the different positions in a table of ten players are 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.050
 the initial blind positions 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.560
 middle positions 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.650
 final positions 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.110
 in this preflop phase diagram we see that the best placed player will be the 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.550
 that is in the big blind a check has position on the others 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.330
 players 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.060
 if someone says they have a position on us 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.920
 means that those on the left are sitting and will always play after 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.650
 we 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.950
 from the very thing the thing changes 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.570
 and the player who has the best position is the leader or the player at the 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.050
 right of this closest 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.880
 if it does not continue in the hand 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.880
 we see a practical example in phase price 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.740
 in this practical example we will see the importance of the position the game 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.360
 is in the pre float phase 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.530
 let's look at the good hand of player 3 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.980
 the first one that would speak would be player 3 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.200
 and he has no information about what his opponents are going to do 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.510
 how do you have a good hand raise the bet 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.610
 behind him players 4 and 5 throw the cards 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.550
 player 6 with a very strong hand summarizes the bet of player 3 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.550
 players 7 8 and 9 throw the cards 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.710
 player 10 with two aces sums up the bet again 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.290
 players one and two who are in the blinds throw the cards 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:15.909
 player 3 will have to throw his cards before so much action despite being 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.109
 good because he had no information about what his 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.459
 opposites has lost the chips he put when he made the raise 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:27.790
 as a starting position we should have a combination of strong cards 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.269
 so as not to risk that the rest of the tablemates do not climb 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:36.659
 let's see another example let's look at player 10 who has the same hand as 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.769
 I had before the player three pairs of tens 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.869
 player 3 up the ante with his big hand 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:44.850
 players 4 5 and 6 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.169
 does not pass the raise by throwing his cards 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:51.159
 player 7 sums up the bet of player three with his big hand 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.609
 player 8 and player 9 leave the hand 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.029
 the player '10' who now has position and therefore information 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:02:58.999
 about his rivals 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.909
 he has a good hand but to withdraw it because there has been a lot of action in front 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:04.950
 thanks to the position 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.950
 now he does not lose any card as he did in the previous example 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:12.319
 with the two examples we have seen that thanks to having our position 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.289
 loss of chips scene 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.889
 In this video we have shown you the importance of having possession in the 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:22.700
 texas commented kaka the different positions in a table are the blind 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.120
 initial positions 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.859
 middle positions final positions 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.949
 the player who has more information has the advantage 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:34.129
 the sooner your turn is stronger, your letters should be 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.419
 Having a position will not serve to earn more money and lose less money 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:43.449
