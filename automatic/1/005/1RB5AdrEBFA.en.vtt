in<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.689> still<00:01:46.229> image<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.570> goes<00:01:48.720> along

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
in a still image so as it goes along

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.740 
in a still image so as it goes along
it's<00:01:49.530> now<00:01:49.920> wow<00:01:50.399> that's<00:01:50.729> nice<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.299> still<00:01:51.509> image

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
it's now wow that's nice is still image

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.359 
it's now wow that's nice is still image
there<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.110> then<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.740> would<00:01:52.799> have<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.220> do<00:01:53.340> that

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
there and then I would have to do that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.600 
there and then I would have to do that
for<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:53.880> six<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.649> basically<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.159> would<00:01:56.369> see

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
for all six so basically you would see

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.539 
for all six so basically you would see
six<00:01:57.509> individual<00:01:58.170> pictures<00:01:58.530> as<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.100> timeline

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
six individual pictures as the timeline

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.120 
six individual pictures as the timeline
goes<00:01:59.960> along<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.409> fades<00:02:01.649> back<00:02:01.860> out

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
goes along and then it fades back out

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.670 
goes along and then it fades back out
now<00:02:02.369> wouldn't<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:03.110> greater<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.380> these

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
now wouldn't it be greater if these

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.779 
now wouldn't it be greater if these
pictures<00:02:05.399> they<00:02:05.759> themselves<00:02:06.090> also<00:02:07.160> moved<00:02:08.160> that

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
pictures they themselves also moved that

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.059 
pictures they themselves also moved that
would<00:02:08.940> be<00:02:09.060> cool<00:02:09.390> right<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:10.080> let's<00:02:10.289> try<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.560> so

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
would be cool right so let's try that so

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.280 
would be cool right so let's try that so
I'm<00:02:11.910> going<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> use<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.540> Jeff<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.110> is

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
I'm going to use the Jeff and this is

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.850 
I'm going to use the Jeff and this is
why

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
why

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.760 
why
you<00:02:13.950> can<00:02:14.130> use<00:02:14.310> gifs<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.760> Corral<00:02:15.210> so<00:02:16.080> let's<00:02:16.410> grab

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
you can use gifs in Corral so let's grab

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.810 
you can use gifs in Corral so let's grab
the<00:02:17.460> same<00:02:17.940> thing<00:02:19.190> alright<00:02:20.190> I'm<00:02:20.430> going<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.610> drag

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
the same thing alright I'm going to drag

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.710 
the same thing alright I'm going to drag
it<00:02:20.880> in<00:02:21.650> hold<00:02:22.650> down<00:02:22.800> my<00:02:22.830> ctrl<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.370> release<00:02:23.720> so

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
it in hold down my ctrl and release so

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.400 
it in hold down my ctrl and release so
now<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.960> have<00:02:25.380> actually<00:02:25.710> got<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.960> jiff<00:02:27.960> in<00:02:28.170> here

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
now I have actually got a jiff in here

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.820 
now I have actually got a jiff in here
so<00:02:28.590> it's<00:02:28.830> now<00:02:29.040> going<00:02:29.340> through<00:02:29.960> pictures<00:02:30.960> so

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
so it's now going through pictures so

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.130 
so it's now going through pictures so
it's<00:02:31.950> no<00:02:32.100> longer<00:02:32.130> just<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:33.090> still<00:02:33.690> image<00:02:33.840> is

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
it's no longer just a still image is

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.460 
it's no longer just a still image is
actually<00:02:34.550> still<00:02:35.550> images<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:36.000> quite<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.240> few<00:02:36.470> so

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
actually still images of quite a few so

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.710 
actually still images of quite a few so
as<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.740> see<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.160> definitely<00:02:38.820> going<00:02:39.600> on

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
as you can see it's definitely going on

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.510 
as you can see it's definitely going on
so<00:02:39.990> wouldn't<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.260> be<00:02:40.350> great<00:02:40.530> if<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.980> had<00:02:41.160> now

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
so wouldn't it be great if you had now

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.330 
so wouldn't it be great if you had now
six<00:02:41.940> doing<00:02:42.270> that<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.200> can<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:43.980> little

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
six doing that so you can have little

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.480 
six doing that so you can have little
photos<00:02:44.940> flashing<00:02:45.570> now<00:02:46.140> these<00:02:46.680> photos<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.310> just

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
photos flashing now these photos I just

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.560 
photos flashing now these photos I just
pulled<00:02:47.700> off<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.970> internet<00:02:48.090> there's

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
pulled off the internet there's

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.920 
pulled off the internet there's
something<00:02:48.840> about<00:02:49.020> camping<00:02:50.420> there<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.480> go<00:02:51.690> and

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
something about camping there you go and

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.440 
something about camping there you go and
that's<00:02:52.110> basically<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.580> how<00:02:53.730> do<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.910> do<00:02:54.000> this

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
that's basically it so how do I do this

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.170 
that's basically it so how do I do this
now<00:02:54.660> obviously<00:02:55.280> creating<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.340> jiff<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:56.910> not

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
now obviously creating a jiff is not

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.090 
now obviously creating a jiff is not
that<00:02:57.420> difficult<00:02:57.660> now<00:02:58.230> there<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.739> small

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
that difficult now there is a small

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.910 
that difficult now there is a small
little<00:02:59.580> trick<00:02:59.820> that<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.000> do<00:03:00.060> need<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.420> tell<00:03:00.600> you

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
little trick that I do need to tell you

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.740 
little trick that I do need to tell you
you<00:03:01.920> need<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.190> make<00:03:02.520> your<00:03:02.700> jiff<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.330> exact

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
you need to make your jiff the exact

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.060 
you need to make your jiff the exact
same<00:03:04.020> length<00:03:04.890> as<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:06.239> template<00:03:06.860> best<00:03:07.860> way<00:03:08.010> to

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
same length as the template best way to

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.400 
same length as the template best way to
find<00:03:08.340> out<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.730> what<00:03:09.090> your<00:03:09.239> template<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.750> just

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
find out is what your template is just

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.320 
find out is what your template is just
highlight<00:03:10.770> your<00:03:10.890> template<00:03:11.280> itself<00:03:11.640> move<00:03:12.150> your

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
highlight your template itself move your

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.050 
highlight your template itself move your
cursor<00:03:12.510> all<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.900> way<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.230> ends<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.620> just

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
cursor all the way to the ends and just

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.000 
cursor all the way to the ends and just
hold<00:03:15.060> down<00:03:15.239> your<00:03:15.270> mouse<00:03:15.570> key<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.470> then<00:03:16.920> it

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
hold down your mouse key and then it

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.789 
hold down your mouse key and then it
gives<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.340> time<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.910> says<00:03:18.230> five<00:03:19.230> seconds

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
gives you the time it says five seconds

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.630 
gives you the time it says five seconds
and<00:03:19.920> 20<00:03:20.280> frames<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:20.910> your<00:03:21.180> jiff<00:03:21.769> sequence<00:03:22.769> must

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
and 20 frames so your jiff sequence must

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.509 
and 20 frames so your jiff sequence must
be<00:03:23.910> at<00:03:24.120> least<00:03:24.360> 5<00:03:24.840> seconds<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.860> 20<00:03:26.130> seconds<00:03:26.489> a

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
be at least 5 seconds and 20 seconds a

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.729 
be at least 5 seconds and 20 seconds a
lot<00:03:26.670> 20<00:03:27.120> frames<00:03:27.330> long<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:28.350> you'd<00:03:28.500> be<00:03:28.590> better

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
lot 20 frames long so you'd be better

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.990 
lot 20 frames long so you'd be better
off<00:03:28.830> just<00:03:29.100> making<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.519> 6<00:03:30.110> second<00:03:31.610> sequence<00:03:32.610> so

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
off just making a 6 second sequence so

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.550 
off just making a 6 second sequence so
if<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.239> go<00:03:33.360> back<00:03:33.540> in<00:03:33.690> here<00:03:33.870> you'll<00:03:34.049> see<00:03:34.290> that<00:03:34.500> I

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
if I go back in here you'll see that I

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.520 
if I go back in here you'll see that I
have<00:03:34.799> created<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:36.060> frames<00:03:36.600> 1<00:03:36.989> seconds

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
have created the frames 1 seconds

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.440 
have created the frames 1 seconds
duration<00:03:38.310> each<00:03:38.700> if<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.090> press<00:03:39.330> play<00:03:41.180> you'll<00:03:42.180> see

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
duration each if I press play you'll see

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.920 
duration each if I press play you'll see
it'll<00:03:42.630> cycle<00:03:42.840> through<00:03:43.440> per<00:03:43.709> seconds<00:03:44.720> ok<00:03:45.720> and

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
it'll cycle through per seconds ok and

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.180 
it'll cycle through per seconds ok and
then<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.140> just<00:03:46.260> goes<00:03:46.440> back<00:03:46.709> now<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:46.950> don't

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
then it just goes back now you don't

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.090 
then it just goes back now you don't
need<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.700> have<00:03:47.880> your<00:03:48.030> jiff<00:03:48.650> repeating<00:03:49.650> because

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
need to have your jiff repeating because

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.130 
need to have your jiff repeating because
if<00:03:50.400> you're<00:03:50.640> using<00:03:50.820> it<00:03:51.000> in<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.180> timeline<00:03:51.630> as<00:03:51.900> in

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
if you're using it in a timeline as in

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.440 
if you're using it in a timeline as in
corral<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:53.280> will<00:03:53.430> only<00:03:53.489> go<00:03:53.730> through<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.180> once

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
corral it will only go through it once

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.289 
corral it will only go through it once
anyway<00:03:55.140> it's<00:03:55.470> not<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.250> video<00:03:56.970> is<00:03:57.150> going

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
anyway it's not that the video is going

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.030 
anyway it's not that the video is going
to<00:03:57.360> repeat<00:03:57.690> itself<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.200> there's<00:03:58.350> no<00:03:58.440> point<00:03:58.709> but

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
to repeat itself so there's no point but

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.350 
to repeat itself so there's no point but
whether<00:03:59.580> you<00:03:59.730> save<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.209> as<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.920> recurring

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
whether you save it as a recurring

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.970 
whether you save it as a recurring
sequence<00:04:03.360> or<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.690> one-time<00:04:04.140> sequence<00:04:04.769> it's

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
sequence or a one-time sequence it's

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.710 
sequence or a one-time sequence it's
irrelevant<00:04:05.489> because<00:04:05.610> Corral<00:04:06.269> would<00:04:06.480> just

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720

how<00:04:33.570> you<00:04:33.780> can<00:04:34.260> incorporate<00:04:35.480> jiff

how you can incorporate jiff
animation<00:04:38.180> we<00:04:40.160> rather<00:04:41.160> lad<00:04:41.400> wisdom<00:04:42.020> and

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
animation we rather lad wisdom and

animation we rather lad wisdom and
that's<00:04:43.140> how<00:04:43.260> you<00:04:43.320> can<00:04:43.500> do<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.740> so<00:04:44.340> it's<00:04:44.460> very

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
that's how you can do it so it's very

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.700 
that's how you can do it so it's very
simple<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:45.120> as<00:04:45.840> always<00:04:46.550> thanks<00:04:47.550> for<00:04:47.610> watching
