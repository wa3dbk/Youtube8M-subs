like we got a roof ready to go we do
we've<00:00:15.809> got<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:16.109> mock-up<00:00:16.379> here<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.130> that's

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
we've got a mock-up here that that's

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.210 
we've got a mock-up here that that's
been<00:00:18.119> all<00:00:18.210> put<00:00:18.420> together<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.900> as<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.830> can<00:00:19.980> see

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
trim that's been prepared for this

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.539 
trim that's been prepared for this
particular<00:03:11.400> section<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:12.000> can<00:03:12.690> see<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:14.370> it's

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
particular section you can see that it's

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.539 
particular section you can see that it's
been<00:03:14.700> bent<00:03:14.910> around<00:03:15.209> on<00:03:15.360> each<00:03:15.510> corner<00:03:16.430> now<00:03:17.430> I'm

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
been bent around on each corner now I'm

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:18.910 
been bent around on each corner now I'm
going<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.790> fasten<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.420> roof<00:03:18.660> deck

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
going to fasten it to the roof deck

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.880 
going to fasten it to the roof deck
using<00:03:19.920> pancake<00:03:20.489> head<00:03:20.670> fasteners<00:03:21.739> you<00:03:22.739> could

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
using pancake head fasteners you could

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.310 
using pancake head fasteners you could
also<00:03:23.010> use<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.280> roofing<00:03:23.700> nail<00:03:24.079> my<00:03:25.079> only

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
also use a roofing nail my only

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.680 
also use a roofing nail my only
suggestion<00:03:25.739> is<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.280> when<00:03:27.060> you're<00:03:27.180> fastening

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
suggestion is that when you're fastening

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.270 
suggestion is that when you're fastening
a<00:03:27.750> trim<00:03:27.989> like<00:03:28.170> this<00:03:28.410> if<00:03:28.709> you're<00:03:28.920> using<00:03:28.950> a

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
a trim like this if you're using a

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.860 
a trim like this if you're using a
roofing<00:03:29.609> nail<00:03:29.640> it's<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.090> lot<00:03:30.269> harder<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.690> take

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
roofing nail it's a lot harder to take

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.900 
roofing nail it's a lot harder to take
up<00:03:31.109> if<00:03:31.290> you've<00:03:31.739> made<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.950> mistake<00:03:32.100> this<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:32.880> a

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
up if you've made a mistake this is a

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.910 
up if you've made a mistake this is a
pancake<00:03:33.180> fastener<00:03:33.780> call<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.560> pancake

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
pancake fastener call the pancake

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.849 
pancake fastener call the pancake
fastener<00:03:35.340> because<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.730> its<00:03:35.880> flat<00:03:36.150> head<00:03:36.859> so

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
fastener because of its flat head so
