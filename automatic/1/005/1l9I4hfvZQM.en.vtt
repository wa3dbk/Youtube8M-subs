00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.930 
better personally I'm a fan of this one
I<00:05:40.960> like<00:05:41.259> it<00:05:41.469> I<00:05:41.560> think<00:05:41.620> it<00:05:41.830> looks<00:05:41.979> good<00:05:42.190> it's

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
I like it I think it looks good it's

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.300 
I like it I think it looks good it's
just<00:05:43.270> you<00:05:44.229> know<00:05:44.319> it's<00:05:44.560> I<00:05:44.860> think<00:05:45.039> it's<00:05:45.129> pretty

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
just you know it's I think it's pretty

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.589 
just you know it's I think it's pretty
cool<00:05:45.490> it<00:05:45.639> just<00:05:45.729> looks<00:05:45.940> kind<00:05:46.120> of<00:05:46.180> weird<00:05:46.389> with

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
cool it just looks kind of weird with

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.959 
cool it just looks kind of weird with
the<00:05:46.810> front<00:05:47.650> of<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.949> K<00:05:48.159> and<00:05:48.490> but<00:05:48.580> I<00:05:48.610> think<00:05:48.849> it's

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:48.969 
the front of the K and but I think it's

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:51.830 
the front of the K and but I think it's
because<00:05:49.270> our<00:05:49.479> logo<00:05:50.199> is<00:05:50.229> actually<00:05:50.620> slanted<00:05:51.520> and

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
because our logo is actually slanted and

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.209 
because our logo is actually slanted and
with<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:52.990> actual<00:05:54.150> for<00:05:55.150> an<00:05:55.210> intro<00:05:55.599> it's<00:05:55.780> it's

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
with the actual for an intro it's it's

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:59.309 
with the actual for an intro it's it's
right<00:05:57.219> you're<00:05:57.520> looking<00:05:57.789> at<00:05:57.909> it<00:05:58.030> and<00:05:58.840> birds<00:05:59.110> out
