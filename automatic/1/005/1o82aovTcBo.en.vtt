model for mass destruction as you know
God<00:00:15.540> has<00:00:15.570> been<00:00:15.929> building<00:00:16.289> statues<00:00:16.830> in<00:00:17.010> every

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
God has been building statues in every

town but what you didn't know is that

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.080 
town but what you didn't know is that
those<00:00:19.289> statues<00:00:19.859> are<00:00:20.039> centers<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.490> mind

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
those statues are centers of mind

those statues are centers of mind
control<00:00:24.769> I'm<00:00:25.769> not<00:00:26.130> really<00:00:26.340> sure<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:26.970> I'll

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
control I'm not really sure but I'll

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.279 
control I'm not really sure but I'll
take<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> stab<00:00:27.810> at<00:00:28.080> it

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
by the looks of this model he could be

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.250 
by the looks of this model he could be

let's<00:01:27.570> get<00:01:27.810> cracking

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.100 

when<00:01:39.820> I<00:01:39.850> was<00:01:40.240> King<00:01:40.540> we<00:01:40.659> used<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:40.960> have

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
when I was King we used to have

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.990 
when I was King we used to have
wonderful<00:01:41.530> security<00:01:42.250> robots<00:01:42.670> who<00:01:42.820> could

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
wonderful security robots who could

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.810 
wonderful security robots who could
vaporize<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:43.750> with<00:01:43.900> a<00:01:43.930> single<00:01:44.409> black<00:01:50.820> they've

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
vaporize you with a single black they've

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.810 
vaporize you with a single black they've
spotted<00:01:52.210> us<00:01:52.619> quick<00:01:53.619> through<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:54.100> door

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.640 

look<00:01:57.390> out<00:01:57.540> missile<00:01:58.020> mail

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
look out missile mail

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:15.140 
look out missile mail
go<00:02:00.430> let's<00:02:00.820> take<00:02:01.060> care<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.450> these<00:02:01.600> torpedoes

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.720 

all<00:02:16.150> right<00:02:16.450> now<00:02:16.930> serving<00:02:17.260> cavalry<00:02:18.190> no<00:02:18.250> forget

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
all right now serving cavalry no forget

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:35.260 
all right now serving cavalry no forget
about<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:19.150> crap<00:02:19.450> wait

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.380 

so<00:02:36.050> anyway<00:02:36.770> King<00:02:37.100> words<00:02:37.520> that's<00:02:37.760> pretty<00:02:38.210> much

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
so anyway King words that's pretty much

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.980 
so anyway King words that's pretty much
it

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
it

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.160 
it
grill<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.040> bat

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.020 

so<00:02:46.170> now<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.710> grills<00:02:47.010> out<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.370> commission<00:02:47.880> I

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
so now that grills out of commission I

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.880 
so now that grills out of commission I
suppose<00:02:48.390> you'll<00:02:48.600> want<00:02:48.660> me<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.440> take<00:02:49.650> care<00:02:49.830> of

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
suppose you'll want me to take care of

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.550 
suppose you'll want me to take care of
chase<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.610> rebels
