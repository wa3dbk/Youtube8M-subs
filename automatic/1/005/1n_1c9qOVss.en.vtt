00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.640
 and then draw in the four best 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.490
 in case they do not reach 20 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.980

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.990

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.329
 twenty thousand if you reach five thousand likes 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.730

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.520
 we must forward for now we have a 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.760
 player in each position we will see if the 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.760
 goalie 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.880

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.289
 egg to fill let's go there let's see 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.289
 what brings us the water 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.130
 this is the team that we have played 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.280
 Now all that's left is to put it together, good gentlemen 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.990
 we already have the equipment assembled and the truth 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.700
 is that well, we do not have the only thing 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.600
 that we have is the left side thing 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.479
 that is not bad 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.860
 we have front moussa that the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.660
 truth is that speed will not come 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.079
 wrong after half 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.079
 I also see nothing wrong team 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:29.010
 83 very well and it's very good we do not have 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.269
 yellow and I also love how 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.819
 defense is great 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.410
 He did not do anything wrong and 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.790
 when Jesus is also a great 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.790
 defense so 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.849
 but I have put a defense of those who 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.129
 let's say there was more rhythm that is the 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.810
 sir, and let's go, let's go 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.110
