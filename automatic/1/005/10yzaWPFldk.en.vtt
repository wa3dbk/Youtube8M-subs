deep ok notice there's like three inches
of<00:00:28.680> water<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.519> gravel<00:00:30.029> there<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.660> they're

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
of water of gravel there so they're

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.190 
of water of gravel there so they're
there<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.439> nice<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.710> deep<00:00:32.270> vallisneria<00:00:33.270> it's

bending<00:00:56.160> over<00:00:56.460> because<00:00:56.760> when<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.320> fill<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
bending over because when I fill the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.110 
bending over because when I fill the
tack<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.829> they'll<00:00:59.070> straighten<00:00:59.399> themselves<00:00:59.670> up

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
tack up they'll straighten themselves up

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.540 
tack up they'll straighten themselves up
what<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.690> am<00:01:00.930> worried<00:01:01.379> about<00:01:01.590> though<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.859> not

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
that is there's going to be a heater and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.059 
that is there's going to be a heater and
a<00:02:06.450> filter<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.780> come<00:02:07.049> yet<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.799> we<00:02:07.890> don't<00:02:07.920> want

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
a filter to come yet and we don't want

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.029 
a filter to come yet and we don't want
to<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:08.369> bomb<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.849> stuff<00:02:09.539> right<00:02:09.840> away<00:02:10.039> so

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
to just bomb this stuff right away so

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.360 
to just bomb this stuff right away so
we'll<00:02:11.250> put<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:14.489> Platts<00:02:15.890> where<00:02:16.890> they<00:02:17.040> get<00:02:17.190> a

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
we'll put the Platts where they get a

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.850 
we'll put the Platts where they get a
fair<00:02:17.670> bit<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.849> light<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:19.580> they'll<00:02:20.580> grow<00:02:21.860> there

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
fair bit of light and they'll grow there

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.720 
fair bit of light and they'll grow there
we<00:02:22.980> go<00:02:23.239> one<00:02:24.239> last<00:02:24.480> one<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:25.110> think<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.310> one<00:02:26.519> we

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
we go one last one I think this one we

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.559 
we go one last one I think this one we
will<00:02:26.880> put

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.020

and back here

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.990 
and back here
and<00:02:34.360> there<00:02:34.720> we<00:02:34.840> go<00:02:34.870> we've<00:02:35.380> added<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:36.000> first
