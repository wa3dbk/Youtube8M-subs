it<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.780> far<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.589> think<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.670> definitely<00:01:05.850> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
it so far I think it's it's definitely a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.440 
it so far I think it's it's definitely a
great<00:01:06.810> product<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.440> have<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.970> that<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.240> will

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
great product to have in that it will

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.160 
great product to have in that it will
charge<00:01:09.900> devices<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.659> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:12.990> you

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
charge devices for you and then you

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.580 
charge devices for you and then you
could<00:01:13.320> recharge<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:15.049> several<00:01:16.049> different<00:01:16.470> ways

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
could recharge it several different ways

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.130 
could recharge it several different ways
one<00:01:17.190> way<00:01:17.450> being<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> goal<00:01:19.200> 0<00:01:21.140> solar

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
one way being with the goal 0 solar

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
one way being with the goal 0 solar
panel<00:01:23.869> that<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.229> also<00:01:25.740> did<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> video<00:01:26.670> on

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
panel that I have also did a video on

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.500 
panel that I have also did a video on
recently<00:01:27.860> this<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.310> unit's<00:01:32.030> power<00:01:33.030> source

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
recently this is the unit's power source

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.670 
recently this is the unit's power source
here<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.619> on/off<00:01:35.130> button<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:37.200> green<00:01:37.469> light

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
here the on/off button the green light

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.340 
here the on/off button the green light
shows<00:01:38.039> that<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.490> unit<00:01:39.390> has<00:01:39.570> power<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.320> is

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
shows that the unit has power it is

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.630 
shows that the unit has power it is
charged<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:42.079> then<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.380> next<00:01:44.070> one<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
charged and then the next one is the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.260 
charged and then the next one is the
flashlight<00:01:45.289> which<00:01:46.289> I<00:01:46.729> think<00:01:47.729> goes<00:01:47.909> for<00:01:48.179> about

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
flashlight which I think goes for about

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.380 
flashlight which I think goes for about
a<00:01:48.359> hundred<00:01:48.570> hours<00:01:49.109> on<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> battery<00:01:49.890> pack<00:01:50.390> you

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
a hundred hours on the battery pack you

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.090 
a hundred hours on the battery pack you
have<00:01:51.539> a<00:01:51.570> mini<00:01:51.929> USB<00:01:52.969> here<00:01:54.289> you<00:01:55.289> have<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.469> larger

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
have a mini USB here you have a larger

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.609 
have a mini USB here you have a larger
USB<00:01:57.030> here<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.890> then<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.039> have<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.369> solar

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
USB here and then you have the solar

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.649 
USB here and then you have the solar
input<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:02.340> plug<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> solar<00:02:03.179> panel

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
input to plug it to the solar panel

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.190 
input to plug it to the solar panel
which<00:02:03.869> I'll<00:02:04.049> show<00:02:04.289> you<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:05.280> comes<00:02:05.490> with<00:02:05.759> four

underneath this little plastic door you
can<00:02:16.710> get<00:02:17.840> triple<00:02:18.840> A's<00:02:18.990> but<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.440> need<00:02:19.590> an

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
can get triple A's but you need an

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.610 
can get triple A's but you need an
adapter<00:02:20.030> for<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.090> triple<00:02:21.510> A's<00:02:21.660> but<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.470> will

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
adapter for the triple A's but it will

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.550 
adapter for the triple A's but it will
do<00:02:22.830> triple-a<00:02:23.400> batteries<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.380> again<00:02:25.380> these

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
do triple-a batteries and again these

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.440 
do triple-a batteries and again these
are<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.860> double-a<00:02:26.280> batteries<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.210> comes

your computer which I have a clip that
I'm<00:02:54.790> going<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:54.970> show<00:02:55.210> how<00:02:56.050> that's<00:02:56.290> done<00:02:56.590> you

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
I'm going to show how that's done you

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.830 
I'm going to show how that's done you
plug<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.130> into<00:02:57.250> your<00:02:57.370> computer<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:58.150> then<00:02:58.810> it

plug it into your computer and then it

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.990 
plug it into your computer and then it
charges<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.970> system<00:03:01.350> with<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.380> guide<00:03:02.650> 10<00:03:03.000> then

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
charges the system with a guide 10 then

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.280 
charges the system with a guide 10 then
you<00:03:04.530> can<00:03:06.750> use<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:09.190> solar<00:03:09.490> input<00:03:10.140> cable<00:03:11.140> that

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
you can use the solar input cable that

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.870 
you can use the solar input cable that
it<00:03:11.410> comes<00:03:11.650> with<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:13.710> I'll<00:03:14.710> just<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.700> the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
it comes with and I'll just and the
