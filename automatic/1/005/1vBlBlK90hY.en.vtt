00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
been may be hard to put it away is that

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.609 
been may be hard to put it away is that
a<00:05:58.879> sign<00:05:59.269> that<00:05:59.300> is<00:05:59.689> the<00:05:59.869> focus<00:06:00.050> slipping<00:06:00.559> a

00:06:00.609 --> 00:06:00.619 
a sign that is the focus slipping a

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:04.689 
a sign that is the focus slipping a
little<00:06:00.649> bit<00:06:00.949> yeah<00:06:01.309> I<00:06:01.339> think<00:06:01.699> so<00:06:03.399> why<00:06:04.399> can't

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
little bit yeah I think so why can't

little bit yeah I think so why can't
bring<00:06:05.449> that<00:06:05.569> intensity<00:06:05.989> open<00:06:06.459> because<00:06:07.459> we've

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699
