00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.469
 [Music] 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.480
 hello to all then after trying 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.520
 for a long time he follows everyone I think 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.119
 to finally be able to make you 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.830
 a review are fruit and about 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.090
 some products from the body shop 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.130
 some new products 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.810
 the body shop among all those I have 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.009
 proved that they are four 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.110
 what I liked most is that 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.790
 I am using this daily 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.970
 here this here that patient to a bronzer 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.250
 in the shade 02 world them but not me 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.510
 can access so much motion now and is a 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.340
 very clear bronzer however with jack is a 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.020
 warm color but also with veins 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.850
 rosÃ© in the middle 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.700
 I generally am spending it all 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.130
 the days above the blush and I like it 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.070
 a lot is really very very beautiful 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:05.079
 according to me there is so much because i am 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.500
 nine grams maturity at 18 months but on which 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.790
 very very nice 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.810
 every year they also have another one 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.320
 bronze thing here however is in the shade 01 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.530
 golden bronze this one for now for me 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.650
 it's a little too dark so I think 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.650
 that a little too dark for now 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.650
 so I think I can use it 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.450
 this summer for now it remains for me 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.320
 the color is too dark , however 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.119
 but for now too hot 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.800
 dark if you have a darker complexion 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.220
 of my 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.220
 this is for you 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.460
 then they sent me this eye shadow 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.240
 know here double a cooked eyeshadow this 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.369
 here the shade 03 Jan 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.840
 there are two grams at expiration also 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.340
 this here at 18 months 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.320
 of course the cooked eye shadows you know 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.660
 all very well that you can use 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.630
 both from dry ask for wet I do 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:13.209
 see this color dry here anymore 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.880
 clear this that darker color than 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.040
 it might seem almost black from here though 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.930
 in reality the patina over black is getting 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.780
 almost removing and then eventually 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.750
 a color always emerald slightly more 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.750
 dark and I must say that I like how it is 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.290
 they are good base they last without problems and 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.050
 so I have to clean my handcuffs 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.090
 here they are obviously they have reflections 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.260
 very beautiful from bathers are very much 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.260
 more intense 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.530
 nina kolaric and is using in these 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.210
 days I am staring with the pencil of 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.230
 alert from above precedent the eye shadow 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.540
 black and smoke 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:56.930
 it's called carbon black to designers a lot 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.520
 long on one side from the smudge always 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:07.580
 useful and on the other hand the mine is a carbon 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.740
 black so the problem of is very black 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.160
 these pencils like the same problem 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.599
 that I had encountered with 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.730
 [Music] 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.160
 always the body shop house is that 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.110
 second melamine is a little too hard 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.510
 this pencil will be excellent for 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.489
 this summer when it will be hot when 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.900
 all the other pencils were well is 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.150
 so soft they will be 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.500
 practically liquid this to which it will be 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.840
 perfect then for a collection 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.230
 summer I see this as perfect is one 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.220
 coll 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.010
 therefore it can also be applied 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.849
 inside the eye without problems 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.849
 it also fades easily 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.880
 here the only thing obviously must be fixed 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.730
 because if carinola fixed after a while like 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.069
 I find myself the press that has above 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.660
 in the summer it will be a good pencil will be 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.180
 certainly the pencil I will use of 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.319
 more precisely because of his aim but for 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.319
 now let's say that I prefer 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.130
 mine with pencils with a mine a little bit 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.130
 softer 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.969
 and that's not all if you have it 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.920
 any question that you want me to do 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:15.799
 as soon as I can just enter the internet 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.180
 I don't even see you next time 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.180
 he saw a kiss hello
