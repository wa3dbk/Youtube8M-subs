not much of a unboxing but don't really
pack<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.350> up<00:01:40.619> very<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:41.509> which<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.540> good

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
pack it up very well which is good

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.260 
pack it up very well which is good
because<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.770> don't<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.189> rustle<00:01:44.970> around

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
because you don't have to rustle around

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.319 
because you don't have to rustle around
with<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.570> styrofoam<00:01:45.990> crap<00:01:47.149> here's<00:01:48.149> some

and that looks like clamps for the
handlebars<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.149> a<00:02:00.149> charger<00:02:00.780> which<00:02:01.380> I'm<00:02:01.560> throw

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.660 
12 hours or so don't be running it
straight<00:02:32.830> out<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.100> box<00:02:33.310> with<00:02:33.550> that

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
straight out of the box with that

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.390 
straight out of the box with that
battery<00:02:34.090> because<00:02:34.300> you'll<00:02:34.480> end<00:02:34.660> up<00:02:35.400> ruining

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
battery because you'll end up ruining

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.910 
battery because you'll end up ruining
the<00:02:36.700> lifespan<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.210> your<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.900> your<00:02:37.960> battery<00:02:38.440> so

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
the lifespan of your of your battery so

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.520 
the lifespan of your of your battery so
definitely<00:02:39.280> plug<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:39.640> in<00:02:39.760> before<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.530> go

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
definitely plug it in before you go

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.340 
definitely plug it in before you go
ahead<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:41.950> ride<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.990> recommend<00:02:43.990> checking

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
ahead and ride and I recommend checking

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.310 
ahead and ride and I recommend checking
the<00:02:44.650> spokes<00:02:45.540> see<00:02:46.540> if<00:02:46.630> they're<00:02:46.810> nice<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:46.990> tight

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
the spokes see if they're nice and tight

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.260 
the spokes see if they're nice and tight
which<00:02:47.590> they<00:02:47.830> were<00:02:47.890> right<00:02:48.760> out<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.030> box

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
which they were right out of the box

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.670 
which they were right out of the box
with<00:02:49.570> this<00:02:49.750> one<00:02:50.820> usually<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:52.720> would<00:02:52.959> unch<00:02:53.500> I

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
with this one usually you would unch I

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.070 
with this one usually you would unch I
nice<00:02:53.860> things<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.280> would<00:02:54.930> definitely<00:02:55.930> want<00:02:56.020> to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
nice things you would definitely want to

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.630 
nice things you would definitely want to
check<00:02:56.260> those<00:02:56.500> because<00:02:56.890> they<00:02:57.040> come<00:02:57.250> loose<00:02:57.430> from

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
check those because they come loose from

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.540 
check those because they come loose from
the<00:02:57.760> factory<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.240> most<00:02:58.420> cases<00:02:59.400> check<00:03:00.400> the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
the factory in most cases check the

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.280 
the factory in most cases check the
play-in<00:03:00.850> your<00:03:01.330> brake<00:03:01.900> lever

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
play-in your brake lever

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.350 
play-in your brake lever
I'd<00:03:02.709> say<00:03:02.890> that's<00:03:03.100> good<00:03:03.280> good<00:03:03.970> amount<00:03:04.209> right

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
I'd say that's good good amount right

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.790 
I'd say that's good good amount right
there<00:03:04.540> make<00:03:04.750> sure<00:03:04.780> it's<00:03:04.900> not<00:03:05.110> dragging<00:03:05.440> or

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
there make sure it's not dragging or

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.430 
there make sure it's not dragging or
anything<00:03:07.290> but<00:03:08.290> just<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.800> -<00:03:09.930> when<00:03:10.930> I<00:03:10.959> first<00:03:11.290> got

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
anything but just it - when I first got

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.590 
anything but just it - when I first got
it<00:03:11.650> was<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:11.920> was<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.190> Berkley<00:03:12.970> was<00:03:13.150> pointing

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
it was it was a Berkley was pointing

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.090 
it was it was a Berkley was pointing
straight<00:03:13.810> down<00:03:13.930> he<00:03:14.290> definitely<00:03:14.680> wanted<00:03:14.860> just

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
straight down he definitely wanted just

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.060 
straight down he definitely wanted just
it<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.959> kind<00:03:17.709> of<00:03:17.769> an<00:03:18.070> angle<00:03:18.430> like<00:03:18.610> that

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
it so it's a kind of an angle like that

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.640 
it so it's a kind of an angle like that
make<00:03:21.070> sure<00:03:21.100> all<00:03:21.400> your<00:03:21.550> controls<00:03:22.000> work<00:03:22.650> pretty

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
make sure all your controls work pretty

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.340 
make sure all your controls work pretty
much<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.860> only<00:03:23.950> thing<00:03:24.070> you<00:03:24.280> had<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.459> do<00:03:25.239> in<00:03:25.540> the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
much the only thing you had to do in the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.009 
much the only thing you had to do in the
assembly<00:03:26.800> process<00:03:27.269> was<00:03:28.269> put<00:03:28.450> on<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.780> front

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
assembly process was put on the front

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.000 
assembly process was put on the front
fender<00:03:30.239> put<00:03:31.239> on<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.600> number<00:03:32.200> plate<00:03:32.440> here<00:03:32.860> and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
fender put on the number plate here and

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.220 
fender put on the number plate here and
the<00:03:33.760> handlebars<00:03:34.239> with<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.630> clamps<00:03:35.050> and

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
the handlebars with the clamps and

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.509 
the handlebars with the clamps and
that's<00:03:35.350> pretty<00:03:35.500> much<00:03:35.769> it's<00:03:36.040> pretty<00:03:36.220> much<00:03:36.459> just

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
that's pretty much it's pretty much just

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.120 
that's pretty much it's pretty much just
plug<00:03:36.880> in<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.269> go<00:03:37.500> but<00:03:38.500> I<00:03:38.530> definitely

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
plug in and go but I definitely

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.340 
plug in and go but I definitely
recommend<00:03:39.790> checking<00:03:39.970> those<00:03:40.780> spokes<00:03:41.170> out

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
recommend checking those spokes out

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.170 
recommend checking those spokes out
especially<00:03:41.739> if<00:03:42.160> your<00:03:42.310> kids<00:03:42.580> like<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:42.910> little

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
especially if your kids like a little

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
travis pastrana going off jumps and

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.479 
travis pastrana going off jumps and
whatnot<00:03:46.000> definitely<00:03:46.870> want<00:03:47.019> to<00:03:47.050> make<00:03:47.170> sure

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
whatnot definitely want to make sure

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.979 
whatnot definitely want to make sure
those<00:03:48.489> wheels<00:03:48.760> are<00:03:48.970> nice<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.360> tight<00:03:49.570> so

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
those wheels are nice and tight so

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.100 
those wheels are nice and tight so
they're<00:03:50.110> not<00:03:50.200> flying<00:03:50.560> all<00:03:50.769> over<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:51.010> place

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110
