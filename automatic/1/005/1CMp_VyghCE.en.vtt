00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello that as they are good there are many 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.910
 records that I will try to 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.589
 make them all already mission some 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.179
 members that will help me but good 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.040
 I do not want to make this video longer on 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.769
 video that you asked me most was 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.360
 how to make masks then orita 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.490
 I was editing and I was doing 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.859
 masks and I said well it's a good 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.779
 opportunity to explain the first 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.100
 what they are going to do is open their levels 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.510
 then they will import a video in the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.730
 who want to work and in which 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.070
 want to make these masks as they go 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.080
 to find your favorite scene then I 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.759
 to select this scene this is the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.290
 that I want to create a mask for 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.300
 I can put the background that I want 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.770
 I liked what we are going to do is 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.570
 open this little eyelash and here 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.040
 select this tool that is a 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.899
 palomita that we are going to do is that for the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.969
 outline of this image we will pass the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.170
 feather like that trying to do the most 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.170
 perfect that we can 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:06.080
 in this case that not on this bit 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:08.300
 we will select it also and 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.220
 we're just going to put a negative 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.590
 here we have as it has already cut a 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.990
 piece of the video then you will move it 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.120
 here as little as possible and you see that 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.220
 you did not change the image then you go to 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.500
 copy this with controls you're going to 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.320
 move and if the image stays the same 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.510
 static does not move copies this dot 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.270
 earlier more advanced follows the image 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.850
 static pÃ©rez you advance already moved the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.530
 image now let's re-cut it 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.660
 as who says all around me 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.610
 the truth is that if I did a little bit of 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.040
 trap do not cut this hair sentence 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.320
 because it was going to last longer and this already knew 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.229
 finish super fast but you if you have 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.229
 more time then do everything perfect like this 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.620
 let's erase this is no longer useful is the 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.420
 of the last dot and we will go back to 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.990
 do the same here in this space of 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:07.330
 hair we are going to put negative 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.820
 you grab this little dot again the feet 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.280
 in case the doubts advance the minimum that 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.800
 you can not move the image you stick it to 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.050
 you advance another already moved the image is 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.370
 erase in delete and so on 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.370
 let's do this 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.650
 good ready already after a great 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.750
 effort we have finished and what we are going 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.599
 to do to preserve that mask is 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.060
 open another new layer here we put the 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.129
 insert video we upload all this we are going to 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.560
 go to color medium generators 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.170
 solid and we're going to put this color 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.900
 green below good since we have 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.690
 put this green we will render it 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.239
 in super hd we go to the file of 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:10.239
 render as I like to do it 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.239
 in this format in mp4 internet 1080p 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.160
 with this mask I can use it here 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.960
 but I'm going to use the mask that render 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.400
 I did to teach them and they do not know how 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.500
 remove the green color from the background ok 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.390
 well I'm going to cut not where it starts 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.330
 the mask why it does not start from the 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.840
 beginning today we are going to go effects of 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.480
 video we are going to go to chromatic key and 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.590
 we are going to go to green screen 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.450
 and that's it and there he goes checking as more or 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.980
 less as it is going well and ready 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:51.030
 the background is already dependent on your creativity 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:53.010
 that you want to put it, I hope that I have 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.780
 served that has works and if you like 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.250
 I 'm going to give you this mask here in 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.480
 the description of the video you can 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.480
 download it to go
