00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
cut this longer than you need because

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.990 
cut this longer than you need because

brown once it's completely cooled you

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.690

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
can pick it up and just size it up

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.219 
can pick it up and just size it up
against<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.000> side<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.270> your<00:01:48.540> cake<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.200> don't

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
against the side of your cake you don't

top-heavy so I'm going to cut mine off
about<00:01:52.590> here<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.579> comes<00:01:53.759> down<00:01:53.970> quite<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
about here so that it comes down quite a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.420 
about here so that it comes down quite a
bit<00:01:54.810> shorter<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.380> cake<00:01:55.680> make<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.219> cut

three<00:02:02.610> inches<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.149> cookie<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.570> then<00:02:03.990> all

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
three inches of the cookie and then all

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.080 
three inches of the cookie and then all
the<00:02:04.590> way<00:02:04.680> over<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.040> back<00:02:05.189> we're<00:02:05.729> doing<00:02:06.000> this

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
the way over the back we're doing this

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.069 
the way over the back we're doing this
because<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.509> actually<00:02:06.719> gonna<00:02:06.810> make<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
because it's actually gonna make the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.540 
because it's actually gonna make the
cookie<00:02:07.320> watertight<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.190> not<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.489> to

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
cookie watertight and it's not going to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.309 
cookie watertight and it's not going to
absorb<00:02:08.819> moisture<00:02:09.000> from<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.509> cake<00:02:09.750> making<00:02:10.080> it

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
absorb moisture from the cake making it

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.640 
absorb moisture from the cake making it
soggy<00:02:10.679> now<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.400> want<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.790> use<00:02:11.940> your<00:02:12.060> edible

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
soggy now you want to use your edible

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.280 
soggy now you want to use your edible
and<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.159> just<00:02:13.489> marked<00:02:14.060> out<00:02:14.209> sort<00:02:14.659> of<00:02:14.750> even

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
and I just marked out sort of even

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.440 
and I just marked out sort of even
intervals<00:02:16.010> along<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.549> way<00:02:16.879> so<00:02:16.940> I've<00:02:17.239> got

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
intervals along the way so I've got

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.930 
intervals along the way so I've got
seven<00:02:17.900> colors<00:02:18.349> I<00:02:18.440> need<00:02:18.680> seven<00:02:19.040> lines<00:02:19.549> so<00:02:19.909> I

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
seven colors I need seven lines so I

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.430 
seven colors I need seven lines so I
want<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.209> make<00:02:20.360> sure<00:02:20.599> that<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:20.780> kind<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.230> keep

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
want to make sure that I kind of keep

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.649 
want to make sure that I kind of keep
each<00:02:21.590> color<00:02:21.950> about<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.430> same<00:02:22.670> width<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.390> apply

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
each color about the same width to apply

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.420 
each color about the same width to apply
my<00:02:23.810> standing<00:02:24.230> sugar<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.680> started<00:02:25.250> with<00:02:25.400> a

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
my standing sugar I started with a

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.369 
my standing sugar I started with a
paintbrush<00:02:25.909> and<00:02:26.180> just<00:02:26.510> painted<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:27.110> little

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
paintbrush and just painted a little

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.470 
paintbrush and just painted a little
section<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.010> then<00:02:28.190> place<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.000> sanding<00:02:29.450> sugar

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
section and then place the sanding sugar

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.780 
section and then place the sanding sugar
on<00:02:29.840> top<00:02:29.870> kind<00:02:30.319> of<00:02:30.500> sprinkled<00:02:31.069> it<00:02:31.159> but<00:02:31.610> this

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
on top kind of sprinkled it but this

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.130 
on top kind of sprinkled it but this
actually<00:02:32.060> proved<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.599> bit<00:02:32.720> problematic

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
actually proved a bit problematic

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.289 
actually proved a bit problematic
because<00:02:33.409> my<00:02:33.680> chocolate<00:02:34.129> was<00:02:34.280> drying<00:02:34.700> too<00:02:35.030> fast

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
because my chocolate was drying too fast

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.360 
because my chocolate was drying too fast
so<00:02:35.569> I<00:02:35.599> switched<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:36.260> ziploc<00:02:36.650> bag<00:02:36.920> method

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
so I switched to the ziploc bag method

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.800 
so I switched to the ziploc bag method
so<00:02:37.819> put<00:02:38.000> some<00:02:38.120> white<00:02:38.269> chocolate<00:02:38.450> in<00:02:38.720> the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
so put some white chocolate in the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.170 
so put some white chocolate in the
ziplock<00:02:39.110> bag<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:39.650> snip<00:02:39.799> off<00:02:40.069> a<00:02:40.190> very<00:02:40.459> fine<00:02:40.879> tip

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
ziplock bag and snip off a very fine tip

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.759 
ziplock bag and snip off a very fine tip
and<00:02:41.420> rather<00:02:41.870> than<00:02:42.079> paint<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.500> on<00:02:42.590> with<00:02:42.709> a

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
and rather than paint it on with a

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.610 
and rather than paint it on with a
paintbrush<00:02:43.159> squirt<00:02:44.090> on<00:02:44.390> some<00:02:44.810> of<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.140> white

amazing<00:04:57.270> but<00:04:57.390> does<00:04:57.630> require<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.140> bit<00:04:58.320> of<00:04:58.530> time

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
amazing but does require a bit of time

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.950 
amazing but does require a bit of time
in<00:04:58.950> skittle<00:04:59.490> placing<00:04:59.940> probably<00:05:00.300> about<00:05:00.510> 30<00:05:00.780> to

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960

40<00:05:01.290> minutes<00:05:01.380> all<00:05:01.680> up<00:05:01.860> I<00:05:01.950> think<00:05:02.010> it<00:05:02.310> took<00:05:02.460> me<00:05:02.520> so

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
40 minutes all up I think it took me so

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.730 
40 minutes all up I think it took me so
basically<00:05:03.540> I'm<00:05:03.720> just<00:05:03.780> following<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.440> line

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
basically I'm just following the line

KitKat<00:05:29.310> cake<00:05:29.550> it's<00:05:29.760> best<00:05:30.000> to<00:05:30.090> have<00:05:30.180> ribbon

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
KitKat cake it's best to have ribbon

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.360 
KitKat cake it's best to have ribbon
around<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:31.080> outside<00:05:31.500> which<00:05:31.740> covers<00:05:32.220> up<00:05:32.340> the

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
around the outside which covers up the

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.890 
around the outside which covers up the
line<00:05:32.760> that<00:05:33.090> you<00:05:33.150> get<00:05:33.330> in<00:05:33.420> the<00:05:33.510> middle<00:05:33.660> of<00:05:33.810> a

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
line that you get in the middle of a

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.780 
line that you get in the middle of a
KitKat<00:05:34.140> family<00:05:34.710> block<00:05:34.890> but<00:05:35.100> it<00:05:35.190> also<00:05:35.340> holds

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
KitKat family block but it also holds

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.730 
KitKat family block but it also holds
everything<00:05:36.030> together<00:05:36.240> so<00:05:36.510> I<00:05:36.750> opted<00:05:37.200> for<00:05:37.230> a<00:05:37.440> red

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
everything together so I opted for a red

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.710 
everything together so I opted for a red
ribbon<00:05:37.980> with<00:05:38.220> a<00:05:38.250> nice<00:05:38.490> big<00:05:38.760> red<00:05:39.000> bow<00:05:39.180> which

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
ribbon with a nice big red bow which

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.150 
ribbon with a nice big red bow which
matches<00:05:39.960> in<00:05:40.230> with<00:05:40.350> our<00:05:40.470> skittles<00:05:40.830> wrappers

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
matches in with our skittles wrappers

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.430 
matches in with our skittles wrappers
the<00:05:41.730> final<00:05:42.150> part<00:05:42.390> of<00:05:42.510> our<00:05:42.660> cake<00:05:42.930> and<00:05:43.110> I<00:05:43.200> think

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
the final part of our cake and I think

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.500 
the final part of our cake and I think
the<00:05:43.530> most<00:05:43.710> impressive<00:05:44.160> is<00:05:44.430> taking<00:05:44.880> one<00:05:45.360> of

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
the most impressive is taking one of

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.420 
the most impressive is taking one of
those<00:05:45.690> empty<00:05:45.960> skittles<00:05:46.560> wrappers<00:05:46.860> so<00:05:47.040> be<00:05:47.220> nice

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
those empty skittles wrappers so be nice

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.550 
those empty skittles wrappers so be nice
