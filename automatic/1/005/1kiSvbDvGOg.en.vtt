00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.640
 and now how are people who are 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.080
 invest the 1,059 with this new vial 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.700
 let's talk about comfort 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.740
 fast templar but I did not have it 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.660
 gone because if I do not I'm not 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.240
 stealing any technique vélez in signal and 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.550
 they did not give me restrictions then it's 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.789
 pretty simple what we 're going to do 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.410
 the basic idea that we are going to have is going to 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.220
 be that we're going to be our group of 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.199
 six people and before taking the shield 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.110
 let's use some boxes to 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.239
 block the entrances and for when it leaves 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.800
 our enemy of the Templar we are going to 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.750
 walk throwing grenades 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.210
 until it falls is basically the 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.310
 idea sounded very easy and it really is very 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.800
 easy 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.570
 and good already starting with this seriously 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.310
 The first thing we will need is that 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.870
 there is no asshole in the team 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.780
 because if there is one going to go and it's going to take 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.760
 the relic in second we're going to have to 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.950
 go by the sea ​​and are looking for these 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.690
 boxes do not know exact location 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.600
 I tell you this technique just 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.970
 teach last night then we have to 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.360
 place these boxes at the entrance of the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.790
 center as you can see the one here 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.220
 Then he went down the stairs 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.920
 to the right the two entrances the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.020
 we are going to have to block with the boxes 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.970
 as you can see here you have to be 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.479
 centered because if not this is not going to 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.479
 function 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.870
 since we have everything put so very 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.250
 simple someone is going to take the relic and 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.010
 the rest of us are going to stop there 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.310
 increasing pure of grenades you know they are 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.890
 solar grenades vortex grenades and 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.030
 I think that those of 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.190
 thunder the striker lighting lo nate 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.530
 it's called in English it's the third grenade 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.009
 You know this one that sticks on the floor 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.410
 and it leaves a series of waves of energy 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.810
 not be as they did in Spanish but good 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.120
 maybe that one gets to work remember 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.190
 do not shoot the harpies because if not 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.560
 can be attacking in the click 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.190
 that nobody mess with us because 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.320
 because the inputs side can come out 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.560
 the harpies on the left side more without 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.959
 However, they go up and do not touch us and that's 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.319
 is going to be winnowing grenades over and over 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.379
 and again until I can show it 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.599
 well, there is nothing left but to say 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.450
 thing they want me to raise because I 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.280
 I have no ideas to upload any 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.650
 what they want me to upload to you 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.780
 leave it to me in the comments 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.760
 I will do my best to make them a 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.230
 entertaining video with follow-up 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.670
 internal I have tweets because I do not have 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.859
 background um is when they have followers 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.819
 I'll have tweets and so on with 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:00.739
 this good is a simple technique very very 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.530
 good pleasure if you are the ones who 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.090
 complain about this exploits and everything 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.939
 the best they can do is make famous 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.219
 my life by making my video famous is going to 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.260
 make famous the technique of becoming 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.689
 famous the technique is going to be for girls and 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.560
 very simple if you load this you 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:20.959
