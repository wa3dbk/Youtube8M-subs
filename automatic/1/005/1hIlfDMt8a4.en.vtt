00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.720
 a mythical circuit of the most beautiful 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.429
 world championship it's still a myth 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.070
 is a monument so it's true that 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.169
 it's always nice to go to spa in 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.649
 the more we speak French 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.430
 so here we feel a little home 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.570
 it's not a simple circuit it's 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.489
 certain there is a lot a lot of 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.350
 technical parts quick parts 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.559
 others slower and you have to know 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.600
 adapt and find the right pace has 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.809
 again the weather is not often 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.809
 easy to predict and suddenly it does not make 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.580
 not the weekend easy huh virgin 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.710
 complicated the first pin of the 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.360
 source a stupid pin in slow motion 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.280
 but really with a big overhang at 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.570
 rope point a hole is actually for 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.049
 to find the exact line is enough 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.060
 complicated the liveliest goes after 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.189
 lying is the steep red water 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.780
 with this wall in which we arrive at 300 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.159
 km / hour really when we get in 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.299
 in the impression of being crushed in the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.970
 car and then when we get to the top 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.500
 it's a bit like a 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.800
 a roller coaster we have a heart role 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.360
 so it's rather funny my point 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.020
 strong at this step maybe it's going to be the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.790
 late braking especially at the turn 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.510
 number one the source after the line 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.830
 right of the combes 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.040
 and then to the chicane of the bus stop 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.580
 very good memories champion gp2 2011 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.100
 for sure it was a beautiful moment my 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:46.650
 secret at spa 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:48.000
 not leaving after after my secret he 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.920
 there are none there are not specially 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.369
 just have fun on this circuit 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.369
 is wonderful
