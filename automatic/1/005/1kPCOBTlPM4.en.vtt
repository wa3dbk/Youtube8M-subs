00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 then to this new video tutorial for the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.139
 kasparov foundation in this video we are going to 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.080
 learn a game that can be quite 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.960
 funny 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.640
 and that will allow us to learn the 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.640
 horse movement 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:25.989
 in this way for our players 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:29.349
 for our students are going to start 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:32.050
 practice with the horse jump and in 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.540
 What will this game consist of? 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.610
 in which we have two white horses and 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.070
 two black horses on a board 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.940
 three by three ie instead of having 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.920
 an 8- by- 8 board of 64 squares 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.920
 This consists of a board of 9 squares 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.610
 what will happen on this board 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.730
 you can see there is a box that does not 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.030
 let's use which box 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.989
 if we can not get out of here this box 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.380
 from here it can never be used by 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.170
 no horse because from none of 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.520
 these boxes we will be able to fall in 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.240
 this box yes 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.850
 Well, what is this game about? 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.369
 these two white horses are going to have 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.409
 to finish in these two boxes where 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.219
 there are the blacks and these two horses 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.850
 blacks where the whites are all 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:34.119
 making horse jumping plays and 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.950
 every time you move a side first move a 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.700
 white horse then a black horse 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.159
 black white until you get 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.869
 white hair finish where are the 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.740
 blacks and black hair where they are 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.560
 The whites 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.520
 let's start to see how we could 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.399
 get moving is white here then 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.869
 we move this black here is white here 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:02.630
 is black here yes and as you see we have 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.780
 here a horse that is placed in its 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.850
 site and a black horse that is 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.520
 placed on your site also now 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.070
 we have two horses well placed 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.810
 I would have to keep going until I got 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.810
 that the other horses are also in 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.610
 your site these horses although they are already 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.610
 placed can play again 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.240
 then the next move is this 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.240
 we move this horse here 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.420
 now this horse here and this for 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.260
 here 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.450
 we are moving the horses 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.780
 and we have removed the horses from the 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.150
 good boxes but we are doing 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.069
 a maneuver and this maneuver when 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.060
 we know it's quite simple to find out 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.770
 and now 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.770
 we are placing this horse here 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.470
 be here the white so that the black 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.240
 here 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:06.660
 and we get the change of the side of the 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.660
 horses 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.310
 I invite you to make this game in 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:17.300
 home and to practice to see how many 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.700
 plays 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.090
 have to do to achieve it here what 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.490
 we have done in 8 but the important thing is 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.600
 practice practicing jump practice 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.870
 of the horse to use this video 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.180
 so to use this game well to go 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.990
 understanding the movement of the horse 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.020
 see the mobility of this 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.630
 and in our classes in our games 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.780
 can serve us for 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.500
 see the moves of the 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:54.370
 horse I hope this game has been 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.920
 fun and useful for them 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:01.670
 practice the movement of the horse 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.160
 in this way he assured that his students 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.420
 they will learn to move freely 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.420
 horse up soon
