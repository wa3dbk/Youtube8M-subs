00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.960
 hours I cheered up favorite so in this 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:22.650
 blog I'll tell you the 20 most data 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.840
 curious about dragon ball on 3 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.449
 December 1984 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.820
 akira toriyama premiered for the first time 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.409
 the dragon ball sleeve for the 26th 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.089
 February 1986 many still were not born 

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:39.329
 they premiered the first chapter of this 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:42.510
 anime after 519 edited chapters 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.479
 4 television series and 34 animations 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.449
 among other movies and dragon extras 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:50.879
 ball remains and will forever be the 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.829
 anime and manga most representative of 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.510
 last three decades but from where it 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.359
 inspired akira to tell this story 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.789
 Good insurance dragon is not inspired by 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:03.270
 the pilgrimage novel to the west 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.250
 written in China by much 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.530
 as is the second name in a 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.020
 beginning dragon ball was called dragon 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.990
 ball 2 but the editor was wrong on 2 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.810
 al zy put him mushroom and it's because everyone 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.700
 we confuse the z with the 2 not obvious so 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.380
 who wants to decide to leave it like that 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.240
 principle does not want decided that the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.250
 main character could make woman 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.190
 however later he decided that outside 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.890
 man and I call him goku in the z language 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.590
 there are no countries or nationalities 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.840
 but yes geographical features 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.360
 climate as well as ethnicities and clothing 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.490
 regional at the beginning readers of the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.340
 manga complained a lot about the personality 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.200
 of goku that was a bit clueless something 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.360
 as well as a asshole after 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.340
 write many times to toriyama to 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.860
 tell him to change this feature 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.050
 he flatly refused in a rhythm 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.180
 toriyama never thought that his story was 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.369
 would become an icon of the manga of 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.200
 action and combat so he was inspired by 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.810
 the names of the characters in things 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.330
 very normal like for example beauty 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.369
 comes from vegetable kakaroto comes from 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.870
 carrot the names of the family of 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.090
 Burman comes from clothes 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.700
 piccolo interior comes from 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.740
 musical instruments and freezer 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.900
 inspired in the cold and how to forget about 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.510
 hindu troop that are inspired by 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.750
 dairy products the new animals of 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.390
 the androids 17 and 18 are pencil and the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.610
 suite the third room of toriyama is 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.950
 piccolo because he is proud and severe 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.840
 but also paternal and just 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.300
 vegueta difference that is the one 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.290
 least like when the person does not 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.600
 USA 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.060
 the character of mister little had to be 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.190
 digitally colored blue because 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.750
 they considered him to be racist simply 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.390
 because he was black and he was the slave of 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.670
 kamisama that's nothing racist as well as 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.040
 it works like the school in the chapter 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.050
 number 2 of the manga always spends 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.670
 saying that he is 14 years old but when 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.710
 he learns to count he realizes that in 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.560
 reality has 12 by the end of the 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.270
 manga is 47 years old adding the two 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.150
 years that was in the time capsule 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.870
 then he has 49 for when he finished 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.640
 dragon ball gt was 159 years old which 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.170
 says that it is possible that silver will lounge 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.950
 keep alive because then they have the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.170
 same age as goku 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.780
 the character of rum what is my 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.900
 favorite appeared for the first time as 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.690
 a strange traveler who came from the future 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.290

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.019
 love the pants fuck and vegueta se 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.930

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.610

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.950

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.750
