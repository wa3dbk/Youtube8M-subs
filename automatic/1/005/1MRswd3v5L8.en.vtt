it but that's not what their forts for

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.970 
it but that's not what their forts for
the<00:00:36.660> sharpness<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> tip<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.829> way<00:00:37.920> you

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
the sharpness of the tip so that way you

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.069 
the sharpness of the tip so that way you
could<00:00:38.190> throw<00:00:39.090> them<00:00:39.329> at<00:00:39.480> something<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:39.960> have

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
could throw them at something and have

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.240 
could throw them at something and have
them<00:00:40.230> stick<00:00:40.559> into<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.090> quality-wise<00:00:42.090> there

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
them stick into it quality-wise there

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.420 
them stick into it quality-wise there
then<00:00:44.250> Ice<00:00:44.399> Age<00:00:44.960> definitely<00:00:45.960> good<00:00:46.860> strong

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
then Ice Age definitely good strong

steel<00:00:48.590> it'll<00:00:49.590> where's<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:51.180> just

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
steel it'll where's the one here just

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.080 
steel it'll where's the one here just
hanging<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.160> against<00:00:53.460> crunk<00:00:53.699> root<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.059> can

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
hanging it against crunk root you can

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.970 
hanging it against crunk root you can
tell<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.629> taken<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.079> couple<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.500> let's<00:00:55.800> see<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
tell it's taken a couple I let's see it

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.790 
tell it's taken a couple I let's see it
and<00:00:56.100> get<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.250> focus<00:00:56.760> some<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.739> couple<00:00:58.739> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and get that focus some a couple of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.429 
and get that focus some a couple of
chunks<00:00:59.039> off<00:00:59.250> with<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> blade<00:00:59.640> there<00:01:02.149> right

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
chunks off with the blade there right

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.490 
chunks off with the blade there right
there<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:05.000> up<00:01:06.000> here<00:01:06.570> some<00:01:06.869> more<00:01:07.049> there<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.380> go

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
there and up here some more there you go

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
there and up here some more there you go
I<00:01:07.880> can<00:01:08.880> get<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.150> focus<00:01:09.330> come<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:14.360> okay<00:01:15.360> well

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
I can get it to focus come on okay well

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.530 
I can get it to focus come on okay well
whatever<00:01:16.100> they<00:01:17.100> will<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:18.240> are<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> little

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
whatever they will they are a little

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.350 
whatever they will they are a little
brittle<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.189> they<00:01:20.189> work<00:01:20.369> for<00:01:20.549> throwing<00:01:20.759> in

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
brittle but they work for throwing in

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.289 
brittle but they work for throwing in
plywood<00:01:21.689> cardboard<00:01:22.409> or<00:01:22.530> wherever<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.860> need

the<00:01:24.299> weight<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.750> actually<00:01:25.229> put<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> couple<00:01:26.159> of

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the weight is actually put a couple of

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
the weight is actually put a couple of
these<00:01:26.340> down<00:01:26.580> per<00:01:26.790> second<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.409> weight<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.829> is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
these down per second the weight it is

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.510 
these down per second the weight it is
weighted<00:01:29.340> pretty<00:01:30.590> pretty<00:01:31.590> well<00:01:31.799> balanced<00:01:32.340> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
weighted pretty pretty well balanced to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.469 
weighted pretty pretty well balanced to
just<00:01:32.909> right<00:01:33.180> there<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:35.490> weight<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.850> it's

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
just right there the weight of it it's

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.160 
just right there the weight of it it's
got<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.659> nice<00:01:36.900> lightweight<00:01:37.409> still<00:01:38.070> got<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> good

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
got a nice lightweight still got a good

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.719 
got a nice lightweight still got a good
good<00:01:40.170> way<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.290> throwing<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.549> got

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
good way for throwing it you got

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.100 
good way for throwing it you got
different<00:01:42.060> ways<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.329> throw<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.720> got<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
different ways to throw you got the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.350 
different ways to throw you got the
standard<00:01:43.920> rotation<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.880> got<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
standard rotation and then you got the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.359 
standard rotation and then you got the
no<00:01:46.170> spin<00:01:46.439> way<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:48.630> design<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:50.220> got

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
no spin way so the design of it it's got

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.780 
no spin way so the design of it it's got
a<00:01:50.399> pretty<00:01:52.189> what's<00:01:53.189> called<00:01:53.490> simple<00:01:55.399> drop<00:01:56.399> point

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
a pretty what's called simple drop point

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.039 
a pretty what's called simple drop point
blade<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.700> good<00:01:59.700> for<00:01:59.850> third<00:02:00.000> one<00:02:00.119> lightweight

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
