decks<00:05:44.820> that's<00:05:45.180> kind<00:05:45.419> of<00:05:45.480> my<00:05:45.660> thing<00:05:45.950> it's<00:05:46.950> just

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
decks that's kind of my thing it's just

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.190 
decks that's kind of my thing it's just
I<00:05:47.430> mean<00:05:47.730> the<00:05:48.210> handle<00:05:48.510> ability<00:05:48.840> and<00:05:48.930> these<00:05:49.050> are

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
I mean the handle ability and these are

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.900 
I mean the handle ability and these are
a<00:05:49.260> lot<00:05:49.380> better<00:05:49.500> than<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:50.100> 1800<00:05:50.550> stack<00:05:50.730> though

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
a lot better than the 1800 stack though

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.080 
a lot better than the 1800 stack though
I<00:05:51.390> told<00:05:52.050> you<00:05:52.140> not<00:05:52.320> doing<00:05:52.500> any<00:05:52.650> reviews<00:05:53.280> or<00:05:53.669> a

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
custom decks and that's a part of some

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.040 
custom decks and that's a part of some
of<00:05:56.880> the<00:05:56.970> same<00:05:57.090> time<00:05:57.240> to<00:05:57.360> get<00:05:57.480> across<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:57.870> board

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
of the same time to get across the board

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.310 
of the same time to get across the board
of<00:05:58.110> there<00:05:58.260> a<00:05:58.290> little<00:05:58.440> bit<00:05:58.790> not<00:05:59.960> they<00:06:00.960> handle<00:06:01.290> a

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
of there a little bit not they handle a

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.159 
of there a little bit not they handle a
lot<00:06:01.410> better<00:06:01.560> than<00:06:01.830> the<00:06:01.919> 1800s<00:06:02.460> stack<00:06:02.669> does<00:06:03.169> if

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
lot better than the 1800s stack does if

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.390 
lot better than the 1800s stack does if
you<00:06:04.290> want<00:06:04.470> to<00:06:04.590> feel<00:06:04.740> like<00:06:04.860> that<00:06:04.980> kind<00:06:05.160> of<00:06:05.190> style
