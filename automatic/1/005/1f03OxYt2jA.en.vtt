00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
to move in a certain direction or look

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.310 
to move in a certain direction or look
in<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.219> certain<00:00:47.399> direction<00:00:47.539> you<00:00:48.539> basically<00:00:48.960> you

in a certain direction you basically you

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.560

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
function it is it's not going to work so

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.850 
function it is it's not going to work so
well<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.180> those<00:01:54.570> type<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.810> games<00:01:54.960> now

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
well on that those type of games now

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.440 
well on that those type of games now
here's<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> gamepad<00:01:56.549> right<00:01:56.579> here<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.090> him<00:01:57.210> if

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
here's the gamepad right here in him if

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.940 
here's the gamepad right here in him if
you<00:01:57.630> were<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.899> look<00:01:57.930> carefully<00:01:58.380> if<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.890> were

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
you were to look carefully if you were

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.010 
you were to look carefully if you were
to<00:01:59.040> get<00:01:59.159> your<00:01:59.310> hands<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.610> one<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.820> these<00:02:00.020> you'll

to get your hands on one of these you'll

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.889 
to get your hands on one of these you'll
notice<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.409> actually<00:02:01.740> covers<00:02:01.979> every<00:02:02.549> button

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
notice it actually covers every button

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.910 
notice it actually covers every button
for<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.930> consoles<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.469> it's<00:02:04.649> compatible

for the consoles that it's compatible

for the consoles that it's compatible
with<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:06.000> also<00:02:06.240> has<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.719> level<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.439> resistance

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
with it also has a level of resistance

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.949 
with it also has a level of resistance
up<00:02:08.190> or<00:02:08.369> down<00:02:08.489> here<00:02:08.759> now<00:02:09.330> that's<00:02:09.539> not<00:02:09.720> going<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
up or down here now that's not going to

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.360 
up or down here now that's not going to
make<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.110> harder<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.860> push<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.910> pole

make it harder to push the pole
or<00:02:12.459> back<00:02:12.819> however<00:02:13.510> it's<00:02:13.780> going<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.019> mean

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
or back however it's going to mean

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.570 
or back however it's going to mean
you're<00:02:14.500> going<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.680> have<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:14.920> exert<00:02:15.190> more<00:02:15.519> force

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
you're going to have to exert more force

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.119 
you're going to have to exert more force
to<00:02:16.239> get<00:02:16.810> your<00:02:17.019> character<00:02:17.500> or<00:02:17.620> whatever<00:02:17.950> to

to get your character or whatever to
move<00:02:18.370> within<00:02:18.849> the<00:02:19.120> game<00:02:19.299> if<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.989> were<00:02:20.049> to

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
move within the game if you were to

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.009 
move within the game if you were to
boost<00:02:20.379> it<00:02:20.590> all<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:20.860> way<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.190> max<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.640> is

boost it all the way to the max it is

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.660 
boost it all the way to the max it is
incredibly<00:02:23.019> difficult<00:02:23.379> and<00:02:23.830> grueling<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.489> get

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
incredibly difficult and grueling to get

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.699 
incredibly difficult and grueling to get
your<00:02:24.849> character<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.269> move<00:02:25.540> anyway<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.500> move

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
your character to move anyway you move

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.259 
your character to move anyway you move
it<00:02:26.860> down<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.090> bottom<00:02:28.269> level<00:02:28.629> of<00:02:28.840> one<00:02:29.470> and

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
it down to the bottom level of one and

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.819 
it down to the bottom level of one and
you<00:02:31.269> can<00:02:31.450> do<00:02:31.599> it<00:02:31.720> at<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:32.170> little<00:02:32.409> flip<00:02:32.680> of

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
you can do it at just a little flip of

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.940 
you can do it at just a little flip of
the<00:02:33.060> just<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.180> slight<00:02:34.510> touch<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.170> the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
the just a slight touch of the the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.649 
the just a slight touch of the the
joystick<00:02:36.370> now<00:02:36.579> it<00:02:36.670> doesn't<00:02:36.940> replace<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.269> visit

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
joystick now it doesn't replace a visit

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.259 
joystick now it doesn't replace a visit
to<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.840> gym<00:02:38.110> however<00:02:38.739> if<00:02:39.069> you<00:02:39.640> gonna<00:02:39.909> play<00:02:40.150> the

to the gym however if you gonna play the

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.350 
to the gym however if you gonna play the
games<00:02:40.450> anyways<00:02:40.930> why<00:02:41.860> not<00:02:42.069> because<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:43.150> gives

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
games anyways why not because it gives

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.180 
games anyways why not because it gives
it's<00:02:43.629> going<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.870> give<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.079> a<00:02:44.110> workout<00:02:44.290> or<00:02:44.739> a

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
it's going to give you a workout or a

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.190 
it's going to give you a workout or a
little<00:02:45.849> bit<00:02:46.030> while<00:02:46.660> you're<00:02:46.810> playing<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.170> game

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
little bit while you're playing the game

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.900 
little bit while you're playing the game
now<00:02:47.950> they<00:02:48.099> say<00:02:48.280> this<00:02:48.430> will<00:02:48.579> actually<00:02:48.670> work

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
now they say this will actually work

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.729 
now they say this will actually work
with<00:02:49.000> any<00:02:49.390> game<00:02:49.660> on<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.930> supported<00:02:50.349> systems

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
with any game on the supported systems

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.729 
with any game on the supported systems
which<00:02:51.459> is<00:02:51.790> technically<00:02:52.239> true<00:02:52.359> however<00:02:53.319> I

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
which is technically true however I

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.430 
which is technically true however I
found<00:02:54.280> that<00:02:54.609> it's<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.540> bit<00:02:55.750> difficult<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.230> use

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
found that it's a bit difficult to use

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.099 
found that it's a bit difficult to use
on<00:02:56.620> first-person<00:02:57.190> shooters<00:02:57.519> mainly<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:58.629> played

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
on first-person shooters mainly I played

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.470 
on first-person shooters mainly I played
it<00:02:59.230> with<00:02:59.319> halo<00:02:59.769> I<00:02:59.980> found<00:03:00.459> Master<00:03:01.060> Chief<00:03:01.239> just

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
it with halo I found Master Chief just

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.360 
it with halo I found Master Chief just
kind<00:03:01.659> of<00:03:01.690> moving<00:03:01.870> up<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:02.200> down<00:03:02.370> incredibly

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
kind of moving up and down incredibly

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.000 
kind of moving up and down incredibly
hard<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.670> get<00:03:03.819> used<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.560> try<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.799> use

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
hard to get used to and I try to use

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.470 
hard to get used to and I try to use
either<00:03:06.220> access<00:03:06.819> couldn't<00:03:07.269> do<00:03:07.359> it

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
either access couldn't do it

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.270 
either access couldn't do it

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
like a normal person however racing

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.300 
like a normal person however racing
games<00:03:12.760> such<00:03:13.000> as<00:03:13.030> burn<00:03:13.329> our<00:03:13.480> event<00:03:13.930> or<00:03:14.310> another

vehicle games such as crimson skies

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.559 
vehicle games such as crimson skies
worked<00:03:18.130> exceptionally<00:03:18.489> well<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.209> I<00:03:19.359> found

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
worked exceptionally well and I found

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.599 
worked exceptionally well and I found
that<00:03:19.780> it<00:03:19.900> actually<00:03:20.079> helped<00:03:20.530> me<00:03:20.620> get<00:03:20.799> more<00:03:21.190> into

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
that it actually helped me get more into

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.210 
that it actually helped me get more into
the<00:03:21.730> game<00:03:21.910> which<00:03:22.480> was<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.690> lot<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:23.019> fun<00:03:23.200> too<00:03:23.530> it

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
the game which was a lot of fun too it

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.860 
the game which was a lot of fun too it
actually<00:03:24.370> came<00:03:24.639> a<00:03:24.700> bit<00:03:25.000> more<00:03:25.209> naturally<00:03:25.720> than

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
actually came a bit more naturally than

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.589 
actually came a bit more naturally than
using<00:03:26.139> a<00:03:26.380> typical<00:03:26.919> gamepad<00:03:27.519> because<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.389> fact

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
using a typical gamepad because the fact

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.500 
using a typical gamepad because the fact
your<00:03:28.930> whole<00:03:29.139> body<00:03:29.669> wants<00:03:30.669> to<00:03:30.790> move<00:03:30.970> back<00:03:31.239> and

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
your whole body wants to move back and

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.069 
your whole body wants to move back and
forward<00:03:31.930> with<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.410> controller<00:03:32.889> so<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:34.629> point

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
forward with the controller so the point

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.809 
forward with the controller so the point
movement<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.739> plane<00:03:36.099> just<00:03:36.129> seems<00:03:36.609> to<00:03:36.700> be

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
movement of the plane just seems to be

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.059 
movement of the plane just seems to be
so<00:03:37.030> much<00:03:37.180> more<00:03:37.239> natural<00:03:38.049> when<00:03:38.650> you're<00:03:38.709> flying

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
so much more natural when you're flying

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.460 
so much more natural when you're flying
it<00:03:39.370> now<00:03:39.910> on<00:03:40.120> most<00:03:40.389> controllers<00:03:40.959> you'll<00:03:41.139> notice

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
it now on most controllers you'll notice

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.680 
it now on most controllers you'll notice
that<00:03:41.500> there's<00:03:41.650> actually<00:03:42.160> two<00:03:42.400> axis<00:03:42.940> whereas

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
that there's actually two axis whereas

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.170 
that there's actually two axis whereas
this<00:03:43.840> one<00:03:43.900> seems<00:03:44.349> to<00:03:44.470> be<00:03:44.590> missing<00:03:44.799> one<00:03:45.220> that's

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
this one seems to be missing one that's

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.420 
this one seems to be missing one that's
because<00:03:46.599> the<00:03:46.840> entire<00:03:47.379> unit<00:03:47.739> as<00:03:47.859> a<00:03:47.889> whole<00:03:48.010> is

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
because the entire unit as a whole is

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.280 
because the entire unit as a whole is
actually<00:03:49.060> going<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.239> act<00:03:49.480> as<00:03:49.720> one<00:03:50.049> of<00:03:50.109> the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
actually going to act as one of the

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.229 
actually going to act as one of the
access<00:03:50.680> on<00:03:50.829> the<00:03:50.919> control<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.910> other<00:03:52.030> nice

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
access on the control the other nice

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.270 
access on the control the other nice
thing<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:52.900> have<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.260> choice<00:03:53.560> of<00:03:53.889> which<00:03:54.069> one

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
thing is you have a choice of which one

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.069 
thing is you have a choice of which one
of<00:03:54.310> these<00:03:54.489> access<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.209> want<00:03:55.389> the<00:03:55.510> whole<00:03:55.720> unit

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
of these access you want the whole unit

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.439 
of these access you want the whole unit
to<00:03:56.199> take<00:03:56.410> over<00:03:56.739> for<00:03:56.769> based<00:03:57.669> on<00:03:57.879> these<00:03:58.090> switches

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:58.449 
to take over for based on these switches

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:00.689 
to take over for based on these switches
right<00:03:58.780> here<00:03:59.049> you<00:03:59.530> have<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.680> choice<00:03:59.949> of<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.430> left

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:00.699 
right here you have a choice of the left

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.800 
right here you have a choice of the left
right<00:04:01.389> or<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:02.940> combination<00:04:03.940> of<00:04:04.359> both<00:04:04.419> whether

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
right or a combination of both whether

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.420 
right or a combination of both whether
you<00:04:04.989> want<00:04:05.169> only<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.739> vertical<00:04:06.160> or<00:04:06.310> the

you want only the vertical or the

horizontal that take place in the whole

horizontal that take place in the whole
unit<00:04:08.319> itself<00:04:08.650> which<00:04:09.220> is<00:04:09.250> very<00:04:09.579> nice<00:04:09.760> very

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
unit itself which is very nice very

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.300 
unit itself which is very nice very

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
down side you'll notice it takes up

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.569 
down side you'll notice it takes up
quite<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.780> bit<00:04:13.959> of<00:04:14.079> the<00:04:14.199> room<00:04:14.379> plus<00:04:15.099> my<00:04:15.310> friends

really<00:04:15.699> never<00:04:16.030> understood<00:04:16.449> the<00:04:16.599> point<00:04:16.810> too

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
really never understood the point too

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:17.670 
really never understood the point too
much<00:04:17.229> and

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
much and

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.110 
much and
have<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:17.919> admit<00:04:18.009> it<00:04:18.459> never<00:04:18.699> went<00:04:18.940> off<00:04:19.060> that

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
have to admit it never went off that
