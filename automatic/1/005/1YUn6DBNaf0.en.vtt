00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
never lost it when we were out camping I

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.060 
never lost it when we were out camping I
searched<00:00:38.879> high<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.270> low<00:00:39.510> for<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.410> Zippo<00:00:40.890> that

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
searched high and low for a Zippo that

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.310 
searched high and low for a Zippo that
had<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.489> little<00:00:41.850> little<00:00:42.540> clip<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.050> I

could not find one so eventually I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.709 
could not find one so eventually I
decided<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.379> start<00:00:47.190> modding<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.789> see<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.690> I

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.109 
this point the Zippo comes apart pretty
easily<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.979> just<00:01:13.979> remove<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.369> inside<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.909> set

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
easily so just remove the inside and set

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.359 
easily so just remove the inside and set
that<00:01:15.530> over<00:01:16.530> there<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:19.110> here's<00:01:19.710> what<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.100> end<00:01:20.250> up

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
that over there so here's what we end up

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.090 
that over there so here's what we end up
with<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.000> Zippo<00:01:21.299> shell<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.680> bottom

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
with is the Zippo shell for this bottom

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
with is the Zippo shell for this bottom
and<00:01:23.189> use<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.369> paperclip<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:24.689> really<00:01:24.990> don't<00:01:25.170> need

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
and use a paperclip we really don't need

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.200 
and use a paperclip we really don't need
a<00:01:25.290> whole<00:01:25.530> lot<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.799> strength<00:01:26.070> paperclip<00:01:26.939> is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
a whole lot of strength paperclip is

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.170 
a whole lot of strength paperclip is
just<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> perfect<00:01:28.229> diameter<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.759> could<00:01:29.939> use

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
just the perfect diameter you could use

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.469 
just the perfect diameter you could use
brass<00:01:30.900> wire<00:01:31.520> anything<00:01:32.520> that'll<00:01:32.850> that'll<00:01:33.299> hold

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
brass wire anything that'll that'll hold

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.920 
brass wire anything that'll that'll hold
a<00:01:33.540> shape<00:01:33.750> pretty<00:01:34.020> much<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.759> first<00:01:36.600> thing<00:01:36.810> I

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
a shape pretty much so first thing I

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.850 
a shape pretty much so first thing I
want<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:38.900> bend<00:01:39.900> out<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.380> paperclip<00:01:40.920> and

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
want to do is bend out the paperclip and

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.499 
want to do is bend out the paperclip and
figure<00:01:43.860> out<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.970> longest<00:01:45.630> part<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:47.610> that's

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
figure out the longest part and that's

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.710 
figure out the longest part and that's
going<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.439> middle<00:01:49.890> section<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.369> think

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
going to be this middle section I think

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:04.580 
going to be this middle section I think
so<00:01:52.380> we'll<00:01:52.740> clip<00:01:53.010> off<00:01:56.990> one<00:01:57.990> end<00:01:59.150> and<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:04.560> other

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
so we'll clip off one end and the other

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.860 
so we'll clip off one end and the other
end<00:02:04.980> and<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.640> leaves<00:02:05.820> us<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.300> little<00:02:06.540> chunk

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
end and that leaves us this little chunk

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.370 
end and that leaves us this little chunk
here<00:02:08.240> alright<00:02:09.240> now<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.570> get<00:02:09.750> our<00:02:09.869> length<00:02:10.110> right

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
here alright now to get our length right

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.910 
here alright now to get our length right
what<00:02:10.680> we're<00:02:10.860> going<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.010> do<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:11.340> slide

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
what we're going to do is slide

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.490 
what we're going to do is slide
paperclip<00:02:13.920> into<00:02:14.910> where<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> hinge<00:02:16.080> used<00:02:16.350> to

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
paperclip into where the hinge used to

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.400 
paperclip into where the hinge used to
be<00:02:19.400> as<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.670> can<00:02:20.820> see<00:02:21.060> we<00:02:21.810> now<00:02:21.930> have<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:22.110> fully

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
be as you can see we now have a fully

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.770 
be as you can see we now have a fully
functioning<00:02:22.890> hinge<00:02:23.100> again<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.480> want<00:02:27.660> to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
functioning hinge again so you want to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.340 
functioning hinge again so you want to
take<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.560> paperclip<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:32.870> pretty<00:02:33.870> much<00:02:33.990> guess

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
take the paperclip and pretty much guess

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.310 
take the paperclip and pretty much guess
the<00:02:35.310> halfway<00:02:35.550> point<00:02:36.060> on<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.390> hinge<00:02:39.290> put<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
the halfway point on the hinge put a

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.490 
the halfway point on the hinge put a
nice<00:02:40.560> sharp<00:02:40.860> bend<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.280> it

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
nice sharp bend in it

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.570 
nice sharp bend in it
now<00:02:43.500> what<00:02:43.650> you're<00:02:43.770> going<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.250> do<00:02:44.340> here

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
now what you're going to have to do here

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.310 
now what you're going to have to do here
is<00:02:44.670> kind<00:02:44.880> of<00:02:44.970> figure<00:02:45.180> out<00:02:45.240> where<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.750> want<00:02:45.990> the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
is kind of figure out where you want the

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.680 
is kind of figure out where you want the
apex<00:02:46.770> of<00:02:47.010> your<00:02:47.400> clip<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.730> be<00:02:47.850> if<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.510> want<00:02:48.660> a

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
apex of your clip to be if you want a

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.690 
apex of your clip to be if you want a
little<00:02:48.870> bit<00:02:49.050> longer<00:02:49.320> clip<00:02:49.710> make<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.460> sides

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
little bit longer clip make the sides

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.100 
little bit longer clip make the sides
longer<00:02:51.090> if<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.660> want<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.170> little<00:02:52.590> stouter<00:02:53.130> clip

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
longer if you want a little stouter clip

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.220 
longer if you want a little stouter clip
become<00:02:55.110> shorter<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:56.850> looks<00:02:57.120> about<00:02:57.239> good<00:02:57.390> for

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
become shorter that looks about good for

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.520 
become shorter that looks about good for
what<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.440> want<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.890> do<00:02:59.010> with<00:02:59.160> this<00:02:59.310> one<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:01.440> now

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
what I want to do with this one so now

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.790 
what I want to do with this one so now
that<00:03:01.590> you've<00:03:01.770> figured<00:03:01.980> out<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:03.470> angle<00:03:04.470> you

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
that you've figured out the angle you

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:25.760 
that you've figured out the angle you
find<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.220> middle<00:03:05.430> point<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:06.510> Bend<00:03:07.470> back<00:03:07.680> down

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.750 

at<00:03:26.770> this<00:03:26.860> point<00:03:27.100> you<00:03:27.190> want<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.370> bend<00:03:27.520> it<00:03:27.640> a

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
at this point you want to bend it a

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
at this point you want to bend it a
little<00:03:27.790> past<00:03:28.390> center<00:03:30.600> okay

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
little past center okay

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.010 
little past center okay
now<00:03:32.020> you<00:03:32.080> find<00:03:32.560> where<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.360> wire<00:03:34.360> will<00:03:34.630> insert

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
now you find where the wire will insert

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:44.480 
now you find where the wire will insert
into<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.440> hinge<00:03:35.710> and<00:03:40.230> give<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.260> 90-degree<00:03:41.920> Bend

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.870 

okay<00:03:45.490> that<00:03:45.910> should<00:03:46.270> bring<00:03:46.540> things<00:03:46.960> pretty

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
okay that should bring things pretty

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.620 
okay that should bring things pretty
pretty<00:03:48.880> tight<00:03:50.520> here<00:03:51.520> I<00:03:51.700> like<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.210> put<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.480> little

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
pretty tight here I like to put a little

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.330 
pretty tight here I like to put a little
lateral<00:03:52.930> tension<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:54.390> open<00:03:55.390> up<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:57.280> little

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
lateral tension and open up this little

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.060 
lateral tension and open up this little
gap<00:03:57.790> a<00:03:57.820> little<00:03:58.000> bit<00:03:58.470> all<00:03:59.470> right<00:03:59.590> now<00:03:59.830> we<00:03:59.920> can

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
gap a little bit all right now we can

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:07.130 
gap a little bit all right now we can
pull<00:04:00.280> this<00:04:00.460> out<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:01.470> trim<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.890> middle<00:04:06.250> I

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
pull this out and trim to the middle I

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.100 
pull this out and trim to the middle I
find<00:04:08.140> it's<00:04:08.350> it's<00:04:08.680> pretty<00:04:09.040> much<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:10.570> best<00:04:10.720> idea

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
find it's it's pretty much the best idea

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.940 
find it's it's pretty much the best idea
to<00:04:12.810> have<00:04:13.810> both<00:04:14.080> a<00:04:14.170> little<00:04:14.200> meet<00:04:14.530> in<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.710> middle

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
to have both a little meet in the middle

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.500 
to have both a little meet in the middle
rather<00:04:15.130> than<00:04:15.310> have<00:04:15.460> one<00:04:15.490> side<00:04:15.940> longer<00:04:16.180> than

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
rather than have one side longer than

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.320 
rather than have one side longer than
the<00:04:16.630> other<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:18.549> feel<00:04:18.760> free<00:04:18.910> to<00:04:18.940> experiment

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
the other you feel free to experiment

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.880 
the other you feel free to experiment
however<00:04:19.600> you<00:04:19.810> want<00:04:20.820> this<00:04:21.820> is<00:04:22.060> just<00:04:22.680> how<00:04:23.680> I<00:04:23.710> do

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
however you want this is just how I do

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.920 
however you want this is just how I do
it

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
it

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.610 
it
pin<00:04:25.930> hard<00:04:26.140> with<00:04:26.260> these<00:04:26.380> Leatherman<00:04:26.950> pliers

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
pin hard with these Leatherman pliers

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.670 
pin hard with these Leatherman pliers
okay<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:30.220> here<00:04:30.460> we<00:04:30.490> go<00:04:30.580> we're<00:04:30.790> gonna<00:04:31.440> pop<00:04:32.440> one

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
okay so here we go we're gonna pop one

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:43.680 
okay so here we go we're gonna pop one
leg<00:04:32.890> off<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:35.670> then<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:36.940> other<00:04:37.090> I<00:04:42.390> mean<00:04:43.390> this

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
leg off and then the other I mean this

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.500 
leg off and then the other I mean this
isn't<00:04:44.050> rocket<00:04:44.170> science<00:04:44.410> so<00:04:45.310> it's<00:04:46.060> going<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.420> be

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
isn't rocket science so it's going to be

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.270 
isn't rocket science so it's going to be
okay<00:04:46.780> no<00:04:46.960> matter<00:04:46.990> what<00:04:47.260> we<00:04:47.350> do<00:04:47.530> as<00:04:47.830> long<00:04:47.890> as<00:04:48.070> we

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
okay no matter what we do as long as we

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.400 
okay no matter what we do as long as we
get<00:04:48.370> it<00:04:48.430> in<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.960> in<00:04:50.380> the<00:04:50.650> hinge<00:04:51.570> all<00:04:52.570> right<00:04:52.720> so

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
get it in the in the hinge all right so

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.440 
get it in the in the hinge all right so
you<00:04:53.500> can<00:04:53.680> see<00:04:53.950> hopefully<00:04:54.400> I<00:04:54.790> have<00:04:55.030> one<00:04:55.240> side

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
you can see hopefully I have one side

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.640 
you can see hopefully I have one side
it's<00:04:55.600> a<00:04:55.660> little<00:04:55.750> longer<00:04:56.110> one<00:04:56.260> side<00:04:56.500> is<00:04:56.590> a

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
it's a little longer one side is a

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.890 
it's a little longer one side is a
little<00:04:56.680> shorter<00:04:57.100> let's<00:04:57.250> insert<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:58.480> little

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
little shorter let's insert the little

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.060 
little shorter let's insert the little
longer<00:04:59.290> end<00:04:59.530> in<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:01.090> hinge<00:05:01.510> and<00:05:01.870> then<00:05:02.740> we<00:05:02.860> can

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
longer end in the hinge and then we can

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.740 
longer end in the hinge and then we can
kind<00:05:03.310> of<00:05:03.370> take<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.640> pliers<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.180> wrestle<00:05:04.540> that

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
kind of take the pliers and wrestle that

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.310 
kind of take the pliers and wrestle that
other<00:05:05.710> side<00:05:06.280> in<00:05:08.220> okay<00:05:09.240> not<00:05:10.240> perfect<00:05:10.750> but<00:05:11.140> it's

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
other side in okay not perfect but it's

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:19.230 
other side in okay not perfect but it's
serviceable<00:05:13.260> put<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.380> insides<00:05:14.740> back<00:05:15.070> in<00:05:18.240> and

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
serviceable put the insides back in and

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.690 
serviceable put the insides back in and
there<00:05:19.450> we<00:05:19.540> go

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
there we go

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.480 
there we go
of<00:05:21.700> course<00:05:21.970> you'll<00:05:22.560> fiddle<00:05:23.560> with<00:05:23.710> the

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
of course you'll fiddle with the

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
of course you'll fiddle with the
alignment<00:05:24.970> a<00:05:25.030> bit<00:05:25.500> pull<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.620> inside<00:05:26.920> out<00:05:27.510> make

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
alignment a bit pull the inside out make

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.340 
alignment a bit pull the inside out make
sure<00:05:28.720> everything<00:05:29.140> fits<00:05:29.590> just<00:05:29.740> so<00:05:31.229> at<00:05:32.229> this

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
sure everything fits just so at this
