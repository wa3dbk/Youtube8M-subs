00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
people have been asking for a video so I

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.630 
people have been asking for a video so I
had<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> girl<00:00:22.380> coming<00:00:22.650> today<00:00:22.890> who<00:00:23.250> needed<00:00:23.430> it

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
had a girl coming today who needed it

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.990

done

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
done

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.450 
done
so<00:00:24.300> we<00:00:24.420> videotaped<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.230> as<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.590> did<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.099> I

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
so we videotaped it as we did it and I

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.670 
so we videotaped it as we did it and I
thought<00:00:26.670> you'd<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> share<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.480> give<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
thought you'd like to share it give it a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.019 
thought you'd like to share it give it a
try<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:28.949> does<00:00:29.310> take<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> little<00:00:29.849> bit<00:00:29.939> of

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
try it does take a little bit of

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.999 
try it does take a little bit of
perfecting<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.529> get<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.830> right

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
perfecting but if you can get it right

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.240 
perfecting but if you can get it right
it<00:00:32.189> really<00:00:32.340> does<00:00:32.640> help<00:00:32.969> control<00:00:33.870> any<00:00:34.290> drifting

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
it really does help control any drifting

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.280 
it really does help control any drifting
across<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> first<00:00:36.090> toe<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:37.050> little

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
across of the first toe if a little

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.000 
across of the first toe if a little
bunion<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.710> starting<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.219> form<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.850> enjoy<00:00:41.989> hmm

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
bunion is starting to form so enjoy hmm

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.470 
bunion is starting to form so enjoy hmm
so<00:00:44.010> we're<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.160> looking<00:00:44.789> at<00:00:44.879> our<00:00:45.000> bunion

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
so we're just looking at our bunion

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.240 
so we're just looking at our bunion
taken<00:00:45.870> here<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.500> pop<00:00:46.620> your<00:00:46.800> foot<00:00:46.920> said

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
taken here so just pop your foot said

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.670 
taken here so just pop your foot said
huh<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.420> if<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.719> look<00:00:48.870> at<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.050> bunion<00:00:49.350> it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
huh so if you look at the bunion it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.220 
huh so if you look at the bunion it
comes<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> line<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:52.050> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
comes in the line like that we want to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.130 
comes in the line like that we want to
just<00:00:52.440> straighten<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.820> toe<00:00:54.090> joint<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.570> we

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
just straighten up this toe joint if we

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.689 
just straighten up this toe joint if we
just<00:00:55.320> put<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> toe<00:00:55.680> spacer<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.489> tends

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
just put a toe spacer and it just tends

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.209 
just put a toe spacer and it just tends
to<00:00:56.789> push<00:00:57.180> them<00:00:57.360> apart<00:00:57.480> gets<00:00:58.379> worse<00:00:58.559> over<00:00:58.739> time

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
to push them apart gets worse over time

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.479 
to push them apart gets worse over time
so<00:00:59.550> actually<00:00:59.910> want<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.359> correct<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.079> this

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
so actually want to correct it like this

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.100 
so actually want to correct it like this
so<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:02.640> start<00:01:02.940> off<00:01:03.030> with<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.270> bit<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.629> tape

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
so we start off with a bit of a tape

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:13.060 
so we start off with a bit of a tape
around<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:05.309> main<00:01:05.549> part<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> site

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:22.070 

mm<00:01:14.360> bad<00:01:15.360> light<00:01:19.250> just<00:01:20.250> lift<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.840> maybe<00:01:21.840> you're

mm bad light just lift up maybe you're

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.260 
mm bad light just lift up maybe you're
behind<00:01:24.020> okay<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.140> just<00:01:25.350> dumb<00:01:26.060> place<00:01:27.060> it

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
behind okay it's just dumb place it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.190 
behind okay it's just dumb place it
Tunes<00:01:28.520> stuff<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:32.430> then<00:01:32.580> I<00:01:32.700> can't<00:01:33.060> fix<00:01:33.960> them

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
Tunes stuff on and then I can't fix them

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:45.980 
Tunes stuff on and then I can't fix them
all<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.130> huh

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:55.160 

that<00:01:46.590> around<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:47.490> time<00:01:49.610> then<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.970> got<00:01:51.660> one<00:01:54.170> from

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
that around the time then I got one from

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.550 
that around the time then I got one from
the<00:01:55.260> big<00:01:55.560> tire<00:01:57.260> downside<00:01:58.260> pull<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.770> straight

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
the big tire downside pull it straight

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.230 
the big tire downside pull it straight
down

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
down

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.300 
down
so<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.930> going<00:02:04.200> around<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:04.800> only<00:02:05.010> want

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
so with that going around we only want

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.190 
so with that going around we only want
to<00:02:05.369> use<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.820> white<00:02:06.119> types<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:06.690> don't<00:02:06.869> cut

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
to use that white types they don't cut

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.070 
to use that white types they don't cut
off<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.320> circulation

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
off the circulation

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.070 
off the circulation
okay<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.920> already<00:02:11.660> nice<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.690> straight

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
okay so already nice and straight

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.170 
okay so already nice and straight
looking<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.650> little<00:02:13.709> bit<00:02:13.890> straighter<00:02:14.180> then

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
looking a little bit straighter then

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:27.100 
looking a little bit straighter then
with<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.740> rigid<00:02:16.740> tape<00:02:24.350> start<00:02:25.350> underneath

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
with the rigid tape start underneath

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.560 
with the rigid tape start underneath
underneath<00:02:28.110> big-time<00:02:28.830> now<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.700> want<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.209> just

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
underneath big-time now I want to just

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.720 
underneath big-time now I want to just
gently<00:02:30.959> rotate<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.830> out<00:02:33.680> pull<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.800> up<00:02:35.510> around

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
gently rotate it out pull this up around

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.760 
gently rotate it out pull this up around
so<00:02:38.730> that's<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.090> strong<00:02:39.480> bit<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.959> then<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.530> just

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
so that's the strong bit and then I just

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:48.440 
so that's the strong bit and then I just
gently<00:02:41.060> stick<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.390> outside

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.170 

and<00:02:48.780> then<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.290> one<00:02:49.530> from<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.099> top<00:02:50.340> same

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
and then this one from the top same

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.540 
and then this one from the top same
thing

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.140 

move<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:56.000> around<00:02:57.910> not<00:02:59.620> and<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:00.830> then<00:03:01.150> sitting

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
move it around not and so then sitting

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.570 
move it around not and so then sitting
nice<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:02.390> straight<00:03:03.100> then<00:03:04.100> we<00:03:04.220> just<00:03:04.370> do<00:03:04.550> a

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
nice and straight then we just do a

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:14.830 
nice and straight then we just do a
little<00:03:06.820> tape<00:03:07.820> off<00:03:08.000> if<00:03:08.750> it's<00:03:08.990> really<00:03:09.530> bad
