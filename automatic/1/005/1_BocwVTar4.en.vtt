00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.340
 welcome fans of the robot sit 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.259
 green this your east channel in this vii with 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.269
 this video we released a new section 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.800
 in the channel called are reviews where 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.290
 I will review a game in 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.269
 specific by video since they are games 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.430
 with very deep graphic stories 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.289
 spectacular or just games with 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.940
 a lot to talk about that if you put them in 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.830
 a top of the week I would stay very 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.050
 short with the few minutes that I dedicate 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.880
 per game so let's start with 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.880
 this I am extensive and we started 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.540
 the most famous aliens attack 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.010
 again but now on the screens of 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.680
 our android with someone versus 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.120
 predator evolution the game has 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.890
 the history of these two races and 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.930
 aliens that must fight between 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.420
 them to be able to survive in a world 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.920
 hostile beach of hands although each 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.260
 Extraterrestrial has its own history 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.750
 that we will discover while we are going 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.850
 passing the game everything starts when 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.530
 two important clans of predators 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.080
 they are fighting among themselves to 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.820
 prove who is the best but the clan 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.710
 of the super predators has a plan 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.630
 evil in mind that is to capture the 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.000
 queen alien to enslave all the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.940
 alien race and destroy it completely 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.619
 to the enemy clan your personifying until a 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.509
 clan predator or post that has been 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.520
 attacked and must escape to the 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.310
 planet where the story unfolds 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.660
 completely to stop these super 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.790
 predators 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.440
 likewise impersonate an alien in his 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.270
 first stages that has escaped and 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.220
 emerged from the entrails of the enemy 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.649
 to get to where your queen 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.909
 to be liberated and destroy all 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.039
 predators 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.840
 we can use the skills of both 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.850
 races to eliminate our enemies 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.649
 and dismember the ones in the most 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.409
 brutal and seminars that can be 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.090
 imagine on the part of lalín you can use 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.399
 the incredible strength and speed that 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.350
 they possess with their incredible claws 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.270
 you can dismember your enemies in 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.429
 pieces and you will have the possibility to use 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.859
 his sharp tail to go through everything 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.149
 which is in your way and there is no need 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.950
 forget the ability to take out 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.899
 facebookers will invade the bodies 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.750
 enemies so that more someone resurface 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.429
 as they give battle and my favorite the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.530
 predator with its blades in both 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.260
 hands that will destroy everything in its path to 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.060
 stop the enemy clan the predator 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.530
 possesses a wide variety of weapons and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.049
 gadgets that make it a 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.730
 authentic hunter you can use the 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.410
 plasma cannon to eliminate your 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.299
 enemies from meters away or 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.400
 just stab them until they 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.049
 bloodshed what impressed me the most 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.730
 game were the filters that you can 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.030
 do at the time the icon appears 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.140
 of the skull in the head of the enemy 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.180
 depending on which race you use the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.540
 way to kill will be different but not 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.879
 they stop being brutal 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.739
 You can buy improvements for either your 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.870
 someone like for your predator but 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.609
 defining a bit of each other since 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.290
 the lalin not use artifacts or weapons 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:48.230
 to kill but rather its own 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.180
 body as well as you can improve your tail 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.670
 so that it becomes even more deadly and 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.590
 powerful as well as your body and your 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.109
 head that will give us bonuses of 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.030
 health or strength we can also increase 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.950
 the facebook number is that we can 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.959
 draw at the same time the power and 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.489
 reach of our acid as well as modes 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.889
 of fury that will strengthen our 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.079
 skills now let's move on to the predator 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.939
 which has an incredible arsenal every 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.200
 piece of armor will give us skills 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.959
 extras like a generator 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.430
 invisibility and extra protection the most 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.409
 faces will give us in additions 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.180
 incredible as vision vision 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.040
 infrared and all types of visions 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.930
 that you can imagine in what 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.609
 Regarding weapons we can choose between 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.370
 improve the double blades for about 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.599
 much larger and destructive 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.220
 we can improve the plasma cannon of 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.250
 our shoulder by double barrels or 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.439
 just some more powerful and buy 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.870
 a spear or a whip to get a 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.519
 greater range of attack and finally the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.810
 gadgets that will help us kill 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.730
 our enemies like 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.400
 ease as they will provide us 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.230
 support on the battlefield all these 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.730
 artifacts and skills we can go 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.920
 unlocking for each level that 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.660
 we had reached and buy them later 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.640
 with the points that we have to spend 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.530
 missions now what are the points in 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.910
 against the game first of all I 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.800
 I would have liked them to implement a 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.599
 stealth mode in the game since these two 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.130
 movie monsters specialize in the 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.599
 surprise factor and destroy their 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.760
 victims before they give themselves 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.410
 account a good example of this is that 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.849
 You can become invisible but it does not work 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.010
 nothing since everyone can 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.600
 see and another thing that I can 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.489
 complain although you could say that it is not 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.620
 so serious is the duration of each level to 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.269
 my opinion the levels are very short and 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.769
 I would have liked the story to be 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.350
 will develop much more and that levels 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.450
 they were even longer good though this 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.340
 It is my humble opinion, no doubt, no doubt 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.169
 a game with incredible graphics a 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.970
 very intriguing and profound story and a 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.570
 great variety of skills and weapons by 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.430
 where to choose 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.410
 someone versus predator evolution 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.120
 got many out of 10 in this review 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.770
 because being a predator with vision 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.650
 thermal and a plasma cannon in the 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.270
 shoulder is just amazing good since 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.860
 the review is here before I leave 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.020
 send a great greeting ale tus vázquez
