00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.560
 the kia sorento means in 2002 and were 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.360
 to once for the brand of until then 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.700
 Kia really had a bit of trouble 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.599
 old elderly cars and once was 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.160
 a kia 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.290
 tough because let's be honest the 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.680
 first sorento was a fat one 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.539
 beautiful suv really thin statement 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.680
 I was from Korea and 2002 and soft 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.240
 thing for the first time and was among the 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.160
 impression but that was the rest of it 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.519
 the netherlands also what the thing sold as 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.519
 a tierelier 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.890
 under the skin 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.600
 was actually the best old-fashioned head 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.130
 we stood my ladder chassis you the old 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.320
 engines that mean the car 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.000
 really when it smiles on the road 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.880
 like a seesaw chicken 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.190
 and he went like a Templar 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.170
 of course beyond 2009 it became the ox 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.640
 time of the second generation sorrento and 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.040
 that was a self-supporting body 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.420
 more modern motorcycles that have been driven are already 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.040
 a lot better 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.660
 less still used a girlfriend 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.660
 but also successful again 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.480
 and the time stands still in walrus 2015 and 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.190
 today we are driving the third generation 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.720
 sorrento and that too is substantial 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.860
 further developed weather 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.930
 The main difference is in the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.450
 has concept of car on this car 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.280
 is an 8-centimeter longer wheelbase 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.750
 it is almost ten centimeters longer 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.729
 totality and light one and a half 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.110
 cm close to the road surface 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.540
 That doesn't mean a fat one anymore 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.920
 suv is just more of a crossover one 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.229
 bit a big a very big one 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.229
 stationcar because we want that in 2015 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.410
 and inside has the sorento 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.960
 big steps made interior is real 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.009
 all the time again looks nice 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.720
 from 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.640
 nice materials i like this here that 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.990
 art or it looks cheap 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.640
 but it doesn't feel that good 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.140
 soft well for the rest 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.940
 beautiful that you island on the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.710
 center console with a kind of titanium 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.789
 sustain stream one in which all instruments 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.200
 in it 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.670
 the handlebar is nice in the hand that 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.450
 You can see that it is nice and high-gloss 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.190
 fingers 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.470
 it's just a nice car nice too 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.479
 your block panel is the speedometer 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.979
 digital is virtual 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.220
 sit left and right while physical 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.220
 blocks 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.320
 He is incredibly spacious inside it 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.840
 nice and high overview and in particular 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.070
 in the back because that extra wheelbase of 8 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.570
 centimeters come for the most part 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.570
 in favor of the people in the back 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.330
 what is a lot less spacious is the choice 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.980
 because 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.500
 kia makes this car with 3 different ones 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.209
 engines two titles and a gasoline and 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.430
 the netherlands only gets one and if 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.599
 the thickest diesel and if so it has 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.500
 200 hp and that is quite a bit like 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.209
 202 k 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.080
 does not feel benefit is again he has 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.549
 saying so much that you will never be short 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.920
 what in particular is a bit in the way 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.690
 is those machines an old-fashioned machine 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.310
 with torque converter it is very nice and 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.140
 terrain but it is a fairly slow 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.470
 vending machines if you stand on the grass then 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.569
 he should think about it before he runs out 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.569
 his dead convenience will switch 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.450
 the steering is for a Korean car 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.920
 remarkably heavy and communicative 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.400
 really really good for this kind 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.560
 cars 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.270
 it's still a heavy eye for you 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.120
 feel and turns it quite lean 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.440
 and some diving if you are going to brake 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.720
 east of the corridor is a stretch 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.070
 improved weather 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.780
 but well there I can call that the 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.620
 time is in the back but you want that 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.620
 of course see 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.270
 I already said it and what I say is always 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.410
 where i am behind myself now that i am 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.760
 almost 90 feet of legroom 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.260
 headroom is over has the is one more 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.510
 you don't have that special glass day 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.610
 command 2 centimeters 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.410
 and if you need less space a lot less hope 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.640
 then you just go to 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.780
 forward 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.239
 more trunk space or more space for 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.459
 3rd row of land also that is in it 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.700
 of course the right plan to the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.700
 hand 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:03.780
 and that too is very decent 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.450
 crafting natural tablets 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.230
 had it all automatically but must 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.239
 watch you 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.560
 even I can sit here stairs though 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.120
 but good for small children is 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.849
 just really good here in the back 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.949
 you even have your own air conditioning 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.410
 a nice big spacious modern car 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.479
 parking real estate will score 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.009
 the only drawback is no choice 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.060
 motorbikes but maybe there comes in the 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.060
 future changes 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.240
 a
