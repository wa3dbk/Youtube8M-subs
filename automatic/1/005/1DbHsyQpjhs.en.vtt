00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.210 
a few days ago I tried the new Matson 2

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.480 
a few days ago I tried the new Matson 2
voltage<00:00:07.660> live<00:00:08.470> for<00:00:08.920> the<00:00:08.980> first<00:00:09.190> time<00:00:09.340> on

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
voltage live for the first time on

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.120 
voltage live for the first time on
camera<00:00:09.900> again<00:00:10.900> that<00:00:11.080> live<00:00:11.260> just<00:00:11.290> kind<00:00:12.040> of

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
I'm here to try the second new Mountain

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.279 
I'm here to try the second new Mountain
Dew<00:00:18.039> flavor<00:00:18.310> for<00:00:18.580> me<00:00:18.730> and<00:00:19.510> that<00:00:19.630> is<00:00:19.810> Mountain

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.939 
Dew flavor for me and that is Mountain
Dew<00:00:21.150> supernova<00:00:22.150> I<00:00:22.439> almost<00:00:23.439> turned<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:23.830> wrong

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
Dew supernova I almost turned the wrong

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.820 
Dew supernova I almost turned the wrong
legs<00:00:24.220> the<00:00:24.400> a-site<00:00:24.699> flips<00:00:24.970> it<00:00:25.150> but<00:00:25.900> yes<00:00:26.050> I<00:00:26.320> did

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
legs the a-site flips it but yes I did

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.160 
legs the a-site flips it but yes I did
like<00:00:27.039> super<00:00:27.490> nom<00:00:27.759> voltage<00:00:28.480> excuse<00:00:28.750> me<00:00:28.869> I<00:00:28.929> am

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
like super nom voltage excuse me I am

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.730 
like super nom voltage excuse me I am
did<00:00:29.830> like<00:00:30.009> voltage<00:00:30.429> voltage<00:00:30.820> is<00:00:31.150> good<00:00:31.740> nothing

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:32.740 
did like voltage voltage is good nothing

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.220 
did like voltage voltage is good nothing
beats<00:00:33.130> the<00:00:33.340> original<00:00:33.370> yet<00:00:34.000> but<00:00:34.420> um<00:00:34.600> I<00:00:34.870> here

you know him for my videos most likely
um<00:00:40.469> he<00:00:41.469> loves<00:00:41.800> supernova<00:00:42.340> he<00:00:42.579> says<00:00:42.850> at<00:00:43.030> this

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
um he loves supernova he says at this

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.720 
um he loves supernova he says at this
favorite<00:00:43.510> one<00:00:43.629> so<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.890> I've<00:00:45.010> also<00:00:45.190> seen<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.699> lot

favorite one so but I've also seen a lot
of<00:00:45.850> people<00:00:46.090> say<00:00:46.210> supernovas<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.840> worst<00:00:47.050> one

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
of people say supernovas the worst one

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260 
of people say supernovas the worst one
but<00:00:47.500> I've<00:00:48.129> also<00:00:48.280> seen<00:00:48.460> people<00:00:48.879> say<00:00:49.000> that<00:00:49.180> they

but I've also seen people say that they

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.869 
but I've also seen people say that they
hate<00:00:49.420> voltage<00:00:49.870> so<00:00:50.340> obviously<00:00:51.340> you<00:00:51.489> can't<00:00:51.760> go

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
hate voltage so obviously you can't go

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.470 
hate voltage so obviously you can't go
by<00:00:52.059> anybody<00:00:52.780> else's<00:00:53.079> tongue<00:00:53.320> but<00:00:53.559> yourselves

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
by anybody else's tongue but yourselves

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.599 
by anybody else's tongue but yourselves
that<00:00:55.480> makes<00:00:55.719> sense<00:00:55.960> in<00:00:56.230> a<00:00:56.320> non<00:00:56.500> weird<00:00:57.250> kind<00:00:57.550> of

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
that makes sense in a non weird kind of

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:57.779 
that makes sense in a non weird kind of
way

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
way

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.000 
way
so<00:00:58.719> anyway<00:00:58.989> here<00:00:59.109> we<00:00:59.140> go<00:00:59.320> for<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.620> first<00:00:59.769> time

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
so anyway here we go for the first time

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.270 
so anyway here we go for the first time
on<00:01:00.190> camera<00:01:00.399> myself<00:01:01.180> and<00:01:01.359> myself<00:01:01.690> anyway

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
on camera myself and myself anyway

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.730 
on camera myself and myself anyway
Mountain<00:01:03.280> Dew<00:01:03.309> supernova<00:01:04.180> let's<00:01:05.170> do<00:01:05.350> it

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
Mountain Dew supernova let's do it

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.249 
Mountain Dew supernova let's do it
Oh<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:08.290> of<00:01:08.440> all<00:01:08.610> sorry

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
it's do with a blast of strawberry melon

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.270 
it's do with a blast of strawberry melon
flavor<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:15.930> ginseng<00:01:17.070> again<00:01:18.070> I<00:01:18.130> don't<00:01:18.189> know

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
flavor and ginseng again I don't know

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.710 
flavor and ginseng again I don't know
what<00:01:18.400> that<00:01:18.549> last<00:01:18.729> word<00:01:18.939> is<00:01:19.740> ginseng<00:01:20.740> I<00:01:21.040> guess

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
what that last word is ginseng I guess

what that last word is ginseng I guess
yeah<00:01:22.720> and<00:01:22.810> there's<00:01:23.259> a<00:01:23.290> nice<00:01:23.470> purple<00:01:23.770> look<00:01:24.100> to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
yeah and there's a nice purple look to

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:39.450 
yeah and there's a nice purple look to
it<00:01:26.100> let's<00:01:27.100> do<00:01:27.250> this<00:01:27.960> wish<00:01:28.960> me<00:01:29.110> luck

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:54.550 

hmm<00:01:40.330> I<00:01:43.410> don't<00:01:44.410> know

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.649 

I<00:01:54.590> like<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:55.460> I<00:01:55.670> like<00:01:56.659> it<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:58.880> has<00:01:59.030> an<00:01:59.240> artificial

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
I like it I like it it has an artificial

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.899 
I like it I like it it has an artificial
taste<00:02:01.600> feel<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.810> it<00:02:03.280> like<00:02:04.280> you're<00:02:04.700> tasting

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
taste feel to it like you're tasting

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.899 
taste feel to it like you're tasting
like<00:02:05.270> fake<00:02:05.990> fruit<00:02:06.409> I<00:02:06.770> hope<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.460> makes<00:02:07.610> sense

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
like fake fruit I hope that makes sense

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.029 
like fake fruit I hope that makes sense
but<00:02:08.660> um<00:02:08.869> obviously<00:02:09.380> it's<00:02:09.560> artificially

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
but um obviously it's artificially

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.020 
but um obviously it's artificially
flavored<00:02:11.260> but<00:02:13.120> between<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.480> voltage

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
flavored but between this and voltage

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:27.160 
flavored but between this and voltage
it's<00:02:17.030> hard<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.420> tell<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:23.530> like<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.709> I<00:02:25.930> think<00:02:26.930> I

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
it's hard to tell I like it I think I

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.590 
it's hard to tell I like it I think I
may<00:02:27.380> like<00:02:27.560> voltage<00:02:27.950> more<00:02:28.190> but<00:02:29.000> then<00:02:29.480> again

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
may like voltage more but then again

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.030 
may like voltage more but then again
it's<00:02:29.959> very<00:02:30.019> hard<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.380> tell<00:02:30.590> because<00:02:30.739> I've<00:02:30.920> only

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
it's very hard to tell because I've only

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.650 
it's very hard to tell because I've only
had<00:02:31.160> one<00:02:31.220> bottle<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.150> now<00:02:32.269> one

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
had one bottle of that and now one

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.530 
had one bottle of that and now one
bottle<00:02:32.989> of<00:02:33.050> this<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.709> I've<00:02:34.640> been<00:02:34.790> happy<00:02:35.000> and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
bottle of this and I've been happy and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.050 
bottle of this and I've been happy and
I've<00:02:35.780> been<00:02:35.930> having<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.320> original<00:02:36.590> do<00:02:37.060> since

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
I've been having the original do since

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.140 
I've been having the original do since
the<00:02:38.330> days<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.540> Halo<00:02:38.870> 2<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:40.010> that's<00:02:40.220> years<00:02:40.550> for

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
the days of Halo 2 so that's years for

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.740 
the days of Halo 2 so that's years for
now<00:02:41.269> for<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.470> original<00:02:43.540> but<00:02:45.459> I'd<00:02:46.459> say<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:47.269> is

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
now for the original but I'd say it is

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.490 
now for the original but I'd say it is
it<00:02:47.959> is<00:02:48.110> again<00:02:48.410> very<00:02:48.620> good<00:02:49.209> it's<00:02:50.209> not<00:02:50.420> as<00:02:50.690> good
