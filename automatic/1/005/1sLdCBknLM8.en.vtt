look<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:46.770> stories<00:00:47.219> we<00:00:47.399> tell<00:00:47.579> ourselves<00:00:47.640> are

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
look the stories we tell ourselves are

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.880 
look the stories we tell ourselves are
far<00:00:48.420> more<00:00:48.570> important<00:00:49.020> than<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> things<00:00:49.410> we

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
far more important than the things we

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.580 
far more important than the things we
actually<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.760> whey<00:00:51.570> protein<00:00:52.050> being<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
actually do whey protein being a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.580 
actually do whey protein being a
necessity<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.789> your<00:00:53.910> particular<00:00:54.149> gains

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
necessity for your particular gains

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.900
