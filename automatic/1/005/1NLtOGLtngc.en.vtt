been waiting a while and it always

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
been waiting a while and it always
seemed<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.260> was<00:00:43.379> really<00:00:43.530> far<00:00:44.010> away<00:00:44.280> but

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670

seemed like it was really far away but
now<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.230> today<00:00:46.230> literally<00:00:46.920> I've<00:00:47.219> been

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
now that today literally I've been

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.670 
now that today literally I've been
thinking<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.210> lot<00:00:48.360> about<00:00:48.420> why<00:00:48.899> I'm<00:00:49.110> doing<00:00:49.469> this

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
first reason Nvidia is because I always

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.010 
first reason Nvidia is because I always
thought<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.280> losing<00:00:53.760> your<00:00:54.149> hair<00:00:54.449> was<00:00:54.840> an

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
thought that losing your hair was an

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.740 
thought that losing your hair was an
unnecessary<00:00:56.010> added<00:00:56.730> trauma<00:00:57.030> for<00:00:57.390> kids<00:00:57.570> it's

unnecessary added trauma for kids it's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.810 
unnecessary added trauma for kids it's
cancer<00:00:58.199> another<00:00:58.559> reason<00:00:58.980> I'm<00:00:59.100> doing<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.430> is

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
cancer another reason I'm doing this is

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.939
