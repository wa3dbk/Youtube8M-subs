00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.490 
this is actually another week and this
is<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.070> Hollywood<00:00:35.070> sister<00:00:35.550> sis<00:00:36.420> wig<00:00:36.719> natural

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
is the Hollywood sister sis wig natural

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.030 
is the Hollywood sister sis wig natural
and<00:00:38.149> color<00:00:39.149> too<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.600> felt<00:00:40.440> kind<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.800> looks<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
and color too I felt kind of looks a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.600 
and color too I felt kind of looks a
little<00:00:41.190> dark<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.760> too<00:00:42.180> but<00:00:43.250> maybe<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.340> just

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
little dark for too but maybe I just

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.040 
little dark for too but maybe I just
think<00:00:44.760> all<00:00:44.879> tools<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.329> dark<00:00:45.480> cuz<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.719> say<00:00:45.870> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
think all tools of dark cuz I say that

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.560 
think all tools of dark cuz I say that
all<00:00:46.379> number<00:00:46.680> twos<00:00:46.860> maybe<00:00:47.700> um<00:00:48.059> there's

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
all number twos maybe um there's

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.510 
all number twos maybe um there's
probably<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.320> I'm<00:00:49.620> not<00:00:49.950> even<00:00:49.980> probably

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
probably and I'm not even probably

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.950 
probably and I'm not even probably
there's<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.850> difference<00:00:51.180> between<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
there's a difference between like the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.750 
there's a difference between like the
human<00:00:52.649> hair<00:00:52.890> tools<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:55.399> synthetic<00:00:56.399> tues<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
human hair tools and synthetic tues and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.400 
human hair tools and synthetic tues and
that's<00:00:56.879> probably<00:00:57.000> why<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.840> I'm<00:00:58.020> used<00:00:58.289> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that's probably why like I'm used to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.770 
that's probably why like I'm used to
whenever<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.340> got<00:00:59.670> my<00:00:59.850> hair<00:01:00.090> weaved<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.629> would

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
whenever I got my hair weaved I would

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.189 
whenever I got my hair weaved I would
always<00:01:00.899> wear<00:01:01.289> my<00:01:01.949> number<00:01:02.280> two<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.019> feel

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
always wear my number two so like I feel

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.539 
always wear my number two so like I feel
like<00:01:04.229> some<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.619> these<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.040> much<00:01:05.189> darker

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
like some of these are so much darker

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.100 
like some of these are so much darker
but<00:01:05.729> anyway<00:01:06.090> let's<00:01:06.330> get<00:01:06.450> back<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.869> hair

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
but anyway let's get back to this hair

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.880 
but anyway let's get back to this hair
so<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:08.220> hair<00:01:08.520> feels<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.869> looks<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.320> lot<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.860> me

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
so this hair feels and looks a lot to me

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.570 
so this hair feels and looks a lot to me
like<00:01:11.310> some<00:01:12.979> you<00:01:13.979> know<00:01:14.010> blow-dried<00:01:14.760> hair<00:01:16.580> like

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
like some you know blow-dried hair like

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.700 
like some you know blow-dried hair like
it<00:01:17.729> really<00:01:18.030> looks<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.330> my<00:01:18.630> hair<00:01:18.990> after

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
recap this is kind of what it looks like

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.429 
recap this is kind of what it looks like
so<00:01:26.100> I've<00:01:26.220> pulled<00:01:26.580> just<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.630> little<00:01:27.810> baby<00:01:28.049> here

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
so I've pulled just a little baby here

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.310 
so I've pulled just a little baby here
out<00:01:28.680> um<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.060> see<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> wig<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
out um as you see this is the wig the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.920 
out um as you see this is the wig the
wig<00:01:31.350> does<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.520> very<00:01:32.850> natural<00:01:33.299> hairline

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
wig does have a very natural hairline

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.880 
wig does have a very natural hairline
because<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.439> see<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.890> meshed<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:37.680> see

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
because you see as I meshed that you see

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.760 
because you see as I meshed that you see
so<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.810> didn't<00:01:40.170> pull<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.530> all

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
so it really I didn't pull it out all

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.100 
so it really I didn't pull it out all
the<00:01:40.920> way<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:42.140> this<00:01:43.140> wig<00:01:43.409> doesn't<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:45.110> those

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the way so this wig doesn't have those

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.289 
the way so this wig doesn't have those
little<00:01:46.200> tabs<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.130> think<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.520> no<00:01:48.000> wig

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
little tabs and I think that no wig

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.149 
little tabs and I think that no wig
maker<00:01:48.540> should<00:01:48.840> make<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.049> wig<00:01:49.320> without<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.860> so

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
maker should make a wig without that so

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.130 
maker should make a wig without that so
that's<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> only<00:01:51.000> thing<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.450> over<00:01:51.810> here

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
that's the only thing like over here

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.340 
that's the only thing like over here
it's<00:01:52.590> sticking<00:01:52.890> up<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.220> little<00:01:53.460> bit<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.350> it's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
it's sticking up a little bit but it's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.719 
it's sticking up a little bit but it's
okay<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> wouldn't<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.070> really<00:01:56.369> putting<00:01:56.640> it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
okay I wouldn't be really putting it

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.580 
okay I wouldn't be really putting it
back<00:01:56.850> anyway<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.689> stick<00:01:57.930> up<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.200> little<00:01:58.439> bit

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
back anyway just stick up a little bit

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.950 
back anyway just stick up a little bit
say<00:01:59.210> it's<00:02:00.210> okay<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.540> won't<00:02:00.750> put<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:00.960> back<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:02.009> um

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
say it's okay I won't put it back but um

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.500 
say it's okay I won't put it back but um
that's<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:05.010> thing<00:02:05.220> um<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:06.119> doesn't<00:02:06.299> have<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
that's one thing um it doesn't have the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.150 
that's one thing um it doesn't have the
little<00:02:06.780> tab<00:02:06.960> things<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.440> it<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.770> does<00:02:07.920> stick

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
little tab things in it so it does stick

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.090 
little tab things in it so it does stick
up<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.610> very<00:02:08.819> full<00:02:09.450> very<00:02:09.890> soft<00:02:10.890> very

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100
