00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.800
 welcome back to the channel and here 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.750
 we are with the tutorial of how 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.880
 would consider if mega larios galaxies 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.520
 the legendary saints valley points 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.260
 delimited etcetera etcetera well before 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.550
 you have nothing to know that please 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.840
 you have entered this video thinking about 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.270
 get those from a method so 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.650
 say it legal or free should come out of the 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.900
 life that you need a kind of 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.750
 card which you have here an unboxing 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.790
 it's called power save 3ds and it's worth 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.760
 around 20 euros that are being 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.140
 $ 25 more or less and with this 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.510
 card what we are going to be able to do is 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.489
 modify in our game of pokemon 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.940
 x pokemon yy many stronger nor all 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.440
 3ds alright so nothing as I say 6 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.019
 I was looking for that, what if it was free 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.239
 go away from the video because you will not be able to 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.920
 get also you notice that I do not 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.470
 ask that I give pokemon saint is 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.390
 because at the moment I can not I can not 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.190
 give away because getting good nintendo 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.010
 if I can pokemon continue if I can but 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.490
 nintendo do not let give as well 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.340
 say it in pokemon cause as hernias 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.900
 and belt alice ward saint is because its 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.330
 is blocked in 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.550
 in wireless communication mode and 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.140
 wifi communication so nothing guys 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.090
 come on let's go with the tutorial what 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.730
 we must do will be to have the power save 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.860
 3ds connected to our pc and insert the 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.320
 cartridge is quite easy inserts the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.820
 cartridge obviously has no loss of 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.770
 more are two cables so nothing we're going 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.390
 to insert and let's wait for here 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.040
 where he puts coats load we can go 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.920
 entering but you have to load all this 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.240
 if not then it does not work well 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.100
 will be downloading the contents in 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.260
 line since you are updating continuous 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.270
 continuously or be a new code 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.770
 is updated you just have to do nothing 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.780
 well here you have for example 2000 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.940
 selenium scouts that are for example 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.850
 money from battles etc. and so on 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.460
 here you have the codes for example 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.410
 max items that is for example in the slow 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.850
 tour not having these systems and the 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.440
 modifiers for example here we can 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.150
 get the lazio if you are and the law in 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.700
 yes to see if the digital 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.060
 atheists and it's worth alright here we have the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.310
 for example in the recovery ie 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.170
 rare protein candies zinc and all 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.760
 that and here the berries we do not have 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.170
 valley modifier is to say no 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.540
 we can get the fence we want 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.240
 but good in its defect we have stock 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.250
 what is 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.170
 well that is to multiply a fence in order 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.780
 although there are still dozens of clouds 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.080
 can carry repeated objects here 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.670
 we can return saints to the pokemon but 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.070
 we can not catch now I'm going to 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.870
 explain how this works and so 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.520
 which we can not catch a pokÃ©mon that 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.890
 will already be assigned we will not force the 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.170
 looking a little more amish well here 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.930
 we can remove back from saint and then 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.270
 the pokemon go for good then we do not 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.400
 are going to be saint and you are like that for example not 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.350
 we like a little bit to get the bonsai ni 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.320
 by mistake we can not go back 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.960
 jmg is ok here is the for example 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.240
 to modify us in box 1 the first 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.190
 hollow the little good that we to put 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.600
 one day is 1 in days and 15 and here 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.370
 is what the web of fit that we can 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.950
 get element of torch and with element 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.110
 by day so here the powers 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.410
 so we have all the good 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.720
 software all and we're going to get you 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.250
 fill all the softwares and that for 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.810
 have them so to speak unlimited 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.630
 you would have to keep putting it here and such 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.550
 but good and all have all the ovules 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.140
 and here the alternative ways that by 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.610
 example those of floyd that we can even 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.760
 get the act form 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.220
 ok let's get all the pop-up hours 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.290
 power for example and this is valid and also 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.240
 let's get to have her uncle if 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.190
 you are because I have 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.070
 negative if it removes you from negatives in the 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.200
 hollow number one and come let's see each other 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.570
 also unlimited battle points and 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.280
 unlimited money because we're not going to give it 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.590
 apply and let's wait for him to read the 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.390
 cartridge you have read the safe 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.160
 bing from the cartridge to the server because 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.780
 this what I say is not like the action 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.700
 replay or the previous game arts 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.410
 there were some codes that modified the 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.880
 ram memory of the game this what it does 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.340
 which is the temporary memory once 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.580
 able the codes went away not this what 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.350
 what it does is edit the save vale 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.820
 we put you 6 pm in which you have everything 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.739
 after that to see it done 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.290
 express with being see it process is to say 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.750
 that I put everything you have put 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.590
 here you download the ceip game for another 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.820
 time to your game 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.769
 so you are downloading it now 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.810
 same in the eliminated ones can be extracted 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.300
 of the program so for the time being 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.680
 discards the possibility even of 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.880
 get a little sense because it has 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.130
 stayed here blocked but good has 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.480
 advanced a bit in order should be that the 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.740
 servers are saturated something because 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.449
 lately he has bought a lot 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.069
 people are broken but still 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.779
 I find it very strange that as 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.270
 it works that the servers are captured with 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:40.300
 I 'm a little lack of respect, because 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.999
 there is no other way in the end I'm short 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.979
 and now when it is fixed I come back and good 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:46.569
 guys, as you can see, we've already been 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.699
 that once it is set it will turn us 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.589
 here to the codhes tab it's worth it so 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.800
 nothing now we go to our screen 

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:55.089
 the nintendo 3ds and good guys now 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.860
 we're halfway through other times so 

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:59.469
 let's check if everything has worked 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.180
 how it had to work, are we in 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:03.069
 the pokemon center so let's open 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.650
 our backpack and let's look if 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:08.020
 really everything has gone well we go 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.509
 to look first at the bag for him in the 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.860
 bag as you see we have 999 visits 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.270
 but given by recording with this bad 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.770
 quality but I can not do what 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.080
 no other way 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:21.249
 well here also in bus and candies 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.169
 weird but it was previously and good 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:24.819
 as you see at the moment of the dairy and 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.289
 you've worked, let's remember what 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.499
 more we have put 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.149
 I would swear that we have put 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:33.009
 also money so let's go to 

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:37.599
 check the card inside 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:40.300
 and there he puts 9 million 929 thousand 999 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:42.849
 few miles does not change them I think I do not 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.490
 change them so nothing like you see 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.979
 everything has worked perfectly 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.539
 everything went well and good for the 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.830
 that you want to see the legendary haines 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.229
 although I have not put on you know why 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.610
 they were already saint and if I do not have more or not 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.169
 you can eat seen getting the 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.050
 legendary amish we can go to the bag 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.369
 and in the bag, sorry for the team and 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.779
 I'm going to teach you to the 

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:04.719

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:07.089

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:14.620
 move the camera a little have droughts 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:18.790
 eneas is worth there you have shiny hernias 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.020
 then there's a sale and it's worth it so nothing 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.430

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.590
