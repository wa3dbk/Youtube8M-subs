00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.969
 then the air we breathe is the most important substance for life 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.050
 on earth 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.029
 we can live several weeks without eating 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.890
 but humans 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.890
 they can only live 3 to 5 days without water 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.699
 but healthy water cleanses like nature I believe 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.180
 it is increasingly difficult to find 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.610
 industrial waste 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.400
 perkins before 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.909
 other pollutants are a threat to water 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.909
 from which our life depends every day 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.780
 the problem 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.629
 Water 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.800
 in the way that nature created it 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.830
 contains minerals such as gypsum 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.450
 calcite and dolomites 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.320
 The main sources of calcium and magnesium 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.740
 which are the most important minerals for animal life and 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.100
 humans 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.930
 both of them 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.899
 are important ingredients in water because our body 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.659
 It is designed to absorb them in the water 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.960
 They are available for our bodies to use them for 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.630
 create 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.380
 healthy bones and teeth 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.609
 and help us to prevent osteoporosis in women 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.210
 Calcium and magnesium are also natural agents responsible for 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.380
 reduce the acidity in the water without them the water becomes very acidic and does not 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.380
 recommended for humans and animals to drink 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.450
 but still owes the things that the natives added to the water that we use 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.340
 to drink 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.850
 bathe and cook 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.580
 substances have been added 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.040
 that nature never considered 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.460
 from potentially harmful chemical fertilizer organisms 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.509
 and pesticides 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.719
 even industrial waste has been adding to our water 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.719
 in worrying amounts 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.960
 the water that comes from the municipal plants 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.760
 They do everything possible to send water in good condition. I love those popular ones, but the truth is 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.720
 is that the quality of the water your family consumes 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.579
 it's up to you 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.999
 it stays there in its water 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:19.440
 Ask anyone who thinks of their drinking water 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.340
 and they will tell you 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.919
 that have bad smell or taste 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.720
 for years it has been said 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.080
 of the hardness in the water apa the bad taste by the bad smell 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:29.780
 but the reality 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.480
 is that this comes 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.640
 of the chemicals discarded by the iris offer industry previously used 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.099
 in the agriculture 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.780
 the hardness in the water is simply the amount of calcium bicarbonate and 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:44.420
 magnesium carbonate 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.420
 which do not add flavor or smell 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.689
 It is true that poverty can be the cause of corrosion in 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:57.369
 Pipes and household goods such as goals dishwashers and washing machines 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.139
 more hardness as solÃ¡ does not represent any threat to health 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.719
 in fact the opposite 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:08.109
 a recent study of the global health organization or 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.860
 indicates that there may be health benefits 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.009
 when drinking water rich in calcium and magnesium 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:18.949
 and when people take aouate warning level or water that comes from their 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:22.979
 water warnings bush cosmos systems is reverse are at higher risk 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.030
 to suffer 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.030
 heart disease and diabetes 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:33.099
 the artificially softened water benefits have been known for 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.989
 almost a century 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.949
 what does it mean soft water 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:42.660
 said simply the water was artificially warned this water 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.320
 which was removed 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.990
 the calcium bicarbonate 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.620
 and magnesium carbonate and have been replaced with salt 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:54.389
 Most of the uav and flavors work mainly with exchange 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.459
 I just 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.939
 it's an exchange of calcium ions 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.939
 and magnesium sodium collisions 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.469
 At the heart of a water softener there is a mineral tank with millions of 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:11.159
 small polystyrene cameras called resin that have charge 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.930
 negative 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.540
 that combine with water 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.540
 enter the tank 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.030
 the slippery layer that you feel after bathing with softened water 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.159
 it is the salt that remains on our skin 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:28.700
 but slippery skin 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.259
 It is not the only problem caused by uav and water flavors 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.610
 apart from the cost of buying salt every month 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.449
 Most wari flavors 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.430
 do not remove contaminants 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.970
 And they waste 20 in the gallons of water every other day 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.319
 when the system was remembered 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.330
 that's why 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.950
 the warning bears that are being banned 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.500
 in a growing number of cities in the United States 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.020
 or only if it is investment 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.659
 the reverse osmosis 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:01.860
 It is known as a good method for water treatment 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.150
 which was developed by the United States military 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.919
 In the Second World War 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.070
 to remove salt from seawater 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.559
 and can be used by military ships 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:16.080
 the process works by forcing the water to pass through a membrane 

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:17.690
 semipermeable 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.650
 using high pressure 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.540
 said membrane contains by those that only allow molecules of 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.000
 Water 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.380
 pass by leaving behind 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.400
 the pollutants 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.639
 the water that passes through the membrane 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:30.949
 lose minerals 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.169
 essentials and returns its state even been has been 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:36.930
 according to the p ap 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.199
 drinking water 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.650
 must have a range of acidity between 6 points 5 and 8 points 5 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.960
 the water coming from a bersa postponement system 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.889
 this one between four and six points 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:55.130
 the water that was born that you have to use special plastics to prevent 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:56.470
 that acidity 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.509
 Daniel the metallic components 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.039
 in a short period of time 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.169
 while the cosmos and without bersa 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.650
 has been described as the purest form of purification 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.350
 In most cases 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.300
 it is not and not qualified in some quality standards and units 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.740
 small ones that go under the dishwashers 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.259
 they only treat the water 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:23.039
 in a key of his home additionally of vido now the almost continuous challenge 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:23.689
 washed 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:27.300
 what does the unit do to keep the membrane clean these units 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.800
 can spend almost 375 thousand liters of water per year 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:33.790
 let go 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.029
 phillip round 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.080
 mentions 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.550
 Many people are surprised when they hear me say that the use of exclusive 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.660
 purified water 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.780
 or designated 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.259
 constitutes a risk to health 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:49.120
 and that is that water lacks the essential minerals 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:52.160
 when the water is demineralized 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.089
 It is beneficial for the release of toxins in the body 

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:59.080
 but if it is used as the only means of hydration 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.590
 The body will begin to lose electrolytes such as sodium potassium and 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.409
 chloride 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:07.629
 and start having deficiencies 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:08.830
 in minerals 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.740
 calcium and magnesium which can cause regular palpitation in the 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.409
 heart and high pressure
