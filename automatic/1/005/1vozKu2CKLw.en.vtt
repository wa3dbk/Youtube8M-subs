00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:17.119
 [Music] 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.880
 then we continue now double session and the 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.470
 Good Sunday is the last game of 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.450
 preparation and make silk 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.220
 best way for you to win and 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.349
 that helps you not to feel the confidence 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.450
 there and good and ready to start 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.490
 even keep doing the best 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.379
 what the last game was against 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.760
 sub-20 who made a good match with 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.190
 a lot of ball position was had a 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.090
 arrival goal was had definition I think 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.760
 that is what is going to be followed 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.989
 Searching and repeating, I hope it happens like 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.030
 result above all to help you 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.800
 trust I say that more did a 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.829
 power in your stadium not 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.050
 same has more capacity where people 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.270
 have to go to support I say 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.590
 Well, if you do not like it, do not like it 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.420
 everything about what you're playing 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.489
 so you have to go play another 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.640
 but good pressures are 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.339
 taken I simply ask that the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.200
 people will support us there we will be 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.040
 we at home we weigh 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.590
 what 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.470
 they are simply what things where 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.380
 where we play in the playing the priority 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.289
 it is first to be saved 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.259
 is the highest the highest score that is 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.969
 can as he said with 25 points then 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.070
 well you're saved and good and you're 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.829
 you're on the other side you're not thinking about 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.270
 a league but the reality is 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.219
 start you're going to walk away the descent of 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.280
 left where it counts what you have to 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:38.979
 I better not say at the moment you can and 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.350
 what equipment well enough assimilating 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.689
 assimilating fast what the teacher 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.420
 ask and I intend is that not that 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.100
 the party that we have the 10 then 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.840
 let's do what the teacher asks and I tell you and 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.350
 the results will go favoring 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:02:01.829
 from the beginning for us 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:01.829
