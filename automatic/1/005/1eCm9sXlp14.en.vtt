00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.639 

love<00:00:00.510> to<00:00:00.840> play

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:08.959 

so<00:00:07.649> I've<00:00:07.740> been<00:00:07.830> thinking<00:00:08.010> about<00:00:08.219> it<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.670> I

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:08.969 
so I've been thinking about it and I

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.180 
so I've been thinking about it and I
keep<00:00:09.180> calling<00:00:09.389> these<00:00:09.570> lessons<00:00:10.110> but<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.680> don't

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
keep calling these lessons but I don't

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.560 
keep calling these lessons but I don't
think<00:00:11.370> we<00:00:11.430> can<00:00:11.549> necessarily<00:00:12.120> call<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.510> a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
think we can necessarily call it a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.750 
think we can necessarily call it a
lesson<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:13.199> much<00:00:13.410> as<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.770> stage<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.459> skiing

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
lesson so much as a stage in skiing

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.420

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.500 
let them do what they're gonna do one of
the<00:03:12.070> things<00:03:12.130> that<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.490> did<00:03:12.670> not<00:03:12.820> realize<00:03:13.270> about

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
the things that I did not realize about

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.030 
the things that I did not realize about
when<00:03:13.870> she<00:03:14.050> went<00:03:14.200> into<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.470> trees

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
when she went into the trees

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.920 
when she went into the trees
she<00:03:15.430> doesn't<00:03:15.610> have<00:03:15.760> quite<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.150> speed<00:03:16.420> control

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
she doesn't have quite the speed control

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.410 
she doesn't have quite the speed control
so<00:03:17.470> she'll<00:03:17.710> go<00:03:17.830> really<00:03:18.190> fast<00:03:18.520> and<00:03:18.850> then<00:03:19.210> she'll

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
so she'll go really fast and then she'll

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.120 
so she'll go really fast and then she'll
suddenly<00:03:19.750> go<00:03:19.870> slow<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.440> stop<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.920> won't<00:03:21.040> be

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
suddenly go slow and stop and won't be

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.350 
suddenly go slow and stop and won't be
able<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.310> get<00:03:21.430> over<00:03:21.460> one<00:03:21.700> of<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.850> little<00:03:22.060> bumps

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
able to get over one of the little bumps

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.360 
able to get over one of the little bumps
problem<00:03:23.260> with<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:23.470> is<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.710> have<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.070> try<00:03:24.250> and

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
problem with that is you have to try and

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.040 
problem with that is you have to try and
get<00:03:24.490> in<00:03:24.640> there<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.390> have<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.630> try<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:25.930> get

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
get in there and you have to try and get

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.740 
get in there and you have to try and get
her<00:03:26.110> out<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.590> for<00:03:27.580> you<00:03:27.670> parents<00:03:27.940> once<00:03:28.600> they

her out so for you parents once they

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.870 
her out so for you parents once they
discover<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.260> trees<00:03:29.560> it's<00:03:30.160> gonna<00:03:30.280> be<00:03:30.490> a<00:03:30.520> ton

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
discover the trees it's gonna be a ton

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.570 
discover the trees it's gonna be a ton
of<00:03:30.910> work<00:03:31.210> for<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:32.160> exhausting<00:03:33.190> you're

turning<00:03:51.970> they're<00:03:52.300> just<00:03:52.510> doing<00:03:52.810> it

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.190 

lessons<00:04:12.080> are<00:04:12.319> very<00:04:12.880> important<00:04:13.880> when<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:14.690> speak

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
lessons are very important when I speak

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.810 
lessons are very important when I speak
when<00:04:15.860> I<00:04:16.010> speak

when I speak

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.259 
when I speak
they<00:04:17.030> always<00:04:17.359> make<00:04:17.959> it<00:04:18.139> right<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:18.769> turn<00:04:19.160> when<00:04:20.120> I

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
they always make it right to turn when I

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.580 
they always make it right to turn when I
turn<00:04:20.690> I<00:04:21.079> turn<00:04:21.550> every<00:04:22.550> day<00:04:22.840> so<00:04:23.840> that's<00:04:24.050> why<00:04:24.440> I<00:04:24.470> do

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
turn I turn every day so that's why I do

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.720 
turn I turn every day so that's why I do
that's<00:04:27.590> why<00:04:27.740> you<00:04:27.800> scheme<00:04:28.130> you<00:04:28.310> turn<00:04:28.520> out<00:04:28.700> that

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
that's why you scheme you turn out that

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:35.760 
that's why you scheme you turn out that
and<00:04:29.570> I<00:04:29.780> turn<00:04:30.080> after<00:04:30.550> everything<00:04:31.900> long<00:04:32.900> Alka

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.980 

couldn't<00:04:36.770> say<00:04:36.860> it<00:04:36.919> much<00:04:37.070> better<00:04:37.220> than<00:04:37.430> that

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
couldn't say it much better than that

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.710 
couldn't say it much better than that
