00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 servus romaniacs we are in novigrad 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.319
 and I want you one today 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.440
 relatively effective exploit in the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.179
 witcher 3 show with her in relative 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.130
 a short time a lot of coal bushel 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.420
 can 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.400
 the exploit works with the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.380
 current versions of the game so that 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.390
 means twenty-third fifth 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.430
 is could happen relatively quickly 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.869
 that the whole thing is fixed and whether he 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.369
 the whole uses is really you 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.140
 let that be the job 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.179
 I'm not a fan of such 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.130
 exploit to get money because 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.170
 in a sense, you deal with it a lot 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.579
 but I guess from the game 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.160
 Just show it to you like the whole 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.480
 expires who wants to use it and me 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.739
 I did not find the export myself 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.320
 but he is currently on the net like that 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.360
 bit the round 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.550
 good we are currently as already mentioned 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.050
 in novigrad i show it very short 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.449
 where exactly we are because we are at 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.510
 place of the lord and others also the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.699
 bank the armor schmid that's in the middle 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.010
 in the capital and here is one 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.809
 businessman in front of us and that is one 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.840
 bit the key to success grüß 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.840
 you 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:11.090
 shows me this merchant was long 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.649
 has a few clams of two kinds 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.479
 of which we see the front 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.040
 they will buy us now 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.689
 These shells are the promise of 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.310
 key to success that is us 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.880
 make us the inventory full 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.490
 or 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.490
 As far as coal as I have that special 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.470
 it now if we go back to 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.250
 starting point of the conversation and now 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.530
 select 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.049
 show me your true looks 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.810
 in fact so that the shells 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.450
 automatically stops that is the exploit 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.729
 that should not really be so is 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.399
 but that means you can do anything 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.319
 Frequently going back buys shells goes 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.440
 Buy back clams goes back 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.060
 bought mussels well what is coming now 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.810
 then in fact the magic of this 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.670
 exploits because we must now have a 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.220
 armor schmid search or any 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.060
 dealer of relatively much coal occupation 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.350
 there are actually the forge always 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.509
 especially helpful and gives here 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.810
 it is right at the place of the rich there 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.129
 An armor smith and be with that 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.470
 we speak now once and then you will 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.610
 you look like the coal almost on mine 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.610
 account flows 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.549
 first-class swords 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.920
 so what we do now is relative 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:27.250
 easy and we look at it 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.739
 were on and then switch to the branch 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.909
 to disassemble because these shells we 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.900
 We want to have bought now 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.480
 apart 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.390
 that costs us one piece of gold per shell 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.519
 we'll get that out of order 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.650
 pearls and black pearl and that are 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.120
 in fact the stuff this incredible 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.290
 valuable are in the game 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.940
 I have to do a little bit now 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.290
 restrained for the simple reason that 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.560
 I do not have any more money in my own right now 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.970
 but have to show and to bag 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.709
 demonstrate how it all works 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.230
 So a little money is enough for that 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.900
 because we are now this 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.849
 Pearls you see that sell here and 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.370
 suddenly we get a pearl 109 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.409
 gold pieces is a handsome sum 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.489
 or if we are considering for that 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:14.530
 shells paid seven gold pieces have 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.340
 Thus disassembled have one promotion each 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.680
 Goldstück draufgelegt yes to get 100 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.090
 So it already a lot had 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.049
 initially seen account we are both up 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.489
 gone over 1000 gold piece and yes what 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.900
 you ever look at the extra as well as you say 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.030
 take the exploit, so to speak, the 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.220
 bags full of shells goes to 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.560
 armor smith disassembles the stuff in 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.810
 pearls and black pearls and sold 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.000
 the problem with the matter is such 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.930
 of course, the dealer in limit 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.970
 we have already seen that 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.500
 armor smith s of just under 3000 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.299
 gold pieces down to just under 1,500 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.709
 gone and we'll see each other here 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.269
 black pearls are even one more 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.010
 I would all be a little more valuable now 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.560
 I now sell in the bag 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.060
 I would have over 3000 gold pieces 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.069
 The guy has so much coal 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.209
 just not but I think so 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.889
 demonstrates quite well what like violently 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.079
 this exploit is currently and i am 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:11.349
 I'm relatively sure that whole will be on 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:13.810
 short or long gefixed because it is already 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.250
 so a bit extreme so it redeemed 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.049
 would not be such a big problem though 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.120
 Do not stop the shell automatically 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.430
 because then you would just stop one 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.260
 certain number of it but get that way 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.900
 you can be hundreds of thousands 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.440
 grab the bag if 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.550
 the inventory gives it all up like you do 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.380
 could help you now by that 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.600
 The dealers do not own that much coal 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.539
 if you kneel down and you 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.090
 meditates for about five days looks like this 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.850
 from that the dealers 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.470
 about 50 percent of their original 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.639
 coal we restore meaning 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.650
 just have the armor schmid 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.180
 pretty blunt I sit down to me 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.949
 one we used five days has the 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.169
 probably around 2000 again 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.789
 gold in your pocket so you can do that 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.380
 you can also use traders 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.930
 Of course, starting a dealer is one thing 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.949
 possibility to get somewhere in the wental 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.520
 get rid of 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.990
 well you can see so easy in the 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.880
 make witcher 3 money 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.160
 I can only do it in person 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.419
 say again think about it 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.530
 It will certainly be used again 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.479
 fixed exploit 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.800
 that has no consequences for you because 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.820
 it makes my mistake in the game but you do 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.410
 you in my eyes just the 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.690
 game experience broke I wanted you 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:25.349
 Just show it around today 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.630
 demonstrate how it all works 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.190
 because you do not just because we see 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.340
 now with countless others in the 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.960
 but the course of the next days would see it 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.820
 you should just demonstrate 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.229
 I personally will not 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.630
 I make use of here for video 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:42.409
 Just because I do not remember where 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.669
 is still the meaning behind any 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:48.770
 lollipop orders against money too 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.770
 Do it if you did not have it
