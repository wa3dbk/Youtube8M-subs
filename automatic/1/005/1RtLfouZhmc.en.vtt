00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
were used to diagnose concussions

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.310 
were used to diagnose concussions
however<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.330> come<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.660> understand<00:01:16.110> that

however we have come to understand that
players<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:16.710> often<00:01:16.979> suffering<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> symptoms

visible signs symptoms are only

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.640 
visible signs symptoms are only
recognized<00:01:23.430> when<00:01:23.640> players<00:01:23.880> report<00:01:24.360> them

competitive<00:01:25.650> athletes<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> long<00:01:26.580> history

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
competitive athletes have a long history

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.120 
competitive athletes have a long history
of<00:01:27.119> not<00:01:27.300> reporting<00:01:27.660> their<00:01:27.960> symptoms<00:01:28.380> either

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
of not reporting their symptoms either

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.770 
of not reporting their symptoms either
because<00:01:29.490> they<00:01:29.670> don't<00:01:29.700> understand<00:01:30.360> them<00:01:30.540> or

because they don't understand them or

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.320 
because they don't understand them or
because<00:01:31.170> they<00:01:31.320> want<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> stay<00:01:31.830> on<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.070> field
