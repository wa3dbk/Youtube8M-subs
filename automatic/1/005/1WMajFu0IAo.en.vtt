 hello friends from the cell site and like next 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.110
 we're back with another video 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.719
 talking to the manager again 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.240
 from brazil's bank at sena agency 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.470
 Madureira is with her 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:23.670
 the bb credit vehicle in what form 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.970

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.890
 you have access to our client or who 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.579
 want to be our client has access to a 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.120
 car is the main advantage there 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.950
 is that in a wrong practical way we 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.379
 we have employees trained in 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.809
 agency is your mind in sena 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.809
 to address this issue 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.760
 then it is the fulfillment of the dream as you 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.160
 What our client wants to switch from 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.530
 car or stonemasons the first car to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.219
 now is through the financing of the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:07.409
 bb credit at a bank in Brazil 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.790
 relation to ipi how does it get much 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.010
 relevant to your question 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.030
 the important ipi reduction because this 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.759
 It is a course that is government ex 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.990
 tested seeing it did with the reduction to 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.409
 to make loans for movable and 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.040
 more accessible to the population with 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.600
 certain 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.640
 only that reduction of kissing the flag 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.630
 of the reduction it will return to the level 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.880
 normal 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.759
 as you can see the white line or 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.210
 buy home appliances refrigerator is 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.210
 hawk conditioning 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.909
 use the white line since it pointed to your 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.060
 normal year so ipi is no longer 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.890
 reduced and certainly the ipi of the 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.310
 movable and immovable property in the case of 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.000
 and it should be taken until the end of 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.070
 February 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.530
 so it 's time for you to get your 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.820
 car with reduction of ipi is a reduction 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.909
 significant 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.610
 depending on the vehicle model is a 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.780
 significant reduction and you there expertise 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.759
 the new car 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.399
 so the time is now it was until december 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.650
 this reduction has been extended until then 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.170
 in February but it will surely end 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.910
 and then the idea is that customers 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.390
 take advantage of this reduction is 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.650
 continuity to our interview is the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.980
 competitive tracks as they are 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.650
 very interesting to you know that there is a 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.450
 market after reducing rates made 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.420
 by the federal government for our 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.880
 President Dilma is is the rates of all 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.650
 the funds are reduced is what the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.410
 people call a competitive rate rate 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.690
 competitive rate is the rate you can 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.970
 make your customer continues with you in 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.150
 relation to the competition is and why

 in this product bb credit 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.930
 we have very competitive rates at 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.730
 from 0.77 percent per month 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.090
 then the customer will be able to buy his 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.049
 vehicle paying up to 60 months low 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.060
 from 0 77% per month on the basis 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:12.079
 depends on the relationship of the 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.810
 wand as to the products that the 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.720
