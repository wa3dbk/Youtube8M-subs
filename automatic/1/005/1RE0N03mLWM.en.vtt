00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.289 
over the printer on gas and we have to
kind<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.049> go<00:01:46.920> into<00:01:47.189> other<00:01:47.490> direction<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.149> look

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
kind of go into other direction to look

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.719 
kind of go into other direction to look

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
for these kind of compounds just a

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.790 
for these kind of compounds just a
little<00:01:51.030> bit<00:01:51.119> more<00:01:51.360> about<00:01:51.420> those<00:01:52.229> in

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
little bit more about those in

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.210 
little bit more about those in
you're<00:01:53.280> lost<00:01:54.110> yeah<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.320> said<00:01:55.620> we<00:01:56.010> always

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
you're lost yeah that said we always

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.550 
you're lost yeah that said we always
start<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:56.730> it<00:01:57.120> with<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> simple<00:01:58.260> interval
