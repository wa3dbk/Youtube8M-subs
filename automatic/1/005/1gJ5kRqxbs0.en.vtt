00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.150
 Y 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.980
 what happens people in this opportunity what 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.219
 what I bring is the boxing of the day 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.560
 s3 this is a phone that was very 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.689
 all right 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.890
 it has a 64-bit processor and I do not know 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.699
 if this is the first one box and in 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.359
 Spanish from this phone but really 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.710
 it's very very good ok let's go to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.040
 open it and let's see what it is that we 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.040
 offers 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.350
 on the phone I bought it in fast 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.090
 catec 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.530
 as always 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.530
 and I bought it when I was 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.260
 / 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.820
 but measured 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.820
 and an afternoon has arrived 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.720
 a month or so and since I bought it 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.370
 until it was put on sale in two 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.720
 weeks once he got in 20 the 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.720
 they sent it to me 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.540
 very good very good here we have it 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:35.270
 in the terminal of the phone is 5.5 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.910
 inch a 64-bit processor arrives 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.020
 as I said before is the last of the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:45.910
 last of mediatek you put 6 752 that goes 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.910
 to 1.7 gigahertz octa cores 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.299
 I have come a project of 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.299
 to the screen 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.010
 like everything 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.870
 the hostel with adapter 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.040
 we are missing as good 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.240
 supports the phone 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.160
 we have 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.160
 gift of a 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.730
 the cable cost more 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.310
 what suffered everything 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:46.590
 let's leave this for a side 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.590
 and we are going to what we are interested in is 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.590
 finish 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.440
 As you can see the phone is very 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.770
 well designed was very well 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.450
 it feels very good 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.860
 do not 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.860
 I'm talking about what 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.950
 in principle is to determine there are two 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.590
 versions one that is the basic version 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.930
 2 gigs of ram and the advanced version 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:21.409
 before it's 3 days worth it apart from 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.680
 that has a 3 rear camera 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.680
 megapixels 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.110
 two close as I said before 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.120
 5.5 inch full hd screen or the 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.569
 processor the last mediatek sun 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.959
 element of 675 2 oct chord that goes like 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.459
 to 1 7 gigahertz and is 64 bits this 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.459
 Phone supports 4 g 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.819
 support for you 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.910
 and it really reaches in high tests 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.459
 according to specifications it reaches 40 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.300
 thousand points would be more or less around 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:06.410
 to the s 5 so performance in what 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.180
 which is graphic power as I said and also 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.890
 to this we accompany the camera are and 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.180
 who carry 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.070
 which in theory is very good is still valid 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.810
 lack of this lack of evidence 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.810
 tell some guys 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.450
 of the world 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.350
 It has 22 led flash 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:37.420
 is very good according to what he puts in 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.409
 the specifications 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.369
 to see if it's true 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.369
 you never know 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:51.199
 It takes Android 4 points 4.4 and inside 

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:54.529
 nothing will be updated 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.529
 andros 5 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:17.790
 according 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.430
 let's do a study 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.620
 as you can see yes it has enough 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.540
 resolution still got there and the reduction 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.540
 it has practically lost almost nothing 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.790
 yes it is a very good camera 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.790
 It is a very good camera 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:41.750
 specifications not the basics itself 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:46.270
 we will make a more exhaustive review 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.270
 from this terminal on it 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.250
 in the reviews and nothing because this up 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:57.180
 here if you liked finishing in the 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:02.600
 Video broadcast as always 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.600
 nothing I say goodbye and see it in the other
