automatically makes that your default

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.970 
automatically makes that your default
item<00:02:51.659> so<00:02:52.049> you'll<00:02:52.140> be<00:02:52.230> driving<00:02:52.530> around<00:02:52.620> machine

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
gunning something and then you'll pick

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.610 
gunning something and then you'll pick
up<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.510> missile<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:54.930> accidentally<00:02:55.379> start

to<00:02:57.359> you<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.569> blow<00:02:57.689> your<00:02:57.810> car<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.680> driving

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
to you and blow your car the driving

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.460 
to you and blow your car the driving
itself<00:02:59.609> is<00:02:59.819> really<00:03:00.180> sloppy<00:03:00.569> this<00:03:00.900> isn't<00:03:01.349> a

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
itself is really sloppy this isn't a

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.680 
itself is really sloppy this isn't a
driving<00:03:01.950> game<00:03:02.159> but<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:02.579> also<00:03:02.730> not<00:03:03.000> an<00:03:03.180> action

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
driving game but it's also not an action

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.000 
driving game but it's also not an action
game<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.079> it<00:03:04.170> really<00:03:04.319> doesn't<00:03:04.500> know<00:03:04.680> what<00:03:04.709> it

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
game so it really doesn't know what it

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.770 
game so it really doesn't know what it
wants<00:03:05.159> to<00:03:05.459> be<00:03:05.639> if<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:06.329> ever<00:03:06.480> run<00:03:06.720> into

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780

wants to be if you ever run into
something<00:03:07.409> or<00:03:07.530> hit<00:03:07.650> another<00:03:07.829> car<00:03:08.129> and<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.519> in

something or hit another car and to in
stop<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.510> literally<00:03:09.989> takes<00:03:10.409> several<00:03:10.769> seconds

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
stop it literally takes several seconds

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.309 
stop it literally takes several seconds
to<00:03:11.519> just<00:03:11.730> start<00:03:12.000> your<00:03:12.180> car<00:03:12.389> moving<00:03:12.750> again<00:03:13.049> so

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
to just start your car moving again so

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.020 
to just start your car moving again so
when<00:03:13.769> enemies<00:03:14.069> run<00:03:14.310> into<00:03:14.579> you<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.879> want

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
when enemies run into you and you want

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.460 
when enemies run into you and you want
to<00:03:15.090> blow<00:03:15.239> them<00:03:15.389> up<00:03:15.540> with<00:03:15.689> a<00:03:15.720> missile<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.290> have

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
to blow them up with a missile you have

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.979 
to blow them up with a missile you have
to<00:03:16.680> back<00:03:17.400> up<00:03:17.430> which<00:03:17.970> takes<00:03:18.299> quite<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.780> bit<00:03:18.870> of

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
to back up which takes quite a bit of

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.420 
to back up which takes quite a bit of
time<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.470> then<00:03:19.560> try<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.769> shoot<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.069> missile<00:03:20.189> at

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
time and then try to shoot a missile at

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.520 
time and then try to shoot a missile at
them<00:03:20.609> from<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.849> distance<00:03:21.090> but<00:03:21.720> it's<00:03:22.139> just<00:03:22.260> all

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
them from a distance but it's just all

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.039 
them from a distance but it's just all
very<00:03:22.859> clumsy<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.730> in<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.209> end<00:03:24.359> it's<00:03:24.540> not<00:03:24.629> fun

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
very clumsy and in the end it's not fun

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.899 
very clumsy and in the end it's not fun
maybe<00:03:25.799> if<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.099> got<00:03:26.250> this<00:03:26.400> game<00:03:26.609> when<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.879> were

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
maybe if you got this game when you were

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.789 
maybe if you got this game when you were
a<00:03:27.000> kid<00:03:27.269> you'd<00:03:27.689> look<00:03:27.930> past<00:03:28.170> all<00:03:28.379> of<00:03:28.439> this<00:03:28.620> and

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
a kid you'd look past all of this and

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.020 
a kid you'd look past all of this and
probably<00:03:28.950> had<00:03:29.159> a<00:03:29.189> great<00:03:29.400> time<00:03:29.549> playing<00:03:29.760> it

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
probably had a great time playing it

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:38.330 
probably had a great time playing it
because<00:03:30.269> conceptually<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:31.349> terrific

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.620 

conceptually<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.670> game<00:03:39.940> is<00:03:40.090> right<00:03:40.270> up<00:03:40.450> there

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
conceptually this game is right up there

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.860 
conceptually this game is right up there
