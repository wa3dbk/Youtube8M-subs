do<00:02:23.780> well<00:02:24.080> on<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.770> wire<00:02:25.010> rack<00:02:25.040> for<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.760> water

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
do well on the wire rack for the water

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.470 
do well on the wire rack for the water
bath<00:02:26.209> canner<00:02:26.800> they<00:02:27.800> wobble<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:29.030> fall<00:02:29.450> over

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
bath canner they wobble and fall over

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.979 
bath canner they wobble and fall over
too<00:02:30.260> easily<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.250> use<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.970> rack<00:02:32.239> from<00:02:32.630> my

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
too easily so I use the rack from my

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.540 
too easily so I use the rack from my
pressure<00:02:33.500> canner<00:02:33.920> instead<00:02:36.040> one<00:02:37.040> thing<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.519> I

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
pressure canner instead one thing that I

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.400 
pressure canner instead one thing that I
didn't<00:02:37.970> anticipate<00:02:38.330> when<00:02:38.900> about<00:02:39.140> these

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
didn't anticipate when about these

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.430 
didn't anticipate when about these
bottles<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.160> their<00:02:40.850> height<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.510> they<00:02:42.260> are<00:02:42.410> a

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
juice out of these apples and then I had

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.150 
juice out of these apples and then I had
enough<00:03:29.450> for<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.840> little<00:03:30.140> more<00:03:30.410> than<00:03:30.650> half<00:03:30.950> a

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160

bottle<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:32.209> bottle<00:03:32.269> I<00:03:33.109> didn't<00:03:33.680> water<00:03:34.070> bath

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
bottle that bottle I didn't water bath

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.699 
bottle that bottle I didn't water bath
at<00:03:34.730> all<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:35.180> wanted<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.540> see<00:03:35.840> if<00:03:36.019> it<00:03:36.200> would<00:03:36.350> seal

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
at all I wanted to see if it would seal

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.870 
at all I wanted to see if it would seal
with<00:03:37.870> just<00:03:38.870> putting<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.799> lid<00:03:40.010> on<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.579> let<00:03:40.670> it

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
way they tell you to do it for juices

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.830 
way they tell you to do it for juices
they<00:03:45.590> say<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:46.070> you<00:03:46.190> don't<00:03:46.340> have<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:47.030> water

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840

they say that you don't have to water
bath<00:03:48.140> juice<00:03:48.590> you<00:03:48.829> can<00:03:48.859> just<00:03:49.220> take<00:03:49.549> it<00:03:49.579> directly

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
bath juice you can just take it directly

as for me I feel better water bath in it

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.319 
as for me I feel better water bath in it
but<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.829> bottle<00:04:01.280> even<00:04:01.549> though<00:04:01.880> it<00:04:02.030> was<00:04:02.150> only

but that bottle even though it was only

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:08.110 
but that bottle even though it was only
half<00:04:02.630> full<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:04.010> sealed<00:04:06.370> since<00:04:07.370> these<00:04:07.640> bottle

half full it sealed since these bottle
lids<00:04:08.420> don't<00:04:08.810> have<00:04:09.049> one<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.350> those<00:04:09.470> pop<00:04:10.370> up

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
lids don't have one of those pop up

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.550 
lids don't have one of those pop up
buttons<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:11.750> that<00:04:11.900> you<00:04:12.019> can<00:04:12.140> tell<00:04:12.319> if<00:04:12.470> it's

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
buttons so that you can tell if it's

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.070 
buttons so that you can tell if it's
sealed<00:04:12.890> or<00:04:13.099> not<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.550> few<00:04:14.209> minutes<00:04:14.510> after<00:04:14.870> I<00:04:14.900> took

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
sealed or not a few minutes after I took

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.300 
sealed or not a few minutes after I took
the<00:04:15.739> bottles<00:04:16.669> out<00:04:16.820> of<00:04:17.000> the

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
the bottles out of the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.789 
the bottles out of the
an<00:04:17.430> or<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:17.730> occurred<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.060> me<00:04:18.389> that<00:04:18.680> since<00:04:19.680> it

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
an or it occurred to me that since it

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.620 
an or it occurred to me that since it
would<00:04:19.919> be<00:04:20.010> difficult<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.669> see<00:04:20.940> with<00:04:21.209> your<00:04:21.359> eyes

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
would be difficult to see with your eyes

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.650 
would be difficult to see with your eyes
if<00:04:22.079> I<00:04:22.800> could<00:04:23.040> lay<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.430> knife<00:04:23.730> across<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.450> top

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
if I could lay a knife across the top

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.980 
if I could lay a knife across the top
and<00:04:24.960> see<00:04:25.169> if<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.919> lid<00:04:26.610> was<00:04:26.880> flushed<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.510> then

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
and see if the lid was flushed and then

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.450 
and see if the lid was flushed and then
hopefully<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:28.800> would<00:04:28.919> become<00:04:29.310> concave<00:04:29.970> as<00:04:30.270> it

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
hopefully it would become concave as it

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.940 
hopefully it would become concave as it
as<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.550> vacuum<00:04:32.880> was<00:04:33.180> formed<00:04:33.750> then<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.620> would<00:04:34.830> be

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
as a vacuum was formed then I would be

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.000 
as a vacuum was formed then I would be
able<00:04:35.100> to<00:04:35.190> tell<00:04:35.430> whether<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:36.090> sealed<00:04:36.480> or<00:04:36.690> not<00:04:37.010> so

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
able to tell whether it sealed or not so

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.070 
able to tell whether it sealed or not so
I<00:04:38.040> laid<00:04:38.400> a<00:04:38.430> knife<00:04:38.880> across<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.600> top<00:04:39.780> of<00:04:39.810> the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
I laid a knife across the top of the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.030 
I laid a knife across the top of the
bottles<00:04:41.840> of<00:04:42.840> course<00:04:43.169> something<00:04:43.650> went<00:04:43.830> wrong

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
bottles of course something went wrong

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.370 
bottles of course something went wrong
with<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:44.340> video<00:04:44.850> where<00:04:45.480> they<00:04:45.810> had<00:04:45.960> completely

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
with the video where they had completely

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.830 
since I have a product called clear gel
I<00:05:29.850> decided<00:05:30.539> to<00:05:32.000> change<00:05:33.000> up<00:05:33.180> the<00:05:33.330> recipe<00:05:33.810> a

I<00:05:44.440> set<00:05:45.440> the<00:05:45.590> juice<00:05:45.830> aside<00:05:46.250> to<00:05:46.460> pull<00:05:46.729> then<00:05:47.240> I

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
I set the juice aside to pull then I

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.629 
I set the juice aside to pull then I
mixed<00:05:47.720> together<00:05:47.889> three<00:05:48.889> cups<00:05:49.190> of<00:05:49.400> sugar

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
instead of the five cups that the recipe

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.620 
instead of the five cups that the recipe
calls<00:05:52.250> for<00:05:52.479> half<00:05:53.479> a<00:05:53.720> cup<00:05:53.960> of<00:05:54.490> clear<00:05:55.490> gel<00:05:55.630> four

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
and a quarter cup of lemon juice then I

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.620 
and a quarter cup of lemon juice then I
added<00:06:03.500> the<00:06:03.620> apple<00:06:03.979> juice<00:06:04.190> and<00:06:04.520> heated<00:06:05.360> the

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
added the apple juice and heated the

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.670 
added the apple juice and heated the
syrup<00:06:06.849> staring<00:06:07.849> constantly<00:06:08.539> until<00:06:09.349> it<00:06:09.530> came

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
syrup staring constantly until it came

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.909 
syrup staring constantly until it came
to<00:06:09.740> a<00:06:09.919> boil<00:06:10.280> at<00:06:10.759> that<00:06:11.030> point<00:06:11.449> I<00:06:11.750> thought<00:06:12.590> it

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
to a boil at that point I thought it

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:14.589 
to a boil at that point I thought it
needed<00:06:13.039> a<00:06:13.280> little<00:06:13.400> more<00:06:13.639> clear<00:06:14.000> gel<00:06:14.270> so<00:06:14.539> I

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
needed a little more clear gel so I

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:16.719 
needed a little more clear gel so I
mixed<00:06:14.960> together<00:06:15.080> three<00:06:15.740> tablespoons<00:06:16.430> of

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
mixed together three tablespoons of

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.029 
mixed together three tablespoons of
clear<00:06:17.030> gel<00:06:17.060> with<00:06:17.570> a<00:06:17.599> little<00:06:17.960> water<00:06:18.169> and<00:06:18.470> I

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
clear gel with a little water and I

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.680 
clear gel with a little water and I
added<00:06:19.280> that<00:06:19.699> to<00:06:19.940> the<00:06:20.150> pot<00:06:22.270> when<00:06:23.270> it<00:06:23.419> reached

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
added that to the pot when it reached

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.230 
added that to the pot when it reached
the<00:06:23.960> consistency<00:06:24.169> of<00:06:25.070> a<00:06:25.370> syrup

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
the consistency of a syrup

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.600 
the consistency of a syrup
I<00:06:26.270> started<00:06:27.169> bottling<00:06:27.349> it<00:06:27.860> and<00:06:28.070> I<00:06:28.250> did<00:06:28.430> it<00:06:28.520> the

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
I started bottling it and I did it the

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.260 
I started bottling it and I did it the
same<00:06:28.849> way<00:06:29.060> I<00:06:29.090> did<00:06:29.240> with<00:06:29.539> the<00:06:29.690> apple<00:06:29.960> juice<00:06:30.199> I

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
same way I did with the apple juice I

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.150 
same way I did with the apple juice I
left<00:06:32.270> the<00:06:32.449> quarter-inch<00:06:32.840> headspace<00:06:33.680> and<00:06:34.009> I

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
left the quarter-inch headspace and I

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.210 
left the quarter-inch headspace and I
set<00:06:34.430> the<00:06:34.580> bottles<00:06:35.000> aside<00:06:35.509> on<00:06:35.840> a<00:06:35.870> towel<00:06:36.320> until<00:06:37.009> I

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
set the bottles aside on a towel until I

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.180 
set the bottles aside on a towel until I
had<00:06:37.550> them<00:06:37.759> all<00:06:37.940> full<00:06:38.330> because<00:06:38.810> I<00:06:39.020> found<00:06:39.349> that<00:06:39.560> a

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
had them all full because I found that a

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.149 
had them all full because I found that a
long<00:06:41.060> exposure<00:06:41.509> to<00:06:42.020> a<00:06:42.380> less<00:06:42.710> than<00:06:42.740> boiling

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159 
long exposure to a less than boiling

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.309 
long exposure to a less than boiling
temperature<00:06:43.759> with<00:06:43.909> clear<00:06:44.240> gel<00:06:44.270> ends<00:06:45.050> up<00:06:45.169> with

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 
temperature with clear gel ends up with

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:53.100 
temperature with clear gel ends up with
a<00:06:45.349> very<00:06:45.710> runny<00:06:46.210> texture

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.690 

then<00:06:54.110> I<00:06:54.230> put<00:06:54.470> them<00:06:54.620> in<00:06:54.800> the<00:06:54.890> water<00:06:55.040> bath<00:06:55.310> canner

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 
then I put them in the water bath canner

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:05.980 
then I put them in the water bath canner
and<00:06:55.850> process<00:06:56.600> them<00:06:56.870> for<00:06:57.200> 10<00:06:57.440> minutes

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.839 

when<00:07:06.990> the<00:07:07.139> processing<00:07:07.830> was<00:07:08.009> complete<00:07:08.520> I

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:08.849 
when the processing was complete I

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:11.839 
when the processing was complete I
turned<00:07:09.270> off<00:07:09.479> the<00:07:09.719> heat<00:07:09.990> remove<00:07:10.379> the<00:07:11.039> lid<00:07:11.249> let

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:11.849 
turned off the heat remove the lid let

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:13.549 
turned off the heat remove the lid let
it<00:07:11.999> sit<00:07:12.209> for<00:07:12.389> five<00:07:12.569> minutes<00:07:12.869> and<00:07:13.229> then<00:07:13.289> I

00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:13.559 
it sit for five minutes and then I

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:15.980 
it sit for five minutes and then I
removed<00:07:13.949> the<00:07:14.129> bottles<00:07:14.580> put<00:07:14.999> them<00:07:15.149> on<00:07:15.389> the

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
counter on a towel to cool this time I

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.859 
counter on a towel to cool this time I
check<00:07:21.689> the<00:07:21.869> lids<00:07:22.139> with<00:07:22.559> my<00:07:22.800> knife<00:07:23.069> method

00:07:23.859 --> 00:07:23.869 
check the lids with my knife method

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:26.089 
check the lids with my knife method
immediately<00:07:24.869> after<00:07:25.139> they<00:07:25.289> came<00:07:25.499> out<00:07:25.679> of<00:07:25.800> a<00:07:25.889> pot

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:26.099

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:27.980 
immediately after they came out of a pot
and<00:07:26.279> I<00:07:26.369> found<00:07:26.639> that<00:07:26.819> the<00:07:27.029> lids<00:07:27.330> are<00:07:27.509> actually

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:27.990 
and I found that the lids are actually

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.469 
and I found that the lids are actually
bowed<00:07:28.319> upwards<00:07:29.099> when<00:07:29.789> they<00:07:29.879> first<00:07:30.089> come<00:07:30.300> out

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 
bowed upwards when they first come out

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:32.959 
bowed upwards when they first come out
of<00:07:30.569> the<00:07:30.659> pot<00:07:30.839> and<00:07:31.080> then<00:07:31.199> they<00:07:31.589> do<00:07:31.649> cool<00:07:32.610> and

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:32.969 
of the pot and then they do cool and

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:39.049 
of the pot and then they do cool and
become<00:07:33.569> concave<00:07:33.959> I<00:07:36.619> ended<00:07:37.619> up<00:07:37.770> with<00:07:38.129> eight<00:07:38.459> 12

00:07:39.049 --> 00:07:39.059 
become concave I ended up with eight 12

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:43.579 
become concave I ended up with eight 12
