00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 it is not that terribly long yet 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.859
 ago that I remain ex from lego like 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.930
 in front of the camera and already has 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.330
 Lego was determined but sometimes it was still 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.580
 a series the simpsons at least this time 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.759
 did they come up with the idea 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.529
 All characters have original heads 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.010
 which do not form in the typical lego 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.230
 are and the wildly nice idea 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.050
 of course I have a problem of mine 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.240
 Not one of the 25 stakes of the simpsons 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.070
 seen only minute because I was the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.119
 sims are not at all yet 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.710
 interested I see in 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.770
 general no cartoon series 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.420
 if whole house farc to the simpsons 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.460
 I simply have no accordingly 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.730
 What's a pity, I know about 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.040
 what chooses that 's all because of that 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.200
 I look at the figures for quality and 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.690
 Rate look the figures as very 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.430
 Not sure if they are somehow 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.350
 what to do with the series that knows 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.559
 not me 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.550
 In any case, what should bring something 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:21.119
 diego be in it 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:22.080
 share cutters already rare 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.320
 but they actually have one 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.680
 guide to what to do with it 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.420
 nice idea that's probably the one 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:39.060
 daughter if I see that right only 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:40.500
 what is this thing okay for me 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.479
 again I'm just together yes 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.509
 okay that's a really funny one 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.369
 idea though the little gown what you 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.869
 Anhat was the biggest groping was what I was 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.579
 until now had a lego figure 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.380
 that does not fit all right 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.780
 together in particular the holes 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.259
 but clearly to small cars but with one 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.500
 little formula 1 is doing well as well 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.310
 one expects the non-standard head 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.030
 fits very well 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.190
 the eyes a bit, yes, but blah 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.539
 God probably is that and that 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.099
 one does not like the saxophone that 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.330
 to say something completely different 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.950
 seems like the typical lego figures 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.570
 somehow always looks a bit strange 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.820
 but please, we do not want to go that way 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:31.950
 can be with what all good things 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:50.110
 Two again, okay, that's the rubber 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:52.900
 smells of rubber the head was that 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.280
 looks so interesting I do not have 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.180
 the slightest idea who it is 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.640
 Maybe somebody can do that for me 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.170
 say I do not have to stagger 25 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.050
 just look a fig the 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.290
 probably only on the edge occurs 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.900
 out 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.660
 but otherwise it is done properly 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.250
 and the head she really great osman good 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.170
 that it's made of rubber, it's just fine 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.760
 atypical but rather for dear figure 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.200
 he in the world and have typical and 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.890
 dirk niebel just looks awesome 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.660
 And he pointed that that too 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.650
 owe figures that come naturally 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.880
 on the shelf 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.739
 but I do not have any now 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.350
 only lego figure just thrown away 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.640
 also quality has absolutely yes 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.150
 but that also made it here 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.640
 lego simpsons wonderful thing now in 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.910
 I would say something like that to everyone 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.910
