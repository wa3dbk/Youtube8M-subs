00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.620
 hello to all these two years 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.080
 max 2001 on the site millionaire monnet 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:30.439
 so this is a site that will allow you 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.660
 to buy to buy on the net of 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.800
 software that are paying is in 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.730
 somehow to buy them 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.800
 for free so of course I will put the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.430
 link from this site in the description of 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.199
 the video then explains to you how that 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.239
 market 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.910
 it's a site that suggests losing 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.629
 they lose there are an amount 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.600
 in euros 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.590
 so to eat it 105 thousand pearls and 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.860
 g1 jagu 31 905 million correspond to 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.200
 an elected 31 year old their thirty- one clip to 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.000
 me then I will explain 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.550
 now how to win these famous 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.810
 beads and how to transfer them on 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.880
 time this on bank accounts or 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.539
 others to be able to buy the games or 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.009
 software on the net so here it's 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.810
 simple he wrote played for 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.210
 pearls time the headband left or 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.890
 playing not to lose 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:29.000
 I started at the bottom so there are the 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.010
 paid games and I pay years and tears 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.049
 do not try to understand you're not going 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.840
 not on it 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.890
 above there are the quizzes so 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.920
 it's quite complicated you have to pay a 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.380
 number of pairs so here it's 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.549
 fifty thousand pearls 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:52.040
 you have to pay them and then you put 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.030
 the north of the question how much of 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.549
 adhesive customers 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.920
 it is there in this picture how small 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.400
 sticky 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.040
 so it's pretty complicated 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.270
 often you pay 50 thousand beads for 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.740
 nothing so here on the other hand if you 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.960
 win you win 5 million pairs 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.110
 so here we are, little guy 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.260
 advantage and it must be ensured that 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.580
 you do not know if that's where this 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.840
 those accompanied by this or that has 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.120
 complicated for me to play sometimes 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.670
 think times it's things 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.300
 obvious but one most often 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.410
 it's very difficult very difficult 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.440
 then there are the games so you can 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.569
 do this time it's all free 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.519
 the games there it's free oh 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.719
 from everywhere so people would have had 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.019
 no worries to you do you can 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.959
 to play 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.269
 if on the other hand you can make one 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.709
 alone by day so you can play and 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.540
 for example ah if I'm going to replay I do not 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.749
 could not have already played 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.370
 free today for free 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:59.829
 so the next part is paying the 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.939
 I prefer to keep my pearls 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.879
 knowing that I will not necessarily win 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:09.370
 that's after there is scratching so he 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.950
 to buy a carton of scraping and 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.209
 scratching you have to buy a carton of 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.500
 scratching who you can win or not 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.769
 good personally I do not like it too much 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.049
 scratching who play and sometimes 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:27.129
 it's not very profitable and then there is 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:31.819
 the bingo so c 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:35.390
 look at playing bingo on you have a 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.430
 free bengo cardboard at the very beginning and 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:44.870
 according to the number that arrives by 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:52.819
 example the 17th julie 4 here 35 I did not 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:04:00.379
 not say that the 52 25 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:02.030
 yes I have them 45 no it's not so 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:06.079
 there depending on the number of days that 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.569
 you were going twingo and well you are going 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:11.030
 keep your own box and as you go 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.680
 measure days and days 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.769
 when you have filled the created conflict 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:20.690
 on this little button and you will win 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.880
 so the sum of 16 million pearls 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.750
 or 200 euros 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:29.570
 it's still pretty good so with 200 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.180
 breaststroke and many said he was ready 200 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.190
 euros you can buy a mac is 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.920
