00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.990
 hello today I'm going to show you how to draw 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.990
 squid pencil to step by step 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:17.370
 first we draw the ovals for the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.370
 eyes and a big nose in the shape of a drop 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.329
 we draw a straight line in the middle of 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.329
 the eyes to form the eyelids 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.980
 under the eyelid we create two small 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.980
 ellipses for the pupils 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.380
 we draw our eyebrows 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.510
 now we want the head of calamardo 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.510
 with the shape of a light bulb 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.030
 we review all the lines 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.200
 now we will paint the eyebrows and the pupils 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.200
 in black 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.810
 and it is already 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.480
 as you will see is a very simple drawing of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.480
 do and that looks very good
