00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.090
 take place in the industry park

 races that will be present in the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.500
 livestock exposure are the gyr breeds and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.779
 rolling which for its great capacity 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.240
 to produce milk in conditions 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.189
 adverse tropical are taking every 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.189
 day more boom and importance 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.840
 an important event where we will have a 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.900
 representation more or less than 70 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.390
 animals of both the gyr race and 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.210
 girona but the most special part of the event 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.970
 it will be that we have participation by 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.699
 the first time of the qualification of 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.100
 Ireland by a technician who sends us to 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:54.090
 the association of going hello from Brazil 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.730
 this technician is responsible for the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.580
 research or breed techniques and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.690
 will dictate the keynote address 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.229
 within the congress that we have 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.170
 planned for that date one of the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.720
 special attributes of the jeep is its 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.930
 prospecting to produce milk in a 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.340
 very tropical climate or where the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.500
 other dairy breeds have had 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.780
 cheap problems to manifest themselves in 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.979
 this sense then you have a race 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.100
 pure segureÃ±a that has a history of 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.500
 many thousands of years 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.360
 of the development of the race from 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.270
 Geneticists work they did 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.700
 Brazilians also consolidated the race 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.759
 and rolling that thanks to this race that is 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.350
 the crossing between gene and holstein 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.090
 Brazil has become today 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.039
 an exporter of the current 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.799
 the ice contributes to the race and rolling therefore 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.740
 his ability to withstand the weather and 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.100
 ectoparasites in the tropical area of 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.649
 Central America made a documentary of my 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.270
 agricultural farm in mouth in October 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.950
 of 2013 and it's a very pleasant surprise 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.610
 because today the documentary takes 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.060
 more approximately 95 thousand visits 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.880
 that means that the documentary has 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.269
 had an average of 10,000 visits per 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.000
 month are many visits that of some 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.459
 way because it shows the interest that the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.010
 race has in the middle of livestock 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.379
 international, I invite all 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.450
 ranchers nationwide to 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.090
 participate in this event and also 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.160
 invite livestock and in general to 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.370
 public in general since our 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:42.000
 slogan in this event is the field well 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.980
 in the city is the element is with 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.100
 many activities we have -ha 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.160
 we have different conferences we have the 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.750
 national queen 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.320
 and multiple activities that go 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.790
 to enhance our activity that 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.220
 today I think it's going to turn 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.340
 in livestock and more important fair 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.340
 wrong
