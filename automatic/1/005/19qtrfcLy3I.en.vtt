it<00:02:22.609> just<00:02:22.700> kind<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.060> visualize<00:02:23.359> where<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:23.629> want

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780

to<00:02:23.810> put<00:02:23.930> everything<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.469> guess<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:26.260> this<00:02:27.260> is

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
to put everything I guess and this is

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.830 
to put everything I guess and this is
carefully<00:02:27.920> sprinkle<00:02:28.400> this<00:02:28.519> stuff<00:02:28.790> out<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.810> I

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
carefully sprinkle this stuff out so I

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.339 
carefully sprinkle this stuff out so I
cut<00:02:33.439> it<00:02:33.530> up<00:02:33.709> no<00:02:34.519> get<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.819> in<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.180> big<00:02:35.359> spot<00:02:35.959> one

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
cut it up no get it in a big spot one

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:56.680 
cut it up no get it in a big spot one
area

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
no little plot of grass and then we do

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.650 
no little plot of grass and then we do
you<00:03:04.080> get<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.350> wet<00:03:04.530> water<00:03:05.300> all<00:03:06.300> right<00:03:06.450> did<00:03:06.600> I

you get the wet water all right did I

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.180 
you get the wet water all right did I
jumps<00:03:06.870> print<00:03:07.140> directly<00:03:07.620> i<00:03:07.710> do<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.920> kind<00:03:08.130> of

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
jumps print directly i do I kind of

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.230 
jumps print directly i do I kind of
spray<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.520> kind<00:03:09.270> of<00:03:09.300> up<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:10.100> not<00:03:11.100> really<00:03:11.250> but

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
spray it kind of up and not really but

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.510 
spray it kind of up and not really but
so<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.570> lands<00:03:12.930> on<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.380> way<00:03:13.530> it

is<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.210> see<00:03:36.360> instant<00:03:36.630> like<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:36.870> blade<00:03:37.050> waste

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
is to see instant like this blade waste

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.320 
is to see instant like this blade waste
a<00:03:37.380> lot<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.530> six<00:03:37.740> men<00:03:37.980> but<00:03:38.700> if<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.850> spray<00:03:39.180> this

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
a lot of six men but if you spray this

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.010 
a lot of six men but if you spray this
on<00:03:39.510> before<00:03:40.250> like<00:03:41.250> this<00:03:41.430> i<00:03:41.760> have<00:03:42.540> just<00:03:42.690> sit<00:03:42.930> in

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
on before like this i have just sit in

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.550 
on before like this i have just sit in
there<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.410> will<00:03:43.470> hold<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.740> on<00:03:44.300> experiment<00:03:45.560> more

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
there it will hold it on experiment more

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.380 
there it will hold it on experiment more
directly<00:03:46.950> at<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.550> then<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.880> doesn't<00:03:48.150> waste

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
directly at it and then it doesn't waste

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.000 
directly at it and then it doesn't waste
as<00:03:48.570> much<00:03:51.290> now<00:03:52.290> it's<00:03:52.470> all<00:03:52.620> wet<00:03:52.830> you<00:03:52.980> can

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
as much now it's all wet you can

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.580 
as much now it's all wet you can
actually<00:03:53.340> spread<00:03:53.580> this<00:03:53.730> more<00:03:53.940> directly<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.590> it

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
actually spread this more directly to it

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.340 
actually spread this more directly to it
won't<00:03:55.830> move<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.840> move<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.900> little<00:03:58.020> bit<00:03:58.110> i<00:03:58.230> guess

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
won't move it move a little bit i guess

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.610 
won't move it move a little bit i guess
if<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.560> spray<00:03:58.770> too<00:03:58.980> close<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:01.230> then<00:04:01.350> after

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
if you spray too close and then after

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.200 
if you spray too close and then after
that<00:04:03.170> you<00:04:04.170> spray<00:04:05.040> on<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.280> st.<00:04:05.490> somewhere<00:04:05.790> it's

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
that you spray on the st. somewhere it's

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.330 
that you spray on the st. somewhere it's
make<00:04:06.360> sure<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:07.080> kind<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.500> turns<00:04:07.650> at<00:04:07.770> YC<00:04:08.160> know

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
make sure it kind of turns at YC know

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:18.610 
make sure it kind of turns at YC know
where<00:04:08.490> you've<00:04:08.580> gone<00:04:08.760> it's<00:04:09.180> kind<00:04:09.390> of<00:04:09.420> nice<00:04:11.630> so

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.800 

now<00:04:19.620> if<00:04:19.770> you<00:04:19.859> need<00:04:20.010> any<00:04:20.160> more<00:04:20.310> just<00:04:20.460> put<00:04:20.810> more

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
now if you need any more just put more

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.790 
now if you need any more just put more
grass<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.380> spread<00:04:22.650> in<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:24.270> grass<00:04:24.450> shoots<00:04:24.800> see

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
grass and spread in the grass shoots see

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.630 
grass and spread in the grass shoots see
i<00:04:25.830> think<00:04:26.100> i<00:04:26.160> miss<00:04:26.550> this<00:04:26.640> little<00:04:26.820> spot<00:04:27.090> so<00:04:27.360> I

i think i miss this little spot so I

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.140 
i think i miss this little spot so I
step<00:04:29.780> we<00:04:30.780> don't<00:04:31.020> know<00:04:31.110> if<00:04:31.170> you<00:04:31.260> see<00:04:31.440> or<00:04:31.530> not<00:04:32.150> how

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
does that put a little bit to cover it

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.749 
does that put a little bit to cover it
up

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
up

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:44.240 
up

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
and then now it's pat is covered on this

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.820 
and then now it's pat is covered on this
rating<00:04:44.699> is<00:04:44.819> good<00:04:45.830> and<00:04:46.830> what<00:04:47.099> pushes<00:04:47.490> bushes

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830

normal<00:05:28.710> blue<00:05:28.889> this<00:05:29.430> is<00:05:29.639> why<00:05:29.759> wasn't<00:05:30.240> it<00:05:30.449> work

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
normal blue this is why wasn't it work

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.230 
normal blue this is why wasn't it work
so<00:05:32.539> and<00:05:33.539> then<00:05:33.719> he's<00:05:34.710> let<00:05:34.860> that<00:05:35.009> dry<00:05:35.250> for<00:05:35.279> the

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
so and then he's let that dry for the

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.350 
so and then he's let that dry for the
day<00:05:36.449> I<00:05:36.479> guess<00:05:37.159> the<00:05:38.159> grass<00:05:38.550> with<00:05:38.759> it<00:05:38.939> wouldn't

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
day I guess the grass with it wouldn't

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.300 
day I guess the grass with it wouldn't
take<00:05:39.479> all<00:05:39.599> that<00:05:39.689> long<00:05:39.750> to<00:05:39.990> dry<00:05:40.229> the<00:05:40.919> grass<00:05:41.129> is

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
take all that long to dry the grass is

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.430 
take all that long to dry the grass is
dry<00:05:41.460> and<00:05:41.819> did<00:05:42.539> seem<00:05:42.779> like<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:42.990> bushes<00:05:43.289> were

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
dry and did seem like the bushes were

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.769 
dry and did seem like the bushes were
attached<00:05:43.770> at<00:05:43.979> all<00:05:44.159> I<00:05:44.400> look<00:05:44.669> like<00:05:44.789> they're<00:05:45.000> they

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:45.779 
attached at all I look like they're they

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.730 
attached at all I look like they're they
weren't<00:05:46.050> sticking<00:05:47.120> but<00:05:48.120> then<00:05:48.300> I<00:05:48.599> just<00:05:49.500> kept

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
weren't sticking but then I just kept

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.640 
weren't sticking but then I just kept
going<00:05:49.979> I<00:05:50.219> selected<00:05:51.000> there<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.930> eventually

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
going I selected there and eventually

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.260 
going I selected there and eventually
have<00:05:53.069> to<00:05:53.099> like<00:05:53.310> a<00:05:53.339> day<00:05:53.550> or<00:05:53.580> two<00:05:53.819> it<00:05:53.969> was

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
have to like a day or two it was

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.510 
have to like a day or two it was
sticking<00:05:54.750> to<00:05:54.900> it<00:05:55.039> so<00:05:56.039> I<00:05:56.069> guess<00:05:56.159> this<00:05:56.310> wasn't

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
sticking to it so I guess this wasn't

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.969 
sticking to it so I guess this wasn't
dry<00:05:56.789> yet<00:05:57.319> so<00:05:58.319> yes<00:05:58.440> here's<00:05:58.650> a<00:05:58.680> little<00:05:58.860> ghost

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
dry yet so yes here's a little ghost

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:08.890 
dry yet so yes here's a little ghost
walk<00:05:59.360> no<00:06:00.360> dry<00:06:01.639> after<00:06:02.639> a<00:06:02.909> while<00:06:05.569> so<00:06:06.569> there<00:06:06.960> it<00:06:07.139> is

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
walk no dry after a while so there it is

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.809

an<00:07:26.229> old<00:07:26.349> caboose<00:07:26.740> that<00:07:27.279> I<00:07:27.310> got<00:07:27.520> a<00:07:27.759> while<00:07:28.150> ago

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 
an old caboose that I got a while ago

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:32.610 
an old caboose that I got a while ago
and<00:07:30.719> he's<00:07:31.719> actually<00:07:31.900> I<00:07:32.080> think<00:07:32.110> the<00:07:32.319> first<00:07:32.500> one

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:32.620 
and he's actually I think the first one

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.999 
and he's actually I think the first one
I<00:07:32.710> had<00:07:33.210> was<00:07:34.210> a<00:07:34.270> plastic<00:07:34.779> one<00:07:34.930> grade<00:07:35.289> sheet<00:07:35.590> but

I had was a plastic one grade sheet but
if<00:07:36.279> that<00:07:36.490> I<00:07:36.520> think<00:07:36.789> it<00:07:36.849> looks<00:07:36.969> kinda<00:07:37.150> cool

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:37.449 
if that I think it looks kinda cool

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:43.399 
if that I think it looks kinda cool
that's<00:07:38.229> a<00:07:38.349> bad<00:07:38.500> news<00:07:38.680> section<00:07:38.800> track<00:07:41.520> so<00:07:42.520> was
