00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.529
 the day 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.569
 rockrose 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.730
 hello friends of the powerful 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.860
 I am your great friend 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.000
 Interfax 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.730
 and this time I have the pleasure of presenting my new section called 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.200
 unusual world 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.630
 here I will talk about really strange but true things 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.820
 that happen on our planet in addition to technological advances tigers mark coma 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.030
 blasco and believe me you will not regret 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.430
 jajajajajajajaja 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.000
 well the first topic we will talk about was something incredible in China they make five 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.040
 Energy areas use two bodies of babies 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.320
 how they heard it 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.700
 I did not believe it for me it is impossible I know that they are crazy and they eat things that 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.800
 we in 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.190
 the west said that 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.190
 but there is the east and has other customs 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.920
 or apparently it's real that that myth 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.439
 Normally the products manufactured in China do not enjoy a good reputation 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.590
 as far as quality is concerned that has led to rumors of all kinds 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.280
 related to what you have 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.300
 that country one of those rumors pointed out that no Chinese lab were 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.420
 making some kind of energy pills manufactured with bodies of 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.159
 dead babies so a Korean television network made a 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.370
 journalistic investigation 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.749
 disturbingly he discovered that the story was true 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:12.989
 Korean journalists investigated Chinese hospital selling bodies of 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.049
 babies who had died the majority from abortions or births 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.629
 premature the company that bought them is a pharmaceutical company that 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.139
 dried the bodies to get substances that added some 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:29.159
 pills which were advertised as pills to improve the rigor 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.109
 physical 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.069
 to ensure what we had discovered entrusted to a laboratory 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.809
 independent that will analyze the content of the paintings and the result 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:42.279
 is that it's 99 7 percent human like in a fiction movie 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:47.819
 the documentary will be aired in a few days in south korea in the chain sbs 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.189
 television and it will surely have a big impact on all this 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:58.959
 I will stop buying Chinese things except toys movies things for 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.779
 computers energy pills hahaha xd xd 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:07.549
 Let's leave the disgusting things a little and let's see our future 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.469
 helicopter to remote control for ipod that's great xd what I do not recommend 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:14.839
 it will be on planes 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:19.869
 one day I bought one of 700 pesos the goals are coming but the damn 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:21.009
 aires rn 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.979
 my poor plane is going to fail 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:25.739
 I also have a helicopter 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.070
 but that was swept the gear and did not make their antlers 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.019
 but one day I'll fix it and vote again 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.799
 Following with the ipesa the remote eitc is a remote-controlled helicopter that 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.849
 instead of using the typical remote control, use one and background and paid hilton 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.650
 you simply install an application on it is with it you have ready a 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.860
 interface is that you can manage using the touch screen also 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.019
 allows you to take advantage of the iss accelerometer and gyroscope 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.239
 still ico to stabilize the helicopter in the air that was going 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.010
 following the movements you make with your hand while holding is the mod 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.989
 interestingly it is a project that be worse than it got more than 28 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.009
 thousand euros I needed to go into production 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:11.439
 You can find it on the official page from there 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.069
 and to finish this great segment there 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.229
 mestre on how to plunder wireless internet although it is not at all 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.889
 certain 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.879
 this is only for people who have some brands with system 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:24.580
 operative 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.259
 android if you do not have it you're a loser if you have an iphone 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:32.559
 well hundreds although I'm not sure it works for iphone 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.630
 to jaquear a company created an android application just me 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.469
 would like any wireless signal and will take it no matter what 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:43.849
 passwords 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.439
 maybe you ever wonder what to do to become a checkmate 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:53.029
 surely the closest answer is to study a lot of computer science and know it 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:57.399
 all about computer networks but now there is another faster possibility 

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:59.840
 install an android application 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.850
 interestingly the application has been developed by one 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.650
 cinterion security company 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.410
 so that companies can test 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.150
 look at how secure their networks are although it is logical to think that the end 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.210
 Last is to get some foreign clients the application is called 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.520
 android networks toolkit and basically allows you to access computers 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.410
 remote are already based on android 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.550
 even them and even allows you to send some attack commands 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.250
 there were wifi networks find open ports and so on if you wonder if 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.620
 you need some type of knowledge to use them literally the company 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.620
 says that the public state application that is almost like 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.009
 this could be a good or bad news depending on how you see it 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.440
 but what is clear is that not only will they sell a good number of 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.080
 applications but also get a good handful of customers 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.990
 looking to improve their systems 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.850
 If you're interested in trying, you can buy it for around eight euros, but 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.280
 you know you should not use these things for higher purposes that was all 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.389
