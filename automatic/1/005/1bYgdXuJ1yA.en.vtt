my<00:05:24.750> obliterator<00:05:25.350> for<00:05:25.560> like<00:05:25.650> twenty<00:05:25.950> eight

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
my obliterator for like twenty eight

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.430 
my obliterator for like twenty eight
cake<00:05:26.370> with<00:05:26.760> yeah<00:05:27.240> like<00:05:27.870> this<00:05:27.990> wasn't<00:05:28.350> that

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
cake with yeah like this wasn't that

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.110 
cake with yeah like this wasn't that
much<00:05:28.590> and<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:28.980> absorbed<00:05:29.400> a<00:05:29.520> ton<00:05:29.550> because<00:05:29.880> the

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
much and it absorbed a ton because the

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.580 
much and it absorbed a ton because the
gladiator<00:05:30.480> sanctum<00:05:30.810> reduces<00:05:31.230> damage<00:05:31.350> by

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
gladiator sanctum reduces damage by

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.650 
gladiator sanctum reduces damage by
fifty<00:05:31.890> percent<00:05:32.040> so<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:32.730> killed<00:05:33.210> him<00:05:33.330> through

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
fifty percent so I killed him through

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.230 
fifty percent so I killed him through
bark<00:05:34.110> skin<00:05:34.410> and<00:05:34.620> a<00:05:35.100> 50-percent<00:05:35.760> shield<00:05:36.000> wall

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
bark skin and a 50-percent shield wall

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.810 
bark skin and a 50-percent shield wall
so<00:05:36.600> that's<00:05:37.380> a<00:05:37.470> pretty<00:05:37.650> big<00:05:37.890> you<00:05:38.160> know<00:05:38.280> damage

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
so that's a pretty big you know damage

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.310 
so that's a pretty big you know damage
mitigation<00:05:39.000> and<00:05:39.510> i<00:05:39.570> still<00:05:39.810> kill<00:05:40.020> them<00:05:40.170> with

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
mitigation and i still kill them with

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.340 
mitigation and i still kill them with
just<00:05:40.530> the<00:05:40.620> one<00:05:40.770> shot<00:05:41.450> but<00:05:42.450> you<00:05:42.750> know<00:05:42.840> an<00:05:43.020> arena

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
just the one shot but you know an arena

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.580 
just the one shot but you know an arena
i<00:05:43.500> actually<00:05:43.950> pull<00:05:44.400> anywhere<00:05:44.790> between<00:05:45.590> 40,000

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
i actually pull anywhere between 40,000

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.340 
i actually pull anywhere between 40,000
to<00:05:46.680> 60,000<00:05:47.310> dps<00:05:47.670> on<00:05:48.600> that<00:05:48.780> one<00:05:48.900> target<00:05:49.230> with

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
to 60,000 dps on that one target with

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.620 
to 60,000 dps on that one target with
that<00:05:49.470> combo<00:05:49.860> and<00:05:50.070> then<00:05:50.610> it<00:05:50.730> also<00:05:50.880> can<00:05:51.210> keep<00:05:51.420> up

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
that combo and then it also can keep up

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.690 
that combo and then it also can keep up
after<00:05:52.080> those<00:05:52.260> six<00:05:52.830> obliterates<00:05:53.310> you<00:05:53.430> can<00:05:53.580> also

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
after those six obliterates you can also

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.970 
after those six obliterates you can also
get<00:05:53.970> like<00:05:54.120> a<00:05:54.150> seventh<00:05:54.600> if<00:05:55.590> you're<00:05:55.740> ruining<00:05:55.890> a

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
get like a seventh if you're ruining a

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.010 
get like a seventh if you're ruining a
question<00:05:56.400> takes<00:05:56.640> a<00:05:56.760> little<00:05:56.880> bit<00:05:57.060> quicker<00:05:57.540> and

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
question takes a little bit quicker and

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.260 
question takes a little bit quicker and
stuff<00:05:58.170> like<00:05:58.290> that<00:05:58.350> so<00:05:58.530> but<00:05:59.490> overall<00:05:59.760> it<00:06:00.090> works

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
stuff like that so but overall it works

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.660 
stuff like that so but overall it works
really<00:06:00.600> really<00:06:00.720> well<00:06:00.980> you<00:06:01.980> know<00:06:02.310> as<00:06:02.400> you<00:06:02.550> can

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
really really well you know as you can

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.910 
really really well you know as you can
see<00:06:02.820> i<00:06:02.850> didn't<00:06:03.480> do<00:06:03.780> a<00:06:03.810> whole<00:06:03.930> time<00:06:04.260> dps<00:06:04.650> because

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
see i didn't do a whole time dps because

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.500 
see i didn't do a whole time dps because
the<00:06:05.040> gladiator<00:06:05.370> sanctum<00:06:05.760> but<00:06:05.880> still<00:06:06.120> i<00:06:06.270> did<00:06:06.480> a

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
the gladiator sanctum but still i did a

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.760 
the gladiator sanctum but still i did a
ton<00:06:06.720> of<00:06:06.750> damage<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.170> I<00:06:07.290> killed<00:06:07.500> him<00:06:07.560> through

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
ton of damage and I killed him through

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.620 
ton of damage and I killed him through
bark<00:06:07.980> skin<00:06:08.220> and<00:06:08.430> the<00:06:08.580> gladiator<00:06:08.910> sanctum<00:06:09.330> with

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
bark skin and the gladiator sanctum with

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.040 
bark skin and the gladiator sanctum with
just<00:06:09.840> that<00:06:09.960> combo<00:06:10.290> so<00:06:10.910> yeah<00:06:11.910> I<00:06:12.090> think<00:06:12.120> I<00:06:12.510> think

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
just that combo so yeah I think I think

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.220 
just that combo so yeah I think I think
that's<00:06:13.230> normally<00:06:14.040> how<00:06:14.070> I<00:06:14.160> do<00:06:14.310> it<00:06:14.490> in<00:06:15.120> DPS<00:06:15.630> type

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.230 
that's normally how I do it in DPS type

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.570 
that's normally how I do it in DPS type
of<00:06:16.350> situations<00:06:16.830> whenever<00:06:17.100> I<00:06:17.190> want<00:06:17.370> to<00:06:17.430> burst

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
of situations whenever I want to burst

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.520 
of situations whenever I want to burst
most<00:06:18.360> of<00:06:18.450> the<00:06:18.510> time<00:06:18.600> I<00:06:18.750> killed<00:06:18.930> roads<00:06:19.200> but<00:06:19.410> then

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
most of the time I killed roads but then

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.320 
most of the time I killed roads but then
about<00:06:19.710> four<00:06:19.890> to<00:06:20.100> five<00:06:20.130> seconds<00:06:20.610> I've<00:06:21.300> used

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
about four to five seconds I've used

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.790 
about four to five seconds I've used
this<00:06:21.750> and<00:06:21.930> you<00:06:21.990> do<00:06:22.110> it<00:06:22.200> correctly<00:06:22.290> but

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
this and you do it correctly but

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.620 
this and you do it correctly but
sometimes<00:06:23.250> sometimes<00:06:24.030> they<00:06:24.150> can<00:06:24.240> get<00:06:24.360> out<00:06:24.510> of

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
sometimes sometimes they can get out of

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.750 
sometimes sometimes they can get out of
it<00:06:24.720> if<00:06:24.810> they<00:06:24.930> pop<00:06:25.140> like<00:06:25.350> trinket<00:06:25.770> Clark<00:06:26.490> skin

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
it if they pop like trinket Clark skin

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.640 
it if they pop like trinket Clark skin
and<00:06:27.060> sri<00:06:27.600> form<00:06:27.870> which<00:06:28.020> get<00:06:28.200> to<00:06:28.290> all<00:06:28.380> of<00:06:28.410> the

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
and sri form which get to all of the

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.050 
and sri form which get to all of the
offensive<00:06:29.100> quota<00:06:29.490> or<00:06:29.670> all<00:06:29.820> of<00:06:29.850> their

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
offensive quota or all of their

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.120 
offensive quota or all of their
defensive<00:06:30.510> cooldowns<00:06:30.630> immediately<00:06:31.350> so<00:06:31.590> it's

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
defensive cooldowns immediately so it's

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.340 
defensive cooldowns immediately so it's
really<00:06:32.280> important<00:06:32.670> to<00:06:32.730> note<00:06:32.940> that<00:06:33.080> with<00:06:34.080> all

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
really important to note that with all

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.200 
really important to note that with all
of<00:06:34.380> your<00:06:34.620> offensive<00:06:35.010> boutons<00:06:35.430> that<00:06:35.580> happen<00:06:35.880> so
