just<00:01:34.650> remember<00:01:35.100> cheap<00:01:35.550> locks<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:36.479> easy<00:01:36.750> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
just remember cheap locks are easy to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.020 
just remember cheap locks are easy to
break<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.619> they're<00:01:37.800> sloppy<00:01:38.160> they<00:01:38.910> have

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
break because they're sloppy they have

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.499 
break because they're sloppy they have
lots<00:01:39.300> of<00:01:39.479> give<00:01:40.100> bond<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.250> other<00:01:41.400> hand<00:01:41.729> quality

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
lots of give bond the other hand quality

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.080 
lots of give bond the other hand quality
name<00:01:42.780> brands<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.920> less<00:01:44.250> give<00:01:44.580> because

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
name brands have less give because

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.640 
name brands have less give because
they're<00:01:45.390> more<00:01:45.570> tightly<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.990> machine<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
they're more tightly a machine and

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.310 
they're more tightly a machine and
therefore<00:01:46.860> harder<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.580> break<00:01:47.960> all<00:01:48.960> right<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
therefore harder to break all right I

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.320 
therefore harder to break all right I
hope<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.560> guys<00:01:49.800> find<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.220> useful<00:01:50.460> go<00:01:51.300> ahead
