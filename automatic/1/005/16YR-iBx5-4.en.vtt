it<00:01:06.760> would<00:01:06.850> stall<00:01:07.120> I<00:01:08.220> end<00:01:09.220> up<00:01:09.310> having<00:01:09.430> a<00:01:11.190> shorted

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
it would stall I end up having a shorted

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.580 
it would stall I end up having a shorted
cell<00:01:12.430> on<00:01:12.550> the<00:01:12.640> battery<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:14.200> ended<00:01:14.350> up<00:01:14.410> putting

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
cell on the battery we ended up putting

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.980 
cell on the battery we ended up putting
another<00:01:14.860> battery<00:01:15.220> in<00:01:15.370> it<00:01:15.460> yet<00:01:15.729> is<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:15.990> marine

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
another battery in it yet is a marine

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:26.219 
another battery in it yet is a marine
battery<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:24.869> unfortunately<00:01:25.869> I<00:01:25.930> think<00:01:25.990> it

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
battery and unfortunately I think it

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.660 
battery and unfortunately I think it
killed<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.560> alternator<00:01:26.830> you<00:01:27.190> see<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.460> red

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
killed the alternator you see the red

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.270 
killed the alternator you see the red
light<00:01:27.780> we're<00:01:28.780> not<00:01:28.900> charging<00:01:29.140> we<00:01:29.979> got<00:01:30.130> that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
light we're not charging we got that

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.039 
light we're not charging we got that
marine<00:01:30.580> battery<00:01:30.910> in<00:01:31.030> there<00:01:31.150> right<00:01:31.270> now

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
overdrive on you would ship through the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.029 
overdrive on you would ship through the
gears<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.350> then<00:01:47.090> go<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.149> neutral
