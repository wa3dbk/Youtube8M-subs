second system is a Shanghai standard
power<00:00:26.910> system<00:00:27.539> which<00:00:28.140> we're<00:00:28.439> introducing<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
power system which we're introducing the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.009 
power system which we're introducing the
code<00:00:29.939> name<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.210> Shanghai<00:00:30.449> but<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:30.840> known<00:00:30.990> as

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
code name is Shanghai but it's known as

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.040 
code name is Shanghai but it's known as
the<00:00:31.109> 45<00:00:31.590> nanometer<00:00:32.270> quad-core<00:00:33.270> processor<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the 45 nanometer quad-core processor and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.940 
the 45 nanometer quad-core processor and
we<00:00:34.710> have<00:00:35.070> our<00:00:35.370> competitors<00:00:36.410> low-power<00:00:37.410> xeon

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
we have our competitors low-power xeon

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.299 
we have our competitors low-power xeon
processor<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.649> power<00:00:41.040> at

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
processor so what you see is a power at

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.400 
processor so what you see is a power at
the<00:00:41.430> wall<00:00:41.610> demo<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.390> see<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> three<00:00:42.960> systems

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the wall demo you see the three systems

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.920 
the wall demo you see the three systems
and<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.370> systems<00:00:44.789> running<00:00:45.450> at<00:00:45.660> three

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
and we have the systems running at three

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.020 
and we have the systems running at three
different<00:00:46.050> power<00:00:46.739> levels<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.579> first<00:00:47.820> power

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
different power levels the first power

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.580 
different power levels the first power

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
percent the second is more of a typical

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.150 
percent the second is more of a typical
server<00:00:51.750> load<00:00:51.960> at<00:00:52.140> about<00:00:52.350> thirty<00:00:52.590> percent<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
server load at about thirty percent and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.910 
server load at about thirty percent and
then<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.969> final<00:00:54.270> one<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.840> at<00:00:54.960> idle<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.829> you

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
then the final one is at idle and you

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.529 
then the final one is at idle and you
see<00:00:56.100> three<00:00:56.370> numbers<00:00:56.670> displayed<00:00:57.030> these<00:00:57.390> are

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
see three numbers displayed these are

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
load but at idle you'll notice we've got

load but at idle you'll notice we've got
141<00:01:32.549> wats<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.000> you've<00:01:33.299> got<00:01:33.329> great<00:01:33.630> efficiency

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
141 wats so you've got great efficiency

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.170 
141 wats so you've got great efficiency
and<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> standard<00:01:34.979> power<00:01:35.310> part<00:01:35.670> was

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and this is the standard power part was

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.640 
and this is the standard power part was
exciting<00:01:36.600> about<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.990> as<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
about a quarter so now let's compare it

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.719 
about a quarter so now let's compare it

critical here is that when you're

the<00:03:30.360> low<00:03:30.540> power<00:03:30.810> part<00:03:31.200> there's<00:03:31.830> a<00:03:31.890> substantial

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
the low power part there's a substantial

the low power part there's a substantial
performance<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:34.110> price<00:03:34.350> difference<00:03:34.830> so<00:03:35.010> if

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
performance and price difference so if

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.240 
performance and price difference so if
you<00:03:35.910> look<00:03:36.150> at<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:37.200> performance<00:03:37.560> numbers<00:03:38.010> at

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
you look at the performance numbers at

267,000<00:03:49.890> on<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.850> intel<00:03:51.360> l<00:03:51.630> 5420<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:52.650> that's<00:03:52.860> a

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
267,000 on the intel l 5420 so that's a

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.949 
267,000 on the intel l 5420 so that's a
substantial<00:03:53.550> difference<00:03:53.670> so<00:03:53.970> it's<00:03:54.420> not<00:03:54.690> just

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
substantial difference so it's not just

substantial difference so it's not just
a<00:03:55.080> measurement<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.590> power<00:03:55.830> it's<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.580> measure<00:03:56.790> of

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
a measurement of power it's a measure of

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.170 
a measurement of power it's a measure of
power<00:03:57.420> performance<00:03:58.320> per<00:03:59.040> watt<00:03:59.070> so<00:03:59.850> the<00:04:00.000> net

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
power performance per watt so the net
