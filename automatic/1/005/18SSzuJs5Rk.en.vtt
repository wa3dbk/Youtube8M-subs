00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.060
 we will all be seventh top fort wildlife and 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.440
 today it's a video giving boxing 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.420
 and this time it's a boxing man 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.800
 unpacking the phone louis cau ses 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.389
 phones or ico so this mark which 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.190
 cartonne right now for a few 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.900
 two years three years of existence mans 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.490
 was not very much and who managed to 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.800
 to gradually impose on the market 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.100
 on the range including very very good 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.300
 value for money for phones 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.070
 today show us present paul 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.029
 reminding me of the prison to apologize 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.289
 there is very little time 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.000
 three new phones that fit 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.460
 in the family of famous dark dark 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.489
 knight the dark moon and the dark pools and 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.190
 today I'm going to open you the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.719
 dark knight phone box so at 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.219
 packaging level something of 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.649
 very common in all phones 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.270
 than a plastic box that does not 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.370
 take no space we see the phone 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.790
 in transparency on top let's look 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.650
 now a little closer 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.700
 this box so even heard the logo 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.680
 ico on the dark knight side so the 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.420
 phone model and the back of the 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.470
 box as usual the different 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.000
 specificities 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.290
 so we're still on the 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.990
 big phone since it's 5 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.910
 inches we are also on the hd 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.920
 so there it is marked in very small good 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.290
 heard but I will succeed in stealing from 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.260
 720p so hd ready good of us 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.280
 are on a platform android jelly 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:22.310
 bean 4.2.1 h + very important so the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.170
 3g 4g unfortunately no one 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.550
 phone an apn of 8 million 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.460
 pixels at the back with 2 million 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.950
 pixels for apn frontal and level 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.080
 proco processor so the engine 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.300
 we are on quad core at 1.2 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.560
 therefore giguÃ¨re a priori on paper a 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.330
 phone that should be pretty 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.650
 swift especially for applications 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.080
 greedy and young and without 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.060
 see it during the test of this phone 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.830
 at the level of memory we have 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.130
 some information actually rome 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.910
 so internal memory of 8 gigas which 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.070
 is quite correct for a 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.500
 phone this range an oar so 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.600
 a 1 gigabyte RAM which 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.220
 should be relatively sufficient 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.710
 also to be able to rotate 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.570
 quite fluid way the applications and 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.070
 we'll see that too during the test 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.920
 something interesting also a 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.619
 screen protection we are on the 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.000
 corning corning gorilla glass forgiveness on 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.640
 which means a screen that should 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.830
 resist normally enough 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.280
 interesting to stripes and small 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.340
 shock 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.320
 otherwise additional microsd with a 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.940
 possibility to add memory of 32 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.860
 gigabits in something pretty 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.299
 important then we'll see if we 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.769
 can install some applications 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.600
 most applications from elsewhere 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.030
 which would allow to be able to increase 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.670
 the memory of 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.650
 very importantly 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.410
 at ricoh as usual we are 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.819
 on the dual sim that I know that you 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.380
 Please well and so it is important that we are 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.520
 add in the weight of a priori 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.900
 sim elevators 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.450
 actually for different 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.099
 formats 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.110
 something that is nice too 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.670
 it is not proposed by all 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.230
 builders and where are we 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.250
 proposes and it's nice of them but 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.239
 I will not make you wait any longer 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.360
 long time we will reopen the box 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.569
 of this dark knight so new family 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.269
 in ricoh so three characters 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.819
 phone new dark knight dark moon 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.400
 and where I get lost a little dark 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.530
 dark knight knight dark moon and dark 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.799
 pools here are the dark pools that I have 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.480
 also beside me here it is that I will have 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.769
 also the opportunity to present you in mind 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.239
 I already made the boxing man you the 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.349
 will see from here very very shortly I 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.910
 think at the same time as the dark knight 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.290
 so that will allow us to do 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.360
 some small cons palp that she can 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.180
 little comparison because yes that has 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.310
 heard his own style in terms of 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.540
 of phone visuals I think that 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.190
 you have for those who follow a little 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.599
 the mark you're used to so 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.810
 here is this dark knight 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.660
 we will remove the projections 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.980
 immediately here is at the front 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.180
 something very sober like 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.069
 usually chioui than at the back a 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.030
 visual that we find in others 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.190
 phones in this range 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.109
 look at for example I show you the 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.340
 dark pools next so dark knight the 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.609
 right hand dark pools in the hand 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.519
 left 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.049
 that's unless you do not have the 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.760
 phones side by side it's true he 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.850
 would be like that in the street very very 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.880
 very difficult to differentiate them 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.290
 especially front of it for the little one 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.239
 visual comparison which I remind you 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.910
 we are on 5 inches so this one is 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:16.680
 a little bit bigger here I hope 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.120
 that you have seen so priori is 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.039
 stand out on the aluminum box and 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.910
 actually when we scratch a little 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:29.010
 so that must be to check well 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.060
 heard we'll see now what 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.580
 that there is in this box what we 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.010
 propose yes you with the phone of 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.590
 headphones or of course the design has 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.590
 looks nice to see now if 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.330
 the sound will be as good as the 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.880
 visual 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.480
 of course the usb cable let's look at a 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.590
 little connectivity closer 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.510
 actually as useful classic one 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.710
 found in many phones I 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.440
 think you're used to seeing 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.810
 it sure is sure a cable a little a 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.120
 little tablecloth something pretty dishes 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.070
 nice to watch 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.889
 the battery is obviously fraipont 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.889
 without the battery then how much this 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.780
 2000 battery and match so I do not know 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.150
 huge for a 5 inch is maybe 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.380
 that at the behavior we will be 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.160
 maybe we'll see that 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.930
 heard during the test some zombies 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.250
 additional for some earphones 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.660
 nice thing too from the late 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.580
 wiko does not give all the same sizes 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.140
 and we will be able to 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.060
 adapt to each person's morphology 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.500
 it's good 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.880
 these are the famous adapter sim which 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.720
 we had talked there a few 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:39.270
 instants of course the charger for 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:43.229
 go with the USB cable principle too 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:46.270
 even essential and the famous manual 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.290
 which will certainly allow you to 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.280
 those who do not know too much 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.870
 do you a little bit of a hand 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.970
 quickly on the phone and its 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.270
 different features and well 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.100
 listen 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.870
 here for this ton boc unboxing 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.640
 sorry excuse me unpacking 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.169
 phone louis cau so I you 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.180
 remind this one that dark knight 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.289
 we also also prone to 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.960
 fire remakes the dark pools 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:06.789
 So you see phone anyway 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.100
 visually very similar and we 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:10.870
 so let's see in different is a 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.820
 for each one what are the differences 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.490
 has the advantages the disadvantages 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.289
 and especially is that independently of a 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.580
 lot anyway they are good so 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.000
 here it was the dark boxing man 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.100
 knight 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.030
 I tell you very soon for the 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.030
 complete hi test
