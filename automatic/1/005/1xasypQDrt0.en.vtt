00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.559
 hello youtube people today I come with a 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.379
 tutorial of the great game saint row 4 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.269
 This tutorial is about teaching 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.849
 how to remove the annoying the of the game in 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.950
 a few simple steps below 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.619
 I will show how the game looked 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.869
 this configuration have the pc that 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.100
 have I'm sure you're going to have 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.920
 minus a little bit of the app look at this 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.050
 it is very hard as you will see this one that is 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.510
 super annoying what makes the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.550
 good game will have to do what 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.090
 next press the escape key 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.520
 then they give him in options then click 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.800
 masters on screen below them 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.350
 will appear this we only touch on 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.140
 where it says predetermined this will be in 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.170
 so we'll change it below the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.150
 graphics we do not download them since 1280 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.180
 jump to the minimum and there you will see 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.640
 horrible look where it says screen 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.830
 wide that can not be changed there is the 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.320
 another alternative to remove the lag and not 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.390
 leave the graphics at the minimum to 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.210
 what we do is go to the screen 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.060
 of title and do the same go to options 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.640
 give it on screen and there as you will see if it 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.549
 you can change the wide screen what 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.670
 we make and leave the graphics in 800 x 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.820
 600 in this resolution you will see them very 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.460
 well and the best without side we do not touch anything 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.070
 more and we press efe 2 and we give it to itself 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.560
 now you will see how the thing has changed 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.280
 totally as it is no longer gee and what 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.710
 better is that it's going 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.930
 now you can finally enjoy this 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.180
 Hilarious game without any kind of 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.670
 annoyance I have already finished it and I 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.040
 I recommend you observe how good it looks 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.619
 and how fast the game runs that 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.290
 I'm recording and still perfect 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.740
 I hope it will help you until the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.740
 next 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.610
