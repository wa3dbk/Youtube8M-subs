we are here at Sebring Johnson and today
I'm<00:00:21.210> talking<00:00:24.380> now<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.439> saw<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:32.750> that<00:00:33.750> was

system<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:11.989> we<00:02:12.989> calculated<00:02:13.560> loosely<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.310> we

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
system so we calculated loosely that we

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.880 
system so we calculated loosely that we
had<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.760> create<00:02:15.060> 15%<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.080> aircraft<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:16.800> it

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
had to create 15% of aircraft so it

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.040 
had to create 15% of aircraft so it
shouldn't<00:02:17.190> take<00:02:19.760> we<00:02:20.760> all<00:02:20.910> know<00:02:21.060> how<00:02:21.209> vacuum<00:02:21.959> is

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
shouldn't take we all know how vacuum is

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.600 
shouldn't take we all know how vacuum is
plenty<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.440> even<00:02:22.830> for<00:02:22.980> somebody<00:02:23.160> who's<00:02:23.400> done

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
didn't know that what it was barebone

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.160 
didn't know that what it was barebone
yeah<00:04:04.920> that's<00:04:05.130> right<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.760> most<00:04:06.540> guys<00:04:06.810> applause

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
which

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.400 
which
you<00:04:13.030> know<00:04:13.120> they<00:04:13.300> give<00:04:13.420> me<00:04:13.510> one<00:04:13.720> example<00:04:14.080> of<00:04:14.260> how

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
you know they give me one example of how

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.500 
you know they give me one example of how
that<00:04:14.440> would<00:04:14.770> be<00:04:14.800> how<00:04:15.160> you<00:04:15.220> help<00:04:15.520> would<00:04:16.090> proceed

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
that would be how you help would proceed

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.470 
that would be how you help would proceed
that<00:04:16.750> well<00:04:17.470> obviously<00:04:17.830> it<00:04:18.430> has<00:04:18.610> a<00:04:18.640> it<00:04:19.239> has<00:04:19.450> a

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
that well obviously it has a it has a

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.720 
that well obviously it has a it has a
different<00:04:19.989> sound<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:20.560> vibration<00:04:21.340> because<00:04:21.700> of

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
different sound and vibration because of

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.090 
different sound and vibration because of
the<00:04:22.000> harmonics<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.660> you<00:04:22.990> saw<00:04:23.230> its<00:04:23.770> wider

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
the harmonics that you saw its wider

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.760 
the harmonics that you saw its wider
versus<00:04:24.760> there<00:04:24.970> okay<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:26.170> windows<00:04:26.560> are<00:04:26.740> very

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
versus there okay the windows are very

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.190 
versus there okay the windows are very
stabilized<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.880> smooth<00:04:28.210> and<00:04:28.540> wide<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.990> vent

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
stabilized and smooth and wide the vent

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.650 
stabilized and smooth and wide the vent
systems<00:04:29.650> on<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.950> dash<00:04:30.210> instead<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.360> little

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
systems on the dash instead a little

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.750 
systems on the dash instead a little
rattle<00:04:31.930> event<00:04:32.200> on<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.530> windows<00:04:32.830> so<00:04:33.430> people

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
rattle event on the windows so people

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.560 
rattle event on the windows so people
get<00:04:33.910> in<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.270> it's<00:04:34.390> like<00:04:36.090> they<00:04:37.090> see<00:04:37.300> there's<00:04:37.480> a

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
get in and it's like they see there's a

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.450 
get in and it's like they see there's a
little<00:04:37.780> bit<00:04:37.900> of<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:38.050> step<00:04:38.320> up<00:04:38.530> then<00:04:38.830> maybe<00:04:39.100> from

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
little bit of a step up then maybe from

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.550 
little bit of a step up then maybe from
a<00:04:39.520> Cadillac<00:04:39.970> right<00:04:40.210> yeah<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:41.200> you<00:04:41.440> know

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
that's right kind of sick range and then

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.450 
that's right kind of sick range and then
you<00:05:12.940> got<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.390> wider<00:05:14.350> door<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:14.980> allow<00:05:15.130> you<00:05:15.190> get
