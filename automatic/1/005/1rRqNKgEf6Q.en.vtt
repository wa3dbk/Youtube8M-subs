00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.650
 it's everyone knows in Lyon then 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.070
 today we still find ourselves on the 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.160
 new zombie butt raid map which still 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.960
 the new zombie map that I said of 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.970
 mapaq revenge that came out on the 2nd 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.520
 July is here today it's a 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.829
 little tutorial video on the new 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.790
 asset therefore elixir of vultures so there 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.880
 you see on the screen what to do 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.340
 you just have to break the door 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.750
 from the entrance of the church to be able to 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.400
 have access and thanks to the behemoths 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.170
 as usual if you do not know 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.120
 how does one deliver a mastodon he 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.690
 just see the previous pre season 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.770
 video that I did so here and I 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.630
 will talk a little bit about this asset 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.550
 because frankly we all have great 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.660
 interesting I'm going back in 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.100
 a few moments so where you see 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.170
 that I'm trying to get enough points 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.130
 to buy me the cough that costs 3000 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.350
 passing points 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.810
 and so I repeat it vulture elixir 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.310
 who have 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.610
 finally who is available in the church 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.960
 at the price of 3000 points and there I could 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.570
 tell you about the effects that I could 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.180
 notice so these are effects that 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.350
 I noticed directly in game so 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.399
 that is, I do not necessarily have 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.869
 deepened maybe there are some 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.300
 extra things but from that 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.270
 I did not understand 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.130
 no - you finally go should you 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.530
 lighten up a little bit about the thing so 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.990
 that's it then you can see that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.549
 I bought cough and can be seen at 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.840
 through the walls so what is that 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.380
 I mean through the walls and everything 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.560
 which is symbol so to all key box 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.409
 dead weapons 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.680
 to all I will say I repeat myself there is 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.460
 also the two men cross each other and 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.659
 that you see these are points 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.950
 of questioning so make a video 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.360
 later to tell you about it 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.650
 question marks upside this 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.960
 are the 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.470
 the boxes the state of death these are the 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.980
 weapons so that is to say he is dead 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.710
 cost bowie and others then there is 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.960
 not that with this asset you see that 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.760
 there on the floor there are 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.950
 little things in gold so there are some 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.870
 gold purses that represent bonuses 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.920
 of points that is to say that it goes from five 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.150
 from 5 to 30 it seems to me so you 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.950
 see here it is that in game twenty 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.840
 seven is not seen on the studio but 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.940
 when I walk on them on 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.970
 scholarships it gives me money there is 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.680
 also ammunition so bullets 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.090
 on the ground are bullets that 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.560
 can retrieve assignments 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.530
 simply that they are by small 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.810
 handle I would say between 5 and 10 balls 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.190
 so it's not insignificant if you 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.650
 are still low sleeves towards 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.050
 ammunition develops I retrieve it 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.640
 so that's it and the last effect that I have 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.810
 may have noticed so that's where it's really 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.540
 an extraordinary effect 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.640
 it allows you to when probed is 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.490
 hot it's small green smoke 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.400
 this allows you to scare away 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.510
 zombies as if it was just that 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.220
 flee zombies it does not attract them 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.019
 it's not strange enough but when 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.310
 you make this smoke around a 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.860
 while teammate colors bare but 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.269
 if it is very useful then we come to the 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.440
 end of the video I hope you will have 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.480
 more or less I hope you'll have 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.300
 enlighten on this mystical asset that is 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.690
 the vulture elixir I repeat it at the price 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.120
 of 3000 available in the church so 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.860
 here is a comment to the garlic 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.269

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.500
 this interests you of course me I 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.880
 tell you the next it's all the 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.880
 world had been zion lease
