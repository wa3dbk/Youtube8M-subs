00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi girls lamiere vi of today will be sui 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.049
 gloss boluk of the new nolan brawl 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.760
 gloss released at home is then in Italy 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.710
 not what we are known except 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.809
 in the spring collection that 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.920
 these two should have four colors 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.990
 instead they are part of the collection 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.880
 permanent and plasters are 29 colors of 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.269
 these 29 colors three have been defined 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.160
 top coat top coat to the lips a little like 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.140
 when we put it on our nails 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.599
 a top can be transparent or 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.759
 brilliant or there is between etc with different 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.190
 effects also will save created between 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.800
 the different effects a transparent one 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.329
 gold and one black 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.500
 the two colors I chose are the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.289
 number 100 149 you see is the form 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.760
 by drop and in the middle is that little hole i 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.350
 points if you see it almost looks like a dustpan 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.390
 the america price of 32 dollars in 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.910
 Italy will probably be around 28 euros 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.760
 this is color 101 and how you can 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.770
 see does not alter the color of the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.390
 lips because it is too light 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.880
 this rose therefore only appears 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.290
 iridescence and this effect a little 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.150
 three-dimensional render the buoys 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.119
 slightly larger and this instead 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.280
 the color 49 initially calculated 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.380
 they bought this but then later that is 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.390
 it's not that I didn't like it is that it's nice 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.210
 cross but says nothing there is a gloss 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.979
 transparent practically then bought 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.560
 this and I loved it 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.439
 however, it has an intense beautiful color 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.930
 I like it because it lasts quite a while 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.670
 couple of hours without going around too much 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.320
 so however different so many highs 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.060
 gloss does not go too much in the folds 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.890
 I thought it was with the glitter in reality 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.149
 it is only slightly recent but not 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.399
 they are seen in the letters so it is 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.770
 very wearable very very elegant 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.150
 like color and scent of melon what that 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.980
 may like it or not 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.630
 is something that goes from a subjective I will have the 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.520
 perfume enough doors you can hear then 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.200
 if I don't like it in perfumes and moles 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.570
 Cosmetics is not for you 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.920
 I definitely recommend and color those 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.270
 a little more intense because otherwise 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.210
 others don't have much without three 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.200
 four colors all on 10 news 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.149
 transparent that practically everyone is 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.009
 it is not the same that one sees so much instead 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.040
 those very intense are beautiful because 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.850
 they give this hurry a little more 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.550
 three-dimensional compared to other glosses 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.140
 and make amber full so then 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.000
 slightly more voluminous above all 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.180
 for those who maybe have a little suu kyi on their lips 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.760
 so my vote for this product is 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.980
 the use of greetings 8 the dogma that has a 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.780
 I especially like the blog 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.690
 deals with those a little more intense 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.220
 transparent need also seen live 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.110
 they will be things like that, but those that are theses are 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.700
 really beautiful and the thing that most me 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.160
 like this big and little the fact that 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.100
 will withdraw just voluminous because 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.600
 however more voluminous but also not 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.370
 tends to go too far in the folds that 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.480
 you know that sometimes they go a little 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.290
 fairs that make lips look like 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.350
 dried jos 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.390
 these instead the le pialla as therefore 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.840
 very nice slightly sticky but 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.440
 not a lot and average duration hello 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.440
 beauties
