00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.609 
language on a signer somewhat and I
might<00:02:03.030> become<00:02:03.390> an<00:02:03.509> interpreter<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.350> feel

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
might become an interpreter so I feel

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.550 
might become an interpreter so I feel
like<00:02:04.770> being<00:02:05.070> blind<00:02:05.490> would<00:02:05.790> not

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
like being blind would not

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.699 
like being blind would not
good<00:02:06.890> for<00:02:07.159> my<00:02:07.280> career<00:02:08.080> um<00:02:09.080> in<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.069> regards<00:02:10.970> uh

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
good for my career um in that regards uh

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.240 
good for my career um in that regards uh
so<00:02:12.709> I<00:02:13.069> would<00:02:14.140> choose<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.349> hiccups<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:15.950> get

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
so I would choose the hiccups I get

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.280 
so I would choose the hiccups I get
hiccups<00:02:16.550> all<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.940> time<00:02:17.120> anyways<00:02:17.599> now<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.170> it

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
hiccups all the time anyways now so it

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.870 
hiccups all the time anyways now so it
wouldn't<00:02:18.530> be<00:02:18.560> really<00:02:18.920> any<00:02:19.069> different<00:02:19.160> what're

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
wouldn't be really any different what're

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.940 
wouldn't be really any different what're
you<00:02:20.239> rather<00:02:20.480> be<00:02:20.810> stranded<00:02:20.840> alone<00:02:21.620> on<00:02:21.680> the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
you rather be stranded alone on the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.130 
you rather be stranded alone on the
island<00:02:22.099> for<00:02:22.459> two<00:02:22.730> years<00:02:23.120> or<00:02:23.420> with<00:02:23.660> one<00:02:23.870> person

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
island for two years or with one person

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.430 
island for two years or with one person
for<00:02:24.319> five<00:02:24.709> I<00:02:25.069> think<00:02:25.550> if<00:02:25.760> I<00:02:25.910> were<00:02:26.060> alone<00:02:26.360> on<00:02:26.690> an

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
for five I think if I were alone on an

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.070 
for five I think if I were alone on an
island<00:02:27.590> by<00:02:27.890> myself<00:02:28.069> i<00:02:28.489> can<00:02:28.670> go<00:02:28.819> insane<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:30.019> i

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
island by myself i can go insane so i

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.290 
island by myself i can go insane so i
would<00:02:30.349> pick<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:31.400> person<00:02:31.640> for<00:02:31.970> five<00:02:32.150> years

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
would pick the one person for five years

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.870 
would pick the one person for five years
it's<00:02:32.780> it's<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.349> longer<00:02:33.560> time<00:02:33.890> but<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.430> might

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
it's it's a longer time but it might

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.820 
it's it's a longer time but it might
seem<00:02:35.120> shorter<00:02:35.630> than<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.260> two<00:02:36.440> years<00:02:36.650> about

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
seem shorter than the two years about

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.509 
seem shorter than the two years about
yourself<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:38.630> yeah<00:02:39.410> logical<00:02:40.040> thinking<00:02:40.310> guys

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
yourself so yeah logical thinking guys

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.600 
yourself so yeah logical thinking guys
would<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.269> rather<00:02:41.510> have<00:02:42.170> fingers<00:02:42.860> as<00:02:43.069> long<00:02:43.370> as

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
would you rather have fingers as long as
