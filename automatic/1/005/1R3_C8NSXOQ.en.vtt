you know not repeat the steps I'm going

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.800 
you know not repeat the steps I'm going
to<00:01:27.930> go<00:01:28.049> each<00:01:28.350> step<00:01:28.650> once<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:30.299> Mayton<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.659> name

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
to go each step once the Mayton the name

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.920 
to go each step once the Mayton the name
of<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.049> machine<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.680> mana<00:01:32.130> price<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.930> it's

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
of this machine is a mana price and it's

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.200 
of this machine is a mana price and it's
from<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.140> company<00:01:34.320> called<00:01:34.560> eggy<00:01:35.220> care<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.119> I

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
from a company called eggy care and I

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.679 
from a company called eggy care and I
got<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.570> 30<00:01:36.810> bucks<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.350> found<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.860> eBay

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
got it for 30 bucks I found on eBay

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.840 
got it for 30 bucks I found on eBay
so<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:40.259> seems<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> seems<00:01:40.950> pretty<00:01:41.220> good<00:01:41.369> it's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so it seems it seems pretty good it's

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.120 
so it seems it seems pretty good it's
not<00:01:42.060> great<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.200> think<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.799> lot<00:01:43.979> better

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
not great but I think it's a lot better

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
not great but I think it's a lot better
than<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> disc<00:01:44.549> doctor<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.240> junk<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
than the disc doctor and junk like that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.620 
than the disc doctor and junk like that
so<00:01:46.649> here's<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.430> first<00:01:47.610> step<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.149> put<00:01:48.509> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
so here's the first step you just put it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.950 
so here's the first step you just put it
in<00:01:48.780> four<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.380> three<00:01:49.710> minutes<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.310> buff<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
in four to three minutes to buff it and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.179 
in four to three minutes to buff it and
next<00:01:51.960> step<00:01:52.170> after<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.829> repairing<00:01:53.340> so

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
next step after that is repairing so

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.130 
next step after that is repairing so
alright<00:01:56.189> now<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.790> that's<00:01:56.939> finished<00:01:57.149> um<00:01:57.750> he

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
alright now that that's finished um he

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.570 
alright now that that's finished um he
just<00:01:58.350> removed<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> disc

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
just removed the disc

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.810 
just removed the disc
and<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:01.180> buffed<00:02:01.420> it<00:02:01.570> out<00:02:01.690> so<00:02:02.460> as<00:02:03.460> you<00:02:03.670> can<00:02:03.760> see

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
and it buffed it out so as you can see

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.660 
and it buffed it out so as you can see
Alan<00:02:04.480> if<00:02:04.540> it<00:02:04.690> shows<00:02:05.140> up<00:02:05.170> but<00:02:05.530> it's<00:02:06.130> very<00:02:06.370> shiny

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
Alan if it shows up but it's very shiny

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.120 
Alan if it shows up but it's very shiny
much<00:02:07.090> more<00:02:07.300> shinier<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:07.750> cleaner<00:02:08.130> it's

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
much more shinier and cleaner it's

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.710 
much more shinier and cleaner it's
actually<00:02:09.490> removed<00:02:09.820> a<00:02:10.030> lot<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.540> light

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
actually removed a lot of the light

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.990 
actually removed a lot of the light
scratches<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.410> have<00:02:11.530> had<00:02:11.650> already<00:02:12.000> but

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
scratches that have had already but

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.880 
scratches that have had already but
there's<00:02:13.180> another<00:02:13.390> method<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.870> fix<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.650> even

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
there's another method to fix it even

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.330 
there's another method to fix it even
more<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:16.200> there's<00:02:17.200> like<00:02:17.350> tiny<00:02:17.680> like<00:02:18.010> swirl

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
more so there's like tiny like swirl

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.120 
more so there's like tiny like swirl
method<00:02:19.120> around<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.930> which<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.650> can<00:02:20.770> see<00:02:20.980> more

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
method around it which you can see more

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.650 
method around it which you can see more
on<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.280> black<00:02:21.550> disc<00:02:21.850> but<00:02:22.090> this<00:02:22.210> one<00:02:22.390> looks

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
on the black disc but this one looks

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.960 
on the black disc but this one looks
pretty<00:02:22.870> good<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.310> next<00:02:24.340> step<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:24.940> just

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
pretty good so the next step is just

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.240 
pretty good so the next step is just
take<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.420> disc<00:02:25.630> out<00:02:25.840> remove<00:02:26.560> these<00:02:26.770> red<00:02:27.040> ones

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
take the disc out remove these red ones

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:37.190 
take the disc out remove these red ones
and<00:02:28.230> replacing<00:02:29.230> them<00:02:29.290> with<00:02:30.510> with<00:02:31.510> yellow

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.869 

now<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.379> is<00:02:38.560> called<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.950> repair<00:02:39.310> method<00:02:39.700> I

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
now this is called the repair method I

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.729 
now this is called the repair method I
guess<00:02:40.360> this<00:02:40.540> is<00:02:40.689> where<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.019> kind<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.290> fills<00:02:41.560> in

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
guess this is where it kind of fills in

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.979 
guess this is where it kind of fills in
the<00:02:41.920> holes<00:02:42.159> or<00:02:42.430> whatever<00:02:42.730> on<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.540> disk<00:02:43.780> I

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
the holes or whatever on the disk I

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.289 
the holes or whatever on the disk I
guess<00:02:44.260> I'm<00:02:45.189> not<00:02:45.340> sure<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.640> still<00:02:45.849> don't<00:02:46.239> know

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
guess I'm not sure I still don't know

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.319 
guess I'm not sure I still don't know
how<00:02:46.450> this<00:02:46.659> kind<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:46.989> stuff<00:02:47.200> works<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.120> put

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
how this kind of stuff works so you put

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.740 
how this kind of stuff works so you put
a<00:02:49.360> little<00:02:49.510> bit<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:50.459> repair<00:02:51.459> fluid<00:02:51.819> on<00:02:51.939> it<00:02:52.120> and

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
a little bit of a repair fluid on it and

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.530 
a little bit of a repair fluid on it and
try<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.290> do<00:02:53.409> this<00:02:53.500> with<00:02:53.650> one<00:02:53.890> hand<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:54.540> bear

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
try and do this with one hand so bear

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:04.170

the repair method is done I can actually
see<00:03:49.290> very<00:03:49.530> lightly<00:03:49.890> there's<00:03:50.340> some<00:03:50.550> wear<00:03:50.790> on<00:03:50.970> it

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
see very lightly there's some wear on it

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.820 
see very lightly there's some wear on it
some<00:03:51.390> scratches<00:03:53.120> are<00:03:54.120> still<00:03:54.420> on<00:03:54.570> it<00:03:54.750> but<00:03:55.680> it's

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
some scratches are still on it but it's

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.610 
some scratches are still on it but it's
looking<00:03:56.100> better<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.810> might<00:03:58.019> run<00:03:58.200> this<00:03:58.350> disc

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
looking better and I might run this disc

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.580 
looking better and I might run this disc
through<00:03:58.890> again<00:04:00.230> more<00:04:01.230> than<00:04:01.350> once<00:04:03.440> remove<00:04:04.440> the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
through again more than once remove the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.790 
through again more than once remove the
yellow<00:04:04.680> ones<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.190> put<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.760> blue<00:04:05.940> ones<00:04:06.180> in<00:04:06.800> and

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
yellow ones and put the blue ones in and

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.340 
yellow ones and put the blue ones in and
I<00:04:08.220> guess<00:04:08.430> this<00:04:08.640> is<00:04:08.850> known<00:04:09.569> as<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.870> actual

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
I guess this is known as the actual

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.830 
I guess this is known as the actual
cleaning<00:04:10.590> step<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:13.880> you<00:04:14.880> put<00:04:15.090> some<00:04:15.390> cleaning

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
cleaning step and you put some cleaning

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.800 
cleaning step and you put some cleaning
fluid<00:04:15.870> on<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:16.769> right<00:04:17.100> side<00:04:18.919> this<00:04:19.919> one<00:04:20.810> it

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
fluid on the right side this one it

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.000 
fluid on the right side this one it
looks<00:04:21.959> like<00:04:22.109> water<00:04:22.380> um<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:24.290> don't<00:04:25.290> know<00:04:25.440> what<00:04:25.919> it

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
looks like water um I don't know what it

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.690 
looks like water um I don't know what it
smells<00:04:26.160> like<00:04:28.070> doesn't<00:04:29.070> really<00:04:29.100> have<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.400> scent

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
smells like doesn't really have a scent

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.310 
smells like doesn't really have a scent
to<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:29.910> so<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.390> could<00:04:30.540> just<00:04:30.600> be<00:04:30.870> water<00:04:31.080> on<00:04:33.320> but

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
to it so it could just be water on but

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.590 
to it so it could just be water on but
it's<00:04:34.470> just<00:04:35.010> tiny<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.520> tiny<00:04:35.790> drops<00:04:36.169> of<00:04:37.169> that<00:04:38.600> and

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
it's just tiny to tiny drops of that and

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.390 
it's just tiny to tiny drops of that and
put<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.140> disc<00:04:40.410> back<00:04:40.590> in<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.070> it's<00:04:41.190> going<00:04:41.340> to

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
put the disc back in and it's going to

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.170 
put the disc back in and it's going to
go<00:04:41.520> for<00:04:41.760> about<00:04:41.940> three<00:04:42.150> minutes<00:04:42.330> again<00:04:44.180> I'll

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
go for about three minutes again I'll

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.960 
go for about three minutes again I'll
see<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:45.450> guys<00:04:45.600> in<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.870> little<00:04:46.020> bit<00:04:46.729> okay<00:04:47.729> guys

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
see you guys in a little bit okay guys

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.750 
see you guys in a little bit okay guys
the<00:04:48.240> third<00:04:48.510> and<00:04:48.810> final<00:04:49.200> step<00:04:49.560> is<00:04:49.740> complete<00:04:50.190> and

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
the third and final step is complete and

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.760 
the third and final step is complete and
I<00:04:51.770> don't<00:04:52.770> know<00:04:52.890> I<00:04:53.130> would<00:04:53.370> have<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.669> give<00:04:53.880> a<00:04:54.770> from

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
I don't know I would have to give a from

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.830 
I don't know I would have to give a from
one<00:04:56.010> to<00:04:56.190> ten<00:04:56.460> ten<00:04:56.490> being<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.210> best<00:04:57.450> and<00:04:57.630> one

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
one to ten ten being the best and one

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.230 
one to ten ten being the best and one
being<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.169> worst<00:04:58.320> as<00:04:58.919> how<00:04:59.880> this<00:05:00.030> machine

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
being the worst as how this machine

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.909 
being the worst as how this machine
works<00:05:00.419> I<00:05:01.070> probably<00:05:02.070> have<00:05:02.250> to<00:05:02.400> give<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:02.729> a<00:05:03.919> five

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
works I probably have to give it a five

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.050 
works I probably have to give it a five
because<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.910> does<00:05:06.830> clean<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:07.979> disc<00:05:08.160> up<00:05:08.460> like

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
because it does clean the disc up like

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.170 
because it does clean the disc up like
for<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:09.960> decent<00:05:10.229> amount<00:05:10.470> and<00:05:11.370> you<00:05:11.789> know<00:05:11.910> I<00:05:11.940> have

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
for a decent amount and you know I have

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.940 
for a decent amount and you know I have
it<00:05:12.300> fouled<00:05:12.510> you<00:05:12.930> know<00:05:13.020> done<00:05:13.260> it<00:05:13.440> more<00:05:13.620> than<00:05:13.650> one

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
it fouled you know done it more than one

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.890 
it fouled you know done it more than one
I've<00:05:14.160> just<00:05:14.190> done<00:05:14.490> this<00:05:14.610> one<00:05:14.820> time<00:05:15.060> but<00:05:15.300> this

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
I've just done this one time but this

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.260 
I've just done this one time but this
one<00:05:16.080> had<00:05:16.229> a<00:05:16.260> lot<00:05:16.410> of<00:05:16.530> scratches<00:05:16.800> on<00:05:17.130> it<00:05:17.160> if<00:05:18.090> you

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
one had a lot of scratches on it if you

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.180 
one had a lot of scratches on it if you
look<00:05:18.450> closely<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.530> camera<00:05:19.860> won't<00:05:19.950> pick

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
look closely and the camera won't pick

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.250 
look closely and the camera won't pick
it<00:05:20.310> up<00:05:20.460> but<00:05:20.640> I<00:05:20.850> can<00:05:21.270> still<00:05:21.510> see<00:05:21.720> a<00:05:21.750> lot<00:05:21.990> of<00:05:22.200> the

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
it up but I can still see a lot of the

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.080 
it up but I can still see a lot of the
little<00:05:22.440> scratches<00:05:22.950> on<00:05:23.100> it<00:05:23.130> so<00:05:23.789> I'll<00:05:23.880> probably

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
little scratches on it so I'll probably

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.540 
little scratches on it so I'll probably
repeat<00:05:24.330> this<00:05:24.660> process<00:05:24.900> again<00:05:25.320> if<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:26.370> works

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
repeat this process again if it works

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.340 
repeat this process again if it works
better<00:05:26.789> by<00:05:27.060> repeating<00:05:27.630> it<00:05:27.720> I'll<00:05:27.870> let<00:05:28.020> you<00:05:28.169> guys

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
better by repeating it I'll let you guys

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.820 
better by repeating it I'll let you guys
know<00:05:28.700> I'll<00:05:29.700> probably<00:05:29.940> make<00:05:30.120> a<00:05:30.180> video<00:05:30.539> of<00:05:30.599> it<00:05:30.830> so

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
know I'll probably make a video of it so

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.310 
know I'll probably make a video of it so
um<00:05:32.010> it<00:05:32.550> did<00:05:32.729> work<00:05:32.909> alright<00:05:33.330> it<00:05:33.599> took<00:05:33.780> a<00:05:34.020> lot<00:05:34.289> of

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
um it did work alright it took a lot of

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.999 
um it did work alright it took a lot of
the

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
the

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.459 
the
a<00:05:35.099> lot<00:05:35.939> of<00:05:35.969> it<00:05:36.240> and<00:05:36.449> it<00:05:36.749> cleaned<00:05:36.960> it<00:05:37.110> up<00:05:37.199> really

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
a lot of it and it cleaned it up really

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.439 
a lot of it and it cleaned it up really
nicely<00:05:37.800> and<00:05:38.249> it<00:05:38.369> did<00:05:38.520> make<00:05:38.699> it<00:05:38.849> shine<00:05:39.119> really

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
nicely and it did make it shine really

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.189 
nicely and it did make it shine really
good<00:05:40.699> but<00:05:41.699> I'm<00:05:42.419> going<00:05:42.599> to<00:05:42.689> repeat<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.020> process

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
good but I'm going to repeat the process

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.149 
good but I'm going to repeat the process
again<00:05:43.619> so<00:05:44.689> I'm<00:05:45.689> still<00:05:46.110> not<00:05:46.229> sure<00:05:46.289> if<00:05:46.740> I<00:05:47.129> like

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
again so I'm still not sure if I like

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.489 
again so I'm still not sure if I like
this<00:05:47.490> machine<00:05:47.699> or<00:05:47.969> not<00:05:48.149> I<00:05:48.389> mean<00:05:48.629> it's<00:05:49.319> all

00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:49.499 
this machine or not I mean it's all

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:51.290 
this machine or not I mean it's all
right<00:05:49.710> you<00:05:50.069> know<00:05:50.189> it<00:05:50.339> probably<00:05:50.460> works<00:05:50.789> bestest

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
right you know it probably works bestest

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.749 
right you know it probably works bestest
or<00:05:51.479> light<00:05:51.659> really<00:05:51.960> like<00:05:52.259> scratches<00:05:52.830> but<00:05:53.699> I'm

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
or light really like scratches but I'm

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.399 
or light really like scratches but I'm
going<00:05:53.939> to<00:05:54.029> repeat<00:05:54.300> the<00:05:54.419> process<00:05:54.599> again<00:05:55.020> to<00:05:55.229> see

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
going to repeat the process again to see

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:56.839 
going to repeat the process again to see
if<00:05:55.439> that<00:05:55.710> will<00:05:55.800> work<00:05:55.860> that<00:05:56.219> all<00:05:56.339> right<00:05:56.490> this<00:05:56.669> is

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
if that will work that all right this is

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.059 
if that will work that all right this is
the<00:05:56.879> bug<00:05:57.149> to<00:05:57.389> disk<00:05:57.689> and<00:05:58.020> I've<00:05:58.349> buffed<00:05:58.649> it<00:05:58.860> like

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.069 
the bug to disk and I've buffed it like

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.450 
the bug to disk and I've buffed it like
four<00:05:59.550> or<00:05:59.669> five<00:05:59.729> times<00:05:59.879> and<00:06:01.219> definitely<00:06:02.219> helped

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
four or five times and definitely helped

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.230 
four or five times and definitely helped
it<00:06:02.580> out<00:06:02.699> more<00:06:02.999> and<00:06:04.369> you<00:06:05.369> have<00:06:05.639> to<00:06:05.789> look<00:06:05.939> close

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
it out more and you have to look close

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.649 
it out more and you have to look close
to<00:06:06.449> see<00:06:06.659> there's<00:06:06.899> tiny<00:06:07.229> scratches<00:06:07.800> on<00:06:08.159> it<00:06:08.270> um

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
to see there's tiny scratches on it um

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:11.959 
to see there's tiny scratches on it um
this<00:06:10.080> unit<00:06:10.469> is<00:06:10.559> pretty<00:06:10.889> good<00:06:11.099> I<00:06:11.430> probably<00:06:11.759> go

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
this unit is pretty good I probably go

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.850 
this unit is pretty good I probably go
up<00:06:12.089> on<00:06:12.240> my<00:06:12.360> rating<00:06:12.719> I<00:06:12.779> probably<00:06:12.990> rate<00:06:13.199> at<00:06:13.319> 7<00:06:13.710> at

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
up on my rating I probably rate at 7 at

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.249 
up on my rating I probably rate at 7 at
10<00:06:14.129> it<00:06:14.669> does<00:06:14.939> work<00:06:15.210> and<00:06:15.449> if<00:06:15.569> use<00:06:15.749> it<00:06:15.899> multiple

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
10 it does work and if use it multiple

10 it does work and if use it multiple
times<00:06:16.319> it<00:06:16.740> will<00:06:16.860> remove<00:06:17.159> all<00:06:17.370> those<00:06:17.580> light

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:17.789 
times it will remove all those light

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.689 
times it will remove all those light
scratches<00:06:18.360> but<00:06:18.899> it's<00:06:19.110> not<00:06:19.289> meant<00:06:19.529> for<00:06:19.699> like

play<00:07:03.839> anyway<00:07:04.289> so<00:07:05.099> I<00:07:05.129> can't<00:07:05.459> guarantee<00:07:05.639> on<00:07:05.999> that
