finger holes in a bowling ball and if we
think<00:00:15.210> about<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> little<00:00:16.590> bit<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
think about it this is a little bit of a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.680 
think about it this is a little bit of a
challenge<00:00:17.100> because<00:00:17.550> if<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.210> know<00:00:18.300> go<00:00:18.539> with

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
challenge because if we you know go with

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.470 
challenge because if we you know go with
something<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.289> UV<00:00:19.680> sphere<00:00:19.740> then<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:21.270> have

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
something like a UV sphere then we have

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.349 
something like a UV sphere then we have
no<00:00:21.869> good<00:00:22.230> place<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.980> position<00:00:23.490> these<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:24.240> know

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
no good place to position these you know

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.290 
no good place to position these you know
we<00:00:24.570> could<00:00:24.779> potentially<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.949> know<00:00:26.090> extrude<00:00:27.090> in

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
we could potentially you know extrude in

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.540 
we could potentially you know extrude in
a<00:00:27.539> couple<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.019> holes<00:00:28.590> here<00:00:29.010> or<00:00:29.220> something<00:00:29.460> like

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
a couple of holes here or something like

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.679 
a couple of holes here or something like
that<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.789> know<00:00:29.939> having<00:00:30.240> adjusted<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
that you know having adjusted the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.299 
that you know having adjusted the
segments<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.289> might<00:00:31.470> work<00:00:31.650> but<00:00:32.130> it's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
segments and that might work but it's

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.830 
segments and that might work but it's
still<00:00:32.460> kind<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.759> messy<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.360> we<00:00:33.600> don't<00:00:33.690> have

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
still kind of messy and we don't have

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.170 
still kind of messy and we don't have
very<00:00:33.960> good<00:00:34.079> topology<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.399> additionally<00:00:36.059> you

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
very good topology and additionally you

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.020 
very good topology and additionally you
know<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.390> could<00:00:36.570> use<00:00:36.780> say<00:00:37.079> like<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> cube<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.160> we

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
know we could use say like a cube and we

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.520 
know we could use say like a cube and we
could<00:00:39.239> use<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> subdivision<00:00:39.989> surface<00:00:40.500> modifier

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
could use a subdivision surface modifier

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.830 
could use a subdivision surface modifier
and<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.730> could<00:00:41.850> go<00:00:41.969> down<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.480> know<00:00:42.570> create

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and we could go down and you know create

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.569 
and we could go down and you know create
something<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:43.890> extrude<00:00:44.430> in

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
something like that and then extrude in

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.420 
something like that and then extrude in
holes<00:00:44.969> here<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.629> here<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.289> here<00:00:46.500> but<00:00:47.340> again

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
holes here and here and here but again

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.940 
holes here and here and here but again
that<00:00:48.090> doesn't<00:00:48.390> work<00:00:48.899> all<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.559> well<00:00:49.620> there's

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that doesn't work all that well there's

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.729 
that doesn't work all that well there's
no<00:00:50.160> good<00:00:50.640> way<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.510> however<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.289> did<00:00:52.559> come

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
no good way to do it however I did come

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.260 
no good way to do it however I did come
up<00:00:52.860> with<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.219> slightly<00:00:53.550> different<00:00:53.789> solution

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
up with a slightly different solution

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.060 
up with a slightly different solution
that<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.539> think<00:00:54.780> works<00:00:54.930> really<00:00:55.079> well<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.590> that

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that I think works really well and that

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.520 
that I think works really well and that
is<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.430> use<00:00:56.699> an<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.239> coast<00:00:57.480> fear<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.199> we're<00:00:58.500> just

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
is to use an I coast fear so we're just

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.590 
is to use an I coast fear so we're just
going<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.800> hit<00:00:58.890> shift<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.219> add<00:00:59.430> animesh<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.270> an

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
going to hit shift a add animesh and an

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.569 
going to hit shift a add animesh and an
ico<00:01:00.750> spear<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.039> krause<00:01:02.219> fear<00:01:02.370> we're

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
ico spear and this I krause fear we're

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.160 
ico spear and this I krause fear we're
going<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> bring<00:01:03.059> up<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.270> operator<00:01:03.690> panel<00:01:03.899> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
going to bring up the operator panel and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.130 
going to bring up the operator panel and
adjust<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> subdivisions<00:01:05.430> either<00:01:06.030> two<00:01:06.510> three

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
adjust the subdivisions either two three

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.649 
adjust the subdivisions either two three
or<00:01:07.470> four<00:01:07.729> I<00:01:08.729> think<00:01:09.060> we'll<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.180> stick<00:01:09.450> with

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
or four I think we'll just stick with

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.480 
or four I think we'll just stick with
three<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.439> time<00:01:10.650> being<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.280> do

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
three for the time being you can do

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.670 
three for the time being you can do
either<00:01:11.670> one<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:13.049> nice<00:01:13.200> thing<00:01:13.229> about<00:01:13.470> an

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
either one and the nice thing about an

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.940 
either one and the nice thing about an
eye<00:01:13.830> Coast<00:01:14.070> fear<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.810> all<00:01:16.020> equally

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
eye Coast fear is that it is all equally

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.149 
eye Coast fear is that it is all equally
divided<00:01:17.460> into<00:01:18.060> triangles<00:01:18.689> now<00:01:19.290> normally<00:01:19.710> this

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
divided into triangles now normally this

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.100 
divided into triangles now normally this
wouldn't<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.580> good<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:20.850> hard<00:01:21.390> surface<00:01:21.750> model

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
wouldn't be good for hard surface model

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.240 
wouldn't be good for hard surface model
because<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.680> fact<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.159> all

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
because of the fact that it's all

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.710 
because of the fact that it's all
triangles<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.060> don't<00:01:24.180> really<00:01:24.360> divide

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
triangles and they don't really divide

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.270 
triangles and they don't really divide
very<00:01:24.990> well<00:01:25.200> once<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.650> add<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.009> subdivision

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
very well once you add in a subdivision

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.030 
very well once you add in a subdivision
surface<00:01:26.820> modifier<00:01:26.990> but<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.320> case<00:01:28.560> since

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
surface modifier but in this case since

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.850 
surface modifier but in this case since
a<00:01:29.310> bowling<00:01:29.610> ball<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.970> perfectly<00:01:30.900> round<00:01:31.200> minus

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
a bowling ball is perfectly round minus

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.710 
a bowling ball is perfectly round minus
the<00:01:32.009> holes<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.610> actually<00:01:33.150> works<00:01:33.450> out<00:01:33.600> really

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the holes it actually works out really

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.510 
the holes it actually works out really
well<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.920> what<00:01:35.040> we're<00:01:35.130> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.400> now<00:01:35.490> is

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
well so what we're going to do now is

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.380 
well so what we're going to do now is
we're<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:35.909> go<00:01:36.030> into<00:01:36.150> edit<00:01:36.270> mode

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
we're going to just go into edit mode

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.749 
we're going to just go into edit mode
and<00:01:36.720> we're<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.560> position<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.460> three

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
and we're going to position the three

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.580 
and we're going to position the three
finger<00:01:39.119> holes<00:01:39.299> which<00:01:39.840> basically<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.530> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
finger holes which basically is going to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.429 
finger holes which basically is going to
be<00:01:40.710> right<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:43.649> then<00:01:44.210> let's<00:01:45.210> see<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.439> did

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
be right here and then let's see you did

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.749 
be right here and then let's see you did
it<00:01:46.590> too<00:01:47.930> here<00:01:48.930> here<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:50.130> yeah<00:01:50.490> there<00:01:50.670> we

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
it too here here and here yeah there we

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.999 
it too here here and here yeah there we
go<00:01:50.790> okay<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.770> grow

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
go okay so if we then just like grow

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.710 
go okay so if we then just like grow
these<00:01:53.189> selections<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.149> basically

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
these selections like this basically

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.910 
these selections like this basically
that's<00:01:54.840> what<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.350> let<00:01:55.619> me<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> go<00:01:55.829> into

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that's what we have let me to go into

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.429 
that's what we have let me to go into
face<00:01:56.100> mode<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.670> then<00:01:57.030> grow<00:01:57.659> them<00:01:57.810> or<00:01:58.079> we<00:01:58.320> can

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
face mode and then grow them or we can

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.039 
face mode and then grow them or we can
just<00:01:58.469> select<00:01:58.680> days<00:01:59.189> like<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.049> this

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
just select days like this and like this

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.219 
just select days like this and like this
and<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.060> suddenly<00:02:03.719> what<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.079> have

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
and like this and suddenly what we have

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.490 
and like this and suddenly what we have
is<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.590> three<00:02:05.420> roughly<00:02:06.420> equal<00:02:06.840> areas<00:02:07.290> of

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
is we have three roughly equal areas of

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.160 
is we have three roughly equal areas of
which<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.459> then<00:02:08.789> extrude<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.690> our<00:02:09.929> geometry

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
which to then extrude in our geometry

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.220 
which to then extrude in our geometry
now<00:02:10.950> we're<00:02:11.190> not<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.790> do<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.450> exactly

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
now we're not going to do this exactly

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.830 
now we're not going to do this exactly
like<00:02:13.349> this<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:13.650> let's

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
like this so let's

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.360 
like this so let's
do<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:14.019> one<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.319> time<00:02:14.440> let's<00:02:14.620> start<00:02:14.980> by<00:02:15.310> doing

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
do this one in time let's start by doing

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.860 
do this one in time let's start by doing
the<00:02:15.670> thumb<00:02:15.879> so<00:02:16.360> we're<00:02:16.450> going<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.629> grab<00:02:16.750> this

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
the thumb so we're going to grab this

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.300 
the thumb so we're going to grab this
area<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.290> we're<00:02:17.470> going<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.620> hit<00:02:17.709> I<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.220> we're

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
area and we're going to hit I and we're

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.759 
area and we're going to hit I and we're
going<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.459> inset<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.120> being<00:02:19.810> careful<00:02:20.230> not<00:02:20.260> to

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
going to inset that being careful not to

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.220 
going to inset that being careful not to
adjust<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.610> depth<00:02:21.849> so<00:02:22.450> let<00:02:22.750> me<00:02:22.780> just<00:02:22.930> undo

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
adjust the depth so let me just undo

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.229 
adjust the depth so let me just undo
that<00:02:23.349> well<00:02:23.709> inset<00:02:24.099> this<00:02:24.220> again<00:02:24.519> we're<00:02:25.060> get<00:02:25.150> it

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
that well inset this again we're get it

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.880 
that well inset this again we're get it
to<00:02:25.330> approximately<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.140> size<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.500> we<00:02:26.709> want

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
to approximately the size that we want

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.330 
to approximately the size that we want
now<00:02:27.250> in<00:02:27.489> this<00:02:27.700> case<00:02:27.760> I'm<00:02:28.209> just<00:02:28.269> going<00:02:28.629> to<00:02:29.340> just

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
now in this case I'm just going to just

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.460 
now in this case I'm just going to just
eyeball<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.819> because<00:02:31.299> I'm<00:02:31.690> not<00:02:31.930> trying<00:02:32.349> to<00:02:32.379> be

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
eyeball it because I'm not trying to be

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.589 
eyeball it because I'm not trying to be
super<00:02:32.739> precise<00:02:33.160> if<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:34.090> have<00:02:34.299> an<00:02:34.450> actual

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
super precise if you have an actual

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.210 
super precise if you have an actual
bowling<00:02:34.870> ball<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.319> course<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.590> can<00:02:35.830> get<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.040> as

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
bowling ball of course you can get it as

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.830 
bowling ball of course you can get it as
close<00:02:36.459> as<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.790> want<00:02:36.819> then<00:02:37.569> we're<00:02:37.690> going<00:02:37.780> to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
close as you want then we're going to

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.420 
close as you want then we're going to
move<00:02:37.900> our<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.440> where<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:38.920> next<00:02:39.099> finger<00:02:39.220> hole

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
move our to where the next finger hole

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.610 
move our to where the next finger hole
would<00:02:39.489> be<00:02:39.549> and<00:02:39.849> we're<00:02:40.239> going<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.480> inset<00:02:41.410> that

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
would be and we're going to inset that

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.979 
would be and we're going to inset that
and<00:02:41.920> we'll<00:02:42.370> do<00:02:42.519> say<00:02:42.760> something<00:02:43.420> about<00:02:43.780> like

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
and we'll do say something about like

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.009 
and we'll do say something about like
that<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.560> then<00:02:45.010> we'll<00:02:45.099> grab<00:02:45.250> this<00:02:45.430> one<00:02:45.610> and

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
that and then we'll grab this one and

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.630 
that and then we'll grab this one and
we'll<00:02:47.019> just<00:02:47.230> hit<00:02:47.319> shift<00:02:47.590> are<00:02:47.829> to<00:02:48.040> repeat<00:02:48.489> that

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
we'll just hit shift are to repeat that

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.819 
we'll just hit shift are to repeat that
and<00:02:48.940> then<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.930> can<00:02:50.079> start<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.440> see<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.709> we're

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
and then you can start to see that we're

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.610 
and then you can start to see that we're
getting<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:51.370> we<00:02:51.910> now<00:02:52.030> have<00:02:52.329> three<00:02:52.989> separate

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
getting is we now have three separate

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.610 
getting is we now have three separate
areas<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:55.000> we<00:02:55.209> can<00:02:55.450> create<00:02:56.170> our<00:02:56.380> finger

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
areas that we can create our finger

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.309 
areas that we can create our finger
holes<00:02:56.769> now<00:02:56.950> these<00:02:57.130> might<00:02:57.370> not<00:02:57.579> be<00:02:57.730> quite

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
holes now these might not be quite

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.839 
holes now these might not be quite
equally<00:02:59.319> distributed<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.549> may<00:03:00.670> not<00:03:00.700> be

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
equally distributed so it may not be

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.360 
equally distributed so it may not be
quite<00:03:01.209> ideal<00:03:01.599> but<00:03:02.170> that's<00:03:02.530> probably<00:03:02.920> okay

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
quite ideal but that's probably okay

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.229 
quite ideal but that's probably okay
from<00:03:04.360> here<00:03:04.690> what<00:03:05.019> we<00:03:05.110> can<00:03:05.260> do<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.650> just<00:03:05.709> hit<00:03:06.519> f2

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
from here what we can do is just hit f2

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.819 
from here what we can do is just hit f2
fill<00:03:07.480> each<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.780> these<00:03:07.840> with<00:03:08.049> an<00:03:08.140> end<00:03:08.290> on<00:03:08.410> such

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
fill each of these with an end on such

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.979 
fill each of these with an end on such
they<00:03:09.040> become<00:03:09.340> totally<00:03:09.760> flat<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.329> what's<00:03:10.840> nice

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
they become totally flat and what's nice

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.569 
they become totally flat and what's nice
about<00:03:11.049> this<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.470> now<00:03:11.739> we<00:03:11.799> can<00:03:12.040> inset<00:03:12.400> this

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
about this is now we can inset this

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.289 
about this is now we can inset this
again<00:03:13.180> go<00:03:13.930> in<00:03:14.079> just<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.709> little<00:03:14.890> bit<00:03:15.120> or<00:03:16.120> if<00:03:16.209> you

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
again go in just a little bit or if you

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.390 
again go in just a little bit or if you
don't<00:03:16.450> know<00:03:16.540> before<00:03:16.810> we<00:03:16.930> do<00:03:17.079> that<00:03:17.110> let's<00:03:17.829> bring

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
don't know before we do that let's bring

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.160 
don't know before we do that let's bring
up<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.609> loop<00:03:18.730> tools<00:03:18.940> so<00:03:19.480> one<00:03:19.780> issue<00:03:19.959> that<00:03:20.019> we

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
up the loop tools so one issue that we

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.680 
up the loop tools so one issue that we
have<00:03:20.319> at<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.440> moment<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.920> we<00:03:21.910> can<00:03:22.060> show<00:03:22.480> this

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
have at the moment and we can show this

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.360 
have at the moment and we can show this
is<00:03:22.930> if<00:03:23.079> we<00:03:23.260> add<00:03:23.410> in<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.650> subdivision<00:03:23.889> surface

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
is if we add in a subdivision surface

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.210 
is if we add in a subdivision surface
modifier<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.940> we<00:03:25.630> increase<00:03:25.959> this<00:03:26.220> settings

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
modifier and we increase this settings

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.650 
modifier and we increase this settings
we're<00:03:27.850> not<00:03:28.000> actually<00:03:28.239> going<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.569> get

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
we're not actually going to get

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.479 
we're not actually going to get
perfectly<00:03:29.109> smooth<00:03:29.500> circles<00:03:30.099> here<00:03:30.250> let<00:03:30.430> me

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
perfectly smooth circles here let me

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.099 
perfectly smooth circles here let me
just<00:03:30.670> delete<00:03:30.940> these<00:03:31.150> faces<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:31.810> you'll<00:03:31.989> see

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
just delete these faces and you'll see

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.379 
just delete these faces and you'll see
what<00:03:32.170> I<00:03:32.260> mean<00:03:32.290> there<00:03:33.069> oh<00:03:33.430> actually<00:03:34.030> they<00:03:34.239> look

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
what I mean there oh actually they look

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:35.910 
what I mean there oh actually they look
pretty<00:03:34.599> darn<00:03:34.810> close<00:03:35.049> but<00:03:35.440> just<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.769> ensure

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
pretty darn close but just to ensure

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.890 
pretty darn close but just to ensure
that<00:03:36.190> these<00:03:36.310> are<00:03:36.489> perfectly<00:03:36.940> round<00:03:37.239> let's

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
that these are perfectly round let's

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.110 
that these are perfectly round let's
bring<00:03:38.260> up<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.680> loop<00:03:38.950> tools<00:03:39.280> add-on<00:03:39.760> which<00:03:40.000> is

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
bring up the loop tools add-on which is

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.879 
bring up the loop tools add-on which is
bundled<00:03:40.510> with<00:03:40.599> blender<00:03:40.959> we'll<00:03:41.500> just<00:03:41.620> go<00:03:41.739> right

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
bundled with blender we'll just go right

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.860 
bundled with blender we'll just go right
into<00:03:42.069> edit<00:03:42.310> mode<00:03:42.340> switch<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.299> edge<00:03:43.450> select

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
into edit mode switch to edge select

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.229 
into edit mode switch to edge select
mode<00:03:44.139> and<00:03:44.410> then<00:03:44.829> just<00:03:45.040> using<00:03:45.400> our<00:03:45.549> loop<00:03:45.910> select

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
mode and then just using our loop select

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.180 
mode and then just using our loop select
with<00:03:46.389> alt<00:03:46.630> selection<00:03:47.260> mouse<00:03:47.410> just<00:03:47.919> select

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
with alt selection mouse just select

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.460 
with alt selection mouse just select
each<00:03:48.310> one<00:03:48.519> of<00:03:48.549> these<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:48.940> just<00:03:48.970> hit<00:03:49.630> W<00:03:50.109> loop

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
each one of these and just hit W loop

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.860 
each one of these and just hit W loop
tools<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.040> circle<00:03:51.609> and<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:52.450> looks<00:03:52.569> like<00:03:52.660> it

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
tools and circle and it looks like it

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.940 
tools and circle and it looks like it
didn't<00:03:53.019> actually<00:03:53.079> change<00:03:53.319> many<00:03:53.560> things<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:53.859> in

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
didn't actually change many things so in

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.710 
didn't actually change many things so in
this<00:03:54.040> case<00:03:54.250> we're<00:03:54.519> good<00:03:54.669> to<00:03:54.760> go<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.209> we<00:03:55.480> didn't

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
this case we're good to go and we didn't

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.729 
this case we're good to go and we didn't
really<00:03:55.840> need<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.079> worry<00:03:56.200> about<00:03:56.290> anything<00:03:56.530> in

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
really need to worry about anything in

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.860 
really need to worry about anything in
the<00:03:56.799> beginning<00:03:56.919> but<00:03:57.250> with<00:03:58.180> these<00:03:58.359> we<00:03:58.599> can<00:03:58.720> then

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
the beginning but with these we can then

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.809 
the beginning but with these we can then
reflect<00:03:59.290> these<00:03:59.410> will<00:03:59.739> fill<00:03:59.950> them<00:04:00.099> we'll<00:04:00.730> hit

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
reflect these will fill them we'll hit

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.319 
reflect these will fill them we'll hit
high<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.120> inset<00:04:01.720> just<00:04:02.169> a<00:04:02.290> little<00:04:02.530> bit<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.859> then

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
high to inset just a little bit and then

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.020 
high to inset just a little bit and then
we'll<00:04:04.329> do<00:04:04.450> it<00:04:04.569> again<00:04:04.660> we'll<00:04:05.319> push<00:04:05.530> it<00:04:05.650> in<00:04:05.799> and

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
we'll do it again we'll push it in and

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.449 
we'll do it again we'll push it in and
then<00:04:07.030> we'll<00:04:07.239> do<00:04:07.359> it<00:04:07.480> again<00:04:07.569> and<00:04:08.280> press<00:04:09.280> them

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
then we'll do it again and press them

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.650 
then we'll do it again and press them
way<00:04:09.669> in<00:04:10.440> say<00:04:11.440> something<00:04:11.889> like<00:04:11.919> that<00:04:12.069> and<00:04:12.660> then

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
way in say something like that and then

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.199 
way in say something like that and then
maybe<00:04:13.690> inside<00:04:14.260> one<00:04:14.530> more<00:04:14.799> time<00:04:15.069> just<00:04:15.430> for<00:04:16.000> good

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
maybe inside one more time just for good

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.870 
maybe inside one more time just for good
measure<00:04:16.269> and<00:04:16.750> like<00:04:17.560> that<00:04:17.799> we<00:04:18.160> now<00:04:18.340> have<00:04:18.639> our

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
measure and like that we now have our

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.699 
measure and like that we now have our
bowling<00:04:19.150> ball<00:04:19.299> holes<00:04:19.450> now<00:04:19.720> it's<00:04:19.959> not<00:04:20.229> quite

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
bowling ball holes now it's not quite

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.770 
bowling ball holes now it's not quite
perfect<00:04:21.190> you'll<00:04:21.969> notice<00:04:22.270> that<00:04:22.300> there's<00:04:22.719> a

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
perfect you'll notice that there's a

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.409 
perfect you'll notice that there's a
little<00:04:23.020> bit<00:04:23.200> of<00:04:23.260> a<00:04:23.409> dimple<00:04:23.860> right<00:04:24.580> here<00:04:24.940> it's

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
little bit of a dimple right here it's

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.730 
little bit of a dimple right here it's
pretty<00:04:25.659> subtle<00:04:26.229> but<00:04:26.979> you<00:04:27.190> can<00:04:27.340> see

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
pretty subtle but you can see

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.129 
pretty subtle but you can see
but<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.910> could<00:04:29.060> actually<00:04:29.240> repo<00:04:29.780> this<00:04:29.900> if<00:04:30.050> we

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
but you could actually repo this if we

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.170 
but you could actually repo this if we
grab<00:04:30.380> this<00:04:30.560> now<00:04:30.860> let's<00:04:31.280> add<00:04:31.430> in<00:04:31.580> another<00:04:31.669> ICO

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
grab this now let's add in another ICO

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.749 
grab this now let's add in another ICO
sphere<00:04:32.479> and<00:04:32.630> this<00:04:33.530> time<00:04:33.800> we're<00:04:34.130> going<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.400> use

face mode and we're going to grab say
this<00:04:48.650> face<00:04:48.889> and<00:04:50.289> you<00:04:51.289> know<00:04:51.319> let's<00:04:51.560> grow<00:04:51.830> that

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
this face and you know let's grow that

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.550 
this face and you know let's grow that
selection<00:04:52.280> ones<00:04:52.550> so<00:04:53.120> this<00:04:53.389> will<00:04:53.599> be<00:04:53.780> our<00:04:54.020> thumb

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
selection ones so this will be our thumb

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.990 
selection ones so this will be our thumb
hole<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:55.069> then<00:04:55.550> right<00:04:55.789> down<00:04:55.819> here<00:04:56.389> we<00:04:57.050> can<00:04:57.229> do

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
hole and then right down here we can do

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.629 
hole and then right down here we can do
the<00:04:59.000> finger<00:04:59.210> holes<00:04:59.710> so<00:05:00.710> this<00:05:01.009> these<00:05:01.220> might<00:05:01.460> be

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
the finger holes so this these might be

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.839 
the finger holes so this these might be
and<00:05:02.150> this<00:05:02.930> might<00:05:03.139> be<00:05:03.259> a<00:05:03.289> little<00:05:03.590> close<00:05:03.949> so<00:05:04.580> we

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
and this might be a little close so we

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.309 
and this might be a little close so we
could<00:05:05.000> maybe<00:05:05.150> shift<00:05:05.509> this<00:05:05.720> down<00:05:05.960> just<00:05:06.259> a

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
could maybe shift this down just a

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:07.809 
could maybe shift this down just a
little<00:05:06.440> bit<00:05:06.530> so<00:05:06.949> you<00:05:07.039> can<00:05:07.069> see<00:05:07.159> if<00:05:07.370> we<00:05:07.490> do<00:05:07.639> the

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
little bit so you can see if we do the

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.820 
little bit so you can see if we do the
four<00:05:08.270> subdivisions<00:05:08.930> we<00:05:09.110> get<00:05:09.259> a<00:05:09.289> little<00:05:09.560> bit

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
four subdivisions we get a little bit

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.399 
four subdivisions we get a little bit
more<00:05:10.569> control<00:05:11.569> and<00:05:11.690> a<00:05:11.900> little<00:05:12.110> bit<00:05:12.199> more

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
more control and a little bit more

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.399 
more control and a little bit more
flexibility<00:05:13.130> as<00:05:13.280> far<00:05:13.310> as<00:05:13.639> how<00:05:14.360> far<00:05:14.750> down<00:05:15.020> or

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
flexibility as far as how far down or

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.350 
flexibility as far as how far down or
how<00:05:15.560> far<00:05:15.770> apart<00:05:15.889> to<00:05:16.159> actually<00:05:16.639> make<00:05:16.819> these<00:05:17.030> and

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
how far apart to actually make these and

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.469 
how far apart to actually make these and
then<00:05:18.080> we<00:05:18.349> just<00:05:18.530> hit<00:05:18.650> I<00:05:18.800> we<00:05:19.490> in<00:05:19.669> set<00:05:19.940> these<00:05:20.150> and

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
then we just hit I we in set these and

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.510 
then we just hit I we in set these and
then<00:05:20.990> this<00:05:21.229> is<00:05:21.289> a<00:05:21.470> case<00:05:21.710> where<00:05:21.770> we<00:05:22.250> would<00:05:22.400> want

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
then this is a case where we would want

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.610 
then this is a case where we would want
to<00:05:22.669> definitely<00:05:22.909> select<00:05:23.270> this<00:05:23.419> one<00:05:23.479> and<00:05:23.900> we

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
to definitely select this one and we

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.290 
to definitely select this one and we
would<00:05:24.740> do<00:05:24.830> loop<00:05:25.039> cut<00:05:25.280> or<00:05:25.460> loop<00:05:25.759> tools<00:05:25.970> and

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
would do loop cut or loop tools and

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.980 
would do loop cut or loop tools and
circle<00:05:26.810> just<00:05:27.680> like<00:05:27.800> that<00:05:28.099> and<00:05:28.509> then<00:05:29.509> we<00:05:29.720> can<00:05:29.870> go

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
circle just like that and then we can go

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.680 
circle just like that and then we can go
and<00:05:30.139> we<00:05:30.289> can<00:05:30.319> select<00:05:30.560> these<00:05:30.800> and<00:05:31.479> maybe<00:05:32.479> this

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
and we can select these and maybe this

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.499 
and we can select these and maybe this
one<00:05:32.870> we<00:05:33.050> will<00:05:33.430> scale<00:05:34.430> in<00:05:34.639> just<00:05:35.150> a<00:05:35.240> little<00:05:35.389> bit

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:35.509 
one we will scale in just a little bit

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:40.180 
one we will scale in just a little bit
more<00:05:35.750> and<00:05:37.240> then<00:05:38.240> we<00:05:39.020> can<00:05:39.139> select<00:05:39.289> these<00:05:39.530> and<00:05:40.009> I

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
more and then we can select these and I

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.020 
more and then we can select these and I
to<00:05:40.250> inset<00:05:40.729> and<00:05:41.229> push<00:05:42.229> them<00:05:42.380> in<00:05:42.560> add<00:05:42.909> in<00:05:43.909> the

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
to inset and push them in add in the

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.209 
to inset and push them in add in the
subdivision<00:05:44.389> surface<00:05:44.810> modifier<00:05:45.219> increase

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:46.219 
subdivision surface modifier increase

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.909 
subdivision surface modifier increase
the<00:05:46.340> count<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:46.849> then<00:05:47.659> probably<00:05:48.169> you<00:05:48.710> know<00:05:48.740> we

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
the count and then probably you know we

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.709 
the count and then probably you know we
could<00:05:49.009> go<00:05:49.190> in<00:05:49.219> we<00:05:50.000> could<00:05:50.120> add<00:05:50.270> another<00:05:50.509> edge

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:50.719 
could go in we could add another edge

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.770 
could go in we could add another edge
loop<00:05:50.960> in<00:05:51.110> here<00:05:51.440> we<00:05:52.039> could<00:05:52.159> hit<00:05:52.219> e<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:53.419> flip<00:05:53.659> the

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
loop in here we could hit e to flip the

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.490 
loop in here we could hit e to flip the
even<00:05:54.219> either<00:05:55.219> way<00:05:55.449> we<00:05:56.449> could<00:05:56.659> add<00:05:57.020> in<00:05:57.229> another

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
even either way we could add in another

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.879 
even either way we could add in another
edge<00:05:57.800> loop<00:05:58.009> right<00:05:58.219> here<00:05:59.169> we<00:06:00.169> could<00:06:00.319> just<00:06:00.440> bevel

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 
edge loop right here we could just bevel

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.170 
edge loop right here we could just bevel
this<00:06:01.069> and<00:06:02.020> then<00:06:03.020> maybe<00:06:03.409> add<00:06:03.740> in<00:06:03.979> some<00:06:04.699> creasing

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
this and then maybe add in some creasing

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.570 
this and then maybe add in some creasing
and<00:06:07.990> there<00:06:08.990> you<00:06:09.110> go<00:06:09.229> so<00:06:09.710> there's<00:06:10.069> a<00:06:10.190> couple<00:06:10.430> of

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
and there you go so there's a couple of

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.430 
and there you go so there's a couple of
ways<00:06:10.940> to<00:06:10.969> model<00:06:11.690> the<00:06:11.870> holes<00:06:12.050> this<00:06:12.259> one

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
ways to model the holes this one

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.600 
ways to model the holes this one
definitely<00:06:12.560> works<00:06:12.860> a<00:06:12.949> little<00:06:13.069> better<00:06:13.219> so<00:06:13.580> I

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
definitely works a little better so I

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.980 
definitely works a little better so I
encourage<00:06:13.849> you<00:06:14.060> to<00:06:14.180> use<00:06:14.300> the<00:06:14.659> four

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
encourage you to use the four

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.120 
encourage you to use the four
subdivisions<00:06:15.530> you're<00:06:15.650> going<00:06:15.770> to<00:06:15.830> get<00:06:15.949> a

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
subdivisions you're going to get a

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.499 
subdivisions you're going to get a
little<00:06:16.460> bit<00:06:16.639> more<00:06:16.759> control<00:06:17.000> you're<00:06:17.330> going<00:06:17.449> to

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
little bit more control you're going to

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:19.180 
little bit more control you're going to
have<00:06:17.599> a<00:06:17.630> little<00:06:18.110> bit<00:06:18.289> denser<00:06:18.620> geometry<00:06:19.069> so

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
have a little bit denser geometry so

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.740 
have a little bit denser geometry so
it's<00:06:19.310> going<00:06:19.400> to<00:06:19.460> be<00:06:19.580> a<00:06:19.610> bit<00:06:19.759> smoother<00:06:20.270> you

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
it's going to be a bit smoother you

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.659 
it's going to be a bit smoother you
won't<00:06:20.960> get<00:06:21.169> the<00:06:21.409> artifacts<00:06:22.039> that<00:06:22.190> we<00:06:22.550> were

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
won't get the artifacts that we were

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.189 
won't get the artifacts that we were
getting<00:06:22.940> in<00:06:23.120> terms<00:06:23.360> of<00:06:23.479> the<00:06:23.630> the<00:06:23.960> shape

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
getting in terms of the the shape

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.740 
getting in terms of the the shape
profile<00:06:25.030> I'll<00:06:26.030> just<00:06:26.180> go<00:06:26.270> ahead<00:06:26.360> and<00:06:26.449> bevel

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
profile I'll just go ahead and bevel

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.980 
profile I'll just go ahead and bevel
these<00:06:26.900> as<00:06:27.169> well<00:06:27.740> and<00:06:28.099> then<00:06:28.969> once<00:06:29.150> again<00:06:29.389> select

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
these as well and then once again select

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.279 
these as well and then once again select
these<00:06:30.080> edges<00:06:30.469> shifty<00:06:31.479> increase<00:06:32.479> the<00:06:32.990> crease

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289 
these edges shifty increase the crease

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.189 
these edges shifty increase the crease
on<00:06:33.530> those<00:06:34.039> and<00:06:34.690> there<00:06:35.690> we<00:06:35.750> go<00:06:35.779> there's<00:06:36.169> a

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
on those and there we go there's a

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.500 
on those and there we go there's a
bowling<00:06:36.349> ball
