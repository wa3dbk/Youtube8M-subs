oh<00:00:05.990> hey<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.620> venue<00:00:07.830> give<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.280> card<00:00:08.639> and

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
oh hey is this venue give a card and

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.400 
oh hey is this venue give a card and
I've<00:00:08.940> got<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.150> deck<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.450> show<00:00:09.750> you<00:00:09.809> let's<00:00:10.080> get<00:00:10.230> to

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
I've got a deck to show you let's get to

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.080 
I've got a deck to show you let's get to
this<00:00:11.070> all<00:00:11.639> right<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:12.000> is

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
this all right this is

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.099 
this all right this is
empty<00:00:12.330> jar<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.049> idea<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.620> deck<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.070> to

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:15.109 
empty jar and the idea of the deck is to

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:17.300 
empty jar and the idea of the deck is to
make<00:00:16.109> your<00:00:16.230> point<00:00:16.440> run<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.830> cards<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.250> this

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
make your point run on the cards in this

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.370 
make your point run on the cards in this
deck<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.820> lose<00:00:18.060> because<00:00:19.050> these<00:00:19.140> are<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
deck and lose because these are the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.160 
deck and lose because these are the
cards<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.000> first<00:00:21.000> card<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.539> morphing<00:00:21.990> door

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
cards so first card is morphing door

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.560 
cards so first card is morphing door
best<00:00:22.640> probably<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.880> best<00:00:24.060> one<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.359> dug

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
best probably the best one in the dug

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.349 
best probably the best one in the dug
just<00:00:24.869> keeps<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:26.279> discard<00:00:26.670> their<00:00:26.789> hand<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.119> it

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
just keeps it discard their hand and it

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.009 
just keeps it discard their hand and it
it<00:00:28.080> gets<00:00:28.830> five<00:00:28.980> cards<00:00:29.010> oh<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.970> that's<00:00:30.779> really

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
it gets five cards oh so that's really

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.709 
it gets five cards oh so that's really
good<00:00:31.230> then<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.550> second<00:00:32.940> probably<00:00:33.210> best<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
good then the second probably best is

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.950 
good then the second probably best is
morphing<00:00:34.200> jar<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.640> three<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.760> them<00:00:35.960> morphing

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
morphing jar to three of them morphing

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.770 
morphing jar to three of them morphing
jar<00:00:36.989> -<00:00:37.879> if<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.120> don't<00:00:39.270> know<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> effect

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780

pretty much for every monster they have

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.360 
pretty much for every monster they have
on<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.050> field<00:00:43.260> those<00:00:43.649> all<00:00:43.800> go<00:00:43.950> back<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
on the field those all go back to the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.540 
on the field those all go back to the
deck<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.850> then<00:00:44.969> they<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:46.309> set<00:00:47.309> our

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
deck and then they have to set our

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.000 
deck and then they have to set our
summon<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.629> face<00:00:48.840> not<00:00:49.050> defense<00:00:49.289> position<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
summon and face not defense position the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.069 
summon and face not defense position the
same<00:00:50.250> amount<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.210> monsters<00:00:51.629> they<00:00:51.750> lost

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
same amount of the monsters they lost

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.410 
same amount of the monsters they lost
but<00:00:53.039> level<00:00:53.250> four<00:00:53.520> versions<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.300> they're

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
but level four versions so if they're

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.290 
but level four versions so if they're
running<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:55.789> monarchs<00:00:56.789> actually<00:00:57.149> they

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
running like monarchs actually they

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.119 
running like monarchs actually they
might<00:00:57.480> even<00:00:57.690> mill<00:00:58.050> off<00:00:58.260> some<00:00:58.469> monarchs<00:00:58.680> or

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
might even mill off some monarchs or

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.639 
might even mill off some monarchs or
some<00:00:59.430> higher-level<00:01:00.090> monsters<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.020> then<00:01:01.500> all

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
some higher-level monsters and then all

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.540 
some higher-level monsters and then all
the<00:01:01.770> rest<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> cards<00:01:02.340> go<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the rest of the cards go to the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.490 
the rest of the cards go to the
graveyard<00:01:02.609> obviously<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.660> that's<00:01:04.290> number

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
graveyard obviously so that's number

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.310 
graveyard obviously so that's number
this<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.739> second<00:01:05.040> part

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
this is second part
