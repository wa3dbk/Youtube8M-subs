 piety with a university of conception

 of the Campanile they went back to find this 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.310
 once in the always complicated court of 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.289
 feel talca south great public great 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.779
 environment in a match that is already a 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.699
 classic full basketball league 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.460
 directv would not give an ideal encounter 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.339
 on Wednesday and with a figure 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.520
 exclusive today with some has to

 26 points 11 assists and 6 rebounds 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.120
 they would become the directv player 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.329
 of the match 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.190
 triumph 89 82 of the local taking charge 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.430
 revenge of the defeat in the house of 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.620
 sport only a week ago and if 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.269
 a good defense I think we could do 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.440
 what we do not play in conception 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.600
 I want to grab the court and our 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.479
 strong could serve a lot we will do the 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.940
 court we put three without government space 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.560
 and we could be angry other than 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.840
 shone in the talkers was the 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.060
 American titus robinson with 25 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.220
 points followed by sergi and salamanca 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.649
 with 16 I had a very complete match 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.780
 against a great team it cost us a lot 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.369
 keep the difference and especially to 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.770
 final that that put us a bit over 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.240
 but then we did not know how to get it out 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.950
 basis of what we have been practicing 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.979
 during the week it's running 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.690
 defend running and good does not go well in 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.940
 the university of conception again 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.880
 the best hand was evandro arteaga with 20 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.399
 points followed by green dallas with 19 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.960
 although it was of little use to him after falling through 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.960
 second time is what's going tournament 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.930
 Talca's Spanish had its sweet revenge 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.360
 and the second triumph in a row for the 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.610
 team of judy abreu in the other sidewalk 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.710
 the concern of Pablo ares in a 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.840
 team that seeks to resume the victories 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.590
