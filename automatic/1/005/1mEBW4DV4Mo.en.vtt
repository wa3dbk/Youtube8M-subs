00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.860
 how is it in the crucial 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:14.370
 Seasonal to have such a long break 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:18.050
 unfamiliar I think that's stupid, too 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.699
 so long break has you then 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.519
 two more weeks come out, though 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.340
 trained hope that we as us 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.349
 have expanded a bit now 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.869
 to live up to words correctly 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.669
 So how did your training schedule look like that? 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.120
 last days and how are you now 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.579
 continue 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.739
 from the weekend so we have to 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.329
 weekend is completely free from friday 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.100
 sunday we can each other 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.980
 training on monday tuesday wednesday 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.360
 Thursday and Friday were playing 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.030
 the units now so the last week 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.520
 what has that done to you and 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.440
 Lets run a lot so long walks 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.530
 how much long routes and makes workout 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.579
 so far something for the legs 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.559
 but it was quite good that that 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.899
 had tempo tightened 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.150
 pick up the three days off and then off 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.040
 monday again normal 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.920
 again the series continued to step back 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.400
 against deggendorf how was your conclusion 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.520
 So the four games were so easy 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.150
 it is not science how much the now 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.190
 i have gained a lot of mistakes 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.600
 expect many not expect it to 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.790
 any case that is very difficult 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.430
 especially to play in deggendorf he was 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.350
 Retreating is right 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.880
 think hard for us then become us 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.760
 other teams are better off 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.230
 not so retreat in short though 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.440
 not easy for you like 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.780
 you interact with in a row 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.270
 rate with tobi and peter halouska 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.770
 you needed a little bit around you 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.440
 to be found again in any case 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.729
 At first I was surprised that nothing 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.490
 I ran back when I came back 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.050
 came complete and then we have one 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.790
 a few times with each other again 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.510
 and then just ran blind again 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.860
 just in the last game 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.119
 I think you have four out of five 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.140
 Contributed to the powerplay in the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.150
 series against deggendorf 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.310
 the balance was not so good on the 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.530
 bayreuth has another side in the series 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.709
 against toelz I think a black was 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.489
 of 34 percent had as meaningful 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.670
 is that, or is it rated now? 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.410
 too 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.700
 these are two different series are 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.040
 Maybe that's what Denkendorf has 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.810
 had a better number than partly and 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.870
 with all this so that even the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.430
 Main round had a top powerplay 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.800
 Exactly good powerplay now in the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.450
 playoffs too little train to gate too little 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.860
 shot 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.569
 I think that's just what people do 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.469
 done the other way around 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.180
 before the next opponent bayreuth like 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.060
 you prepare yourself personally to the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.260
 opponents of that do you worry or 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.230
 how do you prepare yourself before you go rather 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.090
 to your strengths and almost not at all 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.609
 so much to think about what the tigers are 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.920
 strong well we already know how the 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:02.159
 play between but we focus 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.049
 us on us so me personally me 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.689
 do not care if he would now 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.310
 the player is there 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.349
 we focus on looking at ourselves 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.469
 that we play our game and then 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:17.430
 we will probably hope so 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:19.379
 Come on, you have your time in 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.870
 Schwenningen mentions if you are up now 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.569
 this bl games look back what 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.699
 the most impressed you 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.290
 Physical hardness game in hall still 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:32.189
 times two heads bigger than in the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:36.480
 top league everything is faster harder 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:39.139
 better thought out that simply 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.719
 players there we go with a lot if you 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:45.389
 is in the fourth row is that 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:47.579
 your more pressurized as reducing 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.500
 first second or third row plays 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.849
 because he thinks of it as a trucker 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.849
 I see no tor must collect not 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.019
 it is completely different but it was familiar 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.040
 a very nice time and now I am 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.319
 Glad to be here again 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.759
 what are you taking from there with you? 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.799
 somehow really one or the other 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:03.569
 trick it or one or the other 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:08.129
 thing you did me the abgeguckt 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.900
 I play my very different 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.000
 more than in the top league shoot 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.440
 matif and we are running the power 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 So you can look at it purely 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.829
 you can already see something 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.400
 but you still have your own 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.720
 head and know what you have to do yourself 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.340
 but my question even if it is one 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.410
 a bit similar but you fall there 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.850
 also in the hole when in the color 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.039
 line arena in hamburg has played or 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.380
 against the cops and sharks now 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.570
 again with the upper against Oberliga 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.940
 adversary 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.320
 I do not think so it is that 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.050
 same only two different ones 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.850
 then are told here I have 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.770
 said it does not matter which player before the 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:52.710
 cities respect but no fear 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:56.580
 look ahead to bayreuth if you are there 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.380
 the games so on the next days up 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.570
 the game down to go you're there he 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.229
 nervous or increases with you there the 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.060
 anticipation 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:07.490
 the anticipation in every case so mine 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.389
 but both his body is so nervous 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.550
 I say powdered 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:15.000
 day by day is getting stronger and stronger 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.620
 is looking forward to more and is always like it 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.560
 simple is simply happy every day 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.180
 on it again and I am happy too 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.000
 frenzel men goes off 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.009
 if it's right before the game 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.960
 There is a player in the game 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.669
 Team all makes hot again 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.240
 or it goes on you doing still 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:36.539
 times in the cabin so close to the game 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.099
 before every playoff start so full of that 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.639
 first thinks only games we have one 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:47.039
 circle made with the caregivers coach 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:51.539
 captain philipp lame me push pushed 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:52.560
 and it was already making good what do you think 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:57.210
 how many spectators are coming against 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:06:01.710
 bayreuth friday in hand i hope 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:03.389
 At least 2500 Carnival three stores 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.499
 I hope I manage three 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:08.699
 guess it on 28 29 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:10.169
 last question what can the spectators 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:15.529
 expect to come to the hall on friday 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:17.699
 pure passion from you 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:20.669
 we will walk a lot we will 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.529
 fight to the top and the thing 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.879

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:27.599
