which<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.829> good<00:00:56.660> didn't<00:00:57.660> get<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.899> kind<00:00:58.820> that

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
which is good didn't get the kind that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.119 
which is good didn't get the kind that
just<00:01:00.260> give<00:01:01.260> these<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> means<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.039> then

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
just give these it means if you can then

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.429 
just give these it means if you can then
hear<00:01:02.309> yourself<00:01:02.670> well<00:01:03.090> you're<00:01:04.080> running<00:01:04.350> around

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
hear yourself well you're running around

if you come into the park problem

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.109 
if you come into the park problem
madness<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.369> basically<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.820> basically

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
madness so it's basically it's basically

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.780 
madness so it's basically it's basically
all<00:01:12.299> kind<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.540> straightforward<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:13.260> um

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
all kind of straightforward here um

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.210 
all kind of straightforward here um
that's<00:01:14.790> good<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.060> well<00:01:15.090> while<00:01:15.710> used<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:16.950> my

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
that's good as well while used with my

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
that's good as well while used with my
survival<00:01:18.150> marker<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.229> then<00:01:19.729> sir<00:01:20.729> which

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
survival marker and then sir which

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.050 
survival marker and then sir which
eschews<00:01:21.479> are<00:01:21.750> linked<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.830> glyphs<00:01:23.070> I've

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
eschews are linked on in the glyphs I've

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.999 
eschews are linked on in the glyphs I've
got<00:01:24.330> my<00:01:24.689> angle<00:01:24.930> because<00:01:25.320> actually<00:01:25.710> attack

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
got my angle because actually attack

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.060 
got my angle because actually attack
because<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.460> more<00:01:26.610> often<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.829> get

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
because it's more often that you can get

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.539 
because it's more often that you can get
a<00:01:29.960> shred<00:01:30.960> spam<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.710> some<00:01:31.920> ad<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.220> look<00:01:32.369> around

once again with my summer home by four
works<00:01:39.689> well<00:01:39.930> let<00:01:40.740> rip<00:01:41.040> that's<00:01:41.729> good<00:01:41.939> because

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
works well let rip that's good because

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.649 
works well let rip that's good because
that's<00:01:42.780> your<00:01:43.140> mainly<00:01:43.500> damage<00:01:43.860> attack<00:01:44.070> really

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
that's your mainly damage attack really

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.200 
that's your mainly damage attack really
that<00:01:45.659> not<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.530> needed<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.970> good

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
that not really needed that is good

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.450 
that not really needed that is good
you'll<00:01:48.930> need<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.229> add<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.409> lot<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.770> go<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.009> like

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
you'll need to add a lot to go to like

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.550 
you'll need to add a lot to go to like
frost<00:01:50.729> /<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.210> kind<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.420> thing<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.170> time<00:01:52.380> on

there's<00:02:05.189> two<00:02:05.369> main<00:02:05.700> ways<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.680> reforge<00:02:07.680> really

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
there's two main ways to reforge really

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.380 
there's two main ways to reforge really
on<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.729> either<00:02:08.849> reforged

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
on to it you can either reforged

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.280 
on to it you can either reforged
straight<00:02:09.690> for<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.679> know<00:02:10.830> print<00:02:11.610> or<00:02:12.260> listen<00:02:13.260> to

as<00:02:13.829> well<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.129> can<00:02:14.250> basically<00:02:14.459> fill<00:02:15.420> threat

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
as well you can basically fill threat

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.229 
as well you can basically fill threat
Phil<00:02:16.560> jelly-filled<00:02:17.400> damage<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:17.909> what<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.030> like
