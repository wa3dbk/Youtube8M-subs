bit of rough rough treatment not at all

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.250 
bit of rough rough treatment not at all
no<00:00:32.099> no<00:00:32.360> probably<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> other<00:00:33.570> side<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.079> is

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
no no probably the other side it is

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.530 
no no probably the other side it is
giving<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.370> an<00:00:35.640> easy<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.030> go<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.420> there

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
giving it an easy to go here and there

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.170 
giving it an easy to go here and there
but<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.870> know<00:00:37.350> overall<00:00:38.010> was<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.879> good

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
but I know overall was just a good

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.340 
but I know overall was just a good
competitive<00:00:39.629> game<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:41.270> just<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.989> same<00:00:43.230> is

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
competitive game and just the same is

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.440 
competitive game and just the same is
just<00:00:43.500> capitalized<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.190> all<00:00:44.460> our<00:00:44.640> errors<00:00:45.059> they

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
just capitalized in all our errors they

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.029 
just capitalized in all our errors they
punished<00:00:45.840> us<00:00:45.989> every<00:00:46.289> time<00:00:46.320> they<00:00:46.620> could<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
punished us every time they could and

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.209 
punished us every time they could and
thus<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.879> results<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.350> where<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.890> definitely

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
thus the results so where we definitely

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.680 
thus the results so where we definitely
have<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> few<00:00:50.520> things<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.660> improve<00:00:52.020> and

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
have a few things to to to improve and

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.709

making<00:00:54.690> any<00:00:54.809> excuses<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:56.309> ourselves<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.850> think

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
making any excuses for ourselves I think

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.680
