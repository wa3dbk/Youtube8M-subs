00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.309
 lomb 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.679
 hello guys forward yours and drink more 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.160
 a bit of pocket and nowadays 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.090
 one 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.240
 sinister legends not sinister legends of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.880
 today we will talk about the scary photos 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.070
 postmortem has a theme suggested by the fine 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.010
 men in the comments of the legends 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.670
 and this is a fact is not a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.130
 legend 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.920
 in this picture speak of any subject 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.059
 which I judge to be scary and not only 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.790
 legends but then what is the pictures as 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.360
 dead in bonn the word postmortem in come 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.700
 from Latin and means post-death or 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.890
 are photos taken after the person 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.289
 get out of this for the better 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.280
 people do it with seria 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.050
 goal 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.989
 nowadays this is no longer done 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.780
 necessary but once had a 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.449
 photo was not as easy as it is in the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.119
 days and sometimes the only photo that 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.189
 a guy took in all his existence 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.869
 was to draw after he would pass away to 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.450
 that the family could have a 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.939
 reminder of the unfortunate who started with 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.369
 this custom was the queen's victory there in 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.979
 England who asked to photograph a 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.530
 corpse of an acquaintance or relative to 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.270
 that she could keep a memory 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.400
 then this tradition began to spread 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.500
 around the world 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.570
 now for the families had joined the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.280
 this macabre way to remember your being 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.700
 Dear, I'll tell you one 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.070
 thing to my grandmother did this she took a 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.009
 picture of my grandfather who died in the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.009
 70 for souvenir or souvenir 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.229
 this custom is not so unusual but 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.659
 now came the bizarre side of the thing is 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.880
 as if taking a photo of a deceased person no longer 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.189
 it was bizarre enough that for 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.380
 the photos were very close to the real 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.899
 they made it appear that the deceased 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.600
 were sleeping or forced to 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.829
 people as sitting and interacting 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.020
 with the living 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.380
 some were so well assembled that it is 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.959
 difficult to know who the background is 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.420
 I've separated some scary photos to 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.760
 Do you recommend watching this video at night? 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.290
 will lose funds if you feel disrespected 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.330
 for your profaned rest online 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.830
 they are seeing this beautiful baby to look at 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.610
 penetrating 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.849
 he is dead this one almost deceives 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.920
 but the woman is dead 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.959
 in this other one the seated woman is dead 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.030
 here do a good job because the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.700
 seems almost to have outlined a 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.650
 feeling and this boy is sleeping 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.930
 during a boring session then vote 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.970
 no he is a deceased in question 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.510
 positioned to appear to be 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.209
 sleeping here and another dead child 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.400
 it is worth remembering that at that time, the 19th century 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.130
 if there are many children die, 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.440
 infant mortality was very high 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.970
 always those that are born the practically 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.660
 half did not reach the age of five 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.239
 age 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.060
 This photo of dead looks like 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.099
 open eyes but in reality in this 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.769
 photo was used a technique as to whether 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.940
 paints the eyelids to look like 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.370
 eyes open 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.220
 this was done after the photo was revealed 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.170
 and in this one both the baby and the mother 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.690
 they're dead 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.810
 and in the latter the girl in black standing 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.639
 is dead but this image is marked 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.940
 that you can see the river signs 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:31.040
 deaths that is the beginning of decomposition 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.810
 look at her hands and notice how 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.500
 they are darker than 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.940
 face 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.060
 this happens because of the concentration 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.319
 the blood circulating no longer short 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.480
 I'm going to stay here 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.700
 if I continue I know that many will not 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.510
 get a good night's sleep by remembering 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.459

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.239
