was called the landfall mechanic and

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.250 
was called the landfall mechanic and
about<00:02:09.610> creating<00:02:10.000> elemental<00:02:10.570> creatures<00:02:10.960> those

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
about creating elemental creatures those

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.170 
about creating elemental creatures those
are<00:02:11.410> two<00:02:11.560> things<00:02:11.740> that<00:02:12.040> players<00:02:12.520> associate

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
are two things that players associate

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.790 
are two things that players associate
very<00:02:13.360> closely<00:02:13.660> with<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.050> plane<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.260> zendikar

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
very closely with the plane of zendikar

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.590 
very closely with the plane of zendikar
and<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.430> it's<00:02:15.580> kind<00:02:15.820> of<00:02:15.850> this<00:02:15.970> nice<00:02:16.180> package

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
and so it's kind of this nice package

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.840 
and so it's kind of this nice package
that<00:02:16.810> just<00:02:16.990> points<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.650> right<00:02:17.830> back<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.040> what

one of my favorite things about pizza is
that<00:05:16.729> while<00:05:17.630> she<00:05:17.660> is<00:05:18.260> incredibly<00:05:18.979> powerful

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
that while she is incredibly powerful

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.540 
that while she is incredibly powerful
she<00:05:20.210> is<00:05:20.240> equally<00:05:20.810> as<00:05:21.080> compassionate<00:05:21.740> and<00:05:21.919> from

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
she is equally as compassionate and from

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.190 
she is equally as compassionate and from
the<00:05:22.669> smallest<00:05:22.940> to<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.240> largest<00:05:23.360> of<00:05:23.810> life<00:05:23.990> she

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
the smallest to the largest of life she

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.930 
the smallest to the largest of life she
cares<00:05:24.410> about<00:05:24.560> everything

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
cares about everything

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.960 
cares about everything
tread<00:05:26.150> with<00:05:26.360> care<00:05:26.600> so<00:05:27.370> some<00:05:28.370> people<00:05:28.490> think<00:05:28.790> of

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
tread with care so some people think of

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.850 
tread with care so some people think of
magic<00:05:29.300> origins<00:05:29.660> as<00:05:29.810> being<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.140> last<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:30.680> last

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
magic origins as being the last the last

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.190 
magic origins as being the last the last
quartet<00:05:31.490> but<00:05:31.880> I<00:05:31.940> don't<00:05:32.120> think<00:05:32.240> of<00:05:32.300> that<00:05:32.330> at<00:05:32.810> all

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
quartet but I don't think of that at all

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.630 
quartet but I don't think of that at all
I<00:05:33.230> think<00:05:33.590> magic<00:05:33.710> origins<00:05:34.190> is<00:05:34.310> being<00:05:34.490> at<00:05:34.580> the

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
I think magic origins is being at the

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.100 
I think magic origins is being at the
beginning<00:05:34.970> the<00:05:35.420> start<00:05:35.600> of<00:05:35.780> something<00:05:35.990> new
