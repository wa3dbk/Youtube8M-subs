00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
of them at the same time and less than a

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.160 
of them at the same time and less than a
panic<00:05:15.320> situation<00:05:16.600> you<00:05:17.600> want<00:05:17.750> to<00:05:17.810> just<00:05:17.930> fire

panic situation you want to just fire

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.960 
panic situation you want to just fire
one<00:05:18.530> so<00:05:18.920> you<00:05:19.010> can<00:05:19.160> always<00:05:19.310> have<00:05:19.550> one<00:05:19.820> at<00:05:19.940> the

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
one so you can always have one at the

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.190 
one so you can always have one at the
ready<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.450> you're<00:05:20.510> never<00:05:20.720> at<00:05:20.900> a<00:05:20.930> major

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
ready and you're never at a major

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.620 
ready and you're never at a major
disadvantage<00:05:21.820> it's<00:05:22.820> pretty<00:05:23.000> good<00:05:23.090> tactic

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
disadvantage it's pretty good tactic
