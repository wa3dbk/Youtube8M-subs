00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 to then now as I read the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.210
 professor roll or forgiveness or the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.830
 slip previously explained as 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.110
 that guitarist we have habits 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.599
 pentatonic so then already here here with 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.070
 a major tonic skate play play here 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.180
 we already have some reflexes we can 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.650
 use but it's going to be as wide 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.289
 minor because we often have 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:29.010
 two girls habits rist on fit 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:31.260
 invented a term to any kind of plan c 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.369
 us what is our culture for the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.020
 most guitarists in any case 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.300
 rather trendy blues rock music 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.950
 current is all that so 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.450
 the goal of the game is going to be to find or 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.690
 should we play minors 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.570
 so let's not think of panic here 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.280
 we invalidated the Lydian corresponds to the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.710
 degree 4 of the harmonization of the range 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.289
 major so degree 4 so I'm leaving 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.399
 always here always the same forms 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.809
 chords like I showed you to 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.030
 from the second string 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.289
 because these practices wonder about art 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.600
 only one diagram 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.699
 final chord sequence so we start from 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.260
 fire here our fourth degree 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.909
 so ok what are we looking for the sixth 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.270
 degree the minor range natural and well 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.189
 it's simple if this pardon excuse me 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.070
 it is sure the 4th degree so the mode 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.580
 line 1 the fourth the fifth the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.140
 milk solidian mode is the sixth degree 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.040
 the wind mode it is him who we 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.600
 not interested in what we want to enjoy 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.220
 in this world years in this range there in 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.890
 does it mean it here 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.049
 the minor 7 we can improvise in the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.210
 minor on our madness well we take on 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.130
 can improvise in A minor and by 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.290
 extension in a pentatonic minor so 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.610
 demonstration I prove it to you 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.610
 I'm going to play in a minor 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.200
 now I'm going to play a little 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.200
 when the tonic paste 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.380
 so that's very handy shot 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.000
 because it was already full of tools is 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.860
 to basically say I summarize everything 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.240
 we have this the position we have 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.590
 learned by heart stupidly who is 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.850
 practical because it 3 in our park 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.940
 so it really allows room and 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.720
 all our plans etc 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.980
 finally all the plans back and forth 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:20.920
 all the plans the cakes etc 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:23.190
 we have the same octave we have our 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.190
 arpeggio 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:34.270
 here we have our range of F major and we 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.320
 has in addition and the range of the minor 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.630
 pentatonic and minor natural range 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.250
 do not want the minor natural range 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.750
 from there and knowing that if you've been to 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.000
 good students you learned both 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.440
 positions and ultimately what is 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.120
 pass we all know the handle I want 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.519
 to say there we start from there we all know 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.560
 that's when we did not learn the mode 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.640
 lydian degree by degree in 3 our 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.040
 course during lead time 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.360
 so it takes a little a little 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.650
 brain work that is to say there is 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.190
 a logic there is a principle to 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.290
 understand 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.880
 once we understand the thing it's okay 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.070
 all alone frankly it goes alone 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.070
 because of the improvising coup solidien 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.850
 we are not going to stupidly give our 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.850
 positions 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.950
 basically is not going to do the elevator in 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.330
 rising and falling positions there 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.860
 we can immediately start from what we 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.910
 know to know the pentatonic range 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.910
 the pentatonic plans 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.720
 no 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.070
 we are at home and after one 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.810
 has gained confidence because trust 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.190
 is an essential part of 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.270
 improvisation is really here 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.640
 it's the self-confidence that you need 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.570
 actually develop once we've taken 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.250
 trust because we know where we are 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.990
 know our plans in this register 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.990
 there we can start to venture 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:05.330
 arpeggios then go into the range 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.400
 minors et cetera and so on and 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.660
 venturing into terrain as you go 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.710
 as his experience and his 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.260
 habit of improvising 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.780
 more and more more and more unknown 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.660
 more and more the bar and that changes 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.790
 precisely of the clasico plans of the 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.140
 classic blues and rock plans and but that 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.100
 is done gently it's small to 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.430
 small ie we learn to 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.690
 also know another way of 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.250
 play the pentatonic scale because that 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.180
 sound not the same we will not insist on 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.410
 the same notes etc 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.540
 the musicality that developed 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.190
 different but at least we have a point 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.780
 known starting which is the range 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.510
 pentatonic you just have to do everything 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.290
 logical backward path in fact of 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.240
 take this whole story 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.300
 of harmonization to say ok fa lydien 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.220
 so degree 4 I'm looking for degree 6 ok 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.450
 so the degree if it's going to be there so 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.430
 that means that on a fabien I can 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.660
 play the minor and from there that's it 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.669
 we can place all his plans in minor 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.350
 etc see how they sound diarra yes 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.640
 it sounds good but it should be jeans 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.680
 safer cys such notes etc 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.790
 that develops their have also here for this 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.860
 first example give you one 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.669
 second power if you have 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.830
 understood the principle 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:07.150
 so let's put a clever spirit on you 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.150
 asks to improvise the teenager nothing 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.460
 so always the same we do not panic 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.639
 logical reasoning 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.680
 good here already there it's a fashion 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.960
 minor so by extension we can play 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.720
 already there of orians a position that we have 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.789
 learned and the pentatonic minor 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.960
 since by extension the minor 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.699
 it is the mode of nothing from which one has removed 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.750
 the notes because quite characteristic so 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.750
 we can play on it quite 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.800
 so we already have range it's not already 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.110
 wrong now always the same the 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.220
 repeche corresponding the minor the 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.630
 minor this part so go get it 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:49.720
 here we already have that we control it and 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.740
 that on the neck is now we can 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.200
 also look for what we can play 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.080
 others so that is here the de 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.360
 nothing is degree 2 then degree 2 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.890
 we are going to look for degree 6 always 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.170
 like the natural minor range since 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.390
 we are used to this range that we have our 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.710
 little habits in here so we 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.460
 always takes the same from the 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:11.890
 second rope our the minor this 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.720
 pardon which corresponds to degree 2 and one 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.100
 go get the degree 6 there in 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.240
 the occurrence it will be more convenient 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.620
 because here I will arrive a little 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.370
 little to the confines of hot moments actually 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.530
 in terms of height 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.080
 so I'm going to go down there is to 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:28.700
 to say I'm going from degree 2 ° 1 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:31.889
 which is therefore a G major 7 degree 7 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.650
 F sharp minor bag A flat grade 6 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.840
 my mi minor set that so that means 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:41.110
 so that on the spot 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.860
 I can improvise in E minor so 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.860
 it's a judge like that 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.080
 we can see that it works and by 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.290
 extension also in E minor as to 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.290
 tony 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.340
 here after we can also extend the 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.540
 trick search where is the Phrygian mode 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.430
 because we can play pentatonic 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.960
 maignan also on the free comes good already 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.100
 there just with that since I you 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.380
 reminds that painting is that the 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.420
 pinta tonic minors in put in knows 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.080
 it's all eating so I think ya already 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.300
 what to have fun 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.610
 Here on the situation there anything here 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.070
 so it's over for this example 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.150
 I hope you do not have too much trouble 

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.830
 to digest all this is true that it is 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.360
 very indigestible at first because there is 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.800
 a logical progression that must be 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.960
 get to do to the place and to 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.700
 upside to navigate well but 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.140
 believe me really it avoids hours 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.060
 and hours of schema learning 

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.590
 of degree by degree which are 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.630
 sterile because in addition we will have 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.900
 no expressiveness unless you pass 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.980
 hours for kind three lives at the 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.360
 half-time we can end up being 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.740
 comfortable but the advantage is that as 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.390
 that guitarist we find each time 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.740
 its marks by searching where we can 

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.300
 play kid and their pata ranges 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.880
 minors we find its marks of 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.320
 rocker bluesman and that's it's learning 

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.880
 make them sound different to do 

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.070
 sound differently his plans following 

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.950
 to venture a little beyond etc. 

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:01.630
 so here is a good courage I hope that 

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.580
 I hope it does not ask you too much 

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:09.400
 of problems ben so what is it
