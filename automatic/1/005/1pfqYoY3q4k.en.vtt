00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.640
 is full and pirate and very simple and about 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.380
 all free inside my channel that is 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.680
 the gameplay in here is that he had another 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.650
 tutorial but and some non- aggressive and 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.019
 it was not vital and so here I bring the ri 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.570
 pak and good and the first thing that you have to 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:44.960
 do is leave in the description to 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.420
 download you enter it and you give it 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.420
 even a do it once you have it 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.170
 loaded this file will appear if not 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.239
 you have the wing the weird boom what 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.630
 install is and I will appear here 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.330
 these legalized booklets will bring here 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.180
 to see that I have it and once I'm 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.000
 that is extracted will not appear this 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.480
 folder here that puts minecraft and for 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.040
 true the executable is garlic dropped 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.440
 well once you have this you have to 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.650
 have the hub installed so I leave you 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.890
 that a direct access you give here what 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.040
 charges and you already download everything and then already 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.460
 you just have to give here to 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.360
 Minecraft 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.280
 and yazira 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.610
 someone shear minecraft ford city 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:39.400
 because version 1.1 or 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.780
 something like that and then having that folder 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.870
 to see it is clear that explain very well 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.080
 but look you just have to give access 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.310
 direct and this folder will be copied 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.890
 automatically 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.460
 here you have to put the piece by 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.340
 hundred here and then I will work 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.500
 correctly without having to say many 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.210
 rolls as they say out there no destroyer 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.390
 yale yes 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.909
 the one that arrived how good I have here 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.720
 the minecraft as you see completely full 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.610
 in Spanish on the subject you want and what 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.240
 you can update right now I have it 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.750
 in 1.5 points simply because that 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.760
 you think you almost have to go out to 1.5 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.670
 point 3 not the problem of reinforcement of 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.610
 it center game and I'm already this effect the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.160
 accessory as you see 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.190
 after closing it had nothing more than 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.110
 tell you that if you liked it and 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.970
