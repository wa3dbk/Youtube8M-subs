00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680
 hello in this tutorial i will show you how 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.179
 knit facial and purl loops 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.990
 facial loops can be knit by several 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.179
 in ways 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.349
 but the most common ones are 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.650
 classic way 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.650
 and grandmothers after you scored 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.320
 loops can be knotted already facial and 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.180
 purl first loop we always 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.180
 remove because it edge 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.419
 then 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:36.110
 if in the classical way we introduce a loop 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.770
 from left to right we enter the needle into the loop on the left 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.100
 right 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.370
 for the front wall you see a loop 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.700
 is divided 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.820
 in two parts 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.170
 here is the front wall which is in front of you 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.840
 on the spokes 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.670
 and the back wall which is behind 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.300
 for the classic way we need 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.860
 enter the knitting needle over the front wall now 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.860
 you are connected 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.320
 so it will be for the front wall 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.980
 here 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.840
 grabbing the thread 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.090
 take it out 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.100
 throw off the needles so loop new 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.100
 it turns out we have on the right spoke 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.950
 again 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.950
 we introduce a needle 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.560
 from left to right 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.190
 grabbing the thread 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.220
 like this schemes and on this side and 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.820
 throw off the loop 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.820
 again 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.659
 enter knitting needle from left to right 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.220
 grab the thread on the index finger 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.330
 take out a loop 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.330
 it's a classic way 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.660
 to knit grandmother's facial loops 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.620
 in a way 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.200
 sleeps injected in behind the back wall 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.060
 from right to left 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.530
 we enter a needle we seize a thread 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:27.460
 we take out and throw off the loop on the left 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.110
 knitting needle that is right and 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.030
 again 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.640
 we introduce a needle for the back wall 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.640
 lock loop 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.640
 throwing off 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.760
 here 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.459
 when will you knit any 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:50.180
 the product in the default scheme is considered 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.379
 that loop knitted in the classic way 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.760
 that is, it must be considered when 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:03:00.260
 some are not and some schemes may 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.379
 look not so patterns if you will 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.409
 knit grandma loops but if you 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.900
 knit the facial surface so it is not 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.700
 fundamentally loops on density for this 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.859
 not affected and 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.319
 breezes still get smooth 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.980
 now purl to knit 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.699
 wrong side 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.719
 purl loop working thread which you 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:27.560
 knit you need to keep before knitting here 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:31.449
 so and then the needle we introduce for the front 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.449
 wall under the working thread 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:41.190
 here we are here and so 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:46.140
 grasp the thread working and pull out 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.030
 and throw off the knitting needles again not now 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.120
 knitting 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.120
 we introduce a needle 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.730
 not 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:04.819
 grasp the thread 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.819
 drags the loop off the knitting needles 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.470
 next thread again before knitting 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.670
 wrap a thread 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.650
 pulling a nagging mom noose from throwing so 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.650
 knitting needles 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.850
 here 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.930
 thus knit seam loop 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.940
 back loop 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.150
 looks like facial here is hard to see 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.510
 because a little knit and also 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.970
 vice versa facial hinges with purl 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.970
 hand looks like 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.970
 purl 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.360
