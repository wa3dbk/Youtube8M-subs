00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.490 
final mix and it only really works the
perfectly<00:00:32.029> if<00:00:32.270> you're<00:00:32.480> on<00:00:32.599> critical<00:00:33.140> mode<00:00:33.350> or

at level 1 as opposed on other
difficulty<00:00:36.380> levels<00:00:36.710> they<00:00:36.829> could<00:00:36.980> work<00:00:37.190> but

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
difficulty levels they could work but

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.170 
difficulty levels they could work but
you<00:00:38.420> could<00:00:38.600> have<00:00:38.770> so<00:00:39.770> much<00:00:39.950> like<00:00:40.250> HP<00:00:41.030> and

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.549 
you could have so much like HP and
whatnot<00:00:41.600> that<00:00:41.630> the<00:00:42.020> trick<00:00:42.260> won't<00:00:42.469> work

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
whatnot that the trick won't work

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.759 
whatnot that the trick won't work
properly<00:00:42.879> so<00:00:43.879> basically<00:00:44.300> on<00:00:44.719> once<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.469> cavern

and do the same thing over and over

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.089 
and do the same thing over and over
again<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:06.519> that<00:04:06.910> is<00:04:07.060> how<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.269> trick<00:04:07.660> works

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
again and that is how the trick works

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.770 
again and that is how the trick works
even<00:04:09.099> when<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.579> die<00:04:09.790> you<00:04:10.239> keep<00:04:10.569> the

even when you die you keep the
experience<00:04:11.470> so<00:04:12.430> then<00:04:12.609> you<00:04:12.849> just<00:04:13.260> respawn<00:04:14.260> and

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
experience so then you just respawn and

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.849 
experience so then you just respawn and

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
then these are balls have all the drive

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.920 
then these are balls have all the drive
herbs<00:04:18.160> that<00:04:18.220> they<00:04:18.430> contain<00:04:18.820> that<00:04:19.090> so<00:04:19.630> then<00:04:19.810> you

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
herbs that they contain that so then you

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.320 
herbs that they contain that so then you
just<00:04:20.139> attack<00:04:20.470> them<00:04:20.709> again<00:04:20.979> and<00:04:21.190> then<00:04:21.849> just

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
just attack them again and then just

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.629 
just attack them again and then just

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.640 
personally I'm just going to get this to
level<00:04:56.090> 6<00:04:56.360> which<00:04:56.540> is<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.810> highest<00:04:56.930> level<00:04:57.410> I<00:04:57.470> can

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
level 6 which is the highest level I can

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.170 
level 6 which is the highest level I can
get<00:04:57.800> any<00:04:57.980> of<00:04:58.070> my<00:04:58.130> drive<00:04:58.460> forms<00:04:58.760> to<00:04:58.910> at<00:04:59.060> the

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
get any of my drive forms to at the

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.020 
get any of my drive forms to at the
current<00:04:59.450> moment<00:04:59.630> just<00:05:00.560> because<00:05:00.920> and<00:05:01.280> as<00:05:01.880> you

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
current moment just because and as you

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.710 
current moment just because and as you
see<00:05:02.210> we<00:05:02.390> now<00:05:02.540> have<00:05:02.780> aerial<00:05:03.320> dodge<00:05:03.530> which<00:05:04.040> is

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
see we now have aerial dodge which is

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.340 
see we now have aerial dodge which is
master<00:05:05.720> forms<00:05:06.230> on<00:05:07.780> ability<00:05:08.780> we<00:05:08.900> also<00:05:09.050> have

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
master forms on ability we also have

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.730 
master forms on ability we also have
Auto<00:05:09.680> master<00:05:10.370> but<00:05:10.640> master<00:05:11.480> form<00:05:11.690> sucks<00:05:12.020> it's

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
Auto master but master form sucks it's

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:21.180 
Auto master but master form sucks it's
only<00:05:13.010> good<00:05:13.160> for<00:05:15.550> aerial<00:05:16.550> dodge<00:05:16.730> in<00:05:16.970> my<00:05:17.090> opinion

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.600 

so<00:05:22.190> anyway<00:05:22.520> uh<00:05:23.170> that<00:05:24.170> is<00:05:24.500> Ariel<00:05:25.040> dodge<00:05:25.250> it

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
so anyway uh that is Ariel dodge it

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.430 
so anyway uh that is Ariel dodge it
basically<00:05:26.360> gives<00:05:26.600> you<00:05:26.750> invincibility<00:05:27.260> frames

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
basically gives you invincibility frames

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.720 
basically gives you invincibility frames
in<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:27.950> air<00:05:28.100> and<00:05:28.700> it<00:05:28.820> also<00:05:29.030> acts<00:05:29.480> as<00:05:29.810> a<00:05:29.870> nice

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
in the air and it also acts as a nice

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.320 
in the air and it also acts as a nice
almost<00:05:31.730> kind<00:05:32.000> of<00:05:32.060> an<00:05:32.210> aerial<00:05:32.660> dodge<00:05:33.590> roll<00:05:34.270> or<00:05:35.270> a

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
almost kind of an aerial dodge roll or a

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.350 
almost kind of an aerial dodge roll or a
double<00:05:35.840> jump<00:05:36.260> so<00:05:39.370> so<00:05:40.370> yeah<00:05:40.580> you<00:05:40.640> get<00:05:41.000> the<00:05:41.120> point
