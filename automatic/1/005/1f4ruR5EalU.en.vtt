 hi everyone from techno dino do 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.650
 point it 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.230
 today thanks to the online store optimus 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.660
 dot it I show you a product really 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.540
 interesting as you see is called 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.380
 liquid crystal luzon protection class 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:38.340
 what it is is a protection it uses 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.880
 nanotechnology big words words 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.180
 we say that will make ours 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:48.989
 technological device that tablet a 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.719
 monitor display a smartphone o 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.070
 anything will make it resistant 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.010
 to fingerprints resistant even to scratches 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.179
 this maybe I believe a little bit of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:07.920
 will make it less resistant even to 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:11.040
 we say bacteria cleans it so 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.030
 really deep and gives them one 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.950
 oleophobic protection from really good 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.110
 I'll show you what it is first 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.440
 as you see in the package we have two 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.900
 bath two simple cloths that one serves 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.640
 to clean the device well and the other 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.330
 serves to apply the project 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.410
 i will use the trusty galaxy s 4 like 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.590
 guinea pig 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.230
 as you will see in the back and if I don't know if yes 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.920
 however, he sees everything full of life 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.720
 you 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.880
 we are going to apply the product 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.880
 we separate the 2 2 sachets we open the first one 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.690
 tv the chorus server to clean the product 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:05.220
 Eye shadow to clean the smartphone is a 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:08.789
 damp cloth that will serve as a preta 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.080
 pretreat pretreat let's say the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.080
 our smartphone 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.430
 we are going to clean it well in all 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.430
 its parts 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.390
 ok i think the job is more than that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.390
 enough 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.450
 we wait a few moments for it to dry 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:05.570
 and in the meantime let's go and get it 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:05.570
 the other one we open the second envelope 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.709
 we are going to apply the treatment 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.270
 let's start with the display 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.930
 here then we go to the back 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.560
 we also do at the sides 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:51.550
 see you a blow even in front later 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.819
 this treatment must be left 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.300
 rest the smartphone for about 5 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.020
 minutes 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:04.180
 we drive flower are 17 04 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.250
 soon goodbye behold i have passed i 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.010
 five minutes 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.230
 the advice now is to leave it yes 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.959
 can use the smartphone anyway 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.530
 left to rest for about 12 hours 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.150
 let's say you can use it in a way 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.090
 quiet not heavily anyway 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.450
 the treatment was applied it 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.090
 smartphone will be smoother from 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.280
 use but above all will not treat 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.590
 the footprints in the back this solution is 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.680
 the solution really very interesting 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.410
 that I remind you that uses a 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.510
 particular nanotechnology and price 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:47.139
 of 9.99 9.99 euros and can be purchased on 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.290
