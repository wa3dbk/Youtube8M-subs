00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.710
 multipurpose can be a scarf a 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.710
 moustache 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.890
 I'm rod the channel is bad and here we are 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.990
 another day more in the osh channel and today 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.199
 lifted up with his hair a bit withered like that 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.250
 basically without much brightness or life like that 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.899
 I thought it would be a good idea 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.149
 we recorded a tutorial doing is a 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.829
 hairstyle like that with a natural finish but 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.629
 very carefree and above all very easy 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.460
 so I 'm just going to use a product 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.920
 to fix my hairstyle today and in this 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.930
 case will be the new the campillo and 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.850
 flexible fixation of Ã¶zil its ingredient 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.780
 key is the bark extract of 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.010
 wild cherry 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.809
 thanks to this ingredient we will fix 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.940
 our look but they will also bring us 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.590
 shine and natural movement to our 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.269
 hair you want to know finally what 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.940
 hairstyle is therefore put you comfortable 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.769
 that we're going to start like your local shine 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:04.239
 flexible ozzy fixation and some rubber bands 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:05.710
 of the hair with my fingers I'm going to do my 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.830
 line to the side to give more volume to the 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.830
 hair 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:15.090
 Then spray your hair 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.090
 from the root to create textures 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.270
 a pigtail falls to one side 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:30.660
 now pay attention you have to divide 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.580
 your hair in two sections and then go 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:38.520
 catching strands from behind and crossing 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:40.440
 in front it is important not to let go of 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.710
 central tufts so as not to undo the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.710
 braid 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.649
 do not worry if you do not get perfect 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.649
 since that's what it's about so to braid 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.040
 i 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.340
 when you finish, secure your braid with 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.560
 another gummy hair and give it a touch of 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.599
 lacquer because now comes the fun 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.690
 Start releasing your braids by pulling 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.550
 some tufts of cuts and disheveled 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.330
 everything you can to get this 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.330
 finished in perfect 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.200
 such the final touch of liquefied lacquer 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.850
 good 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.920
 super easy success we need 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.020
 comb you do not even need to know 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.390
 do a tang braid well because 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.280
 The more loose and more disheveled the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.380
 better and what I like most about being here 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.140
 is that it has a super rich smell and also 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.880
 and a very fine texture so it's like 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.740
 If you were not doing anything before 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.870

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.370
