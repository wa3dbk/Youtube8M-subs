that's<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.250> me<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> horse<00:00:57.420> race<00:00:57.690> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
that's like me going to a horse race and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.510 
that's like me going to a horse race and
not<00:00:58.079> knowing<00:00:58.320> which<00:00:58.559> horse<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.280> win

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
not knowing which horse is going to win

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520 
not knowing which horse is going to win
so<00:01:00.120> I'm<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.539> bet<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.780> every<00:01:01.320> single

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530

so I'm going to bet on every single
horse<00:01:01.920> that's<00:01:02.570> diversifying<00:01:03.570> your<00:01:03.660> bit<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
horse that's diversifying your bit the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.890 
horse that's diversifying your bit the
only<00:01:04.890> way<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> diversification<00:01:05.900> project

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
only way a diversification project

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.890 
only way a diversification project
process<00:01:07.680> works<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> dark<00:01:08.880> horse<00:01:09.180> wins

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
process works is if the dark horse wins

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140 
process works is if the dark horse wins
now<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.890> doesn't<00:01:11.159> happen<00:01:11.280> very<00:01:11.460> often<00:01:11.850> but

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
now that doesn't happen very often but

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.359 
now that doesn't happen very often but
this<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.450> not<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> very<00:01:12.869> good<00:01:13.080> way<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
this is not a very good way but the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.580 
this is not a very good way but the
common<00:01:14.760> wisdom<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.659> old<00:01:15.869> intelligence

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
common wisdom the the old intelligence

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.550 
common wisdom the the old intelligence
idea<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.549> diversify<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.140> believe

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
idea is to diversify and what I believe

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.620 
idea is to diversify and what I believe
in<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.280> something<00:01:20.700> else<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.210> increase

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630

good advisors from the bad advisors and

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.259 
good advisors from the bad advisors and
what's<00:02:50.930> good<00:02:51.140> for<00:02:51.350> me<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.850> what's<00:02:52.850> not<00:02:53.000> good

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
what's good for me and what's not good

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.660 
what's good for me and what's not good
for<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.570> because<00:02:54.110> what<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.620> do<00:02:54.829> is<00:02:55.310> not

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
for you because what I do is not

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.340 
for you because what I do is not
necessarily<00:02:55.880> what's<00:02:56.570> going<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.720> work<00:02:56.930> for<00:02:57.200> you

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
necessarily what's going to work for you

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.680 
necessarily what's going to work for you
and<00:02:57.590> vice<00:02:57.950> versa<00:02:58.250> here<00:02:58.610> so<00:02:59.239> that's<00:02:59.450> why<00:02:59.570> I

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
and vice versa here so that's why I

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.039 
and vice versa here so that's why I
really<00:02:59.989> think<00:03:00.350> it's<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.760> diversification<00:03:01.760> or

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
really think it's a diversification or

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.199 
really think it's a diversification or
diversifying<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.890> new<00:03:04.100> rules<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.610> money<00:03:04.850> say

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
diversifying the new rules of money say

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.090 
diversifying the new rules of money say
follow<00:03:05.780> one<00:03:06.079> course<00:03:06.110> until<00:03:06.950> you're

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
follow one course until you're

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.400 
follow one course until you're
successful<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:07.970> then<00:03:08.660> keep<00:03:08.959> doing<00:03:09.320> it

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
successful and then keep doing it

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.289 
successful and then keep doing it
because<00:03:09.530> once<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.070> find<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:10.459> way<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.269> being

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
because once you find that way of being

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.210 
because once you find that way of being
successful<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:12.200> can<00:03:12.290> do<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:12.500> again<00:03:12.739> and<00:03:13.040> again

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
successful you can do it again and again

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.370 
successful you can do it again and again
and<00:03:13.700> again<00:03:14.150> it's<00:03:14.720> just<00:03:14.810> like<00:03:14.959> learning<00:03:15.200> to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
and again it's just like learning to

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.170 
and again it's just like learning to
walk<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:15.950> fall<00:03:16.220> down<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.459> number<00:03:16.820> of<00:03:16.940> times

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
walk you fall down a number of times

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.150 
walk you fall down a number of times
once<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:17.660> learn<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.840> walk<00:03:18.200> you<00:03:18.859> know<00:03:19.010> it

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
once you learn to walk you know it

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.390 
once you learn to walk you know it
forever<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:19.820> that's<00:03:20.030> what<00:03:20.180> recommend<00:03:20.720> those

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
forever and that's what recommend those
