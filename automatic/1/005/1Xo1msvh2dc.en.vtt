00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello everybody here is gabi and I'm here 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.130
 quick to show this something that 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.679
 I'm making a friend and if anyone here is 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.230
 that same idea to put fotinho 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.650
 of the mini stats that that machine 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.570
 instant photograph that we are 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.900
 seeing a lot on the market today a friend 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.019
 mine bought this machine and he is 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.960
 loving his machine then I saw that 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.599
 the agu says the article says launched this line 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.369
 paper and she's beautiful is all full 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.250
 of those frames of the photograph itself 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.610
 with small machines this one from my 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.480
 My friend is light blue then I go 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.160
 use these three line papers that are 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.379
 magnificent a delight to print 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.940
 then make the cover of his river 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.739
 the album cover will be in this tone of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.370
 yellow 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.230
 the background I already made with this black paper 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.860
 So the album itself I'll stop 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.289
 side 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.859
 Now that I'm going to do it, I'll just get it. 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.760
 cut out the blue camera I'll remember 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.750
 This box here is old and I'm going too. 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.590
 cut these words here to embellish 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.240
 My friend 's album cover 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.580
 I make the records we have around 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.590
 with a base already cut I just 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.790
 I have now had the job of cutting 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.400
 elements I wanted to enjoy and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.479
 I cut these two little pennies is a gray 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.700
 it's a yellow one 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.420
 I'll use a ground cable said the blue line 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.790
 and I took advantage of that bit that the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.829
 from the back of the paper to the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.680
 enjoy the sister these little flowers 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.140
 also put here before gluing 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.390
 I'm going to spend a piece of that tape 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.340
 in my role 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.340
 this tapes issue is the shape of woa 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.879
 and with glue now freshness and book I go 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.879
 with these elements my base 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.670
 This stamp kit , I'm going to use it too. 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.380
 the word memories which is also a 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:12.430
 path of Watercolor says I can play well with the 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:12.430
 black chair and I'll apply it right here 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.209
 on my album will it stay in that position 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.760
 so I'm going to spend a little bit of cola 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:28.530
 to base this base on the basis 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.530
 of my grass 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.590
 I'll get this kit neighbors stamps that 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.459
 I won from a cute girl who lives in Japan. 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.940
 I'm going to sandra and I'm going to make some niggles. 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.170
 musical 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.790
 next to this jack box so it is not 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.900
 demarcate better I made a little ball 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.640
 all round that circle that 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.810
 I cut with a drill actually to 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.440
 stay a little more circle 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:04:04.000
 Perfect and this part I'm going to put 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:05.680

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.790

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:19.060
 An ice cream balls I punched that one 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.030
