medical engineering I think is the

because OA is a complex disease so we're

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.450 
because OA is a complex disease so we're

make that happen now and that will be

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.560 
make that happen now and that will be

that's<00:01:49.020> had<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.189> great<00:01:50.640> early<00:01:51.060> gains<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.570> is

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
that's had some great early gains and is

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.380 
that's had some great early gains and is

that<00:02:15.510> area<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.109> need<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.620> help<00:02:17.340> with

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
that area of the need to help with

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.690 
that area of the need to help with
surgical<00:02:18.379> replacement<00:02:19.379> of<00:02:19.489> damaged<00:02:20.489> knee

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
surgical replacement of damaged knee

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.229 
surgical replacement of damaged knee
components<00:02:22.189> my<00:02:23.189> vision<00:02:23.579> is<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.939> we're<00:02:24.090> going

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
components my vision is that we're going

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.970 
components my vision is that we're going
to<00:02:24.329> make<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.510> difference<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:25.379> people<00:02:25.829> with

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
to make a difference to people with

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.879 
to make a difference to people with
osteoarthritis<00:02:27.349> and<00:02:28.349> I<00:02:28.500> think<00:02:28.739> that's

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:28.889 
osteoarthritis and I think that's

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.860 
osteoarthritis and I think that's
incredibly<00:02:29.430> important<00:02:29.939> and<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.150> think<00:02:30.389> this

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
incredibly important and I think this

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.660 
incredibly important and I think this
Center<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.319> going<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.680> raise<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.189> profile<00:02:32.639> of

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
Center is going to raise the profile of

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.670 
Center is going to raise the profile of
osteoarthritis<00:02:33.409> particularly<00:02:34.409> in<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
osteoarthritis particularly in the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.619 
osteoarthritis particularly in the
medical<00:02:35.040> engineering<00:02:35.430> context<00:02:36.060> across<00:02:36.389> the

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
medical engineering context across the

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.990 
medical engineering context across the
UK<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.079> around<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.469> world<00:02:37.500> quite<00:02:38.069> frankly<00:02:38.519> so

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
UK and around the world quite frankly so

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.789 
UK and around the world quite frankly so
my<00:02:39.180> vision<00:02:39.329> is<00:02:39.629> to<00:02:39.780> achieve<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.620> make

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
my vision is to achieve that and to make

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.649 
my vision is to achieve that and to make
the<00:02:40.980> center<00:02:41.370> sustainable<00:02:42.090> something<00:02:42.480> that's

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
the center sustainable something that's

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.270 
the center sustainable something that's
going<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.900> go<00:02:43.109> on<00:02:43.139> and<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.620> know<00:02:43.739> we<00:02:43.859> can<00:02:44.010> point

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
going to go on and you know we can point

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.420 
going to go on and you know we can point
back<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.750> 10<00:02:46.019> years<00:02:46.260> 15<00:02:46.530> years<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.280> say

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
back to and in 10 years 15 years and say

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.099 
back to and in 10 years 15 years and say
wow<00:02:47.669> you<00:02:47.730> know<00:02:47.939> we<00:02:48.180> really<00:02:48.329> started<00:02:48.900> something

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
wow you know we really started something

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.559 
wow you know we really started something
with<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.680> Wellcome<00:02:50.040> Trust<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.489> EPSRC<00:02:51.329> so

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
with the Wellcome Trust in EPSRC so

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.259 
with the Wellcome Trust in EPSRC so
there's<00:02:52.049> no<00:02:52.230> magic<00:02:53.069> next<00:02:53.400> step<00:02:53.609> other<00:02:53.819> than<00:02:54.060> to

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
there's no magic next step other than to

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.220 
there's no magic next step other than to
just<00:02:54.810> good<00:02:55.620> old-fashioned<00:02:56.310> hard<00:02:56.549> work<00:02:56.669> and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
just good old-fashioned hard work and

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.609 
just good old-fashioned hard work and
diligence<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.829> lab<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.219> would<00:02:59.370> say
