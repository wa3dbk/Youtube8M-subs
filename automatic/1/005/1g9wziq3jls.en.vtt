00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 [applause] 

00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.629
 today we will learn how to cook 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.730
 why watermelon jam 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.690
 We lost our work 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.679
 have brought 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:18.180
 This watermelon sat inside and a crust 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.580
 throw out no identity there is of course an opinion 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.850
 that watermelon and you cook only crusts 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.029
 from cop thick skinned but it hasn't 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.400
 no value just your crusts 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.360
 will be thin transparent 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:39.660
 have the same delicious crunchy and nice 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.390
 it tastes like let's get down to clear pink 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.890
 part 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.100
 I certainly cleaned and sliced in advance 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.219
 crusts 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:01:01.920
 I want to show you a couple of pieces we take 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:03.650
 sharp knife and clear cut off the green 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.240
 hard part 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.240
 so that it does not remain 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:25.020
 after that we carefully collect them 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:29.970
 in one place and then we will quietly 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:36.170
 cut them can cut with a knife any 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.170
 form or molds for cookies 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:44.180
 hearts bear flowers 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:49.740
 asterisks as soon as you like 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:52.290
 by the way then here are the same pieces of jam 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.420
 you can decorate some cake and 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.840
 dessert or cake is also a favor 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.930
 I use as a hostess fighter like this 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.200
 chop neatly if you don't want 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.200
 bother 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:18.170
 then we weigh and we need to know 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.180
 exact weight because we will add 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.690
 one-to-one sugar 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:30.650
 that is, we have 1 kilogram of these chickens 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:34.070
 then we will have 1 kilogram of sugar 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:44.230
 sand and one whole lemon 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:44.230
 we cut it into slices and put the syrup 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:57.670
 That's the way about what we cut then 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:02.360
 take tea soda for 1 liter of water 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:06.470
 three or four canteens ie 2 3 canteens 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:11.900
 Spoons with a hill of tea soda 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:14.630
 dissolve in cold water before 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:21.680
 immersing necessarily weigh our 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:24.430
 crusts do not forget to go there completely 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.430
 dissolved 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:42.670
 try to keep no lumps 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.920
 and then your crust some will 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.410
 hard no will come soft for that 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.240
 so that they are the same necessarily 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.900
 it is necessary not to remain 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:57.660
 especially the day will be pre 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:04.950
 after weighing we remember how much we have 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:08.040
 crusts if you want to not forget 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.040
 write it down somewhere 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:24.010
 pour the solution mix and leave on 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:26.970
 24 hell to 4 hours so that they like 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.720
 would be strong 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.330
 they will swell a little bit strong 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.390
 after that we will definitely wash them 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.880
 under running water 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:45.640
 two or three times all is not well do not rinse 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:52.180
 there will be a taste of soda and this is for you 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:57.930
 don't need everything now we leave it 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:05:00.610
 relax clean up jam is preparing 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.070
 just like everyone else to me yours 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.370
 jam is ready to take 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.770
 shift the jars necessarily 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.080
 write your jars 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.650
 so you don't forget maybe you 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:19.140
 jam will remain and you will eat it 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.140
 after a year to 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.940
 then a year later you knew what year it was 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:32.810
 it was cooked see this 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:36.020
