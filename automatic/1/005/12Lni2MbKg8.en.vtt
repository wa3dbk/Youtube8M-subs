00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.580
 us when the company four years 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.590
 back with the idea of ​​revolutionizing 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.869
 way people buy shoes and 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.150
 our strong point has always been the 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.519
 convenience that we bring to the 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.319
 consumers can buy 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.060
 online they do not need to have all this 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:27.759
 experience from afar they do not need 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.949
 catch a transit spend a time in life 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.999
 them with this fact of purchase and with that 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.720
 they have time to enjoy life 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.460
 their 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.350
 then the concept that brought much 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:41.829
 side of people enjoy life there 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:44.920
 outside we needed to make a move 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.870
 too strong to really become a 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.030
 fashion store very strong work that 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.850
 started at the beginning of last year and here 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.800
 there are actually now have the highlight is 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:01.210
 with this development of our 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:03.609
 own condition, dafiti called me to 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.830
 this incredible project of putting together a 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.050
 brand and actually we ran out 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.910
 mounting eight marks, dafiti already has the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.620
 its own internal agency is its 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.240
 house that is organizing all this 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.280
 work of the collection along with fitch 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.220
 our employees is a super 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.140
 challenge for 2015 but that's all 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.580
 world so excited to do because the 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.780
 result people are sure to 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.780
 look wonderful 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.000
 I think the biggest challenge of this campaign 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.860
 was to translate what the team of 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.720
 created that it was the urban scenario 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.330
 but we did not want to identify 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.060
 that was new york he was london 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.850
 or create sao paulo we painted band 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.800
 of pedestrian brought traffic light we hired 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.729
 the incredible plastic artist to do 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.400
 the whole graphite part , right? And the idea was 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.860
 bring some of that lease to the 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.110
 studio and then our challenge was to try 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.900
 rebuild a piece of that location 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.940
 inside the studio as photographers 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.610
 awesome how to focus the did the gui paganini 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.070
 and the fact that telmex will be in line 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.920
 flávio gives the max melo making movie 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.660
 to introduce dafiti collection 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.840
 we have this casting of six people 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.239
 in iss an urban environment in this location 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.880
 and on the stage and what we wanted 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.690
 energy of the class arriving invading the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.970
 City 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.739
 the fitch fund challenge with certainty 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.830
 It was in 30 seconds. 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.110
 the messages we had highlighted 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.750
 by the cast's personality 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.239
 it represented the mania of the collection everything 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.000
 this coming in an urban setting the people 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.860
 external film being recorded and dozens 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.690
 of places near that one personality 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.690
 unique that would be in the case to look at the world gives 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.700
 one thing that draws my attention 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.049
 was the size of the production so I stayed 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.209
 scared even when we were 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.830
 filming was a very cool experience. 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.070
 I've never worked with girls before. 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.970
 I had never worked with a 4 in color 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.440
 Laura 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.600
 I've never worked with the blog either. 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.430
 it is a privilege to know the 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.060
 his work then all this energy 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.530
 that has rolled and behind the scenes or in the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.360
 I even think it's being 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.340
 evidenced through photos 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.040
 the clothes are beautiful also the collection is 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.170
 marvelous Dafiti cared much of 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.570
 I work both in the collection 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.940
 proper and this casting is 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.920
 Unbelievable very rare you can 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.930
 count on so many good people 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.930
 joins in the same way 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.290
 I think it's a good touch
