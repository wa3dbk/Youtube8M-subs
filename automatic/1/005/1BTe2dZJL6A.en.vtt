00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
to start to go for a mock phone just in

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.980 
to start to go for a mock phone just in
case<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.640> an<00:01:11.729> immense<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.240> HP<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.900> I'm

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
case I do have an immense of HP so I'm

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.090 
case I do have an immense of HP so I'm
kind<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> hoping<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.770> immense<00:01:13.950> of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
kind of hoping that the immense of

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.010 
kind of hoping that the immense of
entropy<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.820> work<00:01:14.970> he<00:01:15.540> kind<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.810> fell

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
entropy is going to work he kind of fell

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.560 
entropy is going to work he kind of fell
short<00:01:16.350> now<00:01:16.590> luckily<00:01:16.890> my<00:01:17.670> opponent<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.150> decide

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
short now luckily my opponent is decide

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.910 
short now luckily my opponent is decide
to<00:01:18.600> go<00:01:18.810> for<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.049> floor<00:01:19.259> bits<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.590> guess<00:01:19.770> he

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
to go for the floor bits I guess he

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.550 
to go for the floor bits I guess he
didn't<00:01:20.100> want<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> risk<00:01:20.460> go<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> dragon

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
didn't want to risk go for the dragon

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 
didn't want to risk go for the dragon
Russian<00:01:22.920> missing<00:01:23.369> or<00:01:23.610> maybe<00:01:23.850> I'm<00:01:24.659> not<00:01:24.840> too

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
Russian missing or maybe I'm not too

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.600 
Russian missing or maybe I'm not too
sure<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.439> mean<00:01:25.590> anything<00:01:26.189> else<00:01:26.430> like

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
sure I mean anything else like

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.039 
sure I mean anything else like
earthquake<00:01:27.060> would<00:01:27.180> probably<00:01:27.600> take<00:01:27.750> him<00:01:27.869> down

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
earthquake would probably take him down

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.010 
earthquake would probably take him down
and<00:01:28.290> out<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.560> HP<00:01:28.710> upset<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.549> was<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> bit

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
and out of HP upset so that was a bit

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.810 
and out of HP upset so that was a bit
questionable<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.350> guess<00:01:31.619> he's<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> pretty

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
questionable but I guess he's a pretty

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.600 
questionable but I guess he's a pretty
certain<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.329> his<00:01:33.600> two<00:01:33.869> last<00:01:34.170> Pokemon<00:01:34.829> going

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
certain of his two last Pokemon going

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.030 
certain of his two last Pokemon going
against<00:01:35.820> my<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.079> case<00:01:37.320> most<00:01:37.890> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
against my one so in this case most of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.679 
against my one so in this case most of
us<00:01:38.189> could<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.640> said<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> blind

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
us could have said this is a blind

not setting up a sub when I had a chance

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.940 
not setting up a sub when I had a chance

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.530 
realized elders didn't have ice fame but
then<00:03:14.070> again<00:03:14.160> some<00:03:14.700> would<00:03:14.850> probably<00:03:15.209> go<00:03:15.330> down

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
then again some would probably go down

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.690 
then again some would probably go down
on<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.020> worst<00:03:16.230> turn<00:03:16.560> where<00:03:16.980> Gothic<00:03:17.400> out<00:03:17.550> would

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
on the worst turn where Gothic out would

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.180 
on the worst turn where Gothic out would
probably<00:03:18.239> expect<00:03:18.570> me<00:03:18.810> if<00:03:19.410> I'm<00:03:19.709> not<00:03:19.950> mistaking

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
probably expect me if I'm not mistaking

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.460 
probably expect me if I'm not mistaking
then<00:03:20.700> again<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:21.150> was<00:03:21.510> headed<00:03:21.780> English<00:03:22.019> in<00:03:22.170> speed

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
then again I was headed English in speed

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.080 
then again I was headed English in speed
so<00:03:22.680> it's<00:03:22.800> only<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:23.040> question<00:03:23.340> if<00:03:23.640> God<00:03:23.820> tells

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
so it's only a question if God tells

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.970 
so it's only a question if God tells
with<00:03:24.450> truly<00:03:24.989> at<00:03:25.080> speaking<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.530> leads<00:03:25.739> now<00:03:25.920> the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
with truly at speaking of leads now the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.190 
with truly at speaking of leads now the
first<00:03:26.310> Pokemon<00:03:26.700> out<00:03:26.820> there<00:03:27.060> would<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:27.930> mean

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
first Pokemon out there would that mean

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.070 
first Pokemon out there would that mean
said<00:03:28.410> let's<00:03:28.590> get<00:03:28.709> into<00:03:28.920> our<00:03:29.250> direct<00:03:29.790> the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
said let's get into our direct the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.580 
said let's get into our direct the
second<00:03:31.080> one

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
second one

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.979 
second one
Charizard<00:03:32.130> against<00:03:32.550> Charizard<00:03:33.120> it's<00:03:33.660> kind<00:03:33.930> of

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
Charizard against Charizard it's kind of

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.750 
Charizard against Charizard it's kind of
like<00:03:34.140> similar<00:03:34.410> but<00:03:34.769> in<00:03:34.890> this<00:03:35.010> case<00:03:35.220> we<00:03:35.459> do<00:03:35.610> not

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
like similar but in this case we do not

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.370 
like similar but in this case we do not
switch<00:03:36.090> into<00:03:36.390> what<00:03:36.510> we<00:03:36.720> already<00:03:37.050> have<00:03:37.230> it

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
switch into what we already have it

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.160 
switch into what we already have it
ready<00:03:37.709> set<00:03:38.550> up<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.820> guns<00:03:39.030> we<00:03:39.600> are<00:03:39.720> ready<00:03:39.930> to

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
ready set up the guns we are ready to

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.330 
ready set up the guns we are ready to
destroy<00:03:40.530> some<00:03:40.800> lives

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
destroy some lives

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.550 
destroy some lives
as<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.580> can<00:03:41.700> see<00:03:41.910> dragons<00:03:42.840> are<00:03:42.959> working<00:03:43.200> here

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
as you can see dragons are working here

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.130 
as you can see dragons are working here
well<00:03:44.280> mine<00:03:44.519> isn't<00:03:44.790> really<00:03:45.300> a<00:03:45.330> dragon<00:03:45.660> but<00:03:45.959> it

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
well mine isn't really a dragon but it

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.800 
well mine isn't really a dragon but it
does<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.590> know<00:03:46.680> it'll<00:03:46.890> resembles<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.810> dragon

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
does you know it'll resembles a dragon

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.949 
does you know it'll resembles a dragon
so<00:03:48.989> going<00:03:49.950> against<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.370> dragon<00:03:50.750> dragon<00:03:51.750> fire

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
so going against a dragon dragon fire

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.370 
so going against a dragon dragon fire
going<00:03:52.650> again<00:03:52.769> side<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.340> fire<00:03:54.239> flying<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:55.050> do

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
going again side a fire flying I do

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.350 
going again side a fire flying I do
manage<00:03:55.709> your<00:03:55.950> speed<00:03:56.280> but<00:03:56.580> he<00:03:56.850> was<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.120> first

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
manage your speed but he was the first

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.120 
manage your speed but he was the first
one<00:03:57.570> turning<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.380> was<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.560> bit<00:03:58.800> strange

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
one turning so that was a bit strange

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.460 
one turning so that was a bit strange
because<00:03:59.430> how<00:03:59.820> it<00:03:59.940> works<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.360> whoever<00:04:01.050> gets<00:04:01.320> the

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
because how it works is whoever gets the

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.190 
because how it works is whoever gets the
leftovers<00:04:01.769> first<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.550> supposed<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.180> be<00:04:03.239> faster

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
leftovers first is supposed to be faster

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.530 
leftovers first is supposed to be faster
than<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:04.980> him<00:04:05.190> turning<00:04:05.489> does<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:06.060> apply

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
than you so him turning does that apply

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.380 
than you so him turning does that apply

Lucien<00:04:09.720> says<00:04:09.900> well<00:04:10.170> you<00:04:10.680> guys<00:04:10.860> can<00:04:11.070> tell<00:04:11.220> me

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
Lucien says well you guys can tell me

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.400 
Lucien says well you guys can tell me
you<00:04:11.489> know<00:04:11.610> just<00:04:11.640> sheer<00:04:12.390> experience<00:04:12.720> with<00:04:13.140> us<00:04:13.260> I

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
you know just sheer experience with us I

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.080 
you know just sheer experience with us I
mean<00:04:13.560> we<00:04:14.040> can<00:04:14.220> kind<00:04:14.790> of

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
mean we can kind of

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.000 
mean we can kind of
from<00:04:15.239> each<00:04:15.390> other<00:04:15.540> here<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.500> cycle<00:04:16.859> for

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
from each other here so the cycle for

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.650 
from each other here so the cycle for
the<00:04:17.130> air<00:04:17.400> slash<00:04:17.669> again<00:04:17.910> because<00:04:18.239> I've<00:04:18.359> managed

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
the air slash again because I've managed

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.080 
the air slash again because I've managed
to<00:04:18.720> get<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.900> flinch<00:04:19.199> against<00:04:19.590> his<00:04:20.340> Charizard<00:04:20.940> X

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
to get a flinch against his Charizard X

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.689 
to get a flinch against his Charizard X
which<00:04:21.389> was<00:04:21.590> definitely<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.620> bit<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.430> lucky

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
which was definitely a bit of a lucky

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.850 
which was definitely a bit of a lucky
turn<00:04:23.910> on<00:04:24.120> my<00:04:24.210> behalf<00:04:24.570> because<00:04:25.320> Charizard<00:04:25.770> X

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
turn on my behalf because Charizard X

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.450 
turn on my behalf because Charizard X
broadly<00:04:26.400> destroys<00:04:26.820> Charizard<00:04:27.419> y<00:04:28.040> 1<00:04:29.040> +<00:04:29.190> 1<00:04:29.370> which

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
broadly destroys Charizard y 1 + 1 which

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.250 
broadly destroys Charizard y 1 + 1 which
is<00:04:29.610> because<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.030> photon<00:04:30.419> resistance<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.110> does

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
is because the photon resistance it does

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.189 
is because the photon resistance it does
possess<00:04:31.470> against<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.669> fire<00:04:33.300> taboo<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:33.900> even

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
possess against the fire taboo so even

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.230 
possess against the fire taboo so even
even<00:04:34.290> under<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:35.220> drought<00:04:35.520> support<00:04:35.970> I<00:04:36.090> would

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
even under the drought support I would

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.480 
even under the drought support I would
have<00:04:36.360> not<00:04:36.570> been<00:04:36.600> doing<00:04:37.080> much<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.590> was<00:04:38.040> exact

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
have not been doing much and was exact

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.090 
have not been doing much and was exact
were<00:04:38.699> coming<00:04:39.000> in<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.479> do<00:04:39.810> manage<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.320> take<00:04:40.500> his

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
were coming in I do manage to take his

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.770 
were coming in I do manage to take his
Stone<00:04:41.370> Edge<00:04:41.520> which<00:04:41.850> was<00:04:42.120> I<00:04:42.150> guess<00:04:42.510> he<00:04:42.660> was

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
Stone Edge which was I guess he was

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.420 
Stone Edge which was I guess he was
actually<00:04:43.050> expecting<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.620> just<00:04:43.800> stay<00:04:44.010> in<00:04:44.040> I

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
actually expecting to just stay in I

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.070 
actually expecting to just stay in I
mean<00:04:44.580> I'm<00:04:44.910> not<00:04:45.120> too<00:04:45.300> sure<00:04:45.479> if<00:04:45.570> that<00:04:45.720> was<00:04:45.900> really

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
mean I'm not too sure if that was really

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.840 
mean I'm not too sure if that was really
an<00:04:46.229> old<00:04:46.320> prediction<00:04:46.710> because<00:04:46.949> again<00:04:47.160> I<00:04:47.370> was

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
an old prediction because again I was

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.740 
an old prediction because again I was
Fortin<00:04:48.240> week<00:04:48.389> to<00:04:48.540> it

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
Fortin week to it

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.990 
Fortin week to it
sorry<00:04:49.139> took<00:04:49.470> him<00:04:49.590> out<00:04:49.710> then<00:04:50.190> he<00:04:50.550> switches<00:04:50.790> out

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
sorry took him out then he switches out

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.940 
sorry took him out then he switches out
to<00:04:51.120> Charizard<00:04:51.660> X<00:04:51.810> I<00:04:52.110> guess<00:04:52.350> he<00:04:52.560> doesn't<00:04:52.830> have

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
to Charizard X I guess he doesn't have

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.830 
to Charizard X I guess he doesn't have
anything<00:04:53.310> else<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.729> do<00:04:53.970> maybe<00:04:54.270> he's<00:04:54.510> trying<00:04:54.720> to

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
anything else to do maybe he's trying to

comes<00:05:29.370> in<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:30.090> reason<00:05:30.330> I<00:05:30.389> did<00:05:30.660> this<00:05:30.810> is<00:05:30.870> just

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
comes in the reason I did this is just

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.080 
comes in the reason I did this is just
to<00:05:31.440> have<00:05:31.650> that<00:05:31.680> Charizard<00:05:32.160> to<00:05:32.430> set<00:05:32.639> up<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:32.849> Sun

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
to have that Charizard to set up the Sun

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.930 
to have that Charizard to set up the Sun
and<00:05:34.020> just<00:05:34.349> pretty<00:05:34.560> much<00:05:34.710> play<00:05:35.310> around<00:05:35.550> it<00:05:35.789> so

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
and just pretty much play around it so

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.089 
and just pretty much play around it so
he's<00:05:36.120> gotta<00:05:36.300> go<00:05:36.389> for<00:05:36.570> rock<00:05:36.750> rock<00:05:37.320> tune<00:05:37.560> expect

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
he's gotta go for rock rock tune expect

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:39.770 
he's gotta go for rock rock tune expect
me<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.220> switch<00:05:38.550> out<00:05:38.729> the<00:05:38.760> chars<00:05:39.120> are<00:05:39.330> probably

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
me to switch out the chars are probably

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.990 
me to switch out the chars are probably
but<00:05:40.020> again<00:05:40.260> there<00:05:41.160> is<00:05:41.250> no<00:05:41.400> reason<00:05:41.550> for<00:05:41.880> me<00:05:41.970> to

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
but again there is no reason for me to

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.909 
but again there is no reason for me to
do<00:05:42.210> this<00:05:42.360> first<00:05:42.660> of<00:05:42.810> all<00:05:42.930> I<00:05:43.169> still<00:05:43.590> have<00:05:43.710> three

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
do this first of all I still have three

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.310 
do this first of all I still have three
pokémon<00:05:44.310> left<00:05:44.460> second<00:05:45.210> of<00:05:45.300> all<00:05:45.419> if<00:05:45.570> I<00:05:45.750> did<00:05:46.080> such

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
pokémon left second of all if I did such

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.620 
pokémon left second of all if I did such
a<00:05:46.349> switch<00:05:46.680> it<00:05:46.979> would<00:05:47.160> only<00:05:47.370> cost<00:05:47.789> me<00:05:47.970> and<00:05:48.270> I

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
a switch it would only cost me and I

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.020 
a switch it would only cost me and I
would<00:05:48.750> have<00:05:48.840> not<00:05:49.020> gained<00:05:49.289> anything<00:05:50.160> so<00:05:50.910> in

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
would have not gained anything so in

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.550 
would have not gained anything so in
this<00:05:51.150> case<00:05:51.360> it's<00:05:51.599> pretty<00:05:51.750> my<00:05:51.960> best<00:05:52.200> interest

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
this case it's pretty my best interest

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.290 
this case it's pretty my best interest
right<00:05:52.740> now<00:05:52.770> to<00:05:53.160> just<00:05:53.370> stay<00:05:54.000> with<00:05:54.270> the

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
right now to just stay with the

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.890 
right now to just stay with the
repulsion

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
repulsion

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.300 
repulsion
I<00:05:54.930> guess<00:05:55.289> I<00:05:55.440> could<00:05:55.590> have<00:05:55.650> stayed<00:05:55.919> with<00:05:56.190> the

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
I guess I could have stayed with the

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.310 
I guess I could have stayed with the
exact<00:05:56.580> door<00:05:56.789> but<00:05:57.120> I<00:05:57.630> kind<00:05:57.990> of<00:05:58.020> felt<00:05:58.229> well

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
exact door but I kind of felt well

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.710 
exact door but I kind of felt well
registry<00:05:59.130> child<00:05:59.340> repulsion<00:05:59.760> see<00:06:00.450> what<00:06:00.599> he

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
registry child repulsion see what he

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.860 
registry child repulsion see what he
does<00:06:00.870> and<00:06:01.169> rock<00:06:02.010> tomb<00:06:02.250> again<00:06:02.720> expect<00:06:03.720> me<00:06:03.840> to

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
does and rock tomb again expect me to

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.839 
does and rock tomb again expect me to
eventually<00:06:04.560> switch<00:06:04.860> out<00:06:05.070> but<00:06:05.340> like<00:06:05.520> I<00:06:05.580> said

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:05.849 
eventually switch out but like I said

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:08.089 
eventually switch out but like I said
Charizard<00:06:06.780> y<00:06:06.840> cannot<00:06:07.349> feed<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:07.740> brain<00:06:07.919> room

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
Charizard y cannot feed the brain room

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.760 
Charizard y cannot feed the brain room
so<00:06:08.310> I<00:06:08.340> have<00:06:08.610> absolutely<00:06:09.289> nothing<00:06:10.289> to<00:06:10.500> lose

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
so I have absolutely nothing to lose

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.339 
so I have absolutely nothing to lose
from<00:06:11.190> such<00:06:11.849> performance<00:06:12.479> I'm<00:06:12.599> doing<00:06:12.870> here<00:06:13.110> and

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
from such performance I'm doing here and

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:15.170 
from such performance I'm doing here and
he<00:06:14.039> is<00:06:14.099> going<00:06:14.160> to<00:06:14.280> keep<00:06:14.430> on<00:06:14.610> using<00:06:14.760> the<00:06:14.940> bullet

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
he is going to keep on using the bullet

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.540 
he is going to keep on using the bullet
punch<00:06:15.389> that<00:06:16.289> is<00:06:16.590> finally<00:06:17.039> going<00:06:17.190> to<00:06:17.220> take<00:06:17.400> down

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
punch that is finally going to take down

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.480 
punch that is finally going to take down
the

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
the

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.029 
the
she<00:06:18.699> still<00:06:19.630> took<00:06:19.810> those<00:06:20.080> bullet<00:06:20.530> punch<00:06:20.680> quite

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
she still took those bullet punch quite

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.850 
she still took those bullet punch quite
well<00:06:21.340> from<00:06:21.789> from<00:06:22.419> Breloom<00:06:22.900> that<00:06:23.110> most<00:06:23.680> likely

well from from Breloom that most likely

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.010 
well from from Breloom that most likely
runs<00:06:24.370> technician<00:06:24.940> so<00:06:25.449> I<00:06:25.509> switch<00:06:25.750> out<00:06:25.870> to

Breloom life has pretty much been sealed

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.200 
Breloom life has pretty much been sealed
yeah<00:06:31.990> that<00:06:32.680> is<00:06:32.979> absolutely<00:06:33.580> ruined<00:06:34.060> right

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
yeah that is absolutely ruined right
