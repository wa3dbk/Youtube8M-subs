00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello my friends from youtube today les 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.620
 I want to show how we can elaborate 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:12.240
 this beautiful little witch 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:16.700
 let's use a good wine meter 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.900
 this is the size of the person 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.910
 what are we going to do, let's first do 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.160
 having the double cloth we are going to take 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.930
 then the measure of the desired length in 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.590
 this case I am doing it of 72 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:35.150
 centimeters my height is 160 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:38.930
 then I do not need it longer I'll 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:42.860
 then make a long out of my blouse 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.530
 72 centimeters and 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.530
 a width of one meter and how is the 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.250
 double then I'm working with 50 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.760
 centimeters 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.970
 50 wide and 72 long with the fabric of 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.970
 work 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.550
 after the line of the length that I made for 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.590
 trace my chair that is the first thing that 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.589
 I'm going to work as the fabric is pretty 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.609
 elusive 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.130
 and I took the mold take out the mold from another 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:13.020
 blouse with something else that I have to 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.810
 I stayed more or less as I wish that I 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.359
 is on a paper mark the armhole 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.689
 from that other blouse I cut it with my shoulder 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:25.110
 and everything and now I 'm going to transfer it to me 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.459
 fabric since then to measure fabric the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.500
 fabric on this fabric that is pretty 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:30.359
 I got a little slippery 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.280
 complicated then I did it from this 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:36.539
 way after the armhole on a paper 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.319
 tracing the one of another blouse I cut it and 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.509
 now I pass it to the web I'm going to fold the 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:46.250
 I have fabric and folded into four 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.250
 parties will bend 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.090
 cut the armhole like the brand and not 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.330
 only of the double so that at 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.659
 cut it cut me on both sides to 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.789
 cut the two daughters at the same time 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.789
 so that I remain exactly the same 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.000
 being cut and then short 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.000
 also what is the shoulder 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.060
 and then now I'm going to cut the long 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.640
 of the blues 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.090
 for the front neck I'm going to measure 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.810
 from the top 8 centimeters 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.340
 and I'm going to do the curve of the neck with 8 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.379
 centimeters from the top 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.690
 This is going to be my front neck bat 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.670
 from where they start to line the 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.920
 shoulder to where the line of the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.069
 another shoulder for the back 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.650
 then I will lower only two 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.349
 centimeters I will lower only two 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.700
 centimeters and short to cut the part 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.760
 front that the neck is a bit more 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.450
 Big one of them is to remove the part 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.510
 back of the blouse and I'm going to fold by 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.960
 half the front to stop 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.360
 cut the curve on one side nothing more 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.480
 Here I am showing you how and what I 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.780
 I was cut all the neck so that I 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.080
 stay both right and left 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.730
 uniform totally equal 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.130
 what are we going to do in the neck if 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.030
 you want you can do a 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.180
 hem or put a washer 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.980
 let's cut here our sleeve with the 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.470
 same with the same paper with which 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.420
 I have marked the sisa putting a little 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.670
 Edito corner because the demand never 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.990
 they go so straight salt to the right or 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.000
 to the left they always go a little 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.360
 tilted down with the same 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.230
 paper then marko lasiÃ§a for the 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.390
 sleeve equal the length you need to 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.550
 the sleeve in this case I did it 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.420
 a little below the elbow as 2 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.090
 centimeters below the elbow 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.790
 then the length depends on the length 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.340
 where you want it, I already have 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.780
 here my two sleeves cut as they go 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.390
 to do the edge to the sleeve if they have 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.700
 filleting can you can pass it 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.370
 fileteadora if they can not do a 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.860
 hem or with a family machine 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.270
 like mine , a small zig is made 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.270
 zag and it looks very nice 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.829
 you will be able to realize that where 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.449
 was the double cloth was not cut 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.660
 then it was stuck to the part of 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.639
 go ahead with the back and there if 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.850
 you wish you can have a 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.229
 Sewing more or less than one centimeter 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.100
 so that it is sewn with 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:34.980
 two sides and I do not see it necessary to open it 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.500
 in the bottom part we will measure what 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.740
 of the hem they are going to make or if 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.460
 they are going to make a filleting machine and from 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.010
 that brand 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.410
 let's take 5 centimeters up 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.860
 after those five centimeters we're going 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:54.330
 to draw four lines of one centimeter and 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.390
 means to make a defendant now we 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.690
 we are going to sew and there is nothing left to say 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.820
 Here is my blouse already I hope 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.630
 have liked it and put it into practice 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.630
 bye
