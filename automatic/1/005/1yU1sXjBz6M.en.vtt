00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello, my name is Alexander Stems 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.759
 we continue heading experience using 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:15.179
 today we talk about the table for 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:16.980
 subject shooting table or subject 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.590
 shootings are like this 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.689
 here is a metal frame and sheet like 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.269
 white plastic rule which 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.869
 dresses spheres like a cube from the past 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.810
 release 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.359
 table type mobile he understands and 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.030
 It fits here in this small bag from 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.680
 most tables tilt back 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.050
 333 is regulated by the way at this table 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.680
 it is possible to mount the flash below 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.570
 in order to shoot to the light that you 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.910
 are different in size and in size. 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.640
 the cost of my table is small and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.890
 inexpensive despite it me already a year 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.780
 choking a toad because of the spent 5,000 rubles 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.850
 in general, this is the most useless garbage 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.100
 which I have ever bought for my 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.899
 activity photo if purchase 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.969
 Cube can be somehow justify the purchase 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.970
 I just couldnâ€™t justify this 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.619
 There are no positive things, but there is no one 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.630
 plus maintaining chinese 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.000
 manufacturer thanks to this purchase 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.070
 some sun tea with chinese 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.659
 the factory will be able to earn extra 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.570
 a few cents and feed your family 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.850
 a couple more years I can't say the bag 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.590
 in tea a few years I'm fine 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.270
 photographed without this table 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.890
 but last year I could not stand it 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.600
 public pressure and still bought 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.189
 this thing besides the name 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.740
 such a talking table for subject 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.070
 shooting yes what are the advantages 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.110
 the table in front of the table and the ordinary 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.450
 no shorter bought it and now the place 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.280
 takes an important advantage shooting 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.380
 items on a perfect white background without 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.509
 improvements to the editor main idea in 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.579
 tom to shine from below or behind 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.770
 way knocking out the background with light here two 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.780
 problems guard what unnaturally not 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.000
 beautiful light below me personally very much 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.369
 hurts the eyes and the second problem 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.930
 He nifiga yellow if exposing the balance 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.110
 as white as I usually do by 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.240
 sources, the light coming from the table 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.000
 it turns out very yellow and accordingly 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.060
 the bottom of the object is also very yellow if I 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.420
 trying to put white balance around the world 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.550
 from the table it turns out that 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.500
 the subject on top is very blue although many 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.580
 photographers it doesn't hover they don't know what 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.410
 is white balance 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.660
 most importantly 50 rubles for a photo tear off 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.250
 customer until he wakes up consider 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.290
 table as has become 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.630
 if you have been shooting the same life 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.720
 items maybe this chair will suit you 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.480
 I shoot you things of various sizes 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.140
 from it twist millimeters here such 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.360
 large 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.209
 my table is already a few kilograms 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.430
 begin to sag and what do i do 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.900
 buy each shooting table desired 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.030
 size besides my table is not 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.010
 decomposed into a single horizontal 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.140
 the surface and I can't do 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.910
 photos with a beautiful blurry background but 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.860
 we are not only on a white background 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.600
 need for an art backdrop not 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.640
 rarity mobility of this table 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.569
 advantage dubious I have never 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.120
 there was no customer who has not become 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.440
 stools stools cabinets and any other 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.330
 surface on which you can 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.890
 settle for subject shooting at 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.420
 in fact as far as I know none 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.190
 a photographer who is seriously engaged 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.900
 subject shooting at such a table is not 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.030
 enjoys as a rule for everyone 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.070
 the photographer has his work in this 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.060
 I personally use Kiev as well. 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.010
 Here are the tables when I need them 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.230
 white background i use holder 2 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.630
 reflector and attach it to the background here 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.600
 such here 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.130
 if there is not enough height I take the second 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.620
 table and put it on top 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.720
 if not enough size it became possible 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:43.150
 see for example due to the laminate we 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.150
 take the top lay out ago 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.189
 This is certainly not ideal 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.030
 but still much better than a table for 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.519
 subject shooting 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.290
 by the way if you take an ordinary chair and 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.079
 attach to the shaft backless white background 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.030
 scotch it will turn out very good 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.340
 device for subject shooting such 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.099
 way when i was just starting to shoot i 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.439
 shot a medium size subject in volume 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.319
 including a lot of fruit in short i would 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.030
 advised not to spend money on this garbage 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.070
 shoot this one you better not become better 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.199
 buy something useful next time 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.479
 we will move to a positive way and discuss 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.520
 useful thing and what you learn in 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.600
 The next video with you was stay flat 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.600
