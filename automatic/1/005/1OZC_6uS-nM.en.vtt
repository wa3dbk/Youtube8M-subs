00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.310
 good very good guys to all and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.080
 welcome to my channel I am horse and 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.400
 today I guess you will have entered the video 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.800
 for the title that I will have given him 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.160
 title so more or less like how to improve 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.610
 in call of duty or how to be better in this 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.570
 game not how to learn to play better not 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.970
 well what I'm seeing in the background 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.190
 guys is a game of league mode that 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.900
 is what the train is about, the issue is not 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.970
 is a template so league of 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.160
 initiative is four against four 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.739
 in which I am doing the function 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.850
 of coverage of my team they do not take 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.230
 the flags while I do the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.550
 coverage and cover the responsos by 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.290
 where they appear so they do not come 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.790
 to kill my colleagues who are 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.320
 taking the flags as you see me that a 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.540
 little bit back until we get 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.770
 win the position of this flag that is 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.260
 of the most complicated there is because 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.610
 good part for a lot of sites and 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.230
 until we start to win the position 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.320
 and such and we started taking flags then 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.960
 We took a little bit but not good 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.339
 two that came to comment guys is how 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.190
 improve the type and how to be the best 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.800
 player how to improve to shoot at 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.210
 move to take the learning objectives 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.920
 a little 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.170
 guys this is only achieved by playing 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.890
 against people better than you are worth 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.369
 Boys 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.250
 only to play better against people 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.979
 better than you and play well do not be 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.869
 that you do not have to play and between an uncle and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.670
 I start throwing the nachos and so on 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.960
 guys, the best thing is to play 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.729
 league mode as you are watching 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.680
 doing I say you get to play mode 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.170
 league 4 against 4 and it's where you go to 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.150
 to learn 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.470
 what is not written or is it going to 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.850
 playing against people is clear better than 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.130
 you are going to win empty you go to 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.770
 lose games but what are you going to do 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.659
 is to learn a lot guys 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.880
 this is where the most concentration is because 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.750
 what you want is to win as in other 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.880
 games that I do not care 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.370
 sincerely win or lose the only thing 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.350
 I want is to kill and kill and kill 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.840
 which is what I want after all 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.790
 do many times in all the games 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.320
 but here you are going to learn a lot or 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.720
 you are going to have to play for the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.119
 objective or to take flags 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.930
 take hot spots of everything if 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.090
 you want to win the game 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.760
 and this is what the call is made of 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.110
 of duty not to win the games what 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.210
 the gusts and etcetera, that is already 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.310
 something secondary one like here we take the 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.220
 first flag we're going for the 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.290
 second guys if you want to improve 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.780
 truth in call of duty you have to play 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.870
 for eggs against better people than 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.220
 you mean nobody learns playing 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.660
 against worse people not so saying it not 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.830
 can play or just start 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.020
 play call of duty this is like up in 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.970
 sports happens the same in the part 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.160
 it's exactly the same thing happens for others 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.990
 play well and learn you have to lose 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.250
 many football matches of whatever 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.140
 you have to play against people better than 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.750
 you and learn is where you are going to 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.270
 motivate you are going to motivate a lot and it's not 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.630
 really learn to play or do that 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.010
 sport whatever it is guys here as you see 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.020
 because in league mode you are going to play 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.930
 games of 4 against 4 is clear no no 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.180
 it's going to be the same as in public but you're going 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.490
 to learn a lot you will learn to 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.330
 shoot or you see that it is here that 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.970
 I 'm climbing a little bit 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.760
 sensitivity to 4 to lose do not lose 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.970
 so much precision because if you take 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.500
 you lose a lot of precision and you go to 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.829
 find our style is to start 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.840
 find better game modes here 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.549
 You see you can not go as a bag is 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.439
 something then you will come pretty 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.760
 well at the time of playing games 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:31.430
 public because you are not going to aitana saco 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.430
 They are going to kill us so much, so 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.709
 you will have better games I think that 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.349
 this is a good comment guys for 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.459
 that you learn to play well criteria to 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.170
 way league against people better than 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.970
 you do not leave even if they were 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.709
 post then do not leave the 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.120
 Little games, do not ever go 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.849
 the games if they are sending you a lot 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.400
 man is clear that if you get in 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.620
 a game started and question in the 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.409
 air a war wait and a paladin and three 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.870
 soft because I would not stay but if 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.849
 those streaks have been thrown at me I did not 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.709
 I'm going from the game I'm not leaving the 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.750
 game never yes I've left 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.269
 games where I entered one 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.980
 started game and suddenly I say ups 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.019
 or for me not even the whites two 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.720
 Well, it goes up because it's not because it's not 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.100
 streak that they have taken me out is worth 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.889
 a streak that they have taken to the people that 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.650
 He has left the game and the truth is 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.360
 it bothers 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.720
 but when I get the streaks to me 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.900
 guys take me out is a knot to a 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.419
 paladin 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.759
 wild bill whatever it is I eat it 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.350
 because they have already taken me out okay 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.790
 there are times that my team has been taken out 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.610
 and he has not killed me because there are times 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.990
 that same starts the game 80 and of 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.080
 suddenly I see that there is a paladin in the 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.310
 air is also bothered a lot but not 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.930
 I can do nothing have been taken to my 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.240
 team is already better in the streak and point 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.250
 but I 'm not going to the game said is that 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.930
 this comment of mine comes from 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.240
 that there are people who just want to play 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.919
 against against banks or just want to play 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.210
 against people who do not know how to play or who are 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.650
 bad playing this call of duty there 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.690
 many people who are bad there are also 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.970
 many people who are good and people only 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.380
 he wants that he wants nothing more than 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.669
 consists of comment if you want 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.229
 learn to really play this game and 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.930
 learn to move you learn to shoot 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.130
 learn to act to play with your 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.150
 team because the team is very 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.150
 difficult it seems that no but it is very 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.680
 difficult to get you to play league mode or 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.720
 competitive as it is called because it comes 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.220
 very good guys as you see I'm 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.389
 changing if I'm changing but what is 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.889
 what you have to do is league mode yo 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.599
 here my points are being played on 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.800
 the table is worth my points what is 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.570
 Juan and I do not want to lose and I'm going to do 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.460
 Anything to avoid losing when you play 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.720
 public do not play for points or for 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.669
 nothing directly cool for fun 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.380
 but here cool for points and there's no need 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.770
 lose if you win guys I hope that I have 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.110
 liked 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.639
 that prove it, get in time now 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.069
 you will see how you are going to improve a 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.509
 barbarity and here my video ends 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:44.360
 guys I hope you liked to leave 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:47.169
 a like and see you next greeting 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.169
 and goodbye
