00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.110
 good morning my name is Carlos Manuel 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.220
 from pablos I come from the municipality of san 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.470
 joseph peace 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.689
 I have representation of the company of 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.650
 service transformation October 16 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.360
 where we have been in a training 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.480
 first of true theoretical and which 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:34.920
 now we are going to do what 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.960
 it's a stack construction but with 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.730
 the technology that rosell in the next 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.070
 that the school is now doing 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.000
 which we are going to 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.610
 to the consciousness of what in which he goes to 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.579
 serve to water a garden 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:55.809
 good family right now we are doing 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.980
 the fabric of the faults like being first 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:02.650
 truth is the mesh 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.330
 and then the electrowelded mesh is more 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.910
 over it goes another turn what is more 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.540
 beyond galileo and which we are 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:16.890
 doing already not putting so into 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.890
 the boxes 5 to 6 knots for 4 g 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.360
 there you have to do it 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:36.000
 a technology that could be more 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.750
 practical that serves for some 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.600
 store water 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.850
 besides vulgar area as a system of 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.789
 risk 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.659
 we have relatives around here and we're going to 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:54.369
 fix it with the festival so we're going 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.369
 to implement our communities 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.140
 because they still know us from here 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.630
 what we are doing is doing the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.350
 practice for later and developing 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.350
 also the community 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.709
 and once the repelling has finished 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.040
 outside let's wait for it to dry in a 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.860
 moment then let's start to throw the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.210
 country in here that carries 2 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.360
 centimeters 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.700
 and then we're going to remove the most ring 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.700
 to begin we aim around 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.639
 here we have a part of the galley that 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:40.630
 it was at strategic point we can 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.490
 use tubes 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.920
 and we can collect water from the 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.540
 rain and deposit it in the tank as 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.540
 a form of water collection 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.440
 very good my name is manuel arteaga and 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.250
 I come from the king to be invited by the 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.850
 farc we come to build what they are 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.160
 chicken coops that one can make a tank 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.500
 of irrigation because in this one it was accepted that 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.250
 what we are going to do is add 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.320
 stone block that I was wearing 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.280
 sand so that the falling water I have 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.819
 filtration to avoid damaging the contour 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.200
 from that area 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.629
 if we do not find that with the companions 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.659
 and doing what is the the hole already 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:35.780
 then to square it and give it more 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:37.700
 form the septic tank we continue with 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.819
 this project after having 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.400
 dug the hole because we are already 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.560
 that putting the stone veneer then 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.819
 in a ton of blocks for then 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.819
 make formwork by delivery 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.460
 It's enough 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.880
 we see that this is the final part of what 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.240
 that we explain how to do it in the 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.170
 The beginning was a flood of 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.030
 that are gray water now we are 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.100
 seeing the end from this part 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.990
 then we move forward more 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.730
 where we place a new box k 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.610
 also because what we had 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:27.760
 were the loose tubes here and when the 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:31.000
 water and fire advanced crises more to 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.260
 the lots that more neighbors here 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.870
 is the result now we can 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.870
 also try with it with water 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.910
 yes 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:05:02.120
 I do not feel very happy and very grateful 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:05.740
 with what they have come to do to my house 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.740
 that will be very useful
