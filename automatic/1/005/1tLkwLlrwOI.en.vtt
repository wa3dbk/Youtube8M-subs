 Computer games set the pace for children and teenagers 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.170
 The Internet is teeming with players online with them 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.800

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.050
 and they are free of charge for free 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.509
 Renting 2 adventures in one is one of these free online games 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.869
 Far Eastern inspired fantasy world 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.930
 the player meets with hundreds of others online it's all about fighting 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.930
 against other players or against wild animals 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.050
 Christa Reining Groupe Arnault has watched the game before her son 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.420
 It also allowed me to play these terms and conditions 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.130
 I'm just 3 1 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.520
 but of course I do not percent they show 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.160
 printed Ryder Cup 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.010
 for me, the main stage OS is free 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.870
 it's first age fit without percent so for me a third 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.530
 from twelve years the game is released 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.790
 For a year her son played regularly with until September 2010 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.530
 The phone bill code amounts over 0 908 hallways popped up that were 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.980
 "That was quite a big shock because the country as a whole also% sum 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.720
 from Knopp 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.300
 get over 1000 600 euros 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.060
 because in the median two screws can also children easily by 0 900er

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.400
 for the editor-in-chief of the magazine "Gamestar" Michael Trier is the 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.510
 Calculation of the game provider soared 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.510
 The business model is often about having some time 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.750
 Benfica has so it plays without fees and then the operator of the 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.040
 Game percent speculated that one goes too slowly and then 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.410
 One buys around accelerations by being faster with his character 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.560
 can or can safely move in the world for example 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.060
 through new animal or something 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.670
 An additive is therefore part of almost all free games on and at 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.499
 Meeting 2, the selection is huge 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.499
 that was all he wanted to do 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:17.809
 Also a tip from Appen schoolmates always try this with better ones 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:19.599
 Weapons would be 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.539
 to visibly create each one 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:25.309
 and that tells me that it was a complex surprise for me 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.749
 the game for free 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:31.759

 Test and rate here teens actually play that is pay for 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.890
 Benefits in the game among the adolescents tend to frown on the two but also see 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.409
 that there are some games on it 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.919
 at the MÃ¤rka now on banners spider girl further need simply 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.260

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.059

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:56.679
 If then buys up first there are just a lot of all-time low 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:03:00.169
 Example of where to look that set the way up as well 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.239
 exciting is so much fun 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.920
 with him two you will find with the long running tracks for the figure rather 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:06.940
 boring 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.940
 and for others, collecting is too much in the foreground 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:16.299
 Braach example already almost the whole festival program they something like 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.409
 Farmville which was not the same as last year 11 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.189

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:26.470
 1 no 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.560
 because because it just does not come percent of their big hit 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:34.039
 this is revealed next to Clark 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.419
 In the game, the equipment costs Collins 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:38.989
 be played in succession 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.989
 but must be paid with euros 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.759
 Brands Berens bypassing pay runs 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:49.779
 what especially because percent on the various platforms to study 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:53.939
 Euro is what has to be paid and not any play currency 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.889
 Songs like the coupe complicated converted into euros we will do that 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.899
 of course a bit far too veiled because possible price 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:03.579
 For most online games you only need an e-mail address around you 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:04.479
 to register 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.709
 neither name nor age are inquired so two operators do the research 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:13.259
 For such games, there is no obligation to perform an age division here 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.259
 as far as possible the parental duty to supervise 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.169
 you really do not want to know the age of the customer anyway next to Bravo 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.580
 becomes 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.360
 no payment in the game always requires a means of payment 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.000
 that only adults are available credit card and giropay and so on

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.159
 Lock for Premium SMS 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:37.249
 that means 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:41.779
 Parents must pay the phone bill no matter how high she is proud 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:45.559
 References go red on line in which parents pay sums 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:49.949
 over ten thousand euros have rarely been sentenced to recognize that courts 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.279
 Here minors have made illegal transactions

 the meaning of these 0 900 percent pays systems and opens up with India 

00:04:58.109 --> 00:04:59.120
 me in this case 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.220
 who is not quite up 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.310
 because these people obviously have internet but that the platforms 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.510
 Percent of playing this game on the lake 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.850
 and he should then have a view on the payment process who over 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.180
 Internet running 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.780
 because these payment channels are usually only Awacs no 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.449
 disposal 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.330
 for children then it really would be free
