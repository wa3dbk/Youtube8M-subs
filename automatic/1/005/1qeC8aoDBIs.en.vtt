 long are three rectangular galleries 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.590
 each one over the next there's 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.930
 numerous representations of spirits 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.240

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.950
 other representations of scenes from the

 Vedic mythology is promes a temple 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.690
 which is part of the largest temple of 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.940
 angkor 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.680
 Amcor guard it began to build 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.690
 early 12th century by the 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.790
 Khmer civilization under the mandate of 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.710
 sura barman second and is considered the 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.770
 largest religious architectural set 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.570
 never built hundreds of circles of 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.540
 Decorative stone surround animals 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.360
 known as the buffalo deer monkeys 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.580
 of water parrots lizards etc without 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.830
 However, an animal that may not be as 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.630
 familiar to most of us is 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.580
 this representation that there is in a 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.320
 column next to the entrance of the temple of 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.450
 it is form and it is a creature 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.700
 which has a striking resemblance to 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.820
 a kind of dinosaur known as 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.830
 stegosaurus and of course if there is a 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.810
 carving of a stegosaurus in an ancient 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.730
 temple supports the belief that 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.610
 dinosaurs and humans lived 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.950
 together obviously it is impossible that in the 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.229
 12th century dinosaurs of that size 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.210
 walk freely through the jungles of 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.000
 cambodia but the truth is that the figure 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.650
 seems to be there the strangest thing and what 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.600
 more defend those who believe that 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.190
 ancient civilizations like the Khmer 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.290
 They had knowledge of 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.660
 dinosaurs or even that lived together 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.530
 with them is that in that column the rest 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.870
 of represents 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.600
 are dedicated to common animals in 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.280
 the cambodia fauna and easily 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.230
 identifiable what is asked the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.090
 observer is whether the Khmer really 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.670
 they knew the existence of this species 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.010
 who inhabited the earth about 150 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.780
 millions of years and more when I was a 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.760
 saurian that populated the continents of 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.160
 North America and Europe during the 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.350
 Jurassic who believes that the drawing 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.569
 represented should be a relative of 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.400
 the same family as the stegosaurus the 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.770
 hua jiang or saurio that yes habia 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.390
 towards what happens is that also what 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.630
 he did at the same time as his relative 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.000
 western arrived at this point we tread 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.070
 swampy terrain depending on the 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.019
 adopted position we run the risk of 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.480
 become followers of the theory 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.250
 creationist is to say those who 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.680
 they assure that the man and the dinosaurs 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.180
 once lived together and the 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.489
 evolutionists who flatly deny 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.830
 this possibility and they only see in the 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.590
 previous figure an ornate rhinoceros 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.750
 with leaves whatever the case may be 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.670
 mystery of the size of the stegosaur of 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.180
 Ancor still to this day has not been 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.180
 resolved
