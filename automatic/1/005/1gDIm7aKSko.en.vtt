above<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.390> little<00:00:24.660> three<00:00:24.960> cloud<00:00:25.230> foundation

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
above that little three cloud foundation

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.769 
above that little three cloud foundation
ok<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> got<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.640> again<00:00:29.150> dude<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.420> not<00:00:30.750> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
freaking that is not a plane dude that's

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.490 
freaking that is not a plane dude that's
something<00:00:35.160> else<00:00:37.070> look<00:00:38.070> at<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.579> Justin

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
something else look at this Justin

something else look at this Justin
this<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.829> energy<00:00:41.160> based<00:00:41.370> lifeforms<00:00:41.610> dude

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
this is the energy based lifeforms dude

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.299 
this is the energy based lifeforms dude
it's<00:00:42.480> got<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:42.899> what<00:00:43.829> else<00:00:43.950> could<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.219> be

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
it's got to be what else could it be

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.369 
it's got to be what else could it be
it's<00:00:44.879> moving<00:00:47.539> yeah<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.780> not<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> plane

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
orange dot where oh it's not a plane you

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.810 
orange dot where oh it's not a plane you
know<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.439> two<00:01:04.439> planes<00:01:04.860> went<00:01:05.159> by<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.580> then<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
know I two planes went by and then it

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:16.039 
know I two planes went by and then it
came<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.240> behind<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:14.390> they<00:01:15.390> won't<00:01:15.509> give<00:01:15.780> us<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
came up behind it they won't give us a

for<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.600> second<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.020> Boston<00:01:23.410> yeah<00:01:23.950> it's<00:01:24.220> hard

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
for a second and Boston yeah it's hard

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:46.020 
for a second and Boston yeah it's hard
to<00:01:24.580> get<00:01:24.700> on<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.970> camera<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:44.910> what's<00:01:45.910> happening

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
to get on the camera to what's happening

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.340 
to get on the camera to what's happening
that<00:01:46.810> is<00:01:46.900> crazy<00:01:47.170> playing<00:01:51.660> if<00:01:52.660> it<00:01:52.840> is<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:52.990> plane

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
that is crazy playing if it is a plane

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.530 
that is crazy playing if it is a plane
than<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.680> Sun<00:01:53.920> sets<00:01:54.190> having<00:01:54.520> strange<00:01:55.210> effect

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
than the Sun sets having strange effect

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.770 
than the Sun sets having strange effect
on<00:01:55.690> it<00:01:55.840> but<00:01:56.050> I<00:01:56.230> don't<00:01:57.130> think<00:01:57.430> it<00:01:57.610> is<00:01:57.790> I<00:01:58.120> really

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
on it but I don't think it is I really

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.380 
on it but I don't think it is I really
don't<00:01:58.930> think<00:01:59.050> it's<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.380> plane<00:01:59.620> because<00:02:00.390> then

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
don't think it's a plane because then

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.570 
don't think it's a plane because then
I'm<00:02:02.050> trying<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.650> find<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.130> it's<00:02:03.540> there<00:02:04.540> it<00:02:04.660> is

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
I'm trying to find it it's there it is

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.020 
I'm trying to find it it's there it is
