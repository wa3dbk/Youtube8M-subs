00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hello and I apologize in advance 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.820
 that today such a pale camera is not 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.000
 I want to hear today and then but 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.849
 Would the hair color be normal ? 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.410
 so today I will paint my hair 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.330
 garnier olia shade 70 light brown this 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.369
 shade a little lighter than my hair 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.740
 but it seems just to brightens I don't 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.669
 I understand how a paint without ammonia can 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.710
 lighten hair on if anyone knows 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.600
 please write me this secret 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.489
 comments to me it will be very 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.070
 it is interesting to learn so quickly 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.770
 I'll tell you what my hair condition 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.829
 so that you know what the basis will be 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.860
 be painted here as can be seen in 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.840
 i have an uneven shade thats u 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.539
 the dark part of the article is I painted 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.539
 l'oreal paint sublime mousse 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.140
 no that what's surprising though is me 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.540
 bezammiachnoy I paint its conclusions you 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.260
 Can you imagine how much it did not take 2 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.540
 washes and twice I bleached my hair and 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.189
 that's just the color I achieved 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.790
 shade was originally in my chestnut 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:23.869
 frosty chestnut hair condition can 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.490
 say they are thin and fluffy and 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.900
 pretty badly stained 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.320
 well, I think 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.659
 garnier olia can fix the situation 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.659
 the more so if you look and 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.390
 commercials on u tube of this paint 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.970
 you might think that the shade of hair 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.920
 it turns out very close to what 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.390
 painted on the package by the way 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.460
 I really like the packaging 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.220
 portraying some with photoshop 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.950
 lina i am a woman here right now i see butter 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.530
 Immediately shade of hair that I need 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.780
 and sunflower to distinguish this paint on 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.430
 showcase from all others 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.990
 Here I mixed the paint developer one to 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.240
 one and I already see that the consistency 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.979
 it turns out quite liquid it can 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.869
 good thanks to the consistency of this 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.830
 it will be better distributed by 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.230
 hair and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.930
 and this amount of paint just enough 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.750
 on my hair and since i have hair 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:31.560
 here from a little bit darker then I'll start 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:33.870
 coloring it with these sites Well 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:03:06.000
 20 minutes have passed and apply paint on 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:03:08.040
 roots know here I am now soap paint and 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.250
 hair is so tight they just 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.810
 the call is worth even this one 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.510
 Balsam who entered the set did not save 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.000
 The situation is not a drop and I do not know where 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.720
 get all those oils that were 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.410
 declared 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.570
 I'm even afraid to blow dry my hair because 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:31.500
 what seems to me they will break off now 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:33.780
 so I dried an interesting thing up on 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.000
 a pack a shade is much lighter 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.769
 i show here because there weren't 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.650
 painted and roots that is natural 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:44.420
 hair and just the same here and should 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.550
 the result was like a pack 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.260
 hair is much darker with regards to quality 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.530
 hair I would not say that they became 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.870
 better on the contrary this part is well 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.840
 Understandably, that here and kept 40 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.959
 minutes and they are dead just hair 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.570
 but here's where it was held for 20 minutes 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:10.500
 they are very dry hard 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:12.319
 how tough well rather this tough 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.370
 dryness 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:19.340
 say in general, by the way did not block 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:25.490
 paint 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:28.320
 my gradient and not brightened the end 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.289
 there was really no ammonia smell but 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.949
 I think this is the only plus of this. 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.440
 paints 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:40.500
 yes by the way unenviable fingers painted 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.270
 a little bit of paint looks to me like you 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.130
 remember not enough so if you 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:50.940
 decide to buy it all the same then remove 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:56.370
 two packs at just such a length so again 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:05:00.900
 I will show just in case the difference in 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.090
 painted with color they are pretty hair like 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.460
 straw and now I will write down the video and run away 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.639
 just do regenerating masks 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.139
 all sorts of because it 's capped 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.930
 next time i want to try paint 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.699
 otherwise there is also a delivery system 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.530
 pigment with oils 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.870
 but they came up with their paint much 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.120
 earlier than garnier and it costs on 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.220
 order is more expensive here would be very 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.919
 interesting and try well that's all 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.659
 actually what I wanted to say if 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.550
 you have any questions please 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.650
 ask them comments i with 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.229
 I will answer it with pleasure 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.669
 first video so if you 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.680
 liked you can write me 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:42.030
 comment can even be put 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.370
 Like and yes and filmed all day so 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.940
 it's evening now and 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:52.080
 the sun hid finally probably 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:54.860
 you can see my street normally okay 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.400
 let's all bye 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.400
