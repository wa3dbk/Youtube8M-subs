00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.400
 now we'll see the most important techniques that 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.799
 make up our program m 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:12.530
 no but as I said it was an icon or will escape us 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.639
 and beat the opponent 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.050
 Yes 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.929
 the initial position of combat and usually like that face 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.789
 the adversary 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.789
 now we will see the most important fraport targets 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.419
 the ribs 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.440
 stomach 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.750
 Breast 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.490
 jaw 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.810
 the face they are easy to reach with the hands 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.650
 we can use the legs like that kick kick side kick 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.770
 Circular circular kick kick 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.090
 kicking crochet 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.670
 m 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.710
 m 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.260
 now let's see the costs with the hands 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.740
 I'm going to skip some elementary programs because we will not have 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.740
 no time to know everything 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.090
 woerth 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.420
 go now we'll take a stand and see the first goal 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.140
 common to attack 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.960
 it's here in this area 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.020
 but before attacking the first thing I will do it will be blocked if I do not 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.110
 not block it will not hit with its weight 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.110
 so that when you go to hit someone at night 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.420
 observe his weak point he was hitting like that 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.380
 r 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.650
 we are struck 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.220
 when you hit move your arm like that 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.740
 and hit in this way you will have more power to hit your 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.080
 target 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.800
 the ornate now let's see another type of collomb punches 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.910
 do not like that circular 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.740
 instead of direct punches we hit incident 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.010
 this cut
