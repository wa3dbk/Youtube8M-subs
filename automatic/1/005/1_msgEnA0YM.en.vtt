00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
side of the gourd now I'm going to pour

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.260 
side of the gourd now I'm going to pour
a<00:00:52.680> little<00:00:52.890> bit<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.160> water<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.730> here

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
a little bit of water in here

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.840 
a little bit of water in here
so<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:55.079> expand<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.890> herb<00:00:56.160> before<00:00:56.820> I

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
so I can expand the herb before I

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.150 
so I can expand the herb before I
actually<00:00:57.120> put<00:00:57.359> the<00:00:57.989> hot<00:00:58.199> water<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.039> I'm
