let's get started I'm going to click in
3<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:58.190> go<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.699> my<00:00:59.879> first<00:01:00.090> step<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.719> apply

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
3 to go so my first step is to apply

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.990 
3 to go so my first step is to apply
full<00:01:01.440> coverage<00:01:01.949> foundation<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:02.760> over<00:01:02.789> my

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
full coverage foundation all over my

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.060 
full coverage foundation all over my
face<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.570> typically<00:01:04.019> don't<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.320> time<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.769> spot

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
face I typically don't have time to spot

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.070 
face I typically don't have time to spot
treat<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.610> conceal<00:01:05.970> every<00:01:06.540> single<00:01:06.900> blemish

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.850 
so I like using a full coverage
foundation<00:01:09.119> because<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.080> covers<00:01:10.380> every

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
foundation because it covers every

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.010 
foundation because it covers every
imperfection<00:01:11.490> with<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.360> application
