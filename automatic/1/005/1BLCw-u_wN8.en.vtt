cut apart sheet especially if i like

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.959 
cut apart sheet especially if i like
both<00:00:44.730> sides<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:47.160> i'd<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.670> option

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
both sides of it so i'd have this option

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.150 
both sides of it so i'd have this option
because<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.629> option<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.649> pretty

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
because this option is really pretty

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.180 
because this option is really pretty
much<00:00:50.430> inexpensive<00:00:51.420> because<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.170> paper<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
much inexpensive because this paper is a

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.410 
much inexpensive because this paper is a
dollar<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.809> good<00:00:55.410> option<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.850> add<00:00:57.030> on

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
dollar so it's a good option to add on

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.150 
dollar so it's a good option to add on
to<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.410> collection<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.489> get<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> 12<00:01:00.030> by<00:01:00.149> 12
