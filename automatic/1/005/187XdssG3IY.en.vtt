00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:20.650
 The morning of May 21, 2012 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.650
 The sun is seen annular eclipse visible in the teeth of gold in Japan 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.780
 It is beautiful 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.990
 Why can you write a correspondence like this 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.990
 Let's look at it from the perspective of orders 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.070
 This bright sun 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.829
 This is the earth 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.499
 And i like it 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.499
 It's a bit small so let's make it bigger 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.660
 Has been 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:01.120
 The moon goes around the earth in about one month 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:04.739
 On the way, it becomes a crescent moon or a half moon 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.739
 Become a full moon 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:25.150
 And the eclipse occurs when the moon on the straight line connecting the response and the earth passes 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.150
 The next straight line will be built on May 21st . 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:38.560
 Now that you know the mechanism of one color, let's look at the state of the Japanese Islands at the moment of the eclipse 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.619
 It is 6 am on May 21, 2014 in Japan time now 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.920
 This is the day 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:01.820
 The place where you can see the ring eclipse 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:06.190
 And this range is the place where partial eclipse is seen 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.190
 Let's advance the time little by little 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.650
 Uu 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.590
 A meal has already begun on the part of the two 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.469
 What came 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:36.090
 So the place with this round shadow is exactly 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:40.430
 It is a place where the ring eclipse is happening 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.430
 This is the path of the shadow of the moon 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.310
 Let's look at it from the ground finally 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.650
 Here is Toyosu in Tokyo 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.650
 The time is 6 o'clock in the morning 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.750
 I've started to write little by little 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.600
 I will go on and on 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.420
 It is finally over 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:31.250
 The moon was completely in the sun 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.200
 You can see the edge of the sun around the moon 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.030
 Exactly what gold 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.810
 This is the ring eclipse 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.810
 It is beautiful 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.460
 The time for seeing the money is short now 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:52.370
 I will soon return to the food to the part 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.370
 This ring eclipse is over 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.730
 But wait a minute 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:07.080
 Last but not least 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:14.430
 It is really dangerous to look at the sun directly 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:18.160
 And their eyes have out light that is not visible in bright light and eyes visible from the Thailand 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:22.320
 There is also the danger of blindness 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.320
 So what should I do? 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:33.169
 As there are tools for western observatory such as glasses shop for eclipse observation for eclipse observation, there must be them 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:40.180
 Please use 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:40.180
 By the way, it looks like this if you use a tool for eclipse observation 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.030
 It is also a state of going 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.630
 You will see clearly 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.630
 Good 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.599
 Then I hope that it will be sunny on the day 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.599
 Let's enjoy the ring eclipse
