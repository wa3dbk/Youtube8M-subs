were to average it out it's going to

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.410 
were to average it out it's going to
give<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.610> about<00:01:59.810> 200<00:02:00.810> watts<00:02:01.020> at<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.320> time

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
give you about 200 watts at a time

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.420

via Mayo do port another nice thing
about<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:10.300> system<00:03:10.690> which<00:03:11.230> is<00:03:11.380> kind<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.620> a

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
about this system which is kind of a

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.860 
about this system which is kind of a
must<00:03:11.920> for<00:03:12.190> me<00:03:12.250> is<00:03:12.580> that<00:03:13.120> it's<00:03:13.240> got<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.420> separate

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
must for me is that it's got a separate

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.350 
must for me is that it's got a separate
control<00:03:14.290> for<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.920> subwoofer<00:03:15.550> so<00:03:15.970> if<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.150> turn

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360

control for the subwoofer so if you turn
this<00:03:16.510> bass<00:03:16.810> all<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.170> way<00:03:17.260> down<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:18.310> subwoofer

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
this bass all the way down the subwoofer

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.670 
this bass all the way down the subwoofer

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
pretty good response for the size of the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.890 
pretty good response for the size of the
unit<00:03:32.410> I<00:03:32.470> mean<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.680> can<00:03:32.830> see<00:03:33.360> this<00:03:34.360> all<00:03:34.540> fits<00:03:34.780> in

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
unit I mean you can see this all fits in

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.560 
unit I mean you can see this all fits in
my<00:03:35.020> little<00:03:35.230> wire<00:03:35.890> rack<00:03:36.220> there<00:03:36.550> so<00:03:37.150> it's<00:03:37.360> not<00:03:37.510> a

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
my little wire rack there so it's not a

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.510 
my little wire rack there so it's not a
very<00:03:37.900> large<00:03:38.170> system<00:03:38.590> at<00:03:38.890> all<00:03:39.070> it<00:03:39.190> doesn't<00:03:39.280> take

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
very large system at all it doesn't take

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.640 
very large system at all it doesn't take
up<00:03:39.640> much<00:03:39.670> space<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.270> I<00:03:40.810> know<00:03:40.870> guys<00:03:41.350> I<00:03:41.380> know

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
up much space and I know guys I know

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.990 
up much space and I know guys I know
that<00:03:41.890> subwoofers<00:03:42.400> supposed<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.700> be<00:03:42.820> on<00:03:42.910> the

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
that subwoofers supposed to be on the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.030 
that subwoofers supposed to be on the
ground<00:03:43.240> but<00:03:43.959> it<00:03:44.200> just<00:03:44.410> doesn't<00:03:44.650> work<00:03:44.740> for<00:03:44.920> my

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
ground but it just doesn't work for my

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.640 
ground but it just doesn't work for my
space<00:03:45.280> requirements<00:03:46.200> okay<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:47.260> looking<00:03:47.530> in

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
space requirements okay so looking in

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.500 
space requirements okay so looking in
the<00:03:47.740> back<00:03:47.920> here<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.760> can<00:03:48.880> see<00:03:48.940> that<00:03:49.270> this

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
the back here you can see that this

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.840 
the back here you can see that this
right<00:03:50.500> speaker<00:03:50.980> has<00:03:51.160> a<00:03:51.190> little<00:03:51.459> bit<00:03:51.550> thicker

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
right speaker has a little bit thicker

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.730 
right speaker has a little bit thicker
cord<00:03:52.240> coming<00:03:52.480> out<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:53.050> that's<00:03:53.440> because<00:03:53.620> this

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
cord coming out and that's because this

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.290 
cord coming out and that's because this
actually<00:03:54.070> goes<00:03:54.220> into<00:03:54.400> like<00:03:54.550> an<00:03:54.730> old<00:03:54.880> cereal

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
actually goes into like an old cereal

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.949 
actually goes into like an old cereal
bus<00:03:55.660> style<00:03:56.200> input<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:57.970> this<00:03:58.090> has<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.540> controls

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
bus style input so this has the controls

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.020 
bus style input so this has the controls
for<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.320> volume<00:03:59.770> the<00:04:00.130> bass<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.850> main

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
for the volume the bass and the main

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.380 
for the volume the bass and the main
unit<00:04:01.540> power<00:04:01.860> as<00:04:02.860> well<00:04:03.220> as<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.670> audio<00:04:04.000> signal

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
unit power as well as the audio signal

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.490 
unit power as well as the audio signal
for<00:04:04.540> that<00:04:04.570> speakers<00:04:04.930> that's<00:04:05.140> why<00:04:05.290> it's<00:04:05.440> a

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
for that speakers that's why it's a

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.820 
for that speakers that's why it's a
little<00:04:05.680> chunkier<00:04:06.600> this<00:04:07.600> cable<00:04:08.020> down<00:04:08.170> here<00:04:08.709> is

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
little chunkier this cable down here is

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.119 
little chunkier this cable down here is
the<00:04:09.190> output<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.180> left<00:04:10.510> speaker

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
the output to the left speaker

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.670 
the output to the left speaker
and<00:04:12.489> you<00:04:12.609> can<00:04:12.760> see<00:04:12.939> it's<00:04:13.090> got<00:04:13.239> a<00:04:13.269> regular<00:04:13.689> just

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
and you can see it's got a regular just

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.020 
and you can see it's got a regular just
mini<00:04:15.280> audio<00:04:15.700> in<00:04:15.999> as<00:04:16.239> well<00:04:16.780> as<00:04:16.900> an<00:04:16.989> RCA<00:04:17.470> head<00:04:18.030> now

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
mini audio in as well as an RCA head now

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.279 
mini audio in as well as an RCA head now
one<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.329> really<00:04:19.509> interesting<00:04:19.539> things

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
one of the really interesting things

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.439 
one of the really interesting things
about<00:04:20.410> this<00:04:20.769> stereo<00:04:21.100> system<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.090> haven't

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
about this stereo system that I haven't

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.020 
about this stereo system that I haven't
seen<00:04:22.660> a<00:04:22.780> lot<00:04:22.990> of<00:04:23.050> them<00:04:23.259> is<00:04:23.410> it<00:04:23.919> plays<00:04:24.280> audio

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
seen a lot of them is it plays audio

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.860 
seen a lot of them is it plays audio
from<00:04:25.389> all<00:04:25.600> of<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:25.990> inputs<00:04:26.470> simultaneously

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
from all of the inputs simultaneously

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.029 
from all of the inputs simultaneously
which<00:04:28.870> is<00:04:29.020> actually<00:04:29.320> really<00:04:29.440> interesting<00:04:29.770> and

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
which is actually really interesting and

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.089 
which is actually really interesting and
I<00:04:30.070> kind<00:04:30.280> of<00:04:30.310> like<00:04:30.520> it<00:04:30.550> so<00:04:31.300> say<00:04:31.630> you<00:04:31.690> have<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.349> like

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
I kind of like it so say you have a like

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.370 
I kind of like it so say you have a like
I<00:04:33.220> have<00:04:33.340> my<00:04:33.520> playstation<00:04:33.970> 4<00:04:34.419> plugged<00:04:35.229> in

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
I have my playstation 4 plugged in

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.140 
I have my playstation 4 plugged in
through<00:04:35.590> these<00:04:35.710> audio<00:04:36.099> speakers<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:37.030> have

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
through these audio speakers and I have

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.300 
through these audio speakers and I have
my<00:04:37.240> computer<00:04:37.570> plugged<00:04:37.930> in<00:04:38.050> here<00:04:38.349> it<00:04:38.860> will<00:04:39.039> play

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
my computer plugged in here it will play

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.550 
my computer plugged in here it will play
inputs<00:04:39.940> or<00:04:40.270> it'll<00:04:40.509> play<00:04:40.750> sound<00:04:41.169> from<00:04:41.349> both<00:04:41.530> of

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
inputs or it'll play sound from both of

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.430 
inputs or it'll play sound from both of
those<00:04:41.800> inputs<00:04:42.009> simultaneously<00:04:43.139> so<00:04:44.139> if<00:04:44.229> I<00:04:44.320> have

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
those inputs simultaneously so if I have

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.490 
those inputs simultaneously so if I have
music<00:04:44.800> playing<00:04:45.039> on<00:04:45.520> my<00:04:45.639> computer<00:04:45.669> and<00:04:46.509> a<00:04:47.259> game

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
music playing on my computer and a game

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.320 
music playing on my computer and a game
running<00:04:47.710> on<00:04:47.889> ps4<00:04:48.250> it<00:04:48.699> will<00:04:48.910> all<00:04:49.060> come<00:04:49.090> through

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
running on ps4 it will all come through

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.420 
running on ps4 it will all come through
these<00:04:49.630> speakers<00:04:49.840> seamlessly<00:04:50.500> now<00:04:51.130> it's

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
these speakers seamlessly now it's

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.589 
these speakers seamlessly now it's
something<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.759> be<00:04:51.849> aware<00:04:51.940> of<00:04:52.210> because<00:04:52.330> if<00:04:52.509> you

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
something to be aware of because if you

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.570 
something to be aware of because if you
don't<00:04:52.960> want<00:04:53.199> that<00:04:53.410> there<00:04:53.979> is<00:04:54.190> no<00:04:54.370> way<00:04:54.520> to

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
don't want that there is no way to

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.920 
don't want that there is no way to
switch<00:04:54.849> back<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.360> forth<00:04:55.900> between<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.560> two

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
switch back and forth between the two

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.870 
switch back and forth between the two
okay<00:04:58.930> now<00:04:59.139> to<00:04:59.199> talk<00:04:59.500> about<00:04:59.530> sound<00:04:59.979> quality<00:05:00.070> so

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
okay now to talk about sound quality so

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.189 
okay now to talk about sound quality so
I<00:05:00.940> mentioned<00:05:01.270> that<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.509> system<00:05:01.930> is<00:05:02.020> pretty

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
I mentioned that the system is pretty

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.400 
I mentioned that the system is pretty
powerful<00:05:02.470> and<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:02.919> is<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:04.330> downside<00:05:05.020> that<00:05:05.050> I

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
powerful and it is the downside that I

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.379 
powerful and it is the downside that I
found<00:05:05.770> is<00:05:05.979> like<00:05:06.160> a<00:05:06.190> lot<00:05:06.520> of<00:05:06.550> modern<00:05:06.880> stereo

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
found is like a lot of modern stereo

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.110 
found is like a lot of modern stereo
systems<00:05:07.810> it's<00:05:08.590> very<00:05:08.860> high<00:05:09.160> on<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.460> treble<00:05:09.729> and

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
systems it's very high on the treble and

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.600 
systems it's very high on the treble and
it's<00:05:10.240> very<00:05:10.479> high<00:05:10.690> on<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:10.960> bass<00:05:11.289> response<00:05:11.620> but

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
it's very high on the bass response but

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.700 
it's very high on the bass response but
the<00:05:12.729> mid-range<00:05:13.090> is<00:05:13.330> lacking<00:05:13.660> and<00:05:14.020> that<00:05:14.410> kind

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
the mid-range is lacking and that kind

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.469 
the mid-range is lacking and that kind
of<00:05:14.800> makes<00:05:14.949> sense<00:05:15.009> when<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:15.370> consider<00:05:15.479> there

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
of makes sense when you consider there

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.680 
of makes sense when you consider there
aren't<00:05:16.900> really<00:05:17.349> any<00:05:17.500> big<00:05:18.190> woofer<00:05:19.090> elements

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
aren't really any big woofer elements

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.510 
aren't really any big woofer elements
that<00:05:19.780> aren't<00:05:20.080> the<00:05:20.380> subwoofer<00:05:21.039> which<00:05:21.220> is<00:05:21.340> going

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
that aren't the subwoofer which is going

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.760 
that aren't the subwoofer which is going
to<00:05:21.610> have<00:05:21.759> a<00:05:21.789> low<00:05:22.030> cut<00:05:22.240> on<00:05:22.389> it<00:05:22.539> so<00:05:23.409> I<00:05:23.440> actually

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
to have a low cut on it so I actually

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.760 
to have a low cut on it so I actually
had<00:05:24.130> to<00:05:24.250> go<00:05:24.370> into<00:05:24.550> my<00:05:24.750> audio<00:05:25.750> system<00:05:26.409> settings

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
had to go into my audio system settings

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.629 
had to go into my audio system settings
here<00:05:27.009> this<00:05:27.580> is<00:05:27.729> my<00:05:27.849> real<00:05:28.060> Tech<00:05:28.270> audio<00:05:28.630> drivers

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
here this is my real Tech audio drivers

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.740 
here this is my real Tech audio drivers
and<00:05:30.639> I'll<00:05:30.729> give<00:05:30.880> you<00:05:31.000> a<00:05:31.030> look<00:05:31.240> there<00:05:31.479> at<00:05:31.630> the

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
and I'll give you a look there at the

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.620 
and I'll give you a look there at the
equalization<00:05:32.199> settings<00:05:32.949> that<00:05:33.190> I<00:05:33.250> have<00:05:33.630> and

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
equalization settings that I have and

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.010 
equalization settings that I have and
this<00:05:35.080> makes<00:05:35.409> the<00:05:35.560> response<00:05:35.949> pretty<00:05:36.430> good<00:05:37.020> for

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
this makes the response pretty good for

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.260 
this makes the response pretty good for
my<00:05:38.169> tastes<00:05:38.949> so<00:05:39.460> you<00:05:39.520> can<00:05:39.639> see<00:05:39.789> I've<00:05:39.909> really<00:05:40.150> had

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
my tastes so you can see I've really had

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.600 
my tastes so you can see I've really had
to<00:05:40.449> boost<00:05:40.720> up<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.080> mid-range<00:05:41.470> there<00:05:41.949> kind<00:05:42.580> of

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
to boost up the mid-range there kind of

and the lows as you can tell are quite

and the lows as you can tell are quite

I'm<00:07:15.260> sorry<00:07:15.530> 35<00:07:16.130> Hertz<00:07:16.460> and<00:07:16.700> after<00:07:17.300> 20

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630 
I'm sorry 35 Hertz and after 20

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.140 
I'm sorry 35 Hertz and after 20
kilohertz<00:07:18.110> it's<00:07:18.920> a<00:07:18.980> pretty<00:07:19.220> broad<00:07:19.520> range<00:07:19.550> it

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.150 
kilohertz it's a pretty broad range it

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.880 
kilohertz it's a pretty broad range it
doesn't<00:07:20.420> go<00:07:20.480> into<00:07:20.630> those<00:07:20.810> deep<00:07:21.200> deep<00:07:21.530> lows

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:21.890 
doesn't go into those deep deep lows

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.980 
doesn't go into those deep deep lows
which<00:07:22.790> is<00:07:22.940> probably<00:07:23.240> pretty<00:07:23.420> reasonable

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990 
which is probably pretty reasonable

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.420 
which is probably pretty reasonable
considering<00:07:24.410> the<00:07:24.620> size<00:07:24.860> of<00:07:25.010> the<00:07:25.070> woofer

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430
