well as far as the build quality it is

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.700 
well as far as the build quality it is
rather<00:04:50.920> strong<00:04:51.610> it's<00:04:51.970> it<00:04:52.540> I<00:04:53.200> wouldn't<00:04:53.560> it's

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
rather strong it's it I wouldn't it's

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.080 
rather strong it's it I wouldn't it's
not<00:04:53.950> drop<00:04:54.220> proof<00:04:54.580> but<00:04:55.590> again<00:04:56.590> yeah<00:04:57.250> it<00:04:57.640> does

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
not drop proof but again yeah it does

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.760 
not drop proof but again yeah it does
feel<00:04:58.410> rather<00:04:59.410> you<00:04:59.860> know<00:04:59.980> rather<00:05:00.340> solid<00:05:01.470> if<00:05:02.470> I

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
feel rather you know rather solid if I

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.000 
feel rather you know rather solid if I
you<00:05:02.980> know<00:05:03.010> if<00:05:03.130> I<00:05:03.280> push<00:05:03.490> down<00:05:03.760> a<00:05:03.790> little<00:05:04.210> bit<00:05:04.450> its

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
you know if I push down a little bit its

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.940 
you know if I push down a little bit its
edges<00:05:06.010> uses<00:05:06.460> a<00:05:06.720> pretty<00:05:07.720> strong<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.380> i<00:05:08.590> would

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
edges uses a pretty strong and i would

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.210 
edges uses a pretty strong and i would
say<00:05:09.160> high<00:05:09.340> quality<00:05:10.050> plastic<00:05:11.050> here<00:05:11.860> we<00:05:11.980> can<00:05:12.160> see

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
say high quality plastic here we can see

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.620 
say high quality plastic here we can see
the<00:05:12.730> provided<00:05:13.540> USB<00:05:13.570> 3<00:05:14.380> cable<00:05:15.030> attached<00:05:16.030> to<00:05:16.450> the

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
the provided USB 3 cable attached to the

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.920 
the provided USB 3 cable attached to the
a<00:05:16.660> data<00:05:17.080> nobility<00:05:17.860> NH<00:05:18.190> 0<00:05:18.490> 1<00:05:18.900> what<00:05:19.900> is

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
a data nobility NH 0 1 what is

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.690 
a data nobility NH 0 1 what is
interesting<00:05:20.710> here<00:05:20.740> is<00:05:21.070> that<00:05:21.100> there<00:05:21.430> is<00:05:21.550> only

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
interesting here is that there is only

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.570 
interesting here is that there is only
one<00:05:22.410> connector<00:05:23.410> there<00:05:23.680> normally<00:05:24.580> with<00:05:25.050> USB<00:05:26.050> to

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
one connector there normally with USB to

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.580 
one connector there normally with USB to
portable<00:05:27.580> hard<00:05:27.880> drives<00:05:28.180> you<00:05:28.390> would<00:05:28.570> have<00:05:28.930> two

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
portable hard drives you would have two

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.610 
portable hard drives you would have two
connectors<00:05:30.070> one<00:05:30.310> for<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.760> data<00:05:30.970> USB<00:05:31.870> and<00:05:32.440> one

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
connectors one for the data USB and one

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.570 
connectors one for the data USB and one
for<00:05:32.950> power<00:05:33.370> so<00:05:34.180> basically<00:05:34.750> this<00:05:35.110> device<00:05:36.100> can

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
for power so basically this device can

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.250 
for power so basically this device can
be<00:05:37.530> powered<00:05:38.530> by<00:05:39.280> one<00:05:39.580> cable<00:05:39.880> because<00:05:40.480> of<00:05:41.050> the

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
be powered by one cable because of the

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.390 
be powered by one cable because of the
specifications<00:05:42.190> of<00:05:42.610> USB<00:05:43.180> 3<00:05:43.800> there<00:05:44.800> is<00:05:44.980> more

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
specifications of USB 3 there is more

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.790 
specifications of USB 3 there is more
power<00:05:45.880> able<00:05:46.360> to<00:05:46.510> be<00:05:46.660> provided<00:05:47.170> from<00:05:47.320> the<00:05:47.380> ports

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
power able to be provided from the ports

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.460 
power able to be provided from the ports
on<00:05:47.980> your<00:05:48.160> motherboard<00:05:48.880> so<00:05:49.870> this<00:05:50.140> will<00:05:50.320> of

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
on your motherboard so this will of

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.440 
on your motherboard so this will of
course<00:05:50.680> Cape<00:05:51.040> cable<00:05:51.460> cut<00:05:51.670> it<00:05:51.820> down<00:05:51.970> because

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
course Cape cable cut it down because

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.870 
course Cape cable cut it down because
you're<00:05:52.810> only<00:05:52.900> using<00:05:53.110> one<00:05:53.350> cable<00:05:53.830> so<00:05:54.430> that's

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
you're only using one cable so that's

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.770 
you're only using one cable so that's
another<00:05:55.420> good<00:05:55.660> thing<00:05:55.690> about<00:05:56.140> this<00:05:56.830> product

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
another good thing about this product

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.540 
another good thing about this product
this<00:05:58.780> has<00:05:58.990> been<00:05:59.170> our<00:05:59.440> quick<00:05:59.860> look<00:06:00.070> at<00:06:00.340> the<00:06:00.490> a

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
this has been our quick look at the a

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
this has been our quick look at the a
data<00:06:01.000> nobility<00:06:01.810> and<00:06:01.920> h01<00:06:03.240> treat<00:06:04.240> this<00:06:04.390> as<00:06:04.420> a

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
data nobility and h01 treat this as a

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.600 
data nobility and h01 treat this as a
bit<00:06:04.720> of<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:04.900> first<00:06:05.200> looks<00:06:05.500> will<00:06:05.770> have<00:06:05.980> the

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
bit of the first looks will have the

put the address up the bottom go over

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.100 
put the address up the bottom go over
and<00:06:12.160> have<00:06:12.250> a<00:06:12.310> look<00:06:12.370> at<00:06:12.580> that<00:06:12.760> and<00:06:13.000> it<00:06:13.750> will<00:06:13.930> also

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
and have a look at that and it will also

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.230 
and have a look at that and it will also
include<00:06:14.590> the<00:06:14.860> performance<00:06:15.400> benchmarks<00:06:16.060> a

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
include the performance benchmarks a

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.980 
include the performance benchmarks a
data<00:06:16.660> work<00:06:17.110> coming<00:06:17.590> around<00:06:18.190> 80<00:06:19.120> to<00:06:19.600> 90

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
data work coming around 80 to 90

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.530 
data work coming around 80 to 90
megabytes<00:06:20.470> per<00:06:20.710> second<00:06:21.160> with<00:06:21.760> the<00:06:21.910> read<00:06:22.180> and<00:06:22.510> a

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
megabytes per second with the read and a

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.090 
megabytes per second with the read and a
little<00:06:22.780> slow<00:06:23.050> with<00:06:23.320> the<00:06:23.620> right<00:06:24.220> so<00:06:24.970> that<00:06:25.210> is

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
little slow with the right so that is

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.310 
little slow with the right so that is
effectively<00:06:27.480> around<00:06:28.480> two<00:06:28.960> to<00:06:29.080> three<00:06:29.290> times

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
effectively around two to three times

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.560 
effectively around two to three times
faster<00:06:29.710> than<00:06:30.130> USB<00:06:30.520> 2<00:06:30.910> so<00:06:31.120> if<00:06:31.240> you<00:06:31.360> are<00:06:31.540> looking

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
faster than USB 2 so if you are looking

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.620 
faster than USB 2 so if you are looking
for<00:06:32.230> a<00:06:32.260> performance<00:06:33.010> boost<00:06:33.370> for<00:06:34.270> your

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
for a performance boost for your

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.140 
for a performance boost for your
portable<00:06:35.380> storage<00:06:36.070> so<00:06:36.400> my<00:06:36.490> good<00:06:36.640> you<00:06:36.730> know<00:06:36.850> fit
