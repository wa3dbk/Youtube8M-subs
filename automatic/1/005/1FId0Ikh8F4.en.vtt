00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.450 
john deere 400 rubber tiger buckle and

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.320 
john deere 400 rubber tiger buckle and
vegetation<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.600> boot<00:00:07.940> this<00:00:08.940> was<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.210> big

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
vegetation to boot this was the big

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.480 
vegetation to boot this was the big
buckle<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:09.840> was<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.110> 93<00:00:10.559> 50<00:00:10.860> series<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.370> had

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
buckle this was the 93 50 series it had

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.919 
buckle this was the 93 50 series it had
all<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.759> swing<00:00:11.969> power<00:00:12.179> didn't<00:00:12.540> have<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.750> dual

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
all the swing power didn't have the dual

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.450 
all the swing power didn't have the dual
cylinders<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.469> pushed<00:00:13.830> each<00:00:13.980> way<00:00:14.160> like<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
cylinders that pushed each way like the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.050 
cylinders that pushed each way like the
9320<00:00:15.770> so<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.160> was<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> good<00:00:17.550> backhoe<00:00:17.910> when

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
9320 so this was a good backhoe when

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.410 
9320 so this was a good backhoe when
it's<00:00:18.210> date

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.280 

yes<00:00:23.420> every<00:00:23.720> log<00:00:23.900> or<00:00:24.080> even<00:00:24.320> had<00:00:24.440> one<00:00:26.290> further

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
yes every log or even had one further

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.720 
yes every log or even had one further
down<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:27.710> forest

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:56.530 

it's<00:00:34.730> got<00:00:34.940> hydraulics<00:00:37.360> what<00:00:38.360> it<00:00:38.480> is

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.540 

a<00:00:56.660> regular<00:00:57.320> treasure<00:00:57.770> hunt<00:00:58.070> today<00:00:58.190> going

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
a regular treasure hunt today going

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:10.710 
a regular treasure hunt today going
through<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:58.820> bush

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.030 

that's<00:01:11.720> got<00:01:11.960> to<00:01:11.990> be<00:01:12.079> a<00:01:12.170> cat<00:01:12.409> it's<00:01:12.740> going<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:12.950> be

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
that's got to be a cat it's going to be

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:24.690 
that's got to be a cat it's going to be
a<00:01:13.070> d6<00:01:20.950> browsers<00:01:21.950> are<00:01:22.100> good<00:01:22.280> rails<00:01:22.549> are<00:01:22.759> good

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
a d6 browsers are good rails are good

00:01:24.700 --> 00:02:06.480 
a d6 browsers are good rails are good
sprockets<00:01:25.700> not<00:01:25.880> as<00:01:26.119> good

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.700 

okay<00:02:07.490> it<00:02:07.610> Scott<00:02:08.770> we'll<00:02:09.770> go<00:02:09.890> with<00:02:10.039> d6<00:02:11.710> late

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
okay it Scott we'll go with d6 late

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.470 
okay it Scott we'll go with d6 late
1950s<00:02:13.550> or<00:02:13.670> SOT<00:02:13.850> knows<00:02:14.030> it's<00:02:14.209> got<00:02:14.360> the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
1950s or SOT knows it's got the

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.220 
1950s or SOT knows it's got the
hydraulics

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
hydraulics

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.080 
hydraulics
I<00:02:15.260> think<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.040> hydraulics<00:02:16.520> come<00:02:16.700> out<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:16.940> the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
I think the hydraulics come out on the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:25.000 
I think the hydraulics come out on the
six<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.510> nineteen<00:02:17.780> fifty<00:02:18.410> six<00:02:18.800> or<00:02:19.010> seven<00:02:24.010> in

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
six and nineteen fifty six or seven in

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.520 
six and nineteen fifty six or seven in
here<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.310> long<00:02:25.459> time
