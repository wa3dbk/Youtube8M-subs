00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
material but one question that I asked

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.640 
material but one question that I asked
her<00:00:46.030> was<00:00:46.420> about<00:00:46.899> our<00:00:47.280> second<00:00:48.280> son<00:00:48.550> now<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:50.500> is

her was about our second son now this is
a<00:00:50.680> kind<00:00:51.070> of<00:00:51.130> a<00:00:51.220> complicated<00:00:52.320> topic<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:53.770> we

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
a kind of a complicated topic and we

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.580 
a kind of a complicated topic and we
barely<00:00:54.310> covered<00:00:54.640> it<00:00:54.760> all<00:00:54.910> she<00:00:55.150> just<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:56.440> only

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
barely covered it all she just it's only

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.620 
barely covered it all she just it's only
a<00:00:56.680> couple<00:00:56.800> of<00:00:56.950> minutes<00:00:57.040> long<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:57.550> after<00:00:58.510> I'm

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
a couple of minutes long so after I'm

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.420 
a couple of minutes long so after I'm
done<00:00:58.840> explaining<00:00:59.500> a<00:00:59.740> couple<00:01:00.010> things<00:01:00.220> here

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
done explaining a couple things here

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.780 
done explaining a couple things here
then<00:01:00.610> I'll<00:01:01.570> jump<00:01:01.870> to<00:01:02.110> her<00:01:02.550> response<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.640> my

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
then I'll jump to her response to my

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.969 
then I'll jump to her response to my
question<00:01:04.239> but<00:01:04.750> I<00:01:04.780> have<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:05.170> explain<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:05.740> couple

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
question but I have to explain a couple

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.710 
question but I have to explain a couple
of<00:01:06.220> other<00:01:06.640> things<00:01:07.000> so<00:01:07.150> that<00:01:07.180> this<00:01:07.390> makes<00:01:07.600> a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
of other things so that this makes a

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.890 
of other things so that this makes a
little<00:01:07.840> bit<00:01:07.990> more<00:01:08.140> sense<00:01:08.409> so<00:01:08.790> there's<00:01:09.790> a

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
little bit more sense so there's a

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.940 
little bit more sense so there's a
astronomical<00:01:10.900> phenomenon<00:01:11.439> called<00:01:11.680> the

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
astronomical phenomenon called the

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.600 
astronomical phenomenon called the
precession<00:01:12.580> of<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.729> equinoxes<00:01:13.450> and<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:15.310> is

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
precession of the equinoxes and this is

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.149 
precession of the equinoxes and this is
the<00:01:16.180> twenty<00:01:16.689> six<00:01:16.930> thousand<00:01:17.380> year<00:01:17.530> cycle<00:01:17.560> that

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
the twenty six thousand year cycle that

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.760 
the twenty six thousand year cycle that
many<00:01:18.759> people<00:01:19.090> may<00:01:19.299> be<00:01:19.329> aware<00:01:19.720> of<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.230> it

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
many people may be aware of and it

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.620 
many people may be aware of and it
creates<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.690> ages<00:01:22.690> of<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.960> zodiac<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.790> the

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
creates the ages of the zodiac so the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.420 
creates the ages of the zodiac so the
Sun<00:01:25.870> rises<00:01:26.500> in<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.680> east<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
Sun rises in the east and the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.640 
Sun rises in the east and the
constellation<00:01:30.430> that<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:31.210> Sun<00:01:31.420> rises<00:01:31.900> into<00:01:32.320> in

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
constellation that the Sun rises into in

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.630 
constellation that the Sun rises into in
the<00:01:32.890> in<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.340> sky<00:01:33.610> is<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:35.040> age<00:01:36.040> of<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.430> zodiac

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
the in the sky is the age of the zodiac

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.120 
the in the sky is the age of the zodiac
that<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.180> that<00:01:37.570> we<00:01:37.690> are<00:01:37.810> in<00:01:37.990> so<00:01:38.770> we<00:01:39.100> are

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
that the that we are in so we are

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.260 
that the that we are in so we are
currently<00:01:39.610> on<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.020> cusp<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:42.120> Pisces<00:01:43.120> in

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
currently on the cusp of Pisces in

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.130 
currently on the cusp of Pisces in
Aquarius<00:01:44.070> I'm<00:01:45.070> not<00:01:45.310> an<00:01:45.400> expert<00:01:45.760> on<00:01:46.140> astronomy

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
Aquarius I'm not an expert on astronomy

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.080 
Aquarius I'm not an expert on astronomy
or<00:01:47.260> physics<00:01:47.890> or<00:01:47.979> anything<00:01:48.159> but<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:48.820> know<00:01:48.850> this

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
or physics or anything but you know this

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.730 
or physics or anything but you know this
is<00:01:49.240> my<00:01:49.390> understanding<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:50.830> it<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:53.290> at<00:01:53.409> the

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
is my understanding of it and so at the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.890 
is my understanding of it and so at the
present<00:01:53.920> moment<00:01:54.130> then<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.720> Sun<00:01:55.720> would<00:01:55.840> be

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
present moment then the Sun would be

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.800 
present moment then the Sun would be
rising<00:01:56.380> in<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.560> east<00:01:56.770> into<00:01:57.729> well<00:01:58.479> somewhere

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
rising in the east into well somewhere

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.050 
rising in the east into well somewhere
between<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.500> constellations<00:01:59.979> of<00:02:00.430> Pisces<00:02:00.880> and

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
between the constellations of Pisces and

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.520 
between the constellations of Pisces and
Aquarius<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:02.020> know<00:02:02.140> there's<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.500> whole

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
Aquarius you know there's the whole

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.020 
Aquarius you know there's the whole
thing<00:02:02.979> about<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.310> dawning<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.760> Age<00:02:03.940> of

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
thing about the dawning of the Age of

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.670 
thing about the dawning of the Age of
Aquarius<00:02:04.180> who<00:02:04.690> are<00:02:04.810> moving<00:02:05.140> into<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.440> Age<00:02:05.560> of

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
Aquarius who are moving into the Age of

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.639 
Aquarius who are moving into the Age of
Aquarius<00:02:05.830> now<00:02:06.760> what<00:02:07.090> causes<00:02:07.420> this<00:02:07.990> movement

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
Aquarius now what causes this movement

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.039 
Aquarius now what causes this movement
of<00:02:08.799> the<00:02:08.920> constellations<00:02:09.729> in<00:02:09.879> the<00:02:10.060> night<00:02:10.509> sky

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
of the constellations in the night sky

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.910 
of the constellations in the night sky
is<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:12.549> matter<00:02:12.879> of<00:02:13.180> some<00:02:13.510> debate<00:02:13.689> and<00:02:14.170> the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
is a matter of some debate and the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.729 
is a matter of some debate and the
current<00:02:15.280> theory<00:02:15.659> accepted<00:02:16.659> by<00:02:16.810> mainstream

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
current theory accepted by mainstream

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.979 
current theory accepted by mainstream
scientists<00:02:18.489> is<00:02:18.819> that<00:02:19.239> there<00:02:19.390> is<00:02:19.480> some<00:02:19.659> kind<00:02:19.900> of

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
scientists is that there is some kind of

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.570 
scientists is that there is some kind of
a<00:02:20.110> wobble<00:02:20.590> in<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:20.890> Earth's<00:02:21.069> axis<00:02:21.810> axis<00:02:22.810> that

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
a wobble in the Earth's axis axis that

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.380 
a wobble in the Earth's axis axis that
that<00:02:24.580> creates<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.810> appearance<00:02:26.099> that<00:02:27.099> the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
are getting on this bandwagon as well so

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.350 
are getting on this bandwagon as well so
what<00:02:44.650> he<00:02:44.860> asserts<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.459> that<00:02:45.610> what<00:02:45.819> causes<00:02:46.060> this

what he asserts is that what causes this

elliptical orbit around this other star
one<00:03:20.860> possibility<00:03:21.459> is<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:21.819> he's<00:03:23.010> suggested

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
one possibility is that he's suggested

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.830 
one possibility is that he's suggested
suggested<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:25.180> might<00:03:25.300> be<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.629> star

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
suggested that it might be the star

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.199 
suggested that it might be the star
Sirius<00:03:26.110> but<00:03:26.530> that's<00:03:26.709> just<00:03:26.860> one<00:03:27.790> possibility

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
Sirius but that's just one possibility

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.199 
Sirius but that's just one possibility
he<00:03:28.480> hasn't<00:03:28.720> proven<00:03:28.959> this<00:03:29.080> theory<00:03:29.410> at<00:03:29.770> all<00:03:30.209> so

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
he hasn't proven this theory at all so

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.660 
he hasn't proven this theory at all so
there<00:03:31.330> you<00:03:31.450> go<00:03:31.599> that's<00:03:32.560> my<00:03:32.770> little

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
there you go that's my little

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.110 
there you go that's my little
introduction<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:35.160> teal<00:03:36.160> Scott's<00:03:36.520> answer<00:03:36.879> so<00:03:37.060> I

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
introduction to teal Scott's answer so I

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.089 
introduction to teal Scott's answer so I
asked<00:03:37.480> her<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:38.650> is<00:03:40.230> our<00:03:41.230> solar<00:03:41.590> system

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
asked her is is our solar system

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.040 
asked her is is our solar system
revolving<00:03:42.879> around<00:03:43.000> another<00:03:43.420> star<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.750> so

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
revolving around another star and so

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.170 
revolving around another star and so
here's<00:03:44.260> what<00:03:44.620> she<00:03:44.769> had<00:03:44.800> to<00:03:44.890> say

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.220 

you<00:03:50.180> describe<00:03:50.599> December<00:03:51.290> 21st<00:03:52.180> 2012<00:03:53.180> as<00:03:53.720> being

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
you describe December 21st 2012 as being

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.500 
you describe December 21st 2012 as being
the<00:03:54.590> point<00:03:55.310> at<00:03:55.459> which<00:03:55.550> we<00:03:55.610> were<00:03:55.849> furthest<00:03:56.390> away

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
the point at which we were furthest away

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.320 
the point at which we were furthest away
from<00:03:56.629> source

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.400 

what<00:04:05.330> I've<00:04:05.450> come<00:04:05.480> across<00:04:05.780> is<00:04:06.110> that<00:04:06.140> apparently

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
what I've come across is that apparently

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.010 
what I've come across is that apparently
this<00:04:06.770> this<00:04:07.190> may<00:04:07.459> be<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:07.790> result<00:04:08.120> of<00:04:08.270> our<00:04:08.480> solar

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
this this may be the result of our solar

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.430 
this this may be the result of our solar
system

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
system

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.240 
system
journeying<00:04:09.950> around<00:04:10.310> another<00:04:10.819> star<00:04:12.160> do<00:04:13.160> you

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
journeying around another star do you

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.180 
journeying around another star do you
have<00:04:13.370> any<00:04:13.550> do<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:13.849> have<00:04:13.910> any<00:04:14.180> you<00:04:15.050> know<00:04:15.190> punch

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
have any do you have any you know punch

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:40.800 
have any do you have any you know punch
on<00:04:16.400> that<00:04:16.579> header<00:04:18.190> okay<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:19.250> so<00:04:19.760> does<00:04:20.359> that

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.920 

gotcha<00:04:42.010> yeah<00:04:43.010> yeah<00:04:43.940> it's<00:04:44.180> just<00:04:44.419> it's<00:04:44.840> just

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
gotcha yeah yeah it's just it's just

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.500 
gotcha yeah yeah it's just it's just
kind<00:04:45.260> of<00:04:45.290> a<00:04:45.380> never-ending<00:04:47.470> series<00:04:48.470> of<00:04:49.510> cycles

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
kind of a never-ending series of cycles

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.360 
kind of a never-ending series of cycles
like<00:04:50.720> this<00:04:51.430> yes<00:04:52.430> yeah<00:04:52.970> I<00:04:53.870> was<00:04:54.530> just<00:04:54.710> curious<00:04:54.919> if

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
like this yes yeah I was just curious if

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.210 
like this yes yeah I was just curious if
that<00:04:55.669> if<00:04:55.970> that<00:04:56.229> farthest<00:04:57.229> away<00:04:57.350> point<00:04:57.770> as<00:04:58.190> he

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
that if that farthest away point as he

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.240 
that if that farthest away point as he
described<00:04:58.729> it<00:04:58.990> was<00:04:59.990> was<00:05:00.440> in<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.740> physical

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
described it was was in the physical

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.270 
described it was was in the physical
realm<00:05:01.400> as<00:05:01.610> well<00:05:01.820> of<00:05:02.210> us<00:05:02.510> making<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:03.229> you<00:05:04.160> know

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
realm as well of us making that you know

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.280 
realm as well of us making that you know
coming<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.540> furthest<00:05:05.870> away<00:05:05.960> point

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
coming to the the furthest away point

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.140 
coming to the the furthest away point
from<00:05:06.470> this<00:05:06.620> this<00:05:07.010> star<00:05:07.280> and<00:05:07.610> that<00:05:07.790> we<00:05:07.910> were<00:05:08.030> now

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
from this this star and that we were now

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.320 
from this this star and that we were now
headed<00:05:08.450> back<00:05:08.750> in<00:05:08.930> that<00:05:09.050> direction<00:05:09.880> or<00:05:10.880> is<00:05:11.210> it
