00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.610 
courses but we've deliberately chosen to
do<00:03:39.940> this<00:03:40.090> on<00:03:40.240> a<00:03:40.270> much<00:03:40.480> larger<00:03:40.690> boat<00:03:41.050> than<00:03:41.230> usual

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
do this on a much larger boat than usual

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.070 
do this on a much larger boat than usual
you<00:03:41.740> know<00:03:41.770> it's<00:03:42.070> very<00:03:42.220> rare<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.550> see<00:03:43.080> vessels

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
you know it's very rare to see vessels

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.770 
you know it's very rare to see vessels
of<00:03:44.200> this<00:03:44.350> size<00:03:44.590> as<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:45.490> school<00:03:45.910> boat<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.630> gives

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
of this size as a school boat it gives

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.750 
of this size as a school boat it gives
you<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:46.900> better<00:03:47.050> feel<00:03:47.140> of<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:48.130> bigger<00:03:48.310> boat<00:03:48.550> and

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
you a better feel of a bigger boat and

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.650 
you a better feel of a bigger boat and
the<00:03:48.880> AR<00:03:49.480> way<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.800> motor<00:03:50.800> cruising<00:03:51.190> scheme<00:03:51.660> does

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
the AR way a motor cruising scheme does

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.950 
the AR way a motor cruising scheme does
qualify<00:03:53.080> you<00:03:53.200> up<00:03:53.410> to<00:03:53.560> 23<00:03:54.040> meters<00:03:54.430> so<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:55.750> makes

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
qualify you up to 23 meters so it makes

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.660 
qualify you up to 23 meters so it makes
sense<00:03:56.080> to<00:03:56.380> use<00:03:56.590> something<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.370> little<00:03:57.580> bit

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
sense to use something a little bit

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.340 
sense to use something a little bit
heavier<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.030> little<00:03:58.390> bit<00:03:58.480> longer<00:03:58.720> about

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
heavier a little bit longer about

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.080 
heavier a little bit longer about
training<00:03:59.620> you'll<00:04:00.490> spend<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.790> lot<00:04:00.940> of<00:04:00.970> the

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
training you'll spend a lot of the

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.940 
training you'll spend a lot of the
course<00:04:01.330> in<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:01.660> out<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.870> marinas<00:04:02.380> on<00:04:02.680> very

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
course in and out the marinas on very

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.010 
course in and out the marinas on very
short<00:04:03.250> passages<00:04:03.820> just<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.510> get<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.690> feel<00:04:04.990> for

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
short passages just to get a feel for

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.110 
short passages just to get a feel for
maneuvering<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:05.920> vessel<00:04:06.310> in<00:04:06.760> all<00:04:06.940> different

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
maneuvering the vessel in all different

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.640 
maneuvering the vessel in all different
conditions<00:04:07.780> are<00:04:07.900> sort<00:04:08.050> of<00:04:08.080> wind<00:04:08.260> and<00:04:08.410> tide

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
conditions are sort of wind and tide

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.920 
conditions are sort of wind and tide
you'll<00:04:09.580> be<00:04:09.670> doing<00:04:09.820> alongside<00:04:10.090> more<00:04:10.600> in<00:04:10.810> as

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
you'll be doing alongside more in as
