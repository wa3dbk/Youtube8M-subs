moment<00:05:32.480> she<00:05:32.690> said<00:05:32.990> I<00:05:33.820> think<00:05:35.620> he<00:05:36.620> might<00:05:37.130> have

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
moment she said I think he might have

00:05:37.160 --> 00:06:02.810 
moment she said I think he might have
said<00:05:38.020> beer

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:09.720 

and<00:06:03.840> it<00:06:04.840> was<00:06:04.960> only<00:06:05.200> at<00:06:05.590> that<00:06:05.620> moment<00:06:08.190> how<00:06:09.190> much

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
and it was only at that moment how much

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:19.170 
and it was only at that moment how much
more<00:06:10.210> likely<00:06:10.990> it<00:06:11.320> seemed<00:06:11.710> to<00:06:11.919> me<00:06:12.040> that<00:06:17.820> a<00:06:18.820> man

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
more likely it seemed to me that a man

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.930 
more likely it seemed to me that a man
would<00:06:19.510> step<00:06:19.900> out<00:06:20.110> of<00:06:20.139> nearly<00:06:20.710> a<00:06:20.860> day<00:06:21.340> in<00:06:21.760> a
