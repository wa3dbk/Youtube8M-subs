00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:10.879 
minecraft ps3 edition and there are
Northpoint<00:00:10.080> some<00:00:10.260> way<00:00:10.380> that<00:00:10.559> makes<00:00:10.710> them

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
Northpoint some way that makes them

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.740 
Northpoint some way that makes them
particularly<00:00:11.190> worth<00:00:11.400> useful<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.030> course<00:00:12.059> and

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
particularly worth useful of course and

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.839 
particularly worth useful of course and
this<00:00:13.110> week's<00:00:13.349> seed<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.889> very<00:00:14.250> much<00:00:14.460> notable

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
this week's seed is very much notable

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.060 
this week's seed is very much notable
because<00:00:14.969> it's<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.389> mushroom<00:00:15.809> island<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.470> by

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
because it's a mushroom island so by

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.439 
because it's a mushroom island so by
itself<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.550> may<00:00:17.670> be<00:00:17.730> thinking<00:00:17.850> oh<00:00:18.180> yeah<00:00:18.390> you

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
itself you may be thinking oh yeah you

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.540 
itself you may be thinking oh yeah you
just<00:00:18.750> they're<00:00:19.439> not<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.830> know<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.160> rare<00:00:20.400> by

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
just they're not you know that rare by

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.920 
just they're not you know that rare by
themselves<00:00:20.970> want<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.210> spawn<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.570> guess<00:00:21.750> that's

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
themselves want a spawn I guess that's

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.450 
themselves want a spawn I guess that's
pretty<00:00:22.080> cool<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:23.010> know<00:00:23.100> entirely

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
pretty cool but not you know entirely

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.130 
pretty cool but not you know entirely
rare<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.180> seed<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.539> an<00:00:24.630> extreme

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
rare but this seed is an extreme

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.660 
rare but this seed is an extreme
challenge<00:00:25.470> involving<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.279> mushroom<00:00:26.580> island

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
challenge involving the mushroom island

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.480 
challenge involving the mushroom island
because<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.900> basically<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> seed<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.279> just

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
because and basically the seed is just

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.250 
because and basically the seed is just
ridiculous<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.000> I'll<00:00:30.179> explain<00:00:30.420> why<00:00:30.599> now<00:00:30.929> so

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
ridiculous and I'll explain why now so

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260 
ridiculous and I'll explain why now so
this<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.890> as<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.340> said<00:00:32.550> an<00:00:32.700> extreme<00:00:33.090> challenge

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
this is as I said an extreme challenge

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.459 
this is as I said an extreme challenge
if<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.780> want<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> regular<00:00:34.260> game<00:00:34.350> of

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
if you just want a regular game of

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.990 
if you just want a regular game of
Minecraft<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.309> perhaps<00:00:35.489> not<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.820> seed

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
Minecraft this is perhaps not the seed

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.340 
Minecraft this is perhaps not the seed
for<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.570> if<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.750> looked<00:00:36.930> at<00:00:37.020> my<00:00:37.079> last

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
for you but if you looked at my last

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.110 
for you but if you looked at my last
story<00:00:38.129> my<00:00:38.309> seed<00:00:38.489> from<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.640> couple<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.879> weeks<00:00:39.030> ago

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
story my seed from a couple of weeks ago

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.670 
story my seed from a couple of weeks ago
where<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> showed<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> world<00:00:40.230> Hardesty

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
where I showed you the world Hardesty

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.290 
where I showed you the world Hardesty
which<00:00:40.829> had<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.280> one<00:00:41.430> tree<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.120> thought

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
which had just one tree and you thought

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.150 
which had just one tree and you thought
wow<00:00:42.600> that's<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> easy<00:00:43.230> toy<00:00:43.500> count<00:00:43.800> up<00:00:43.920> your

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
wow that's the easy toy count up your

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
wow that's the easy toy count up your
game<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.360> seed<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.230> basically

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
game this is a seed for you so basically

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.770 
game this is a seed for you so basically
as<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.460> said<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.789> spawn<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> mushroom<00:00:48.600> island

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
as I said you spawn on a mushroom island

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.840 
as I said you spawn on a mushroom island
so<00:00:49.170> again<00:00:49.469> by<00:00:49.680> itself<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.070> too<00:00:50.190> difficult<00:00:50.340> but

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
so again by itself not too difficult but

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.130 
so again by itself not too difficult but
then<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.059> head<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> next<00:00:51.660> Island<00:00:51.780> over<00:00:52.079> if

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
then you head to the next Island over if

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.090 
then you head to the next Island over if
you<00:00:52.230> want<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.530> which<00:00:52.680> by<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> way<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.039> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
you want to which by the way is a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.709 
you want to which by the way is a
massive<00:00:53.430> island<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.239> realize<00:00:54.390> that's<00:00:54.570> a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
massive island and you realize that's a

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.150 
massive island and you realize that's a
mushroom<00:00:54.989> island<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.320> which<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.680> guess<00:00:55.860> sucks

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
mushroom island to which I guess sucks

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.290 
mushroom island to which I guess sucks
but<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.520> know<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:56.820> head<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.090> next

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
but you know you just head to the next

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.939 
but you know you just head to the next
one<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:57.840> then<00:00:57.989> after<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.350> explore<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> whole

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
one but then after you explore the whole

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.439 
one but then after you explore the whole
map<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.280> realize<00:00:59.520> there's<00:00:59.760> not<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.969> single

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
map you realize there's not a single

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.330 
map you realize there's not a single
tree<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> thing<00:01:01.289> which<00:01:01.829> makes<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
tree on the thing which makes this a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.690 
tree on the thing which makes this a
treeless<00:01:02.789> map<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.890> my<00:01:04.890> first<00:01:05.129> port<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.549> was

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
treeless map and my first port that was

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.980 
treeless map and my first port that was
oh<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.939> guess<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.330> can't<00:01:06.510> really<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.720> things

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
oh I guess you can't really do things

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.690 
oh I guess you can't really do things
that<00:01:07.140> then<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.890> realized<00:01:08.189> there<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.430> actually

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
that then I realized there is actually

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.190 
that then I realized there is actually
another<00:01:08.729> way<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.270> wood<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.630> isn't<00:01:09.960> just

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
another way to get wood that isn't just

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.260 
another way to get wood that isn't just
from<00:01:10.380> trees<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:11.909> very<00:01:11.970> much

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
from trees and it's a very very much

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.390 
from trees and it's a very very much
difficult<00:01:12.720> way<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.680> makes<00:01:13.890> trying<00:01:14.250> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
difficult way and it makes trying to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.460 
difficult way and it makes trying to
beat<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.790> map<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.240> impossible<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
beat this map and impossible and

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.289 
beat this map and impossible and
possible<00:01:16.890> tasks<00:01:17.130> that's<00:01:17.790> gonna<00:01:17.909> require<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
possible tasks that's gonna require a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
possible tasks that's gonna require a
lot<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.570> skills<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:19.500> gonna<00:01:19.619> explain<00:01:19.890> what

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
these corners and then you need to dig

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.710 
these corners and then you need to dig
down<00:01:37.619> about<00:01:37.680> 25<00:01:38.549> blocks<00:01:38.820> some<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.540> gonna

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
you need to get yourself a stone case up

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.760 
you need to get yourself a stone case up
and<00:02:21.480> do<00:02:21.660> all<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.900> typical<00:02:22.110> minecraft<00:02:22.590> things

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
and do all the typical minecraft things

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.740 
and do all the typical minecraft things
but<00:02:23.190> you're<00:02:23.310> only<00:02:23.580> supplieth<00:02:23.940> wood<00:02:24.300> comes

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
but you're only supplieth wood comes

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.510 
but you're only supplieth wood comes
from<00:02:24.990> this<00:02:25.110> abandoned<00:02:25.590> mineshaft<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.340> that's

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
from this abandoned mineshaft so that's

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.670 
from this abandoned mineshaft so that's
an<00:02:26.640> incredibly<00:02:26.930> risky<00:02:27.930> strategy<00:02:28.230> right<00:02:28.620> there

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
an incredibly risky strategy right there

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.350 
an incredibly risky strategy right there
so<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.460> know<00:02:29.550> just<00:02:29.700> straight<00:02:29.970> off<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.180> bat

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
so you know just straight off the bat

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.270 
so you know just straight off the bat
really<00:02:30.750> really<00:02:30.900> difficult<00:02:31.050> then<00:02:31.980> once<00:02:32.130> you've

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
really really difficult then once you've

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.440 
really really difficult then once you've
done<00:02:32.430> all<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:33.030> need<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.270> set

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
done all of that you need to set
