00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.019
 a question has come to us that 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 has to do with prayer 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.070
 someone has written i think pray 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.900
 often tricky because it is on one 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.240
 directional traffic liked 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.670
 i say things to god but it seems 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.269
 as if god didn't really answer 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.369
 I long for a living prayer life 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.289
 but yes how can I do that 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.500
 and gives the Bible there too 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.629
 handles for prayer as inconvenient 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.460
 to experience 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.600
 There are many Christians who do 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.840
 to have 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.399
 sometimes maybe more often i think the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.010
 culture in which we do not live 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.860
 easy to indeed make a living 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.539
 to maintain prayer life 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.590
 and yet there is so much comfort and 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:02.010
 enrichment and refreshment and renewal 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.780
 possible if we also learn to pray 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.010
 we may also take the disciples against the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.430
 say here 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.350
 rather teach us to pray and in it 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.760
 extension of the question and answer to the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.250
 I would like to mention three things 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.320
 we pray but it looks like no 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.810
 answer 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.060
 I am sometimes disappointed in my 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.740
 prayer life 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.040
 how can we prevent that in the first 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.390
 place this our praying must also be accompanied 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.340
 go from reading in god word for in 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.619
 we find the Bible 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.079
 great promise regarding it 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.579
 Prayer For example if we only 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.850
 would pray and we would only 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:46.380
 can say yes god hears me as we 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.030
 feel that way as we would have it 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.090
 experience if we are only on our own 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.939
 trust personal experiences than 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.500
 maybe it could be that we 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.579
 sometimes say yes god heard me 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.040
 because I have felt that 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.439
 but if we read in the bible then read 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.969
 we just like in psalm 116 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.450
 I have that relief because he hears my 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.730
 vote my plea for he tends to be 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.550
 ear to me 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.560
 That is why I will invoke all my days 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.840
 so this is an example of a promise 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.660
 that we find in the Bible 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.440
 we may know god he hears me 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.830
 leans his ear to us said he is ready 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.830
 to listen to us he has 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.840
 attention to us he even has the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.300
 hair from our head counted that is how he is 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.960
 involved in our lives at know our 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.660
 thoughts 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.590
 our feelings because we stand up 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.230
 by standing on the promises of god 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.000
 word regarding prayer and that 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.500
 we can talk to him that we are him 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.560
 may call 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.080
 that we may share things with him and 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.100
 just know if it wants or not 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.100
 he listens 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.400
 the second thing I would like to mention is 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.960
 it also matters how he looks to the lord 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.780
 the entrance 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.170
 as we go to learn god access 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.730
 mainly with our wish list 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.190
 and with the things we want 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.890
 that they would happen or that we would 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.020
 go to god with our problems and 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.330
 that we expect from god that he be ours 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.490
 will solve problems then it would 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.410
 indeed a good can that we 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.040
 become disappointed because it is more god 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.350
 not especially someone we can 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.570
 use salmon oil to deal with god like 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.280
 someone we do in a different way 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.530
 can use and so handy to such 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.750
 to have god who does what we like 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.420
 want it to happen 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.270
 but what prayer is all about 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.440
 that we that we 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:48.680
 I come to myself that we community 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.000
 with him in the sense that that is the 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.580
 Lord God make us clear in his word 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.700
 makes the road clear that that 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.230
 Free entry is the way for us 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.000
 has been opened by his son jesus 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.410
 Christ 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.100
 you want to be allowed to be bold 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.470
 join god and his throne of 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.270
 mercy to get help but it 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.440
 heart from what prayer is about 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.940
 is that we are with him around 130 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.250
 also makes it very clear from the 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.109
 I cry out to your lord hunger 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.600
 let my ears be attentive in my voice 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.240
 to be 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.100
 my loud pleas and then it 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.140
 The problem sometimes is that his are 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.320
 iniquities that have separation 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.690
 brought between them and god 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.760
 here if you have the unfocused pain if you are there 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.260
 let the will exist but is with you 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.680
 forgiveness 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.200
 that you are feared with the gentlemen 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.210
 forgiveness and when we pray then 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.380
 we are restored to our relationship 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.510
 with god 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.570
 we may receive forgiveness we may 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.040
 confess our sins and then there is the 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.660
 cleaning 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.070
 If we confess our sins to 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.220
 blood of christ 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:00.180
 cleanses us from all our sins that is 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.830
 also where that is really true 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.140
 and that is what god says and 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.580
 clear market and we have already 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.580
 answer to the biggest problem 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.950
 namely that he forgives 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.680
 that he put our little on that we met again 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.440
 let him live on that we come in again 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.840
 fellowship with him may stand on that 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.850
 fear him and that's not the point 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.220
 that him as a kind of heavenly 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.750
 Sinterklaas or as a kind of 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:30.390
 psychotherapist who can to us especially 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.760
 can give it but we treat him 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.530
 worship as our god 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.260
 I expect my soul here 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.520
 him i hope his word my soul 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.880
 wait for manage it is about it 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.990
 longing for god and waiting for god 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.290
 and the third thing I'd like to mention is 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.380
 that we should simply do 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.750
 I think it's wonderful to happen in it 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.740
 book acts that then paulus rice 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.630
 with a number 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.570
 along with the apostles and with the missionaries 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.640
 and then read in acts at the age of 20 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.880
 that all those other employees who go 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.280
 with the ship of loyalty as to authors 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.210
 but on there 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.220
 paulus saw was boarding again in a6 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.080
 round 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.430
 He wanted to go on foot so Paul had 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.610
 was faithful 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.380
 asus on foot and he does that because he 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.080
 just want to be in the midst of the crowds 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.690
 amidst all the people around me and 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.250
 everything that was expected of him and what 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.510
 he all still do and everything there 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.180
 happened 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.280
 he looked for one 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.180
 her lady of loneliness on the 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:38.030
 silence and he walked 60 km along the 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.330
 kiss from pro as to authors in it 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.830
 present turkey and al asti to pray 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.240
 to be alone with god to be 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.669
 pour out the heart shape 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.910
 if you do that then you will notice that 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:51.500
 god really word and he then answers 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.080
 just have to do it 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.910
 so look for solitude record times 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.190
 of silence as paul are of 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.470
 delay of stillness 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.300
 to be alone with god and you will 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.009
 don't get disappointed because we know 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.220
 just be sure from god's word that he 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:08.960
 there is what he hears and that he himself 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.310
 to us 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.550
 and that's where it undergoes in it 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.550
 teeth
