volumes now what you really want to look

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.740 
volumes now what you really want to look
for<00:00:32.650> when<00:00:32.800> you<00:00:32.890> have<00:00:33.160> a<00:00:33.430> DVD<00:00:33.730> is<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:34.059> video<00:00:34.300> TS

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
for when you have a DVD is the video TS

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.540 
for when you have a DVD is the video TS
folder<00:00:35.140> which<00:00:35.320> is<00:00:35.500> going<00:00:35.620> to<00:00:35.710> be<00:00:35.830> on<00:00:35.949> every<00:00:36.100> DVD

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
folder which is going to be on every DVD

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.939 
folder which is going to be on every DVD
pretty<00:00:36.910> much<00:00:37.120> but<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:38.350> reason<00:00:38.680> that<00:00:38.710> this<00:00:38.890> is

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
pretty much but the reason that this is

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:40.710 
pretty much but the reason that this is
important<00:00:39.580> is<00:00:39.760> because<00:00:39.820> you<00:00:40.360> don't<00:00:40.540> actually

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
important is because you don't actually

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.079 
important is because you don't actually
have<00:00:41.080> to<00:00:41.140> rip<00:00:41.440> from<00:00:41.739> a<00:00:41.769> DVD<00:00:42.040> you<00:00:42.760> could<00:00:42.940> have<00:00:43.030> a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
have to rip from a DVD you could have a

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.270 
have to rip from a DVD you could have a
folder<00:00:43.570> with<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.900> video<00:00:44.140> TS<00:00:44.440> folder<00:00:44.799> in<00:00:44.949> it<00:00:45.070> or

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
folder with the video TS folder in it or

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.890 
folder with the video TS folder in it or
you<00:00:45.699> could<00:00:45.850> have<00:00:45.909> an<00:00:46.059> image<00:00:46.330> with<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.629> video

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
you could have an image with the video

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.020 
you could have an image with the video
TS<00:00:47.199> folder<00:00:47.530> in<00:00:47.650> it<00:00:47.769> the<00:00:48.280> important<00:00:48.699> thing<00:00:48.909> is

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
TS folder in it the important thing is

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.780 
TS folder in it the important thing is
that<00:00:49.059> video<00:00:49.409> underscore<00:00:50.409> TS<00:00:50.739> folder<00:00:51.100> exists

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
that video underscore TS folder exists

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.910 
that video underscore TS folder exists
so<00:00:52.449> I'm<00:00:52.510> going<00:00:52.659> to<00:00:52.720> go<00:00:52.809> ahead<00:00:52.900> and<00:00:53.260> click<00:00:53.500> open

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
so I'm going to go ahead and click open

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.549 
so I'm going to go ahead and click open
and<00:00:54.040> then<00:00:54.390> handbrake<00:00:55.390> is<00:00:55.540> going<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.930> scan<00:00:56.290> the

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
and then handbrake is going to scan the

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.570 
and then handbrake is going to scan the
source<00:00:56.860> for<00:00:57.519> files<00:00:57.760> that<00:00:58.030> it's<00:00:58.239> able<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.809> rip

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
source for files that it's able to rip

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.960 
source for files that it's able to rip
to<00:01:00.580> another<00:01:00.790> format<00:01:01.239> now<00:01:01.930> once<00:01:02.500> it's<00:01:02.680> done

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
to another format now once it's done

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.510 
to another format now once it's done
because<00:01:03.970> this<00:01:04.299> is<00:01:04.570> a<00:01:04.869> DVD<00:01:05.590> with<00:01:05.890> television

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
because this is a DVD with television

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.760 
because this is a DVD with television
episodes<00:01:06.970> on<00:01:07.240> it<00:01:07.390> we're<00:01:08.080> gonna<00:01:08.170> see<00:01:08.409> a<00:01:08.439> lot<00:01:08.710> of

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
episodes on it we're gonna see a lot of

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.760 
episodes on it we're gonna see a lot of
options<00:01:09.100> in<00:01:09.640> this<00:01:10.270> area<00:01:10.689> under<00:01:11.170> title<00:01:11.590> and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
options in this area under title and

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.380 
options in this area under title and
that<00:01:12.159> will<00:01:12.280> be<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.520> case<00:01:12.670> with<00:01:12.789> movies<00:01:13.210> too

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
that will be the case with movies too

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.389 
that will be the case with movies too
because<00:01:13.689> movies<00:01:13.960> often<00:01:14.140> have<00:01:14.469> extra<00:01:15.009> features

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
because movies often have extra features

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.370 
because movies often have extra features
and<00:01:15.670> other<00:01:15.789> things<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:16.329> so<00:01:16.390> when<00:01:17.259> you're

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
and other things and so when you're

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.499 
and other things and so when you're
ripping<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:17.859> title<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.820> only<00:01:18.939> thing<00:01:19.179> Hambrick

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
ripping a title the only thing Hambrick

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.389 
ripping a title the only thing Hambrick
is<00:01:19.630> going<00:01:19.899> to<00:01:20.020> give<00:01:20.170> you<00:01:20.350> is<00:01:20.530> how<00:01:20.950> long<00:01:21.159> that

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
is going to give you is how long that

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.109 
is going to give you is how long that
title<00:01:21.759> is<00:01:21.969> and<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.630> track<00:01:22.840> number<00:01:23.079> now<00:01:24.119> that's

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
title is and the track number now that's

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.510 
title is and the track number now that's
not<00:01:25.380> necessarily<00:01:26.380> enough<00:01:26.740> information<00:01:27.009> to

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
not necessarily enough information to

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.039 
not necessarily enough information to
figure<00:01:27.700> out<00:01:27.969> which<00:01:28.119> title<00:01:28.509> you<00:01:28.630> want<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:28.899> rip

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
figure out which title you want to rip

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.779 
figure out which title you want to rip
but<00:01:29.649> if<00:01:29.829> it's<00:01:29.950> something<00:01:30.219> like<00:01:30.249> a<00:01:30.369> movie<00:01:30.759> you

but if it's something like a movie you

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.520 
but if it's something like a movie you
know<00:01:31.090> how<00:01:31.240> long<00:01:31.420> it's<00:01:31.600> going<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.960> be<00:01:32.079> you<00:01:32.499> know

as you can see here I've got a few

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.270 
as you can see here I've got a few
options<00:01:45.929> and<00:01:46.929> I've<00:01:47.049> got<00:01:47.200> one<00:01:47.439> that's<00:01:47.859> one<00:01:48.130> hour

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
options and I've got one that's one hour

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.800 
options and I've got one that's one hour
in<00:01:48.460> 6<00:01:48.700> minutes<00:01:48.909> and<00:01:49.210> it's<00:01:49.389> a<00:01:49.479> little<00:01:49.630> bit

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
in 6 minutes and it's a little bit

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.899 
in 6 minutes and it's a little bit
longer<00:01:49.990> because<00:01:50.200> it's<00:01:50.499> the<00:01:50.649> pilot<00:01:51.039> and<00:01:51.219> then<00:01:51.850> I

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
longer because it's the pilot and then I

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.730 
longer because it's the pilot and then I
have<00:01:52.090> another<00:01:52.179> track<00:01:52.569> that's<00:01:52.749> 45<00:01:53.200> minutes<00:01:53.560> a

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
have another track that's 45 minutes a

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.440 
have another track that's 45 minutes a
couple<00:01:54.249> of<00:01:54.460> tracks<00:01:54.609> that<00:01:54.789> are<00:01:54.850> under<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.240> minute

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
couple of tracks that are under a minute

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.090 
couple of tracks that are under a minute
so<00:01:55.689> we<00:01:55.780> know<00:01:55.899> those<00:01:56.139> aren't<00:01:56.350> episodes<00:01:56.859> and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
so we know those aren't episodes and

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.580 
so we know those aren't episodes and
then<00:01:57.670> another<00:01:57.999> track<00:01:58.240> that's<00:01:58.389> 42<00:01:58.749> minutes<00:01:59.079> so

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
then another track that's 42 minutes so

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.289 
then another track that's 42 minutes so
we've<00:01:59.740> got<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.069> first<00:02:00.249> three<00:02:00.609> episodes<00:02:00.729> on

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
too much because it will take a really

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.069 
too much because it will take a really
long<00:03:22.000> time<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.420> go<00:03:22.510> through<00:03:22.690> all<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:22.870> these

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
long time to go through all of these

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.809 
long time to go through all of these
little<00:03:23.379> settings<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.859> I<00:03:24.069> don't<00:03:24.549> even<00:03:24.639> know

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
little settings and I don't even know

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.289 
little settings and I don't even know
what<00:03:24.940> half<00:03:25.090> this<00:03:25.269> stuff<00:03:25.329> is<00:03:25.629> to<00:03:25.870> be<00:03:25.959> honest<00:03:26.260> so

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
what half this stuff is to be honest so

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.789 
what half this stuff is to be honest so
that's<00:03:28.299> really<00:03:28.540> all<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:28.959> need<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.290> do<00:03:29.470> is

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
that's really all you need to do is

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.050 
that's really all you need to do is

televisions<00:04:23.139> so<00:04:23.740> you<00:04:23.800> want<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.070> make<00:04:24.190> sure<00:04:24.220> you

have D interlace turned on fast is

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.000 
have D interlace turned on fast is
usually<00:04:27.969> good<00:04:28.150> enough<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.690> do<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.409> job<00:04:29.440> but<00:04:29.889> if

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
usually good enough to do the job but if

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.170 
usually good enough to do the job but if
you<00:04:30.099> want<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.430> be<00:04:30.550> really<00:04:30.969> good

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
you want it to be really good

you want it to be really good
deinterlacing<00:04:31.479> you<00:04:31.960> want<00:04:32.139> to<00:04:32.229> choose<00:04:32.409> a

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
deinterlacing you want to choose a

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
deinterlacing you want to choose a
slower<00:04:32.800> speed

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
slower speed

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.580 
slower speed
this<00:04:33.970> is<00:04:34.150> important<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:34.780> set<00:04:35.050> otherwise

that D and releasing is necessary so

that D and releasing is necessary so
that's<00:04:56.440> all<00:04:56.590> there<00:04:56.710> is<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:56.979> it
