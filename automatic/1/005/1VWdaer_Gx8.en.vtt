hi<00:00:04.770> I'm<00:00:04.980> Dan<00:00:05.250> Rena<00:00:05.490> key<00:00:05.670> with<00:00:05.819> unknown<00:00:06.150> media

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
hi I'm Dan Rena key with unknown media

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.440 
hi I'm Dan Rena key with unknown media
today<00:00:06.990> let's<00:00:07.319> talk<00:00:07.500> about<00:00:07.560> ISO<00:00:08.460> versus<00:00:08.970> f-stop

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
today let's talk about ISO versus f-stop

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.690 
today let's talk about ISO versus f-stop
versus<00:00:09.990> shutter<00:00:10.320> speed<00:00:10.740> now<00:00:11.370> what<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:11.639> is

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
versus shutter speed now what this is

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.180 
versus shutter speed now what this is
going<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.940> be<00:00:12.090> dealing<00:00:12.509> with<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.320> exposure

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
going to be dealing with is the exposure

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.109 
going to be dealing with is the exposure
of<00:00:14.639> your<00:00:14.670> image<00:00:15.320> so<00:00:16.320> say<00:00:17.279> your<00:00:17.460> image<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.940> right

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
of your image so say your image is right

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:18.590 
of your image so say your image is right
here

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
here

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.710 
here
medium<00:00:19.050> exposure<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.830> got<00:00:20.010> your<00:00:20.310> aperture<00:00:20.970> or

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
medium exposure you got your aperture or

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.230 
medium exposure you got your aperture or
your<00:00:21.930> f-stop<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.769> got<00:00:22.920> your<00:00:23.070> ISO<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.880> then

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
your f-stop you got your ISO and then

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.870 
your f-stop you got your ISO and then
you<00:00:24.359> got<00:00:24.480> your<00:00:24.630> shutter<00:00:24.900> speed<00:00:25.460> all<00:00:26.460> right

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
you got your shutter speed all right

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.070 
you got your shutter speed all right
so<00:00:27.330> if<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.199> lower<00:00:28.830> your<00:00:29.160> f-stop<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.970> drop<00:00:30.900> it

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
so if you lower your f-stop or drop it

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.479 
so if you lower your f-stop or drop it
down<00:00:31.199> basically<00:00:31.769> what<00:00:31.920> that's<00:00:32.040> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.340> do

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
down basically what that's going to do

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.459 
down basically what that's going to do
it's<00:00:32.700> going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.940> eliminate<00:00:33.510> light<00:00:34.110> from<00:00:34.320> your

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
it's going to eliminate light from your

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.780 
it's going to eliminate light from your
photo<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.130> now<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.480> underexposed

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
photo so now it's a little underexposed

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.540 
photo so now it's a little underexposed
now<00:00:38.820> opposite<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.989> say<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.559> open<00:00:41.280> up<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
now opposite of that say we open up the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.910 
now opposite of that say we open up the
aperture<00:00:41.790> boom<00:00:42.450> we're<00:00:42.870> adding<00:00:43.260> light<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
aperture boom we're adding light to the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.760 
aperture boom we're adding light to the
image<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.399> now<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.879> louver<00:00:45.329> exposed<00:00:45.770> now

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
image so now it's a louver exposed now

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.160 
image so now it's a louver exposed now
it's<00:00:47.280> all<00:00:47.610> about<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.059> balancing<00:00:48.719> act<00:00:48.930> between

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
it's all about a balancing act between

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.580 
it's all about a balancing act between
the<00:00:49.800> aperture<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.000> shutter<00:00:51.449> speed<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
the aperture the shutter speed and the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.479 
the aperture the shutter speed and the
ISO<00:00:53.129> say<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.149> go<00:00:54.329> ahead<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.980> lower

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
ISO say we go ahead and we we we lower

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.479 
ISO say we go ahead and we we we lower
the<00:00:56.789> f-stop<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.660> we're<00:00:57.840> losing<00:00:58.170> light<00:00:58.199> here

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
the f-stop so we're losing light here

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.450 
the f-stop so we're losing light here
but<00:00:59.489> we<00:01:00.239> actually<00:01:00.500> lower<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.800> shutter<00:01:02.070> speed

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
but we actually lower the shutter speed

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.429 
but we actually lower the shutter speed
which<00:01:02.699> allows<00:01:02.969> more<00:01:03.359> light<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.690> come<00:01:04.080> into<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
which allows more light to come into the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.890 
which allows more light to come into the
camera<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.580> here<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:06.659> what

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
camera so it's going here and now what

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.899 
camera so it's going here and now what
that<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.080> going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.920> actually<00:01:08.340> balances

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
that is going to do it actually balances

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.330 
that is going to do it actually balances
it<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.869> again<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.650> whole<00:01:10.920> thing<00:01:11.189> is

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
it out so again this whole thing is

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.399 
it out so again this whole thing is
going<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.729> more<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.540> balancing<00:01:13.229> act

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
going to be more of a balancing act

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.770 
going to be more of a balancing act
rather<00:01:13.770> than<00:01:14.100> than<00:01:14.460> them<00:01:14.760> working<00:01:15.119> against

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
rather than than them working against

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.249 
rather than than them working against
each<00:01:15.869> other

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
each other

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.990 
each other
say<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.920> want<00:01:17.220> something<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.759> real

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
say you want something with a real

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.660 
say you want something with a real
shallow<00:01:18.390> depth<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.869> field<00:01:18.930> go<00:01:19.710> ahead<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.250> open

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
shallow depth of field go ahead and open

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.399 
shallow depth of field go ahead and open
up<00:01:20.759> your<00:01:20.820> aperture<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.540> wide<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> will<00:01:22.229> go

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
up your aperture as wide as it will go

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.469 
up your aperture as wide as it will go
so<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.070> get<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.520> real<00:01:23.759> shallow<00:01:24.150> depth

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
so you can get that real shallow depth

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.539 
so you can get that real shallow depth
of<00:01:24.630> field<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.080> now<00:01:25.619> ultimately<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.400> is

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
of field but now ultimately this is

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.330 
of field but now ultimately this is
going<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.759> make<00:01:26.939> your<00:01:27.090> image<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.570> lot<00:01:27.750> brighter

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
going to make your image a lot brighter

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.969 
going to make your image a lot brighter
so<00:01:29.340> what<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.479> lower<00:01:30.990> your<00:01:31.290> ISO<00:01:31.799> if

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
so what you can do is lower your ISO if

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.980 
so what you can do is lower your ISO if
possible<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:33.030> will<00:01:33.240> actually<00:01:33.450> bring<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
possible that will actually bring the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.289 
possible that will actually bring the
exposure<00:01:34.409> down<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.670> raise<00:01:36.030> your

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
exposure down or you can raise your

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.270 
exposure down or you can raise your
shutter<00:01:36.570> speed<00:01:36.689> which<00:01:37.140> again<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:37.890> bring

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
shutter speed which again will bring

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.910 
shutter speed which again will bring
down<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.579> overall<00:01:39.329> exposure<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.650> again

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
down that overall exposure but again

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.219 
down that overall exposure but again
it's<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.159> finding<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.150> middle<00:01:42.509> ground<00:01:42.960> is

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
it's just finding that middle ground is

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.429 
it's just finding that middle ground is
finding<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.829> nice<00:01:44.100> even<00:01:44.700> exposure<00:01:45.509> where

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
finding that nice even exposure where

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.980 
finding that nice even exposure where
everything<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.549> balanced<00:01:48.090> correctly<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.840> how

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
everything is balanced correctly to how

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.410 
everything is balanced correctly to how
you<00:01:49.049> want<00:01:49.560> your<00:01:49.829> image<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.159> come<00:01:50.460> out<00:01:50.700> so

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
you want your image to come out so

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.020 
you want your image to come out so
that's<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.780> little<00:01:51.960> insight<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.710> ISO<00:01:53.460> versus

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that's a little insight on ISO versus

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.660 
that's a little insight on ISO versus
