00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
that doesn't mean that the base is

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.630 
that doesn't mean that the base is
lacking<00:02:33.090> here<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.959> qc15<00:02:34.590> s<00:02:35.040> have<00:02:35.190> base<00:02:35.430> that

that on a long flight a couple of weeks
ago<00:03:01.769> I<00:03:01.950> was<00:03:02.280> able<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.519> put<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:02.790> these

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
ago I was able to put on these

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.430 
ago I was able to put on these
headphones<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.569> essentially<00:03:03.959> cancel<00:03:04.349> out

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
headphones and essentially cancel out

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.130 
headphones and essentially cancel out
all<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.890> cabin<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.400> engine<00:03:05.790> noise<00:03:05.940> as<00:03:06.269> for

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
all the cabin and engine noise as for

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.720 
all the cabin and engine noise as for
improvements<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.709> these<00:03:07.860> headphones<00:03:08.069> I<00:03:08.400> don't

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
improvements to these headphones I don't

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.640 
improvements to these headphones I don't
really<00:03:08.910> have<00:03:09.030> any<00:03:09.510> now<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.110> lot<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.349> people

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
really have any now a lot of people

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.199 
really have any now a lot of people
don't<00:03:10.890> like<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.280> have<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.580> use<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.760> triple

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
don't like that you have to use a triple

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.270 
don't like that you have to use a triple
a<00:03:12.299> battery<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.959> power<00:03:12.989> these<00:03:13.319> headphones<00:03:13.590> but

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
a battery to power these headphones but

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.280 
a battery to power these headphones but
Bose<00:03:14.549> knows<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.209> best<00:03:15.450> experience<00:03:16.080> and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
Bose knows that the best experience and

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.380 
Bose knows that the best experience and
best<00:03:16.560> comfort<00:03:16.950> with<00:03:17.280> these<00:03:17.459> headphones<00:03:17.670> comes

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
best comfort with these headphones comes

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.970 
best comfort with these headphones comes
when<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:18.660> have<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.930> noise<00:03:19.109> cancelling<00:03:19.650> on<00:03:19.769> at

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
when you have the noise cancelling on at

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.240 
when you have the noise cancelling on at
all<00:03:20.220> times<00:03:20.660> even<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.350> battery<00:03:22.680> lasts<00:03:23.100> for

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
all times even so the battery lasts for

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.800 
all times even so the battery lasts for
up<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.459> thirty<00:03:23.730> five<00:03:24.000> hours<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.780> can

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
up to thirty five hours and you can

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.569 
up to thirty five hours and you can
easily<00:03:25.170> keep<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.650> couple<00:03:25.829> of<00:03:26.040> extra<00:03:26.310> batteries

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
easily keep a couple of extra batteries

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.400 
easily keep a couple of extra batteries
in<00:03:26.730> your<00:03:26.790> case<00:03:27.150> so<00:03:27.600> it's<00:03:27.720> not<00:03:27.900> like<00:03:28.079> you'll<00:03:28.230> be

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
in your case so it's not like you'll be

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.160 
in your case so it's not like you'll be
buying<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.829> bunch<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.100> batteries<00:03:29.519> all<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.760> time

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
buying a bunch of batteries all the time

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.420 
buying a bunch of batteries all the time
overall<00:03:31.170> these<00:03:31.530> headphones<00:03:31.799> are<00:03:32.100> hard<00:03:32.310> to
