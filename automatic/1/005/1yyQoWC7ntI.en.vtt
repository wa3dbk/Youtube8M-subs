00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.279
 belga 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.810
 hello and welcome to this live the performances of the weekly show 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.279
 the session 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.279
 this week we will try to develop the road 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.620
 and you'll see our team of researchers looking over the year 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.010
 quickly made the rounds of police series 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.050
 but what are these strange 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.620
 which ones you have directed your research 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.010
 ask the question to you 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.220
 before I go 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.360
 you find the supermotards a bit too much because he says the road 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.910
 a little bland sports too dangerous for your license funds 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.820
 Structural Europeans have thought of you and is proposing a new breed of 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.320
 motorbike 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.890
 the big sports trails we find this week nor a precursor model 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.760
 in the category that have become a little facelift for two 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.760
 defeat the multistrada Ducati in the lead race 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.470
 he triumphed at heart 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.150
 to get to the end of our experience we left our 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.630
 laboratory for tests 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.740
 on the terrain of predilection of these machines the small winding roads 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.170
 because it works 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.800
 these bikes that are both wheels this uproar raised its opening brings of 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.800
 new sensations unknown until then 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.070
 I'm basically these machines may seem a bit bastard but this 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.080
 learned mix of genres resulted on a near-perfect track against 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.440
 performance of the versatile limacher of questionable nature of character 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.480
 on that plane we are served 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.480
 if from a point of view of alain juppÃ© has already proven itself on the road 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.950
 we feel good alone 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.749
 but the less famous word three cylinders in angular lines 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.450
 what had already investigated us during our first episode 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.729
 There's nothing to say 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.079
 these bikes on one 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.650
 in the imposing template are underlined by posed designers 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.890
 was sought they will run some baffling especially those of the 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.939
 ducati equipment and finishing of china a call for that 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.939
 reproach them italian france 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.609
 without blinking in high school little touches of carbon 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.299
 the call last night about steering much more welcoming the saddle is 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.529
 softer the more natural position 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:34.329
 we immediately feel that these two machines do not play in the same yard 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.329
 it is confirmed we must overcome 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:44.979
 all this looks like a revival of appetite technical center to the fathers of these 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:49.059
 contracts and sports compared to the roadster they came from petroci 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.239
 have lost a little of the compass enduro stop big jazzy trails 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.460
 retains its legendary softness and suppleness 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.310
 he hits from 2,500 laps and falters slightly at 6600 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.020
 will surround coast-d'or satane national bridle while the calculation of cuts 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.540
 the road with its possible trajectories 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.819
 we take the opportunity to present him with three legs rolling with its prices 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.629
 input from one turn to another with vigor 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.069
 it's a little less efficient but just as pleasant 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.829
 to conclude I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised by a 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.379
 triumphs elsewhere all the machines easy to fly it will take you all 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.459
 days at work but who will not be reluctant to a little sprain 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.649
 additional costs 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:24.069
 the equation is simple 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.069
 take it from the mechanics the first half 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.709
 the city of sailing 

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:34.089
 his idea 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.089
 the report of real authors 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.339
 so we're going to mix all that up you'll see story 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:42.230
 it's not at all 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.919
 etc. in parallel 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.329
 to listen to it I love this style 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.329
 so I'm just going to listen to you 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.859
 jasser did good 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.019
 before you recover our rasta from this crisis of capitalism 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.709
 the amount of the valley 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.359
 clarisse 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.440
 we will wait for him 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.729
 there he 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.769
 while rediscovering the sensations of the new triumph 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.899
 besides that I found myself too much how date of the ducati 

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:17.889
 multistrada we feel that 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.219
 a craft that makes time work to listen to the song 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:24.669
 the multistrada marks sportiness with taut lines 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.409
 Exhausts under the saddle a front mudguard in carbon a 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.770
 irreproachable finish the tree fell 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.970
 this version receives suspensions worthy of a real sports with a 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.590
 fork to the lines is the quarter in three millimeters in diameter 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.590
 fully adjustable 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.460
 all that is good but what about the price 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.110
 it is true that he posted 3000 euros more expensive than the taiga multistrada 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.199
 no longer pay dearly for his original 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.749
 with its bicylindre chance the multistrada is for fans of 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:58.770
 thrills 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.809
 but without sacrificing comfort so far 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:04.629
 the big slum ration make you feel comfortable and even if the ducati start 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.520
 August that triumphs his finesse from his saddle maneuverability to the rule 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.569
 the part-cycle of the multistrada and more efficient at the attacked the room of 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:13.319
 atrium 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.469
 and the ducati be organized to give the best of itself 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.729
 personally I can not make my choice 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.159
 so the titles things to know about these two motorcycles 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.919
 the ground clearance remains quite limited including right with a protection 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:37.900
 of collectors 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.219
 that touches early enough 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:42.610
 on the other hand brembo braking remains disappointing on a machine of such 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.939
 caliber leave three members of attac and biting against the crisis a motorcycle 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:48.089
 playful 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:52.499
 functional efficient but this good definition of the perfect final bike 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:56.529
 finally the trio press a bike more accessible while the ducati it 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:58.770
 not for an experienced driver 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.789
 she approved this bag the court agreed to sign it 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.409
 their honor 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:27.229
 england 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:39.460
 his approach what would it serve for what 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.460
 nicole grafeille why so much 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:47.699
 among the stables 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:50.680
 the other two French did not say no to reforms
