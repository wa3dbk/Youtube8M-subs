00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello welcome to bild.de picks tree 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.370
 and a beamer even come close to it 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.529
 also explain a little something in physics 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.800
 we need black shoe box on 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.750
 best cell phone tape scalpel one 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.250
 loop or lens very important and me 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.049
 I've used a cassette why show 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.240
 I like the carton right away 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.510
 paint in black paint black 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.400
 black paper one so stick the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.199
 radiation from the cell phone not so 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.779
 is reflected strongly then he takes the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.010
 Lens this is a reading stones 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.949
 for a couple of euros to buy war 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.420
 or just a magnifying glass puts on the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.559
 narrow outside newspaper lead 78 cm height 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.850
 from the ground, the circle with the pen 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.200
 and then cut clean 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.030
 either with the scalpel that is 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.600
 Of course, super good or with one 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.430
 box cutter 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.020
 that also works the clean 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.430
 Cutout club the better it is 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.289
 after that, when the lens is inserted 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.760
 and they had really good ones 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.050
 cut in close cut then 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.379
 remains ever on his own 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.239
 stick 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.010
 Here I show that music I have to 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.809
 spend a bit of your energy on your own 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.409
 press but also sits right 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.770
 still go and glue that over 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.369
 Whole on the edge will be relevant to yours 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.200
 important so-called armor-bound it is 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.570
 must be an opaque sting so 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.030
 do not use a tesa film which is transparent 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.650
 because only through the lens itself through 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.720
 the magnifying glass itself so not out yet 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.490
 but not around the edge around it 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.220
 if you have normal magnifier would have the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.810
 lens trying to assemble out or 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.400
 there are only flowers because you can style 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.049
 Finally, unscrew the thing 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.610
 be installed as it was called now 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.530
 the handy stand I have here a 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.909
 old music cassette taken from the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.740
 you have made the cave out in the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.729
 perfect stand already finished you have to 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.189
 just flip the flap up and can 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.409
 put the mobile wonderfully in there 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.549
 Always brasilia upright and up too 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.700
 so on the desk or dessert 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.549
 so nice gimmick then 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.070
 place in the box 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.450
 who has a shoebox user now 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.069
 It does not have a huge advantage 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.929
 on the bottom of such a lax 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.329
 in the way as I know never hang on it 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.010
 has remained but there can be handy 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.549
 completely clean in stand back and 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.319
 herschieben 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.420
 that's important after when it comes to it 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.459
 it's all about focusing 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.840
 In operation, the whole thing looks like this 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:28.590
 inside the phone is also from the floods 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.349
 stone directed outwards you can see how 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.879
 the light gets along the white dots 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.730
 focus point to the paper on the piece 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.169
 See what is before pruss the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.930
 beams of light and are against the wall 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:41.489
 thrown so a picture what looks and 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.379
 the perfect enlargement 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.780
 which of the picture zurÃ¼ckgehe direction 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.939
 mobile phone quasi in the hatch stone pure 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.489
 therefore, of course, someday that seems 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.230
 picture what the cell phone emits that 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.639
 the whole thing we have on the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.060
 a page is mobile still times 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.379
 represented the lens and two 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.969
 the red light is the upper one 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.939
 top of the cell phone the reasons ours 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:05.069
 The ray is running in the lens of the Rhine 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.959
 once broken in by the rounding 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.150
 the lens a second time if he 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.829
 comes out of the lens it is characterized 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.840
 littered down the deflected 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.310
 lower beam deflected upwards the 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.780
 meet a point in the focal point 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.889
 like I said before why 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.349
 Focal point could be in the summer 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.419
 just try it with the lens 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.790
 hand the sun keep Linsel dull the 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:26.009
 Loupe over it and the magnifying glass so far away 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.470
 bring light from different points 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.819
 or why should it burn the well 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.889
 rays intersect and that too 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.840
 reason why the picture advises on 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:36.090
 That's why you should go ahead 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.680
 or now if it is when he is 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.209
 proceed according to let the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.340
 picture if I already turning upside down 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.109
 yes that was it again I have fun 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.530
 it was easy to imitate until 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.530
 next time
