00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.670
 Russia is a country with difficult climatic 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.150
 conditions because most of the winter 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.910
 season 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.170
 the road is covered with snow and ice specially 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.779
 for use in such regions 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.829
 michelin has developed studded 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.670
 x-ice north 3 bus 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.100
 it is natural that such a progressive 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.730
 the product was designed far from 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.960
 a clean slate creating a tire in particular 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.059
 empathy machines in the first place 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.010
 repelled from the needs 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.200
 motorists a lot of attention 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.969
 It was paid as I said conditions 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.309
 operating on what roads really 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.600
 rides in the winter in Russia motorists and 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.910
 in addition, we interviewed the owners themselves 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.920
 cars because you understand that 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.170
 really wait from the car and in 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.570
 particular nuances such as strength 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.720
 sidewalls we know the road can sometimes 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.729
 keep surprises very important 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.720
 moment apart from this it is important that 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.869
 studded tire 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.640
 retained thorns not only in season 1 and here 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.530
 these are the moments that we got exactly 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.939
 communicating with our customers and it served 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.310
 specific task for engineers when 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.210
 creating a new generation of tires so 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.950
 the client practically writes us a task for 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.229
 new product development he 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.650
 really stands in the center of our 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.230
 technological progress 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.140
 If you go to the language of numbers then the bus 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.720
 michelin x-ice north 3 has a brake 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.910
 the path is ten percent shorter than 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.290
 previous generation fixing reliability 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.390
 spikes rose 25 percent a 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.690
 number of spikes per meter of surface 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.670
 the table is 50 who matches 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.860
 latest world standards engineers 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.050
 michelin companies have combined a whole 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.900
 complex of innovative technologies for 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.119
 third generation tire tag site 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.399
 snort demonstrated effectiveness 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.830
 in several directions at once 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.100
 more about this will tell our 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.990
 specialist tire michelin x-ice north 3 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.180
 manufacturer is positioned as a tire 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.100
 for real winters what does that mean it 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.260
 means that company specialists 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.840
 michelin primarily considered 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.880
 features of the Scandinavian climate 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.700
 what do they mean by themselves 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.250
 special harsh winter conditions thanks to 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.760
 using a new rubber compound 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.630
 which has the effect of thermo active 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.640
 plasticity 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.000
 managed to achieve such outstanding 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.480
 characteristics precisely for very low 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.010
 winter temperatures is a new model 2013 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.930
 of the year 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.120
 including the most recent 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.340
 technical development company michelin 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.850
 patented smart spike technology 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.800
 than its features are used here 2 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.150
 circular flange but 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.940
 the main feature of this technology 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.800
 is to apply thermo active 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.140
 rubber compound that changes its 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.060
 ductility with temperature 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.489
 and what can you say about the figure protectors 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.500
 spike pattern tread pattern 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.870
 pronounced directed thanks to 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.000
 why is water and snow effectively derived ? 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.739
 porridge from the contact spot multi-row 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.950
 studing allows the most efficient 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:28.340
 use the entire tread surface 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.870
 when moving on slippery ice 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.500
 surfaces and what about 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.570
 structure 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.880
 framework in this model specialist 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.549
 Michelin for the first time for winter tires 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.530
 applied ironflex technology thanks 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.299
 which increases the stiffness of the sidewall 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.700
 her ability to deform when 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.920
 passage of road irregularities except 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.500
 individual technologies that are implemented 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.330
 in this model, michelin declares 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.730
 about some strategy total perform 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.000
 what is the essence of this strategy 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.560
 is that in the tire complex 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.960
 provides an unrivaled level 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.650
 safety on all types of road 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.530
 coating at any temperature conditions 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.900
 under any weather conditions without forgetting 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.270
 pay special attention 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.310
 durability and wear resistance that 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.770
 You can say about the comfort of this tire because 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.870
 floor and full and rather stiff tire on 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.760
 in fact, these tires are very comfortable for 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.820
 through application in the outer layer 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.390
 flexo soft rubber protector 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.430
 of 3 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.350
 this ensures low 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.940
 noise level and high level of comfort 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.730
 another feature of this model 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.510
 is the creation of special wells 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.610
 around the thorn 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.860
 thanks to which it is effectively derived 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.140
 ice chips from the contact patch 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.780
 ice chips interferes with work not only 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.490
 the thorn itself but also the rubber compound 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.260
 I want to draw your attention to the fact that 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.810
 when the temperature changes 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.000
 tire coupling properties may change 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.310
 tires behave differently at high and 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.230
 at low temperatures so I want 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.160
 so you always have it in mind and be 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.160
 extremely neat
