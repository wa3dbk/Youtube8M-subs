00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.710
 is questioned by love ask you if it has to do with contained those who 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.269
 I had the one to go back to earth without the icc they differentiated against the fan 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.360
 fundamentally of that simeone that debuted like trainer to whom racing 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.539
 what happened a while and many teams the middle 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.370
 they were made or not 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.370
 is quickly found because the two parties 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.269
 always there the same objective 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.509
 obviously when 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.589
 when the same objective is not 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.670
 of the two sides sendel want to see 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.370
 and the differences appear 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.960
 in this case punctually 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.050
 did not appear 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.050
 and obviously we are comfortable and in the beginning 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.610
 good to start to walk the path that 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.530
 what we want to look for 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.150
 then you find the staff obviously of that young coach 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.240
 percent and he left the quilmes court 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.690
 percent 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.080
 to start doing it 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.490
 in in in racing in this or insane there is a growth as to not 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.740
 work due to the experiences 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 very good good and some way we've had 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.160
 ibm finds out very enthusiastically now what else my client and send him 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.250
 all right 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.010
 percent do not take it with a step back some say 'good de benet e icaria 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.460
 to return to Argentine football I always look and see 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.950
 what seduces me and what they see 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.960
 nothing feel different thing and this makes me feel something different 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.960
 blind so we can 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.880
 to show 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.790
 with facts not with words 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.820
 I think that Morelia is 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.850
 of usury meters to want to reinforce the team thinking what is coming 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.550
 journalists also the fact that some players 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.550
 that I am important is the team and they stay in situation 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.149
 I think we just started talking about everything, it's clear that 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.840
 santana 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.630
 the leader as we want the best for racing isern have the best 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:09.739
 is to have a balance 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.639
 balance in everything and for that they fear that we will sit down we will talk that what 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:14.909
 it suits you racing 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.779
 what suits us to have tools for which 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:22.179
 they have come to care for us and and to be able to demonstrate 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.509
 on the field but obviously 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.509
 racing is in a process of growth 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.619
 e that beyond the results in the latter 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.669
 period do not speak 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:37.020
 of this because unfortunately I live 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.409
 too low as he was excited at the start 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.099
 percent 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.449
 let's wait room to agree, it will surely be 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.449
 in what suits the club and what the team needs to 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.499
 it looks like growth 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:52.729
 melissa sudden for channel 26 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:56.729
 and when you left you thought that in favor of the left end was an account 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:58.169
 pending I had 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:03.379
 and it will also do so if it considers that it will go gilmore ahmad zia 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.239
 fundamental for this new 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.000
 in academic career the official because when then and tomás gómez 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:10.899
 Inc 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.899
 how good bento they chose another way 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:19.089
 nothing said something that is known will remember 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.519
 said gold insurance 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.579
 because I had started something very nice 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.049
 and because 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.309
 but I felt that way
