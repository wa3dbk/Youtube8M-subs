key this is ordinarily the left key is

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.099 
key this is ordinarily the left key is
now<00:00:58.530> going<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.370> be<00:00:59.430> used<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.879> go<00:01:00.030> down<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.690> up

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
now going to be used to go down and up

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.470 
now going to be used to go down and up
and<00:01:01.289> down<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.579> also<00:01:02.699> go<00:01:03.030> left<00:01:03.270> to

and down and it can also go left to

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.600 
and down and it can also go left to
right<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.939> so<00:01:05.939> that's<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.220> also

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
right like that so that's that and also

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.300 
right like that so that's that and also
because<00:01:09.110> it's<00:01:10.110> oriented<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.710> way<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:11.159> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
because it's oriented this way if you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.429 
because it's oriented this way if you
take<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> picture<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:13.200> wrong<00:01:13.380> way

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
megapixel camera and it has a little

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.969 
megapixel camera and it has a little
light<00:01:26.939> adjustment<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.930> see<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.770> i'll

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
light adjustment so if you see if i'll

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.819 
light adjustment so if you see if i'll
look<00:01:29.340> into<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.759> light<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.329> camera

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
look into the light with this camera

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.190 
look into the light with this camera
then<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.220> see<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.880> adjusts<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.049> can

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
then you see it adjusts it and you can

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.929 
then you see it adjusts it and you can
see<00:01:34.380> verily<00:01:34.799> anything<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> light<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:35.850> if

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
see verily anything but the light but if

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.910 
see verily anything but the light but if
you<00:01:36.030> aim<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.210> back<00:01:36.479> down<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:37.290> will<00:01:37.439> adjust<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
you aim it back down it will adjust it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.920 
you aim it back down it will adjust it
so<00:01:37.950> you're<00:01:38.250> looking<00:01:38.579> at<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> ground<00:01:38.970> again<00:01:39.299> it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
so you're looking at the ground again it

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
no matter what I do it's not going to

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.050 
no matter what I do it's not going to
stop<00:04:40.090> my<00:04:40.360> recording<00:04:41.220> also<00:04:42.220> it<00:04:42.520> stops<00:04:42.849> the

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
stop my recording also it stops the

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
recording according to size and sizes

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.750 
recording according to size and sizes
told<00:04:46.300> with<00:04:46.599> the<00:04:47.560> video<00:04:47.800> obviously<00:04:47.979> the<00:04:48.460> length

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
told with the video obviously the length

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.510 
told with the video obviously the length
but<00:04:49.060> also<00:04:49.240> with<00:04:49.900> pictures<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:50.620> videos<00:04:50.889> size

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
but also with pictures and videos size

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.180 
but also with pictures and videos size
can<00:04:51.880> be<00:04:52.000> determined<00:04:52.479> by<00:04:52.870> how<00:04:53.050> colorful<00:04:53.770> it<00:04:54.070> is

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
can be determined by how colorful it is

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.149 
can be determined by how colorful it is
believe<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.699> or<00:04:54.760> not<00:04:55.020> for<00:04:56.020> example<00:04:56.500> I<00:04:56.710> would<00:04:56.800> be

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:57.159 
believe it or not for example I would be

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:00.659 
believe it or not for example I would be
wasting<00:04:57.610> more<00:04:57.759> space<00:04:58.650> if<00:04:59.650> I<00:04:59.860> happened<00:05:00.280> to<00:05:00.370> be

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
wasting more space if I happened to be

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.300 
wasting more space if I happened to be
recording<00:05:01.180> about<00:05:01.270> this<00:05:01.599> window<00:05:02.259> and<00:05:02.470> looking

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
at a whole bunch of green rather than if

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.999 
at a whole bunch of green rather than if
our<00:05:06.460> recording<00:05:07.240> something<00:05:08.139> completely<00:05:08.740> black

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
camera for pictures for video maybe not

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.990 
camera for pictures for video maybe not
as<00:05:37.090> much<00:05:37.120> but<00:05:37.630> still<00:05:37.779> is<00:05:38.020> very<00:05:38.050> handy

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
as much but still is very handy
