00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
I felt a thrill and I understood that it

really<00:04:27.370> wasn't<00:04:27.850> what<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.000> had<00:04:28.090> expected<00:04:28.480> it<00:04:29.410> was

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
really wasn't what I had expected it was

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.600

a<00:04:29.740> UFO<00:04:30.540> taking<00:04:31.540> us<00:04:32.440> out<00:04:32.740> of<00:04:32.800> ourselves<00:04:33.010> in<00:04:33.520> the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
a UFO taking us out of ourselves in the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.159 
a UFO taking us out of ourselves in the
middle<00:04:34.560> it<00:04:35.560> must<00:04:35.740> have<00:04:35.830> been<00:04:36.010> to<00:04:36.669> hundreds<00:04:37.169> 180

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
middle it must have been to hundreds 180

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.980 
middle it must have been to hundreds 180
meters<00:04:38.560> from<00:04:38.680> here<00:04:38.740> it<00:04:39.640> was<00:04:39.820> closer<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.450> so<00:04:40.840> it

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
meters from here it was closer and so it

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.980 
meters from here it was closer and so it
looked<00:04:41.169> larger<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:42.130> don't<00:04:42.820> know<00:04:42.940> maybe<00:04:43.780> the

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
looked larger and I don't know maybe the

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.600 
looked larger and I don't know maybe the
video<00:04:44.260> camera<00:04:44.710> helped<00:04:44.980> me<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.190> put<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:45.460> into

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
video camera helped me to put it into

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.460 
video camera helped me to put it into
focus<00:04:45.880> enough<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.660> see<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.990> image<00:04:47.169> clearly

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
focus enough to see the image clearly

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.710 
focus enough to see the image clearly
and<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:48.040> believe<00:04:48.820> was<00:04:48.970> thanks<00:04:49.300> to<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.510> video

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
and I believe was thanks to the video

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.890 
and I believe was thanks to the video
camera<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.910> one<00:04:52.120> thing<00:04:52.270> that<00:04:52.419> really<00:04:52.450> caught

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
camera and one thing that really caught

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.230 
camera and one thing that really caught
my<00:04:52.930> attention<00:04:53.080> was<00:04:53.770> that<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.280> made<00:04:54.430> no<00:04:54.610> noise<00:04:54.820> I

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
my attention was that it made no noise I

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.480 
my attention was that it made no noise I
might<00:04:56.169> have<00:04:56.320> thought<00:04:56.410> it<00:04:56.560> was<00:04:56.650> an<00:04:56.740> airplane<00:04:57.160> a

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
might have thought it was an airplane a

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.969 
might have thought it was an airplane a
helicopter<00:04:57.790> but<00:04:58.750> I<00:04:58.930> couldn't<00:04:59.410> hear<00:04:59.590> any<00:04:59.770> noise

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
helicopter but I couldn't hear any noise

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.159 
helicopter but I couldn't hear any noise
and<00:05:00.340> that<00:05:01.030> was<00:05:01.180> what<00:05:01.360> made<00:05:01.479> me<00:05:01.660> get<00:05:01.810> my<00:05:01.960> video

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
and that was what made me get my video

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.730 
and that was what made me get my video
camera<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:02.860> start<00:05:03.130> filming<00:05:04.050> but<00:05:05.050> when<00:05:05.350> I<00:05:05.380> saw

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
camera and start filming but when I saw

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.710 
camera and start filming but when I saw
it<00:05:05.770> through<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.190> video<00:05:06.400> camera<00:05:06.820> when<00:05:07.419> I<00:05:07.450> saw

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
it through the video camera when I saw

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.540
