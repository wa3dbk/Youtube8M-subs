to normalize your audio in Sony Vegas
movie<00:00:08.309> studio<00:00:08.340> now<00:00:09.090> by<00:00:09.389> normalizing<00:00:09.900> what<00:00:10.260> I

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
movie studio now by normalizing what I

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.049 
movie studio now by normalizing what I
mean<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.740> you're<00:00:10.980> going<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.219> raise<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.880> volume

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
mean is you're going to raise the volume

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.390 
mean is you're going to raise the volume
of<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.540> audio<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.530> loudest<00:00:13.920> point<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.280> can

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
of the audio to the loudest point it can

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.180 
of the audio to the loudest point it can
be<00:00:14.580> without<00:00:15.089> any<00:00:15.450> clipping<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.740> useful

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
be without any clipping this is useful

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.800 
be without any clipping this is useful
if<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.340> recorded<00:00:17.880> narration<00:00:18.060> or<00:00:18.600> if<00:00:18.690> your

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
if you recorded narration or if your

if you recorded narration or if your
shot<00:00:18.990> video<00:00:19.350> where<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.740> audio<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.130> you

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
shot video where the audio that you

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.250 
shot video where the audio that you
recorded<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.210> volume<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.720> too<00:00:21.930> low<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.140> hear

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
recorded the volume is too low to hear

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.590 
recorded the volume is too low to hear
well<00:00:22.680> now<00:00:23.340> when<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.580> normalize<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.359> again

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
well now when you normalize it again

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.120 
well now when you normalize it again
it's<00:00:24.779> going<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.930> raise<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.199> volume<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
it's going to raise the volume to the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.179 
it's going to raise the volume to the
maximum<00:00:26.609> point<00:00:27.090> where<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.720> won't<00:00:27.900> clip<00:00:28.529> now

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
maximum point where it won't clip now

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.589 
maximum point where it won't clip now
clipping<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.640> where<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.849> volume<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.390> loud

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
clipping is where the volume is so loud

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.240 
clipping is where the volume is so loud
that<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.929> starts<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.230> crack<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> speaker

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
that it starts to crack in the speaker

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.520 
that it starts to crack in the speaker
doing<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.450> very<00:00:33.719> very<00:00:33.960> easy<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.320> Sony

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
doing this is very very easy in Sony

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.410 
doing this is very very easy in Sony

this clip right here I can play it to

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.420 
this clip right here I can play it to
hear<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.770> audio

lieutenant good Sam's rally is the
demographics<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> attempt<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.940> can

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
demographics of the attempt and I can

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.970 
demographics of the attempt and I can
tell<00:00:45.270> where<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> audio<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.140> loud<00:00:46.410> enough<00:00:46.440> and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
tell where the audio is loud enough and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.500 
tell where the audio is loud enough and
I<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.190> see<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> tracks<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
I can see here on the tracks that the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.690 
I can see here on the tracks that the
audio<00:00:48.809> could<00:00:49.410> afford<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.950> normalized

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
audio could afford to be normalized

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.520 
audio could afford to be normalized
without<00:00:51.210> clipping<00:00:51.449> now<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.350> what<00:00:52.500> I

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
without clipping now to do that what I

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.830 
without clipping now to do that what I
do<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.829> right-click<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.850> audio<00:00:54.210> event<00:00:54.629> I

and you can see the waveform is a lot

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.280 
and you can see the waveform is a lot
taller<00:01:06.060> now<00:01:06.360> which<00:01:06.540> means<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> volume<00:01:07.170> has

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
taller now which means the volume has

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.380 
taller now which means the volume has
gone<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.040> play<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.490> Durell<00:01:08.970> durand

point<00:01:30.720> where<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> decide<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.860> don't<00:01:32.100> want

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
point where I decide that I don't want

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.649 
point where I decide that I don't want
to<00:01:32.310> normalize<00:01:32.430> them<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.240> select<00:01:33.540> them

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
to normalize them I can select them

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.560 
to normalize them I can select them
again<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.229> choose<00:01:35.130> switches<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.939> uh

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
again and choose switches and uh

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.399 
again and choose switches and uh
normalize

now<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.680> may<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:37.860> wondering<00:01:37.950> why<00:01:38.490> would<00:01:38.549> you

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
now you may be wondering why would you

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.340 
now you may be wondering why would you
want<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> unnormalized<00:01:39.810> something<00:01:40.229> that's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
want to unnormalized something that's

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.200 
want to unnormalized something that's
already<00:01:40.500> been<00:01:40.650> normalized<00:01:41.189> well<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.090> have

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
already been normalized well if you have

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.760 
already been normalized well if you have
an<00:01:42.329> audio<00:01:42.570> track<00:01:42.750> where<00:01:43.110> there's<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.500> loud

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
an audio track where there's a loud

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.469 
an audio track where there's a loud
noise<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.670> middle<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.970> track<00:01:45.149> maybe<00:01:45.360> a

noise in the middle of track maybe a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.870 
noise in the middle of track maybe a
slamming<00:01:45.930> doors<00:01:46.140> might<00:01:46.649> coughing<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.310> that's

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
slamming doors might coughing and that's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.880 
slamming doors might coughing and that's
the<00:01:48.000> loudest<00:01:48.180> point<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> track<00:01:49.140> when<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the loudest point of the track when it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.740 
the loudest point of the track when it

make<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.320> loudest<00:01:52.530> point<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.700> may

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
make that the loudest point and you may

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.969 
make that the loudest point and you may
not<00:01:54.000> want<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.479> if<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.409> case<00:01:55.560> let's

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
not want that if that's the case let's

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.399 
not want that if that's the case let's
say<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.310> right<00:01:56.460> here<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.930> coughing

that<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.710> want<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.009> remove<00:01:59.430> what<00:02:00.030> I'd<00:02:00.149> want<00:02:00.360> to

that we want to remove what I'd want to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.109 
that we want to remove what I'd want to
do<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:01.140> press<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> s<00:02:01.829> key<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.250> split<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.729> area

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
do is press the s key to split that area

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.280 
do is press the s key to split that area
out<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:04.070> only<00:02:05.070> normalize<00:02:05.790> around<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.170> that

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
out and only normalize around it so that

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.559 
out and only normalize around it so that
I<00:02:07.350> don't<00:02:07.380> normalize<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.399> loud<00:02:08.849> noise<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.239> that

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
I don't normalize the loud noise so that

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.630 
I don't normalize the loud noise so that
the<00:02:09.810> loud<00:02:09.989> noise<00:02:10.259> affects<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.039> volume<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.520> all

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the loud noise affects the volume of all

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.830 
the loud noise affects the volume of all
the<00:02:11.760> other<00:02:11.879> noises<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:13.020> again<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.560> know

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
