00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.330
 good afternoon company Slavic court we 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.649
 we are engaged in the production of stairs 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.559
 quite a long period that is, we 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.110
 engaged in metal as well as yourself 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.320
 the metal part is mastered and that is 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.449
 the quality of customer claims means no 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.580
 but until recently we completed 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.550
 our stairs are not purchased steps 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.689
 there are steps we bought from suppliers 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.970
 Now we start production 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.449
 self that is why are we to this 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.809
 came then the first moment is quality 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.300
 what we get from the supplier is always 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.610
 comes in the packaging that is, if you notice 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.950
 in all hypermarkets on the construction 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.680
 markets level packed packed in 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.160
 yellow opaque film i.e. you are not 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.870
 see what you buy it is like 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.559
 the rule is made on automatic 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.010
 equipment 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.140
 that is where the cut is reduced participation 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.780
 manual labor is automated that is 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.239
 according to inform not specifically delivers us 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.619
 As such, it is sometimes easy to shoot 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.630
 unable to control quality 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:13.970
 in some cases revealing the stage 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.970
 the client generally sees a drop-down knot 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.900
 there will be a drop-down knot at all 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.560
 not permissible understand and accordingly 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.590
 as we could not influence it even 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.840
 from the same supplier sometimes 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.360
 party party were different ie we 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.240
 came to their own production then 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.119
 have what we improved what we changed 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.220
 steps means a step which 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.380
 presented in hypermarkets on 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.899
 construction markets 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.750
 99 percent of the stage is perfect 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.380
 stage and step slats they are spliced 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.070
 along the length here you see a spike spike that is 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.030
 at length 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.520
 meter, we sometimes have 34 urgent spikes 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.200
 that is, in this case, here is the thorn 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.689
 neat but he is not always so 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.600
 neat understand that is often he 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.369
 again falling out with chips that is 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.759
 for making quality you can only 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.670
 with a bite to paint such a step 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.900
 equal to c uniformly bright bright 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.200
 stain is almost impossible 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.629
 due to the fact that the resin is different this 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.140
 I will . this is different 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:24.329
 paint falls and shade is different 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.209
 so we do it all in manual mode 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:30.329
 that is, the equipment is used 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.280
 this jointer and surface gage compass to that is 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.519
 bar goes through hands many times 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.170
 at each stage of control work control 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.909
 quality ie lack 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.980
 dropping out knots definitely removed 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.930
 that is, we do not pack tightly 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.870
 we will look at every step 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.650
 we pack a pack entirely that is with us 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.519
 not the most 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.980
 not the lowest prices but for their quality 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.099
 we answer thank you for the attention of all 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.099
 kind
