it actually handles more like a tire
rolling<00:01:34.350> violently<00:01:34.829> down<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> hill<00:01:35.340> while

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
rolling violently down a hill while

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.649 
rolling violently down a hill while
you're<00:01:35.610> trying<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> steer<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.299> by<00:01:36.390> throwing

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
you're trying to steer it by throwing

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.600 
you're trying to steer it by throwing
tennis<00:01:36.930> balls<00:01:37.049> at<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.470> from<00:01:37.560> either<00:01:37.680> side<00:01:37.829> but

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
tennis balls at it from either side but

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.520 
tennis balls at it from either side but
it<00:01:38.670> does<00:01:38.820> offer<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.390> really<00:01:39.990> really<00:01:40.229> cool

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
it does offer one really really cool

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.499 
it does offer one really really cool
unique<00:01:40.770> feature<00:01:41.159> which<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.820> well<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.329> guess

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
unique feature which is well I guess

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.270 
unique feature which is well I guess
there's<00:01:42.780> two<00:01:42.840> there's<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.380> camera<00:01:43.829> angles

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
there's two there's the camera angles

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.560 
there's two there's the camera angles
which<00:01:44.430> are<00:01:44.579> kind<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.820> awesome<00:01:45.180> except<00:01:45.420> for<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
which are kind of awesome except for the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.210 
which are kind of awesome except for the
blinking<00:01:45.899> tires<00:01:46.170> thing<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.189> course

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
blinking tires thing and then of course

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
blinking tires thing and then of course
is<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> fact<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.119> free<00:01:48.450> roaming<00:01:48.780> this

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
is the fact that it's free roaming this

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.350 
is the fact that it's free roaming this
is<00:01:49.590> one<00:01:49.799> big<00:01:50.070> giant<00:01:50.310> world<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.030> I'm<00:01:51.119> just

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
is one big giant world and I'm just

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.899 
is one big giant world and I'm just
driving<00:01:51.899> around<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.890> however<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.610> want

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
driving around in it just however I want

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.100 
driving around in it just however I want
I'm<00:01:54.000> stuck<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.360> something<00:01:54.600> what<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.990> hell

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
really re rolling us

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.060 
really re rolling us
alright<00:01:59.470> so<00:01:59.620> there<00:01:59.740> might<00:01:59.830> be<00:01:59.860> a<00:01:59.950> couple

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
alright so there might be a couple

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.410 
alright so there might be a couple
quirks<00:02:00.400> with<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.580> driving<00:02:00.790> around<00:02:01.000> on<00:02:01.210> land

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
quirks with the driving around on land

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.760 
quirks with the driving around on land
but<00:02:01.660> this<00:02:01.780> thing<00:02:01.960> definitely<00:02:02.320> has<00:02:02.470> zero

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
but this thing definitely has zero

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.980 
but this thing definitely has zero
issues<00:02:03.160> driving<00:02:03.370> underwater<00:02:04.330> that's<00:02:04.720> right

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
issues driving underwater that's right

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.210 
issues driving underwater that's right
this<00:02:05.170> thing<00:02:05.320> pretty<00:02:05.500> much<00:02:05.560> just<00:02:05.740> says<00:02:05.920> fuck

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
this thing pretty much just says fuck

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.580 
this thing pretty much just says fuck
you<00:02:06.250> water<00:02:06.640> just<00:02:06.910> keeps<00:02:07.060> on<00:02:07.240> going<00:02:07.590> anyways

who knows but the open world thing the
whole<00:02:15.970> concept<00:02:16.420> there<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.660> awesome<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.410> wished

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
whole concept there is awesome I wished

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.650 
whole concept there is awesome I wished
it<00:02:17.800> was<00:02:17.890> available<00:02:18.010> for<00:02:18.310> motorcycles<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:19.330> that

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
it was available for motorcycles is that

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.870 
it was available for motorcycles is that
hold<00:02:20.260> on<00:02:20.350> a<00:02:20.380> second<00:02:20.860> are<00:02:21.220> those<00:02:21.340> mr.<00:02:21.700> bill

A+<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:25.330> seems<00:02:25.570> like<00:02:25.780> every<00:02:26.230> week<00:02:26.260> there's<00:02:26.470> some

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
A+ it seems like every week there's some

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.950 
A+ it seems like every week there's some
kind<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.340> classic<00:02:27.850> game<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.270> I<00:02:28.300> find<00:02:28.690> that's

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
kind of classic game that I find that's

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.680 
kind of classic game that I find that's
been<00:02:29.140> ported<00:02:29.500> into<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.850> ported<00:02:31.270> into<00:02:31.420> your

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
been ported into it ported into your

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.480 
been ported into it ported into your
like<00:02:31.810> as<00:02:31.930> if<00:02:32.350> they<00:02:32.470> just<00:02:32.650> kind<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.100> change<00:02:33.370> a

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
like as if they just kind of change a

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.890 
like as if they just kind of change a
couple<00:02:33.610> lines<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:34.060> code<00:02:34.240> and<00:02:34.450> suddenly<00:02:34.750> it's

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
couple lines of code and suddenly it's

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.140 
couple lines of code and suddenly it's
in<00:02:34.990> Trials<00:02:35.290> Evolution<00:02:35.460> but<00:02:36.460> anyways<00:02:36.730> we<00:02:36.880> find

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
in Trials Evolution but anyways we find

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.230 
in Trials Evolution but anyways we find
these<00:02:37.360> games<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:37.840> we<00:02:37.900> have<00:02:37.930> pinball<00:02:38.380> we<00:02:38.980> had

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
everybody has played this style of game

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.010 
everybody has played this style of game
on<00:02:44.410> like<00:02:44.770> their<00:02:44.980> Atari<00:02:45.280> 2600<00:02:45.880> or<00:02:46.330> even<00:02:46.750> before

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
on like their Atari 2600 or even before

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.630 
on like their Atari 2600 or even before
that<00:02:47.200> like<00:02:47.410> they're<00:02:47.590> in<00:02:47.680> television<00:02:48.220> system

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640

I was like negative 15 years old and I

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.880 
I was like negative 15 years old and I
played<00:02:55.720> this<00:02:55.900> game<00:02:55.990> and<00:02:56.320> I<00:02:56.380> was<00:02:56.560> just<00:02:56.710> sitting

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
played this game and I was just sitting

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.200 
played this game and I was just sitting
there<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.040> just<00:02:57.250> kind<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.460> you<00:02:57.790> gotta<00:02:57.940> kind<00:02:58.150> of
