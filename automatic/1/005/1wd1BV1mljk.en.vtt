00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
it's very aggressive pick up for that

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.870 
it's very aggressive pick up for that
sound<00:04:44.430> however<00:04:44.640> you<00:04:45.630> do<00:04:45.930> get<00:04:46.080> some<00:04:46.260> hum<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:46.880> in

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
sound however you do get some hum and in

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.060 
sound however you do get some hum and in
some<00:04:48.150> venues<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:48.630> play<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:49.050> hum<00:04:49.200> is<00:04:49.350> very<00:04:49.830> loud

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
some venues I play the hum is very loud

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.590 
some venues I play the hum is very loud
so<00:04:50.310> I<00:04:50.370> really<00:04:50.730> have<00:04:50.850> to<00:04:50.880> control<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.450> volume

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
so I really have to control the volume

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.890 
so I really have to control the volume
now<00:04:51.960> in<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.500> studio<00:04:52.710> here<00:04:53.480> very<00:04:54.480> minimal

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
now in the studio here very minimal

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.480 
now in the studio here very minimal
because<00:04:54.990> I'm<00:04:55.230> not<00:04:55.320> cranked<00:04:55.740> up<00:04:55.830> very<00:04:56.070> loud<00:04:56.250> I'm

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
because I'm not cranked up very loud I'm

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.040 
because I'm not cranked up very loud I'm
not<00:04:56.640> adding<00:04:57.030> distortion<00:04:57.570> if<00:04:57.660> I<00:04:57.750> did<00:04:57.900> that

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
not adding distortion if I did that

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.740 
not adding distortion if I did that
you'd<00:04:58.200> hear<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.530> hum<00:04:58.710> that<00:04:58.860> 60<00:04:59.250> cycle<00:04:59.610> hum<00:04:59.750> so

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
you'd hear the hum that 60 cycle hum so

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.630 
you'd hear the hum that 60 cycle hum so
common<00:05:01.140> with<00:05:01.230> single<00:05:01.530> coils<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.040> these

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
common with single coils and these

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.850 
common with single coils and these
pickups<00:05:03.120> you<00:05:04.110> get<00:05:04.290> that<00:05:04.440> it's<00:05:04.650> just<00:05:04.800> a

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
pickups you get that it's just a

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.800 
pickups you get that it's just a
byproduct<00:05:05.040> now<00:05:05.580> you<00:05:05.640> can<00:05:05.820> go<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.030> another<00:05:06.540> type

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
byproduct now you can go to another type

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.770 
byproduct now you can go to another type
of<00:05:06.840> pick<00:05:07.080> up<00:05:07.110> like<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:07.410> lace<00:05:07.680> sensor<00:05:08.220> or<00:05:08.780> the

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
of pick up like a lace sensor or the

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.040 
of pick up like a lace sensor or the
noise<00:05:10.020> cancelling<00:05:10.800> pickups<00:05:11.460> but<00:05:12.120> I<00:05:12.360> find<00:05:12.840> a

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
noise cancelling pickups but I find a

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.390 
noise cancelling pickups but I find a
lot<00:05:13.170> of<00:05:13.230> times<00:05:13.500> they<00:05:13.680> don't<00:05:13.710> have<00:05:14.010> the<00:05:14.160> bite

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
lot of times they don't have the bite

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.420 
lot of times they don't have the bite
that's<00:05:14.730> the<00:05:14.880> trade-off<00:05:15.150> you<00:05:15.540> know<00:05:15.690> they

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
that's the trade-off you know they

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.010 
that's the trade-off you know they
cancel<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:17.520> hum<00:05:17.700> but<00:05:18.600> they<00:05:18.690> don't<00:05:18.840> have<00:05:18.900> the

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
cancel the hum but they don't have the

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.950 
cancel the hum but they don't have the
bite<00:05:19.790> but<00:05:20.790> they're<00:05:21.000> developing<00:05:21.510> all<00:05:21.660> kinds<00:05:21.930> of

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
bite but they're developing all kinds of

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.980 
bite but they're developing all kinds of
new<00:05:22.110> pickups<00:05:22.470> now<00:05:22.530> and<00:05:22.980> and<00:05:23.130> and<00:05:24.120> actually

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
new pickups now and and and actually

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.270 
new pickups now and and and actually
some<00:05:25.169> companies<00:05:25.560> even<00:05:25.590> have<00:05:25.919> designed

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
some companies even have designed

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.220 
some companies even have designed
circuit<00:05:27.000> boards<00:05:27.300> that<00:05:27.360> you<00:05:27.510> can<00:05:27.660> put<00:05:27.930> like<00:05:28.110> in

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
circuit boards that you can put like in

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.500 
circuit boards that you can put like in
the<00:05:28.320> back<00:05:28.530> of<00:05:28.740> your<00:05:28.830> guitar<00:05:29.190> like<00:05:29.430> sir<00:05:29.760> makes

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
the back of your guitar like sir makes

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.000 
the back of your guitar like sir makes

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
one I haven't tried that yet if anyone

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.650 
one I haven't tried that yet if anyone
has<00:05:32.190> send<00:05:32.730> me<00:05:32.820> an<00:05:32.880> email<00:05:33.000> because<00:05:33.300> I'd<00:05:33.450> like<00:05:33.570> to

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
know how that works they make like a

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.500 
know how that works they make like a
different<00:05:35.669> you<00:05:35.730> take<00:05:35.910> the<00:05:36.030> back<00:05:36.210> plate<00:05:36.480> off

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
different you take the back plate off

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.270 
different you take the back plate off
and<00:05:36.870> you<00:05:36.930> install<00:05:37.440> this<00:05:37.620> new<00:05:37.830> plate<00:05:38.040> with<00:05:38.160> this

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
and you install this new plate with this

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.560 
and you install this new plate with this
device<00:05:38.550> on<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:38.910> back<00:05:39.090> and<00:05:39.270> it<00:05:39.360> supposedly

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
device on the back and it supposedly

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.710 
device on the back and it supposedly
cancels<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.950> hum<00:05:41.160> like<00:05:41.669> to<00:05:41.820> try<00:05:42.000> that<00:05:42.030> see<00:05:42.660> if

a half or a minor third and two steps
and<00:07:17.039> really<00:07:17.460> work<00:07:17.639> in<00:07:17.789> the<00:07:17.880> notes<00:07:18.060> just<00:07:18.270> takes

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:18.509 
and really work in the notes just takes

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:19.779 
and really work in the notes just takes
a<00:07:18.569> little<00:07:18.719> bit<00:07:18.870> of<00:07:18.930> time<00:07:19.110> but<00:07:19.169> you<00:07:19.440> can<00:07:19.620> do<00:07:19.740> it

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:19.789 
a little bit of time but you can do it

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:23.149 
a little bit of time but you can do it
first<00:07:20.789> learn<00:07:21.029> run<00:07:21.270> and<00:07:21.479> learn<00:07:21.599> fly<00:07:22.039> like<00:07:23.039> I

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:23.159 
first learn run and learn fly like I

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:25.639 
first learn run and learn fly like I
always<00:07:23.340> say
