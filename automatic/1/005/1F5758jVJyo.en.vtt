00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
he was a 94 I believe a 94 overall which

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.440 
he was a 94 I believe a 94 overall which
is<00:00:29.099> very<00:00:29.519> good<00:00:30.140> but<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.470> mean<00:00:32.219> his<00:00:32.610> his<00:00:33.120> stats

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
is very good but I mean his his stats

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.270 
is very good but I mean his his stats
are<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.930> lot<00:00:34.440> better<00:00:34.649> than<00:00:34.980> they<00:00:35.100> were<00:00:35.130> last

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
are a lot better than they were last

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.020 
are a lot better than they were last
year<00:00:35.790> too<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:37.190> comparing<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> stats<00:00:38.550> he<00:00:38.820> got<00:00:39.000> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
year too so comparing the stats he got a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.290 
year too so comparing the stats he got a
lot<00:00:39.270> more<00:00:39.300> points<00:00:39.840> per<00:00:40.379> game<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.770> last<00:00:40.950> year

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
lot more points per game the last year

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.639 
lot more points per game the last year
better<00:00:42.300> he<00:00:42.540> was<00:00:42.719> better<00:00:42.960> with<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.290> assist

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
better he was better with the assist

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.670 
better he was better with the assist
overall<00:00:44.520> same<00:00:45.090> amount<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.660> Steel<00:00:45.930> same<00:00:46.410> amount

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
overall same amount of Steel same amount

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.510 
overall same amount of Steel same amount
of<00:00:46.770> rebounds<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:48.329> he<00:00:48.600> did<00:00:48.750> better<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.980> i<00:00:50.010> would

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
of rebounds so he did better so i would

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.360 
of rebounds so he did better so i would
i<00:00:50.789> would<00:00:51.600> expect<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.260> huge<00:00:52.469> boost<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.980> since

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
i would expect a huge boost and since

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.250 
i would expect a huge boost and since
he's<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> cover<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.210> even<00:00:54.570> live<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.930> little

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
he's on the cover and even live a little

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.729 
he's on the cover and even live a little
bit<00:00:55.590> more<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.070> boost<00:00:56.309> there<00:00:56.489> too<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.559> my

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
bit more of a boost there too so in my

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.450 
bit more of a boost there too so in my
opinion<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.520> think<00:01:00.239> Kevin<00:01:00.780> Durant<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:02.039> go<00:01:02.250> up

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
opinion I think Kevin Durant will go up

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.500 
opinion I think Kevin Durant will go up
to<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:06.020> 97<00:01:07.020> 98<00:01:07.830> at<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.490> most<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.939> don't<00:01:09.090> think<00:01:09.330> he

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
to a 97 98 at the most I don't think he

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.530 
to a 97 98 at the most I don't think he
will<00:01:09.659> go<00:01:09.869> 99<00:01:10.640> they<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.939> might<00:01:12.119> since<00:01:12.390> he

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
will go 99 they just might since he

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.670 
will go 99 they just might since he
hasn't<00:01:12.659> recovery<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> think<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.869> 97<00:01:15.869> 98

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
hasn't recovery but I think a 97 98

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.810 
hasn't recovery but I think a 97 98
would<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.750> extremely<00:01:18.750> good<00:01:19.080> for<00:01:19.380> Kevin<00:01:19.680> Durant

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
would be extremely good for Kevin Durant

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.480 
would be extremely good for Kevin Durant
that's<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.060> my<00:01:21.240> opinion<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:22.340> want<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.400> know

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
that's just my opinion I want to know

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.380 
that's just my opinion I want to know
