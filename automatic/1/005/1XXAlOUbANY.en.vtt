with<00:01:52.420> just<00:01:52.660> this<00:01:53.259> you<00:01:53.979> do<00:01:54.130> have<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.310> trigger<00:01:54.580> but

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
with just this you do have a trigger but

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:56.490 
with just this you do have a trigger but
you<00:01:55.060> can't<00:01:55.420> really<00:01:55.509> do<00:01:55.690> much<00:01:55.720> with<00:01:55.840> anyway<00:01:56.259> but

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
you can't really do much with anyway but

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.499 
you can't really do much with anyway but
still<00:01:56.920> on<00:01:57.160> break<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.490> end<00:01:57.640> result<00:01:57.970> some<00:01:58.330> other

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
still on break the end result some other

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:18.600 
still on break the end result some other
ones<00:01:58.750> so<00:01:59.319> you<00:01:59.470> put<00:01:59.649> it<00:01:59.740> in<00:02:16.950> sound<00:02:17.950> effects

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.699 
ones so you put it in sound effects
sadly<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.599> can't<00:02:19.630> lead<00:02:19.989> too<00:02:20.110> much<00:02:20.290> with<00:02:20.410> it

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709

sadly you can't lead too much with it
like<00:02:20.890> this<00:02:21.099> without<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.849> engine<00:02:21.970> souls<00:02:22.300> but

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
like this without the engine souls but

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.540 
like this without the engine souls but
at<00:02:22.810> least<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.080> can<00:02:23.200> stand<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.770> so<00:02:24.069> well

electronics<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:26.269> is<00:03:26.690> nicely<00:03:27.019> detailed<00:03:27.410> but

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
electronics it is nicely detailed but

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.860

electrons or a button to push to

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.120 
electrons or a button to push to
actually<00:03:33.260> activate<00:03:33.620> something<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.069> really

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
actually activate something it really

so now I have the mode blaster slash
highway<00:03:48.330> blaster<00:03:48.750> now<00:03:48.960> this<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.680> all<00:03:49.860> three<00:03:50.070> of

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
highway blaster now this is all three of

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.070 
highway blaster now this is all three of
them<00:03:50.250> combined<00:03:50.580> now<00:03:50.820> in<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.120> mode<00:03:51.330> in<00:03:51.600> the

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
them combined now in this mode in the

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.380 
them combined now in this mode in the
show<00:03:52.290> they<00:03:52.500> actually<00:03:52.740> shoot<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.640> subtracter

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
show they actually shoot the subtracter

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.170 
show they actually shoot the subtracter
out<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:54.900> actually<00:03:55.170> hits<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.160> enemies<00:03:56.460> now

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
out and actually hits the enemies now

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.730 
out and actually hits the enemies now
you<00:03:57.240> can<00:03:57.630> still<00:03:57.810> activate<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.260> engine<00:03:58.500> souls

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
you can still activate the engine souls

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.520 
you can still activate the engine souls
so<00:03:59.220> this<00:03:59.600> toy<00:04:00.600> itself<00:04:00.870> has<00:04:01.110> something<00:04:01.410> really

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
so this toy itself has something really

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.780 
so this toy itself has something really
interesting<00:04:01.710> has<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.010> safety<00:04:02.280> lock<00:04:02.490> so<00:04:02.730> you

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
interesting has a safety lock so you

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.490 
interesting has a safety lock so you
can't<00:04:03.060> really<00:04:03.270> match<00:04:03.510> automatically<00:04:04.080> shoot

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
can't really match automatically shoot

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.870 
can't really match automatically shoot

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
smaller because they were supposed to

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.110 
smaller because they were supposed to
fit<00:05:00.480> in<00:05:00.600> that<00:05:00.750> one<00:05:01.020> bow<00:05:01.140> set<00:05:01.350> now<00:05:02.220> yellow<00:05:02.760> she

fit in that one bow set now yellow she

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.780 
fit in that one bow set now yellow she
actually<00:05:03.270> lost<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:04.170> color<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.650> color<00:05:04.920> on<00:05:05.220> the

actually lost the color the color on the
yellow<00:05:05.970> is<00:05:06.120> actually<00:05:06.410> more<00:05:07.410> brighter<00:05:07.740> she

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
yellow is actually more brighter she

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.180 
yellow is actually more brighter she
lost<00:05:08.670> the<00:05:09.180> stickers<00:05:09.630> on<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.650> side<00:05:10.680> here<00:05:11.010> which

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
lost the stickers on the side here which

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.000 
lost the stickers on the side here which
is<00:05:11.250> kind<00:05:11.460> of<00:05:11.490> stupid<00:05:11.730> and<00:05:12.240> they<00:05:12.330> also<00:05:12.510> made<00:05:12.930> the

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
is kind of stupid and they also made the

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.710 
is kind of stupid and they also made the
area<00:05:14.010> buzzer<00:05:14.490> with<00:05:14.970> like<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.150> little<00:05:15.360> windows

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
area buzzer with like a little windows

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.420 
area buzzer with like a little windows
all<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.170> way<00:05:16.260> around<00:05:16.290> so<00:05:16.740> you<00:05:16.860> see<00:05:17.040> blue<00:05:17.280> one

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
all the way around so you see blue one

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.970 
all the way around so you see blue one
with<00:05:17.610> that<00:05:17.760> now<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.630> straight<00:05:18.990> saber<00:05:19.290> most<00:05:19.770> of

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
with that now the straight saber most of

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.350 
with that now the straight saber most of
it's<00:05:20.100> pretty<00:05:20.220> much<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.670> same<00:05:20.700> except<00:05:21.120> for<00:05:21.150> its

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
it's pretty much the same except for its

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.170 
it's pretty much the same except for its
scale<00:05:21.660> other<00:05:22.260> than<00:05:22.410> that<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.950> handle<00:05:23.730> bar

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
scale other than that the handle bar

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.880 
scale other than that the handle bar
design<00:05:24.630> over<00:05:24.960> here<00:05:25.200> was<00:05:25.380> changing<00:05:25.770> to<00:05:25.860> a

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
design over here was changing to a

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.890 
design over here was changing to a
really<00:05:26.250> simple<00:05:26.520> grey<00:05:26.760> stripe<00:05:27.180> it<00:05:27.360> lost<00:05:27.570> if<00:05:27.750> you

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
really simple grey stripe it lost if you

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.890 
really simple grey stripe it lost if you
can<00:05:28.140> like<00:05:28.320> same<00:05:28.830> goes<00:05:29.010> for<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.340> edge<00:05:29.460> you<00:05:29.610> know

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
can like same goes for the edge you know

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.900 
can like same goes for the edge you know
you<00:05:30.229> can<00:05:30.380> still<00:05:30.620> raise<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:31.100> mower<00:05:31.310> this<00:05:31.610> mark

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
you can still raise the mower this mark

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.280 
you can still raise the mower this mark
I<00:05:32.120> learned<00:05:32.330> that<00:05:32.509> is<00:05:32.600> pretty<00:05:32.780> much<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:33.110> same

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
I learned that is pretty much the same

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.770 
I learned that is pretty much the same
even<00:05:33.710> also<00:05:33.830> leftward<00:05:34.400> go<00:05:34.699> on<00:05:34.940> now<00:05:35.570> though

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
even also leftward go on now though

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.270 
even also leftward go on now though
funny<00:05:36.320> thing<00:05:36.500> is<00:05:36.590> that<00:05:36.650> we<00:05:36.860> actually<00:05:36.949> got<00:05:37.250> a

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
funny thing is that we actually got a

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.010 
funny thing is that we actually got a
bigger<00:05:37.910> size<00:05:38.150> for<00:05:38.330> this<00:05:38.389> but<00:05:38.570> it<00:05:38.630> was<00:05:38.720> a<00:05:38.780> rubber

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
bigger size for this but it was a rubber

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.050 
bigger size for this but it was a rubber
version<00:05:39.470> so<00:05:39.800> you<00:05:39.860> can't<00:05:40.160> really<00:05:40.310> combine<00:05:40.910> it

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
version so you can't really combine it

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.610 
version so you can't really combine it
with<00:05:41.090> any<00:05:41.270> of<00:05:41.360> these<00:05:41.479> weapons<00:05:41.690> at<00:05:41.960> all<00:05:42.080> for<00:05:42.530> the

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
with any of these weapons at all for the

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.980 
with any of these weapons at all for the
table<00:05:42.800> can<00:05:43.100> we<00:05:43.550> actually<00:05:43.759> lighten<00:05:44.419> the<00:05:44.780> blue

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
table can we actually lighten the blue

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.550 
table can we actually lighten the blue
color<00:05:45.229> on<00:05:45.380> here<00:05:45.590> we<00:05:46.220> actually<00:05:46.400> took<00:05:46.880> the<00:05:47.560> the

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
color on here we actually took the the

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.070 
color on here we actually took the the
the<00:05:49.340> names<00:05:49.580> over<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:50.060> stickers<00:05:50.419> in<00:05:50.630> his<00:05:50.870> left

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
the names over the stickers in his left

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.020 
the names over the stickers in his left
from<00:05:51.320> there<00:05:51.500> we<00:05:51.949> added<00:05:52.220> a<00:05:52.280> black<00:05:52.520> pen<00:05:52.850> over

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
from there we added a black pen over

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.550 
from there we added a black pen over
here<00:05:53.180> so<00:05:53.300> we<00:05:53.389> lost<00:05:53.570> the<00:05:53.660> decals<00:05:54.050> around<00:05:54.350> here

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
here so we lost the decals around here

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.370 
here so we lost the decals around here
and<00:05:54.740> also<00:05:55.280> of<00:05:55.370> course<00:05:55.430> the<00:05:55.940> switch<00:05:56.810> on<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.110> on

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
and also of course the switch on the on

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.620 
and also of course the switch on the on
the<00:05:57.680> on<00:05:57.949> the<00:05:58.039> back<00:05:58.220> it<00:05:58.490> was<00:05:58.669> under<00:05:59.270> locking

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.000 
wouldn't say is the best weapon weapon
out<00:06:49.790> there<00:06:49.820> but<00:06:50.420> it<00:06:50.870> does<00:06:51.050> have<00:06:51.260> its<00:06:51.290> faults

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
out there but it does have its faults

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.460 
out there but it does have its faults
and<00:06:52.190> so<00:06:52.880> many<00:06:53.120> problems<00:06:53.630> because<00:06:53.960> they<00:06:54.110> go<00:06:54.290> on

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
and so many problems because they go on

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.130 
and so many problems because they go on
to<00:06:54.620> life<00:06:54.800> needs<00:06:55.310> to<00:06:55.460> use<00:06:55.760> the<00:06:55.940> engine<00:06:56.330> souls<00:06:56.660> to

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140 
to life needs to use the engine souls to

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.420 
to life needs to use the engine souls to
refer<00:06:57.500> all<00:06:57.620> the<00:06:57.740> sound<00:06:58.010> effects<00:06:58.310> and

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
refer all the sound effects and

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.740 
refer all the sound effects and
basically<00:06:58.820> these<00:06:59.030> are<00:06:59.090> just<00:06:59.360> a<00:06:59.450> hunk<00:06:59.630> of

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750 
basically these are just a hunk of

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.390 
basically these are just a hunk of
plastic<00:06:59.870> that<00:07:00.350> don't<00:07:00.560> actually<00:07:00.710> do<00:07:01.100> it<00:07:01.250> and

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 
plastic that don't actually do it and

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.650 
plastic that don't actually do it and
most<00:07:01.520> people<00:07:01.850> don't<00:07:01.940> in<00:07:02.060> a<00:07:02.090> days<00:07:02.270> they<00:07:02.540> would

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:02.660 
most people don't in a days they would

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.030 
most people don't in a days they would
just<00:07:02.780> took<00:07:02.990> the<00:07:03.110> engine<00:07:03.290> Souls<00:07:03.620> out<00:07:03.770> and<00:07:03.920> just

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.040 
just took the engine Souls out and just

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.550 
just took the engine Souls out and just
so<00:07:04.250> the<00:07:04.430> toy<00:07:04.670> separately<00:07:05.480> which<00:07:05.930> is<00:07:06.110> of<00:07:06.320> course

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
so the toy separately which is of course

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.560 
so the toy separately which is of course
a<00:07:06.740> really<00:07:06.950> bad<00:07:07.100> thing<00:07:07.280> because<00:07:07.610> even<00:07:07.850> though

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.570 
a really bad thing because even though

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.150 
a really bad thing because even though
you<00:07:08.630> can<00:07:08.930> have<00:07:08.960> the<00:07:09.290> toy<00:07:09.500> loan<00:07:09.830> it's<00:07:10.010> those

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.110 
shoots and it still shoots the zip
