00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello as you can easily see 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.190
 I made my hair for us 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.899
 all with this particle here 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.460
 that is totally content at the moment 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.620
 youtube everybody has that already in somehow 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.269
 shown a video and I have with it 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.410
 lured my hair today too 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.240
 and I'll tell you something like that 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.770
 works and what I think about it 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.539
 the device is a substitute for 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.090
 a curling iron so this head here 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.130
 turn the strand itself and then 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.930
 it is driven to entice you have 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.910
 So do not do anything yourself 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.470
 except the stare come here to come 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.750
 set the temperatures I have it 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.940
 here at the lowest level on the 1 and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.649
 here you can do it once yes how 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.079
 you want to have the curls you want 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.180
 Right kringel löckchen have angels 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.739
 little bell or her so big waves me 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.300
 had set today for ten seconds 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.489
 one would also have stänkern to 8 seconds 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.829
 while it has become slightly bigger waves 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.899
 or for twelve seconds then heat up 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.550
 it will be even stronger blade 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.379
 become kringel löckchen 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.210
 and yes I have the golden middle today 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.160
 voted and you would still have 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.539
 can vary then I get started 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520
 Of course, first spray mine 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.140
 hair with heat protection is very important 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.640
 me that and then I'll take one 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.350
 strand that may not be thicker than 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.560
 three centimeters the more that can 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.909
 Device does not grasp then it would be like this 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.590
 give warning signal and then it will too 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.150
 Stop the rhino turn what 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.400
 The important thing in the device is how to be 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.590
 so this big head is here 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.659
 must always point down and to 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.939
 head down so what would be harder to 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.280
 example so he head up here 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.549
 and then he would be the strand of hair yes 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.170
 turn it all wrong and then you would 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.060
 that's a bit of a snag in it 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.650
 or would speedman and there you have the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.820
 pull out hair strands again so there 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.049
 you have to be a bit careful but me 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.490
 think with a bit of exercise then know 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.470
 you know how to do that you know that 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.150
 yes also from reading or at some point 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.799
 curling iron there you have it too 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
 sometime the turn out so you have to 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.399
 really only the hair strand 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.110
 hold out then fold up and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.180
 then it automatically rotates the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.500
 hair strand then begins to this 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.060
 Customers to count here 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.320
 So, if you have ten, you have set 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.180
 then he will 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.430
 beep four times and then one 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.409
 give a final beep then you can 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.479
 open the device and the hair strands 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.920
 let go which is also very good that 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.079
 this does not always get into one 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.610
 Direction twirls but probably yes 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.890
 alternately always in the other direction 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.390
 so the curls after that just like that 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.250
 nice of course fall that looks 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.020
 not quite contrived if now 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.850
 all in one 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.200
 It would not be that good 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.300
 is on the device is definitely the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.350
 So that's not without me 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.210
 definitely not all 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.220
 to do my hair with just one hand 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.720
 but I have to go with his hand 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.760
 to take help but that is yes 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.530
 then not so bad then that 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.970
 second thing not so great about that 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.460
 device is definitely the price so 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.770
 he is quite heavy but me 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.330
 have to say i looked at it now 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.660
 google higher at various online 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.000
 shops 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.560
 The price fluctuates but like me 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.090
 think quite strong so there must be so 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.860
 In any case, look where it is on 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.050
 Cheapest is I will definitely 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.940
 Link a few shops below and then 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.350
 you have to compare yourself and 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.100
 precisely because the award I want to 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.570
 say every case 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.830
 It is not really worth it for 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.710
 someone who maybe only three 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.480
 times a year makes the hair with it but 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.120
 someone's example every week 120 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.860
 the hair would like to lure the will 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.020
 be very happy with that because I think so 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.730
 it really makes you curious so you 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.350
 really look very professional 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.650
 I would do that with myself now 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.690
 curling iron I do not believe so 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.150
 get equally evenly are yes 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.410
 really all really lure 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.720
 it is not even now 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.500
 which is more cooled and the other 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.600
 not so hard 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.040
 and yes that just creates the device 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.780
 was important for me as well 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.400
 it takes a long time with it 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.170
 this device here to attract the lure 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.630
 so it is not quite time and 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.650
 elaborate but also if I am 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.510
 The hair now with a curling iron 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.850
 or to lure with a flat iron 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.860
 It would not do much either 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.959
 take less time 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.959
 that's why i prefer to take part and that 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.580
 if I want to lure me with it 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.360
 the just look like from here 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.740
 So I see the result 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.120
 really great, I can handle it otherwise 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.980
 a leaf so with a curling iron 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.959
 not that way I am 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.640
 interesting is this particle 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.360
 this is where you can get that device 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.820
 clean up 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.410
 you can just wash it out and if 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.570
 Of course, the device has cooled off 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.250
 is detached plug then you can 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.080
 poke here in this drum here 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.860
 and then turn and then it gets sour 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.380
 So from whole right as in this 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.239
 highest protection spray or residue 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.700
 what was in the hair just so you're tilting 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.530
 The laid clean so that's it 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.970
 me like you what you think about it 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.650
 So, whether you find that interesting now 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.390
 it also oil mainz now the first video 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.340
 were seen by this device or 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.710
 if you are already quite a temple of 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.389
 this 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.830
 and then of course I have you 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.400
 We liked the video 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.400
 next time again
