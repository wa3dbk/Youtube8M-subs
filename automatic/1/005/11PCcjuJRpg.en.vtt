am so so so happy because Sigma brushes

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.750

are<00:01:03.420> very<00:01:03.809> very<00:01:04.049> very<00:01:04.199> expensive<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:05.460> from<00:01:05.640> my

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
are very very very expensive but from my

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.880 
are very very very expensive but from my
understanding<00:01:05.790> these<00:01:06.570> are<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> exact<00:01:07.350> dupes

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
understanding these are the exact dupes

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.080 
understanding these are the exact dupes
and<00:01:08.780> all<00:01:09.780> Sigma<00:01:10.320> does<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.920> by<00:01:11.580> these<00:01:11.640> brushes

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and all Sigma does is by these brushes

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.330 
and all Sigma does is by these brushes
from<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:12.570> overseas<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.470> put<00:01:13.710> their<00:01:13.860> name<00:01:14.070> on

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.050 
from like overseas and put their name on
it<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.119> was<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.890> excited<00:01:17.280> when<00:01:18.030> I
