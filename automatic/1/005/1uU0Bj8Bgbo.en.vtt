 the weapon I was talking about it will be a 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.660
 bp manowar but we have a small nuance 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.910

 I was going to break the perch 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.250

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.619
 Well, how to say this is still quite good 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.899
 luck was past release well not bad 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.450
 principle fell out therefore the bomb there is not 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.090

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.229

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.320

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.870
 the motive he was beautiful was really very 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.880
 beautiful look well i can say that 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.160
 that I am pleased with today's craft 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.980
 here I was actually waiting for his pawn 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.020
 see in inventory today but still 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.540
 yet it is not bad galil 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.310
 well worn yes here again here again 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.560
 the same garbage is actually what he 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.330
 shabby that's why didn't know before gayb 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.820
 why don't you question me 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.110
 you are huge on what can we be 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.240
 we can now see how much this 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.980
 the thing is worth it if I can't 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.560
 do something i just you on 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.720
 the screen will place the price of this whole thing but 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.120
 I am sure that I did not pay much 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.810
 today's contracts but still it is not 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.510
 ay 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.730
 and in principle I was lucky of course 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.380
 could fall out and in p azims I will try again 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.510
 time friends next issue think 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.910
 do the same thing crank exactly 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.330
 That's right, really filled in exactly the same 5 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.010
 new antiques and 5 strictly speaking 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.660
 10 atm and arthas if something falls out 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.850
 cool but i hope that meeting the release 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.650
 all the same, something will fly well let's 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.480
 let's see if we can still do something 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.820
 to craft with you today because u 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.360
 I have a gun still have no 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.730
 but in principle there is so we have dollars brs 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.230
 which we basically can but i think that 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.710
 in principle, if we do something now 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.660
 so here craft and not planned 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.120
 then we will go to minus I think so 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.130
 let 's still pulse and lay 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.550

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.120

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.650
