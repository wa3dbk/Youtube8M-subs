00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
isn't that galvanized and that nightmare

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.620 
isn't that galvanized and that nightmare
journey<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:34.220> France<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.730> the<00:04:34.970> two-day<00:04:35.300> pony

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
journey to France that the two-day pony

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.480 
journey to France that the two-day pony
ride<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:36.200> they<00:04:36.320> arrived<00:04:37.070> in<00:04:37.190> an<00:04:37.310> absolute

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
ride and they arrived in an absolute

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.830 
ride and they arrived in an absolute
heap<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:37.940> they<00:04:38.030> were<00:04:38.090> expected<00:04:38.510> about<00:04:38.690> and

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
heap and they were expected about and

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.650 
heap and they were expected about and
play<00:04:38.990> I<00:04:39.200> think<00:04:39.770> that<00:04:39.890> woke<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.490> IRFU<00:04:40.970> up<00:04:41.180> to

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
play I think that woke the IRFU up to

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.850 
play I think that woke the IRFU up to
the<00:04:41.780> fact<00:04:41.930> that<00:04:42.020> they<00:04:42.170> really<00:04:42.410> need<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.680> get

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
the fact that they really need to get

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.060 
the fact that they really need to get
behind<00:04:43.160> them<00:04:43.340> understand<00:04:43.880> properly<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:45.410> i

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
behind them understand properly and i

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.260 
behind them understand properly and i
