I<00:01:31.430> think<00:01:32.430> children<00:01:32.700> are<00:01:33.090> younger<00:01:33.540> here<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
I think children are younger here the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.350 
I think children are younger here the
longer<00:01:34.979> they<00:01:35.130> don't<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.670> grow<00:01:35.850> up<00:01:35.909> so

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
longer they don't have to grow up so

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.920 
longer they don't have to grow up so
quickly<00:01:36.799> it<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:38.219> feels<00:01:38.460> safer<00:01:39.180> when<00:01:39.780> you're

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
quickly it just feels safer when you're

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.090 
quickly it just feels safer when you're
out<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.350> about<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.890> children

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
out and about with the children

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.130 
out and about with the children
you<00:01:42.700> could<00:01:42.880> let<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.150> children<00:01:43.600> walk<00:01:43.780> down<00:01:43.990> to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
you could let the children walk down to

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.660 
you could let the children walk down to
the<00:01:44.170> park<00:01:44.470> on<00:01:44.710> their<00:01:44.860> own<00:01:45.009> own<00:01:45.250> when<00:01:45.520> they're<00:01:45.640> a

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
the park on their own own when they're a

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.700 
the park on their own own when they're a
little<00:01:45.820> bit<00:01:46.000> older<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:47.020> whereas<00:01:47.590> you

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
little bit older and whereas you
