overgrown even coming out the top of the
water<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:20.600> some<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.750> leaves<00:00:21.960> looking<00:00:22.350> a

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
water and some of the leaves looking a

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.609 
water and some of the leaves looking a
bit<00:00:22.560> frayed<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> bit<00:00:23.609> rubbish<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.439> just

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
want to show you what I do when I cut my

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.779 
want to show you what I do when I cut my
plants<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.840> tend<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.500> do<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.769> every<00:00:29.070> two

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
plants I tend to have to do it every two

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.659 
plants I tend to have to do it every two
to<00:00:29.939> three<00:00:30.000> months<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.630> plant<00:00:30.900> here<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.669> grows

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
to three months this plant here in grows

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.639 
to three months this plant here in grows
quite<00:00:32.969> quickly<00:00:33.000> yes<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.899> think<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.320> keynote

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
quite quickly yes I think it's a keynote

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
doris as a lot so it's a sword plant

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.420 
doris as a lot so it's a sword plant
it's<00:00:37.500> quite<00:00:37.680> nice<00:00:37.890> when<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.190> got<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> lovely

it's quite nice when it's got a lovely
color<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.850> its<00:00:38.969> leaves<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.649> this<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:40.890> grows

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
color on its leaves and this one grows

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.180 
color on its leaves and this one grows
really<00:00:41.610> quickly<00:00:41.910> from<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> center<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.190> ends

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
really quickly from the center and ends

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.229 
really quickly from the center and ends
up<00:00:44.280> being<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.850> huge<00:00:45.860> monstrosity<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.430> nice

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
up being a huge monstrosity a nice

up being a huge monstrosity a nice
looking<00:00:48.539> monstrosity<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.289> my<00:00:49.770> tank<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.370> then

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
looking monstrosity in my tank and then

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.270 
looking monstrosity in my tank and then
over<00:00:51.360> here<00:00:51.539> got<00:00:51.660> some<00:00:51.719> more<00:00:51.899> swords<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.649> some

cryptic<00:00:53.579> Orion<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.879> mean<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.059> Crypt<00:00:54.270> quarry<00:00:54.539> is

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
cryptic Orion I mean the Crypt quarry is

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.340 
cryptic Orion I mean the Crypt quarry is
actually<00:00:54.960> doing<00:00:55.110> very<00:00:55.170> well<00:00:55.340> some<00:00:56.340> reason<00:00:57.350> it

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
actually doing very well some reason it

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.540 
actually doing very well some reason it
might<00:00:58.469> need<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.680> put<00:00:58.829> some<00:00:58.949> root<00:00:59.129> tabs<00:00:59.370> in

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
might need to put some root tabs in

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.670 
might need to put some root tabs in
there<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.480> know<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.840> central<00:01:01.500> leaves

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
there but you know the central leaves

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.410 
there but you know the central leaves
look<00:01:01.890> fine<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.579> outside<00:01:03.000> leaves<00:01:03.210> like

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
look fine just the outside leaves like

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.200 
look fine just the outside leaves like
this<00:01:03.570> one<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.860> plant<00:01:05.129> grows<00:01:05.519> it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
this one here as the plant grows it

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.260 
this one here as the plant grows it
tends<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:06.890> die<00:01:07.890> off<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.909> outside

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
tends to then die off on the outside

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.030 
tends to then die off on the outside
leaves<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.689> grow<00:01:09.930> from<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> centre<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.860> new

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
leaves and grow from the centre with new

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.700 
leaves and grow from the centre with new
new<00:01:11.610> little<00:01:11.850> leaves<00:01:12.060> coming<00:01:12.360> through<00:01:12.650> some<00:01:13.650> of

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
new little leaves coming through some of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.080 
new little leaves coming through some of
the<00:01:13.799> older<00:01:14.159> leaves<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.520> well<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.850> start

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the older leaves as well you start

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.660 
the older leaves as well you start
getting<00:01:15.299> algae<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.810> there<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:17.549> always

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
getting algae on there so it's always

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.480 
getting algae on there so it's always
good<00:01:18.000> thing<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.600> actually<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:19.950> plants

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
good thing to actually do your plants

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.490 
good thing to actually do your plants
and<00:01:20.640> cut<00:01:20.790> they're<00:01:21.000> outside<00:01:21.570> dying<00:01:21.990> off<00:01:22.200> leaves

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and cut they're outside dying off leaves

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.640 
and cut they're outside dying off leaves
cuz<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:24.119> will<00:01:24.270> promote<00:01:24.479> growth<00:01:24.930> actually<00:01:25.439> from

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
cuz it will promote growth actually from

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.370 
cuz it will promote growth actually from
the<00:01:25.799> center<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.310> pot<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> lot<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.790> plants<00:01:27.150> do

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
the center of the pot a lot of plants do

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.800 
the center of the pot a lot of plants do
tend<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.710> grow<00:01:28.950> from<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> Senate<00:01:29.670> arm<00:01:29.970> starts

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
tend to grow from the Senate arm starts

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.170 
tend to grow from the Senate arm starts
dying<00:01:31.500> off<00:01:31.740> basically<00:01:32.729> when<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.880> starts

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
dying off basically when it starts

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.609 
dying off basically when it starts
killing<00:01:33.360> off<00:01:33.570> its<00:01:33.750> outside<00:01:34.079> leaves<00:01:34.320> what<00:01:34.500> it's

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
killing off its outside leaves what it's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.920 
killing off its outside leaves what it's
doing<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.070> actually<00:01:35.250> sucking<00:01:35.640> back<00:01:35.970> all<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
doing is actually sucking back all of

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.980 
doing is actually sucking back all of
the<00:01:37.409> nutrients<00:01:37.920> from<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.340> leaf<00:01:38.750> back<00:01:39.750> into

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the nutrients from that leaf back into

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.950 
the nutrients from that leaf back into
the<00:01:40.079> plant<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:41.579> tries<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.659> before

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the plant and it tries to do this before

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.830 
the plant and it tries to do this before
it<00:01:43.710> actually<00:01:44.640> then<00:01:44.909> starts<00:01:45.329> growing<00:01:45.540> new

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it actually then starts growing new

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.830 
it actually then starts growing new
leaves<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.520> actually<00:01:47.670> remove<00:01:48.180> those

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
leaves so if you actually remove those

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.460 
leaves so if you actually remove those
dying<00:01:49.200> leaves<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:50.700> will<00:01:50.970> make<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.360> plant<00:01:51.720> stop

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
dying leaves it will make the plant stop

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.789 
dying leaves it will make the plant stop
focusing<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.780> taking<00:01:54.780> those<00:01:55.079> nutrients<00:01:55.619> back

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
focusing on taking those nutrients back

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.060 
focusing on taking those nutrients back
and<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.850> will<00:01:56.969> actually<00:01:57.060> speed<00:01:57.570> up<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and it will actually speed up the the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.830 
and it will actually speed up the the
growth<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.640> plant<00:01:59.880> leaf<00:02:00.090> from<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.479> center

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
growth of the plant leaf from the center

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.980 
growth of the plant leaf from the center
as<00:02:00.960> I've<00:02:01.079> already<00:02:01.200> said<00:02:02.509> you<00:02:03.509> might<00:02:03.659> think

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
as I've already said you might think

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.719 
as I've already said you might think
that's<00:02:04.290> counterproductive<00:02:04.920> because<00:02:05.490> it

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that's counterproductive because it

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.080 
that's counterproductive because it
starves<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> plant<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.979> nutrients<00:02:07.979> but<00:02:08.090> as

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
starves the plant of nutrients but as

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.950 
starves the plant of nutrients but as
long<00:02:09.330> as<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.629> use<00:02:10.410> some<00:02:10.890> kind<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.840> neat

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
long as you use some kind of neat

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.320 
long as you use some kind of neat
shrimp<00:02:13.170> or<00:02:13.910> fertilizers<00:02:14.910> ever<00:02:15.060> been<00:02:15.210> your

tank<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.780> mean<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:15.990> use<00:02:16.290> Excel<00:02:16.980> which<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:17.820> co2

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150

tank I mean I use Excel which is co2
substitute<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.110> also<00:02:19.290> use<00:02:20.390> flourish<00:02:21.390> which<00:02:21.630> is

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780

liquid fertilizer both of those help to

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.780 
liquid fertilizer both of those help to
replace<00:02:28.290> any<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.010> nutrients<00:02:29.640> at<00:02:29.730> the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
plants use up so when I do this I just

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.060

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
need to clean them so when I cut you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.880 
need to clean them so when I cut you
always<00:02:47.070> got<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> cut<00:02:47.520> as<00:02:48.390> far<00:02:48.840> down<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.560> stem<00:02:49.770> as

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
always got a cut as far down the stem as

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.610 
always got a cut as far down the stem as
possible<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.900> make<00:02:51.900> sure<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.260> actually<00:02:52.350> get

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
possible and make sure you actually get

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.900 
possible and make sure you actually get
the<00:02:52.710> right<00:02:52.830> leaf<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.370> want<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.550> cut<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:53.880> I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
the right leaf that you want to cut so I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.600 
the right leaf that you want to cut so I
want<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.090> get<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:54.360> one<00:02:54.600> off<00:02:54.750> here<00:02:55.460> so<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:56.550> go

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
want to get this one off here so you go

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.420 
want to get this one off here so you go
right<00:02:56.880> down<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.390> stem<00:02:57.710> and<00:02:58.710> just<00:02:58.770> trim<00:02:59.310> it

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
right down to the stem and just trim it

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.670 
right down to the stem and just trim it
off<00:02:59.550> there<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.230> I'm<00:03:01.230> actually<00:03:01.350> going<00:03:01.620> to

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
off there and I'm actually going to

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.740 
off there and I'm actually going to
clear<00:03:01.980> all<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.760> ones<00:03:02.940> at<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.180> front<00:03:03.510> there

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
clear all of the ones at the front there

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.650 
clear all of the ones at the front there
I<00:03:03.960> just<00:03:04.500> do<00:03:04.890> not<00:03:04.920> like<00:03:05.070> leaves<00:03:06.060> pushing<00:03:06.570> up

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
I just do not like leaves pushing up

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.200 
I just do not like leaves pushing up
against<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:07.110> front<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.440> glove<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:08.210> I'll

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
against the front of the glove and I'll

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.340 
against the front of the glove and I'll
just<00:03:09.330> keep<00:03:09.480> doing<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:11.690> mean<00:03:12.690> what<00:03:12.960> I<00:03:12.990> tend

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
just keep doing that I mean what I tend

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.080 
just keep doing that I mean what I tend
to<00:03:13.470> aim<00:03:13.680> for<00:03:13.710> anywhere<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.550> I'm<00:03:14.610> doing<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.880> good

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
to aim for anywhere and I'm doing a good

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.060 
to aim for anywhere and I'm doing a good
trim<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:16.080> remove<00:03:16.670> up<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.990> 50%<00:03:18.990> of<00:03:19.560> the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
trim is to remove up to 50% of the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.450 
trim is to remove up to 50% of the
existing<00:03:20.520> leaves<00:03:20.790> now<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.780> might<00:03:21.990> think

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
existing leaves now you might think

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.180 
existing leaves now you might think
that's<00:03:23.460> a<00:03:23.610> bit<00:03:23.760> mad<00:03:23.970> but<00:03:24.650> you'll<00:03:25.650> be<00:03:25.680> surprised

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
that's a bit mad but you'll be surprised

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.450 
that's a bit mad but you'll be surprised
how<00:03:26.340> fast<00:03:26.700> they<00:03:27.030> actually<00:03:27.330> grow<00:03:27.540> back<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.460> I'm

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
how fast they actually grow back so I'm

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.340 
how fast they actually grow back so I'm
going<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.730> carry<00:03:29.910> on<00:03:30.030> doing<00:03:30.210> that<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.690> then

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
going to carry on doing that and then

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.710 
going to carry on doing that and then
show<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.130> reverse<00:03:32.390> now<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.510> might<00:03:33.660> not

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
show you the reverse now it might not

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.360 
show you the reverse now it might not
look<00:03:34.080> like<00:03:34.140> much<00:03:34.380> but<00:03:34.650> that's<00:03:35.010> like<00:03:35.130> shaping

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
look like much but that's like shaping

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.570 
look like much but that's like shaping
up<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.820> lot<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.180> space<00:03:36.620> we<00:03:37.620> mas<00:03:37.890> can<00:03:38.250> get<00:03:38.400> some

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
up a lot of space we mas can get some

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.810 
up a lot of space we mas can get some
light<00:03:38.790> now<00:03:39.350> this<00:03:40.350> whole<00:03:40.560> area<00:03:41.100> is<00:03:41.130> getting

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
light now this whole area is getting

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.490 
light now this whole area is getting
access<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.210> the<00:03:42.420> lights<00:03:42.600> it<00:03:42.840> was<00:03:43.050> a<00:03:43.080> good<00:03:43.260> thing

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
access to the lights it was a good thing

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.520 
access to the lights it was a good thing
to<00:03:44.250> try<00:03:44.460> and<00:03:44.510> trim<00:03:45.510> your<00:03:45.690> plants<00:03:46.080> a<00:03:46.200> little<00:03:46.380> bit

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
to try and trim your plants a little bit

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.070 
to try and trim your plants a little bit
because<00:03:46.800> it<00:03:46.980> lets<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.430> air<00:03:47.870> that's<00:03:48.870> the

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
because it lets the air that's the

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.530 
because it lets the air that's the
lights<00:03:49.290> re<00:03:49.710> get<00:03:50.190> through<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:51.330> you<00:03:51.420> other

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
lights re get through to you other

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.660 
lights re get through to you other
plants<00:03:51.930> also<00:03:52.350> it<00:03:52.620> gives<00:03:52.770> us<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.220> fish<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.430> bit

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
plants also it gives us the fish a bit

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.760 
plants also it gives us the fish a bit
more<00:03:53.820> space<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.450> swim<00:03:54.900> around<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.470> know<00:03:55.560> not

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
more space to swim around you know not

more space to swim around you know not
bump<00:03:55.980> into<00:03:56.250> leaves<00:03:56.430> everywhere<00:03:56.760> even<00:03:57.690> this

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
bump into leaves everywhere even this

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.780 
bump into leaves everywhere even this
side<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.410> think<00:03:58.530> looks<00:03:58.800> better<00:03:59.010> with<00:03:59.460> the<00:03:59.610> bad

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
side I think looks better with the bad

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.430 
side I think looks better with the bad
leaves<00:04:00.060> gone<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.540> cryptic<00:04:00.870> coral<00:04:01.110> looks<00:04:01.350> a

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
leaves gone the cryptic coral looks a

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.080 
leaves gone the cryptic coral looks a
lot<00:04:01.590> more<00:04:01.710> healthy<00:04:02.130> than<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.790> thought<00:04:02.970> it

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
lot more healthy than I and I thought it

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.060 
lot more healthy than I and I thought it
was<00:04:03.210> I<00:04:04.020> found<00:04:04.710> there's<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.130> little<00:04:06.740> shoot<00:04:07.740> there

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
was I found there's a little shoot there

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.520 
was I found there's a little shoot there
of<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.580> noose<00:04:09.090> or<00:04:09.360> plant<00:04:09.690> that's<00:04:09.960> come<00:04:10.200> off<00:04:10.320> the

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
of a noose or plant that's come off the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.500 
of a noose or plant that's come off the
main<00:04:10.710> one<00:04:10.920> at<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.070> back<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.790> now<00:04:12.030> can<00:04:12.330> get

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
main one at the back so that now can get

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.110 
main one at the back so that now can get
some<00:04:13.020> light<00:04:13.230> that<00:04:13.440> in<00:04:13.560> gloves<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:15.000> yeah

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120

some light that in gloves so yeah
overall<00:04:15.600> I<00:04:15.870> think<00:04:16.140> it's<00:04:16.320> been<00:04:16.560> a<00:04:16.590> bit<00:04:16.770> better<00:04:16.980> I

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
overall I think it's been a bit better I

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.250 
overall I think it's been a bit better I
mean<00:04:17.370> hope<00:04:17.670> that<00:04:18.000> is<00:04:18.239> helpful<00:04:18.330> for<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:19.080> if

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.560 
mean hope that is helpful for you if
you've<00:04:19.410> got<00:04:19.560> an<00:04:19.650> overgrown<00:04:20.130> tank<00:04:20.489> don't<00:04:21.270> be

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
you've got an overgrown tank don't be

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.560 
you've got an overgrown tank don't be
afraid<00:04:21.960> to<00:04:22.169> actually<00:04:22.470> give<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.770> trim<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.570> I

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
afraid to actually give it a trim and I

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.750 
afraid to actually give it a trim and I
mean<00:04:24.900> I<00:04:24.990> could<00:04:25.380> have<00:04:25.500> even<00:04:25.590> taken<00:04:25.860> more

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
mean I could have even taken more

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.670 
mean I could have even taken more
but<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.420> think<00:04:27.750> I<00:04:27.960> didn't<00:04:28.230> want<00:04:28.350> to<00:04:28.410> over

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
but I think I didn't want to over

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.490 
but I think I didn't want to over
overkill<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.780> mean<00:04:30.780> that's<00:04:30.990> what's<00:04:31.200> come<00:04:31.380> off

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
overkill it mean that's what's come off

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.660 
overkill it mean that's what's come off
it<00:04:31.910> so<00:04:32.910> May<00:04:33.570> leaves<00:04:33.900> it's<00:04:34.680> almost<00:04:35.040> another

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
it so May leaves it's almost another

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.800 
it so May leaves it's almost another
tanks<00:04:36.090> worth<00:04:36.320> of<00:04:37.320> plant<00:04:37.710> right<00:04:37.950> there

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810
