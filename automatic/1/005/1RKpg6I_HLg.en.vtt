00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
of times in this game so yeah definitely

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.839 
of times in this game so yeah definitely
try<00:02:35.120> him<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:36.170> team<00:02:36.409> just<00:02:36.680> floats<00:02:37.010> so<00:02:37.280> well<00:02:37.519> not

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
try him the team just floats so well not

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.640 
try him the team just floats so well not
too<00:02:38.150> sure<00:02:38.360> if<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.599> was<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.840> formation<00:02:39.379> or<00:02:39.530> it

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
too sure if it was the formation or it

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.110 
too sure if it was the formation or it
was<00:02:39.769> just<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:40.040> players<00:02:40.280> themselves<00:02:40.549> like

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
was just the players themselves like

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.759 
was just the players themselves like
this<00:02:41.450> for<00:02:41.599> example<00:02:41.690> khedira<00:02:42.349> didn't<00:02:42.620> even

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
this for example khedira didn't even

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.199 
this for example khedira didn't even
lock<00:02:42.890> onto<00:02:43.099> his<00:02:43.310> play<00:02:43.489> that's<00:02:43.730> how<00:02:43.849> good<00:02:44.060> he<00:02:44.180> is

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
lock onto his play that's how good he is

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.569 
lock onto his play that's how good he is
and<00:02:44.540> then<00:02:44.599> we<00:02:45.170> are<00:02:45.260> through<00:02:45.470> here<00:02:45.680> with<00:02:45.859> Serbia
