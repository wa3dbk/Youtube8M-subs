00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
we're going to make a bird base let's

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.779 
we're going to make a bird base let's
start<00:00:21.720> by<00:00:21.930> making<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.410> triangle<00:00:22.789> both

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
start by making a triangle both

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.410

directions and a rectangle in both

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:43.610 
directions and a rectangle in both
directions<00:00:41.660> then<00:00:42.660> we're<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.050> fold<00:00:43.350> one

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
directions then we're going to fold one

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.010

corner down on one side and you have the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.470 
corner down on one side and you have the
corner<00:00:52.440> down<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:54.750> other<00:00:54.899> side<00:00:59.000> then<00:01:00.000> open<00:01:00.390> up

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
corner down the other side then open up

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.580 
corner down the other side then open up
this<00:01:00.690> part<00:01:01.250> flatten<00:01:02.250> down<00:01:05.750> just<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:06.930> this

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.070

take the one flap bring it over to the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:22.910 
take the one flap bring it over to the
middle<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.700> kite<00:01:18.119> shape

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.800 

flip<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:24.070> over<00:01:24.130> do<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.700> same<00:01:24.909> thing<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.689> other

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
flip it over do the same thing the other

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:36.060 
flip it over do the same thing the other
side<00:01:33.539> and<00:01:34.539> just<00:01:34.840> fold<00:01:35.110> this<00:01:35.229> top<00:01:35.500> part<00:01:35.799> down

side and just fold this top part down

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.660 
side and just fold this top part down
just<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.090> make<00:01:37.119> a<00:01:37.299> crease<00:01:37.689> there<00:01:38.520> that's<00:01:39.520> just

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
just to make a crease there that's just

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.559 
just to make a crease there that's just
so<00:01:39.939> that<00:01:39.970> we<00:01:40.299> know<00:01:41.759> how<00:01:42.759> far<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.119> bring<00:01:43.420> this

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
so that we know how far to bring this

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.990 
so that we know how far to bring this
top<00:01:43.929> sheet<00:01:44.259> up<00:01:44.619> to<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:45.069> line<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.729> make<00:01:48.880> it

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
top sheet up to that line and make it

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.980 
top sheet up to that line and make it
come<00:01:49.179> to<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:49.329> nice<00:01:49.600> point<00:01:50.020> again<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.450> just<00:01:55.599> call
