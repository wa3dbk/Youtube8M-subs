00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
you know obviously they're designed for

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.260 
you know obviously they're designed for
any<00:00:46.020> size<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.879> today<00:00:47.879> we're<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> see

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
any size and today we're going to see

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:57.620 
any size and today we're going to see
other<00:00:48.390> work

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.000 

ah

so<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.270> first<00:01:12.600> thing<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.840> noticed<00:01:13.110> about<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
so the first thing I noticed about the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.749 
so the first thing I noticed about the
MX<00:01:13.920> 32<00:01:14.840> which<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> tire<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.350> rode<00:01:16.619> today<00:01:16.799> I've

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
MX 32 which is a tire I rode today I've

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.600 
MX 32 which is a tire I rode today I've
written<00:01:18.060> with<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.330> 52<00:01:18.810> as<00:01:18.930> well<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> 32

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
written with the 52 as well but the 32

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.730 
written with the 52 as well but the 32
want<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.909> keep<00:01:21.060> coming<00:01:21.299> back<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.690> and<00:01:21.899> like

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
want to keep coming back to you and like

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.710 
want to keep coming back to you and like
they<00:01:23.009> mentioned<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.549> us<00:01:23.580> sort<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.479> their<00:01:24.570> big

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
they mentioned to us sort of their big

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.779 
they mentioned to us sort of their big
push<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.170> tire<00:01:25.440> is<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:26.220> designed<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
push for this tire is it's designed to

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.200 
push for this tire is it's designed to
really<00:01:27.090> cover<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.780> broad<00:01:28.590> range<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.250> terrain

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
really cover a broad range of terrain

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.760 
really cover a broad range of terrain
types<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.780> wasn't<00:01:31.049> designed<00:01:31.289> for<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.560> that's

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
types it wasn't designed for that that's

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.770 
types it wasn't designed for that that's
just<00:01:31.979> how<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.189> ended<00:01:32.399> up<00:01:32.520> working<00:01:32.670> out<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
just how it ended up working out the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.050 
just how it ended up working out the
tire<00:01:33.960> evolved<00:01:34.439> from<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.740> what<00:01:35.130> was<00:01:35.250> called<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.549> 62

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
tire evolved from a what was called a 62

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.980 
tire evolved from a what was called a 62
race<00:01:36.720> tire<00:01:36.960> back<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.439> 09<00:01:38.509> it<00:01:39.509> was<00:01:39.630> very<00:01:39.690> very

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
race tire back in 09 it was very very

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.719 
race tire back in 09 it was very very
hard<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.319> get<00:01:40.440> only<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.830> top<00:01:41.009> 4<00:01:41.250> 50<00:01:41.460> guys<00:01:41.550> were

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
hard to get only the top 4 50 guys were

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.809 
hard to get only the top 4 50 guys were
getting<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.470> but<00:01:43.470> they<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:43.890> liked<00:01:44.190> it<00:01:44.310> had

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
getting it but they really liked it had

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.850 
getting it but they really liked it had
this<00:01:45.000> aggressive<00:01:45.509> lug<00:01:45.720> pattern<00:01:46.110> didn't<00:01:46.799> look

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
this aggressive lug pattern didn't look

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.590 
this aggressive lug pattern didn't look
like<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.100> would<00:01:47.220> work<00:01:47.280> well<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.909> Supercross

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
like it would work well in Supercross

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.630 
like it would work well in Supercross
but<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.929> guys<00:01:49.049> were<00:01:49.229> finding<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.799> had<00:01:50.310> great

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
but the guys were finding it had great

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.550 
but the guys were finding it had great
straight<00:01:51.000> line<00:01:51.209> traction<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.959> really<00:01:52.409> good

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
straight line traction and really good

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.370 
straight line traction and really good
grip<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.920> whoops<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.580> that's<00:01:54.569> that<00:01:55.080> tire

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
grip in the whoops so that's that tire

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.559 
grip in the whoops so that's that tire
developed<00:01:55.890> into<00:01:56.069> this<00:01:56.220> MX<00:01:56.819> 32<00:01:57.209> that<00:01:57.330> we<00:01:57.450> have

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
developed into this MX 32 that we have

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.289 
developed into this MX 32 that we have
today<00:01:57.720> and<00:01:58.640> obviously<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.880> only<00:01:59.970> difference

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
today and obviously the only difference

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.719 
today and obviously the only difference
between<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.049> race<00:02:01.200> tire<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.770> this

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
between this and the race tire is this

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.430 
between this and the race tire is this
is<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.909> less<00:02:03.270> expensive<00:02:03.569> compound<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
is a less expensive compound and the

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.340 
is a less expensive compound and the
carcass<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.459> slightly<00:02:05.670> different<00:02:06.259> just<00:02:07.259> to

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
carcass is slightly different just to

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.990 
carcass is slightly different just to
make<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.619> little<00:02:07.709> more<00:02:07.860> durable<00:02:08.190> for<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
make it a little more durable for the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.460 
make it a little more durable for the
