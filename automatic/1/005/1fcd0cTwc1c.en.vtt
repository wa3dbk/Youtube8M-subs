00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.730
 the Betis bicolor theme indicated 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.729
 it is used by the nascar 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:12.259
 and so we arrive 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.329
 as we said in 1969 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.759
 at the end of the 70s 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.960
 in which an unmanned ship would reach Jupiter 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.359
 to Saturn now not Alberto one already Pluto 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.029
 these are our days 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.050
 and what this program continues is the incredible culmination of an effort 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 at the end of the seventies 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.020
 the space traveler is the product of many efforts of different 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.100
 nationalities 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.410
 Mexico is part of that effort 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.210
 the color stop and control system 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.350
 It is a Mexican invention 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.640
 is an observation tool for the team of scientists that is responsible 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.130
 to put together the puzzle that surrounds the mysteries of Jupiter 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.320
 since Galileo directed the first telescope to Jupiter and its satellite 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.050
 is 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.130
 these casinos not the scientists 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.760
 jupiter I already said 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.960
 is larger than any of the other planets in the solar system 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.660
 Jupiter is almost entirely composed of hydrogen and helium 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.730
 for that satellite is maybe 14 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.130
 four of them are bigger than our moon 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.130
 what's under those orange and white clouds 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.980
 Of course the hand crest more heat than it receives from the sun 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.310
 when this powerful planet was formed 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.280
 that has happened over the course of billions of years since its 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.930
 creation 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.100
 the traveler's scientists one seeks the answer is 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.700
 the traveler one passes closer to Jupiter on the morning of March 5 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.700
 than any other body sent by man 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.010
 This is one of the most important technological advances of the 20th century 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.089
 the system patent 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:15.659
 was granted in Mexico and also in the United States in 1940 to his car 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:20.499
 the engineer guillermo gonzÃ¡lez camarena there were heroes 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.150
