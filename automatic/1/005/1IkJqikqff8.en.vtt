it from our previous videos dispelled so
i<00:01:07.530> could<00:01:07.890> add<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.250> gate<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.939> here<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.780> in

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
i could add the gate one in here one in

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.719 
i could add the gate one in here one in
here<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.460> i<00:01:11.460> could<00:01:11.820> put<00:01:11.939> one<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> middle

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
here and i could put one in the middle

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.940 
here and i could put one in the middle
but<00:01:14.729> that's<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> good<00:01:15.240> thing<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.830> when<00:01:16.830> you

again above it you will have a huge

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.740 
again above it you will have a huge
corner<00:02:34.880> which<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:36.040> shrinks<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.220> size<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:38.720> you

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
corner which is shrinks the size so you

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
with the brick and that would be

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.580 
with the brick and that would be
beautiful<00:04:36.520> to<00:04:36.880> add<00:04:37.000> things<00:04:37.210> exactly<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.230> same
