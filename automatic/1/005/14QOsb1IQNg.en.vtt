more<00:00:42.270> videos<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.980> hopefully<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.520> goes

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670

better<00:00:44.879> now<00:00:45.300> I'm<00:00:45.450> using<00:00:45.600> xsplit<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.350> seems<00:00:46.590> to

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
better now I'm using xsplit it seems to

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.709 
better now I'm using xsplit it seems to
be<00:00:46.829> working<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.250> little<00:00:47.520> bit<00:00:47.640> better<00:00:47.969> doesn't

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
be working a little bit better doesn't

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.270 
be working a little bit better doesn't
seem<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.379> know<00:00:49.410> terribly<00:00:49.950> laggy

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
seem to be like you know terribly laggy

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.430 
seem to be like you know terribly laggy
so<00:00:50.730> that's<00:00:50.910> that's<00:00:51.210> good<00:00:51.449> news<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:52.170> means<00:00:52.350> i

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
so that's that's good news that means i

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.650 
so that's that's good news that means i
can<00:00:52.590> use<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.860> until<00:00:53.039> OBS<00:00:53.489> gets<00:00:53.699> update<00:00:54.000> did

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
can use this until OBS gets update did

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.209 
can use this until OBS gets update did
but<00:00:54.960> hopefully<00:00:55.469> i<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> settings<00:00:56.039> right

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
but hopefully i get the settings right

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.250 
but hopefully i get the settings right
so<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.090> my<00:00:57.149> first<00:00:57.360> time<00:00:57.480> using<00:00:57.660> xsplit<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
so this is my first time using xsplit to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.900 
so this is my first time using xsplit to
record<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.800> two<00:00:59.309> years<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.640> I'm<00:00:59.789> just

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
record in like two years and I'm just

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.250 
record in like two years and I'm just
hoping<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.359> settings<00:01:00.660> go<00:01:00.809> right<00:01:01.050> I

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
hoping that the settings go right I

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.660 
hoping that the settings go right I
think<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.980> grenade<00:01:02.190> might<00:01:02.370> kill<00:01:02.520> him<00:01:02.609> but

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
think that grenade might kill him but

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.189 
think that grenade might kill him but
I'm<00:01:02.789> not<00:01:02.910> sure<00:01:03.090> I'm<00:01:03.449> gonna<00:01:03.600> I'm<00:01:03.960> gonna<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.170> a
