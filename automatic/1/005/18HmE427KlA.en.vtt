00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.200
 thirty four inches 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.859
 This video is for those who are going to enter 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.000
 console to the country and so here it looks 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:26.039
 the game on the tv lamps is pretty 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.910

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.780
 take play seriously say such 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.920
 bowl 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.930
 such TVs inserted very 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.290
 serious audio since the place 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:48.260

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.600
 in general and how it looks but honestly 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.699
 I'll say on a big TV it's 34 inches 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.239
 look pretty pretty pretty 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.879
 not bad if such a TV 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:11.229
 will stand far enough it will 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:18.680
 nice to have to play like this 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:21.759
 that is, that's how it looks in my opinion 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.259
 opinion pretty good 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.590
