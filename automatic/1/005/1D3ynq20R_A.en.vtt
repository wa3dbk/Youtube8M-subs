00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.670
 took 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.350
 we do not want a specific rhythm 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.720
 dictate but you are right in principle 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.640
 in order to get ahead on the main 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.130
 you go out into the world and yours 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.780
 position strengthen for example the 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.010
 to demolish the gates of a fortress 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.690
 if you look at the main story 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.190
 you can concentrate in you 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.720
 the open world to the bare minimum 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.030
 limit to an investment 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.190
 Enough to improve but we 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.270
 hope we can distract you like that 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.160
 that you are in the open world 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.050
 loses and then orphaned longer 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.210
 So there is a certain minimum 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.940
 I have to check off with the 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.650
 story continues and a maximum that 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.440
 i could experience before i do all 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.670
 content of a zone has exhausted and 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.670
 that's a lot 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.190
 so 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.880
 It was our plan from the beginning 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.920
 to make an open world game experience 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.300
 where we narrate and bioware 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.770
 bring in quality 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.450
 skyrim allowed us one 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.950
 How to look at success story 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.380
 role playing a broader market 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.040
 can reach without losing their DNA too 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.170
 change 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.420
 So the tester did not simplify 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.800
 there was no big departure from that 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.800
 what they had always done 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.490
 some knew were sanded and 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.260
 Skyrim was easier to use 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.970
 it was a good example of how that 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.830
 technology to the ambitions of a 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.720
 exclude that was probably a game 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.250
 Turning point that already started with oblivion 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.050
 and then there is not one at the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.680
 simulation of the open world the nail 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.680
 hit on the head 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.880
 so 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.719
 you can see the goal runs if 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.549
 you say a character I want that 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.079
 you moves you then, we show the 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.819
 route will hit 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.889
 if not something like him 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.599
 ice wall in between, there are more 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.489
 information is displayed and you can too 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.239
 to some extent predict what 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.489
 will happen 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.049
 a fundamental change is natural 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.939
 that this view is not just on the 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.950
 pc but synonymous with all consoles 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.810
 versions are the camera is not on 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.340
 It limits a fixed angle 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.409
 behaves similar to a hovering one 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.209
 cursor you can move around 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.459
 zoom in and a really good feeling for 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.560
 the situation gets this 360 degrees 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.180
 about the world and it is somehow 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.349
 cool to stop the game ins 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.540
 fight happening together 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.829
 I just love the explosion of a guy 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.829
 is made of a fire-election 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.310
 all characters have different 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.170
 action strands which you go to 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.060
 the companions are really that 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.410
 heart and soul of the whole game someone did 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.330
 I asked what the most important 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.070
 special feature of dragon age 2 and that 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.020
 the lot is a group of 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.220
 characters that come together and as 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.990
 a team work 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.880
 that's for the story as well 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.590
 crucially for the gameplay the more 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.600
 We are our characters and their roles 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.760
 and conflicts celebrate all the better 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.420
 we succeed in a typical dragon age 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.420
 play 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.440
 a 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.020
 three companions were already known 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.910
 and today we have so lars and iron 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.430
 bowl are revealed after today's stand 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.960
 So it's five characters officially that 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.820
 a special feature of solers is his 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.410
 connection to nothing the game turns 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.910
 it's about him that nothing 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.360
 was taken out of the demons 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.460
 come 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.710
 So he is a very important character 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.960
 he does not have the expertise you maybe 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.360
 would probably expect it 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.860
 dallas hÃ¼ther because an 11 is no he 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.140
 is a learned of some of the goods 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:20.970
 depth of magic has been explored 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:22.530
 Sometimes it seems a bit off the hook 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.910
 lars has not explored areas of 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.710
 the on a broker a little bit 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.360
 disturbing act sometimes he gets a 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.800
 a little crazy over and you are asking yourself 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.450
 what exactly goes on in his head 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.730
 our authors are really good at it 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.240
 It makes it a bit different 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.240
 feels 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.330
 we do not even have it with us 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.890
 started thinking about dlc 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.690
 the entire team is currently involved 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.940
 quite the game we have the time 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.600
 still a tendency to us with dlcs too 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.430
 employ 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.450
 our goal is that people are hundreds 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.130
 of hours with the main game 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.080
 if you like the story 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.070
 the game does not end on you 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.210
 can still continue on 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.160
 Go discoveries and all sorts of things 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.810
 pursue employment in the world 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.970
 There are different systems like that 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.620
 crafts so we expect fuller with 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.600
 that the people also after completion of the 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.200
 Main story adventure in the world experience 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.370
 become 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.020
 we want that in the future, too 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.910
 support but we do not have either 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.980
 decided when the dlc publish 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.970
 become and what kind of dlcs themselves 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.970
 will act at all
