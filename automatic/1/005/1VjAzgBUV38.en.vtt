colony<00:00:10.870> of<00:00:11.080> woolly<00:00:11.530> Apple<00:00:11.950> aphids<00:00:12.400> on<00:00:12.669> one<00:00:12.969> of

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:12.999 
colony of woolly Apple aphids on one of

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.800 
colony of woolly Apple aphids on one of
my<00:00:13.209> apple<00:00:13.570> trees<00:00:13.870> it's<00:00:14.559> a<00:00:14.769> serious<00:00:15.400> pest<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.780> I

fibrous thread-like substance that if

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.960 
fibrous thread-like substance that if
you<00:00:34.180> move<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.600> cotton<00:00:34.989> apart<00:00:35.520> aside<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:36.820> will

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
you move the cotton apart aside you will

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.660 
you move the cotton apart aside you will
see<00:00:37.270> a<00:00:38.490> sea<00:00:39.490> of<00:00:39.520> aphids<00:00:41.340> sucking<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:42.460> life<00:00:42.640> out

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
see a sea of aphids sucking the life out

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.770 
see a sea of aphids sucking the life out
of<00:00:43.060> the<00:00:43.390> apple<00:00:43.690> tree<00:00:44.250> if<00:00:45.250> left<00:00:47.250> unattended

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
of the apple tree if left unattended

this a fit will create several
generation<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.880> course<00:00:55.120> of<00:00:55.270> the<00:00:55.450> summer

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
generation in the course of the summer

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.030 
generation in the course of the summer
ending<00:00:56.860> up<00:00:57.010> with<00:00:57.809> females<00:00:58.809> that<00:00:59.050> are<00:00:59.590> winged

and able to fly to different places and

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:12.300 
and able to fly to different places and
in<00:01:03.550> fact<00:01:03.790> even<00:01:04.409> more<00:01:05.409> trees<00:01:09.299> eventually<00:01:11.310> will

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
in fact even more trees eventually will

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.660 
in fact even more trees eventually will
the<00:01:12.430> apple<00:01:12.700> aphid<00:01:13.090> will<00:01:13.360> migrate<00:01:13.900> down<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.710> the

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
the apple aphid will migrate down to the

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.420 
the apple aphid will migrate down to the
root<00:01:15.880> system<00:01:15.909> of<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:16.570> tree<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.130> gets

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
root system of a tree and when it gets

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.250 
root system of a tree and when it gets
to<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.760> root<00:01:18.909> system<00:01:18.970> then<00:01:19.840> you<00:01:19.990> can't

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
to the root system then you can't

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.670 
to the root system then you can't
eradicate<00:01:20.710> it<00:01:21.280> with<00:01:21.490> anything<00:01:21.760> including

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
eradicate it with anything including

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.270 
eradicate it with anything including
very<00:01:23.680> harsh<00:01:23.979> chemicals<00:01:25.500> if<00:01:26.500> it<00:01:26.680> infects<00:01:27.100> the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
very harsh chemicals if it infects the

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.550 
very harsh chemicals if it infects the
root<00:01:27.430> system<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.299> young<00:01:28.510> tree<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:29.350> will

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
root system of a young tree it will

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.039 
root system of a young tree it will
dwarf<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:30.100> tree<00:01:30.369> and<00:01:30.640> in<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.330> case<00:01:31.510> of<00:01:31.690> older

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
dwarf the tree and in the case of older

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.500 
dwarf the tree and in the case of older
tree<00:01:32.350> it<00:01:33.280> will<00:01:33.930> substantially<00:01:35.189> reduce<00:01:36.189> the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
tree it will substantially reduce the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:46.480 
tree it will substantially reduce the
yield

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.180 

here<00:01:47.299> I'm<00:01:47.479> just<00:01:47.510> disturbing<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:48.409> colony<00:01:48.920> so

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
here I'm just disturbing the colony so

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.940 
here I'm just disturbing the colony so
you<00:01:49.640> can<00:01:49.850> see<00:01:51.340> if<00:01:52.340> it's<00:01:52.790> in<00:01:52.909> different<00:01:53.060> stages

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
you can see if it's in different stages

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.510 
you can see if it's in different stages
there<00:01:54.950> are<00:01:54.979> really<00:01:55.280> young<00:01:55.520> ones<00:01:57.280> larger<00:01:58.280> ones

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
there are really young ones larger ones

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.880 
there are really young ones larger ones
even<00:01:58.760> on<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.509> upper<00:01:59.810> right<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.259> can<00:02:00.290> see<00:02:00.650> one

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
even on the upper right you can see one

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.760 
even on the upper right you can see one
that<00:02:01.640> is<00:02:01.790> just<00:02:02.030> about<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.479> hatch<00:02:04.150> their

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
that is just about to hatch their
