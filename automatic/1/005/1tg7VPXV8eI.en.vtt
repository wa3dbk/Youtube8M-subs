00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
your glass bowl over the top of it

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.410 
your glass bowl over the top of it
because<00:01:19.290> well<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:20.009> know<00:01:20.790> what's<00:01:21.180> going<00:01:21.360> to

because well I know what's going to

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.749 
because well I know what's going to
happen<00:01:22.400> okay<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:24.920> usually<00:01:25.920> cook<00:01:26.100> eggs<00:01:26.340> for<00:01:26.610> two

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
happen okay I usually cook eggs for two

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.460 
happen okay I usually cook eggs for two
minutes<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.299> we'll<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.600> start<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:28.259> and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
minutes so we'll just start that up and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.410 
minutes so we'll just start that up and
go<00:01:30.680> now<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:32.070> editing<00:01:32.549> I'm<00:01:32.759> going<00:01:33.180> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
go now in editing I'm going to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:58.929 
go now in editing I'm going to
accelerate<00:01:34.140> this

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.410 

well<00:01:59.539> that<00:02:00.320> was<00:02:00.619> really<00:02:01.159> impressive<00:02:01.429> it

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
well that was really impressive it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.599 
well that was really impressive it
actually<00:02:03.020> blew<00:02:03.319> the<00:02:03.469> poll<00:02:03.770> up<00:02:04.069> off<00:02:04.340> of<00:02:04.369> the

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
actually blew the poll up off of the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.489 
actually blew the poll up off of the
plate<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.090> that's<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.420> heavy<00:02:05.630> glass<00:02:05.929> bowl<00:02:06.229> I'll

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499 
plate and that's a heavy glass bowl I'll

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:16.660 
plate and that's a heavy glass bowl I'll
tell<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:09.519> now<00:02:10.519> let's<00:02:10.759> open<00:02:10.879> this<00:02:11.150> up<00:02:15.069> and<00:02:16.069> look

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
tell you now let's open this up and look

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.140 
tell you now let's open this up and look
at<00:02:17.090> what's<00:02:17.239> left<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:18.610> it's<00:02:19.610> blowing<00:02:19.970> it

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
at what's left of that it's blowing it

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.509 
at what's left of that it's blowing it
completely<00:02:20.690> apart<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.220> is<00:02:25.370> what

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
completely apart and so this is what

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.020 
completely apart and so this is what
happens<00:02:25.849> when<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.060> put<00:02:26.299> a<00:02:26.560> uncracked<00:02:27.560> egg

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
happens when you put a uncracked egg

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.890 
happens when you put a uncracked egg
into<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.060> microwave<00:02:29.540> oven

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
into a microwave oven

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.030 
into a microwave oven
it<00:02:30.530> really<00:02:30.830> does<00:02:31.099> explode<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:33.140> now<00:02:33.739> that<00:02:33.890> we

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
it really does explode so now that we

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.520 
it really does explode so now that we
know<00:02:34.069> how<00:02:34.519> not<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.269> our<00:02:35.629> boil<00:02:35.930> an<00:02:36.140> egg<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.470> a

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
know how not to our boil an egg in a

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.580 
know how not to our boil an egg in a
microwave<00:02:37.120> let's<00:02:38.120> have<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.299> look<00:02:38.540> at<00:02:38.660> how<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:39.379> do

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
microwave let's have a look at how to do

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:47.170 
microwave let's have a look at how to do
it<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:43.250> key<00:02:43.670> why<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.720> egg<00:02:45.079> exploded<00:02:46.180> is

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
it and the key why the egg exploded is

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.650 
it and the key why the egg exploded is
the<00:02:47.450> shell<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:49.370> shell<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.879> sealed<00:02:50.269> all<00:02:50.569> the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
the shell the shell is sealed all the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.330 
the shell the shell is sealed all the
way<00:02:50.780> around<00:02:51.079> and<00:02:51.349> as<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.590> egg<00:02:51.769> heats<00:02:52.099> up

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
way around and as the egg heats up

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.190 
way around and as the egg heats up
inside<00:02:53.769> we<00:02:54.769> develop<00:02:55.340> some<00:02:55.549> steam<00:02:55.790> pressure

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
inside we develop some steam pressure

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.240 
inside we develop some steam pressure
because<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.440> moisture<00:02:57.620> in<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.129> egg

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
because of the moisture in the egg

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.800 
because of the moisture in the egg
itself<00:02:58.700> and<00:03:00.040> this<00:03:01.040> eventually<00:03:01.790> builds<00:03:02.359> up<00:03:02.510> and

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
itself and this eventually builds up and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.020 
itself and this eventually builds up and
the<00:03:02.989> egg<00:03:03.170> explodes

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
the egg explodes

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.620 
the egg explodes
so<00:03:05.030> what<00:03:05.239> dramatically<00:03:05.840> as<00:03:05.989> you<00:03:06.139> saw<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:08.480> the

microwave egg cooker that looks like it

microwave egg cooker that looks like it
oughta<00:03:33.130> be<00:03:33.220> pretty<00:03:33.580> good<00:03:33.820> I've<00:03:34.510> been<00:03:34.570> using

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
oughta be pretty good I've been using

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.970 
oughta be pretty good I've been using
this<00:03:35.170> one<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:35.730> we'll<00:03:36.730> go<00:03:36.910> with<00:03:37.060> that

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
this one so we'll go with that

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.530 
this one so we'll go with that
so<00:03:38.980> what<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.310> do<00:03:39.459> is<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:39.730> just<00:03:39.760> crack<00:03:40.240> the<00:03:40.420> egg

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
so what you do is you just crack the egg

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.210 
so what you do is you just crack the egg
gently<00:03:40.990> because<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.590> don't<00:03:41.770> want<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.010> break

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
gently because you don't want to break

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:52.800 
gently because you don't want to break
the<00:03:42.370> yolk<00:03:49.470> just<00:03:51.000> put<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.120> in<00:03:52.239> there<00:03:52.420> into<00:03:52.720> the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
the yolk just put it in there into the

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.100 
the yolk just put it in there into the
egg<00:03:52.930> cup<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:57.340> course<00:03:57.610> you<00:03:57.760> can<00:03:57.910> see<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:58.930> has

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
egg cup and of course you can see it has

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.140 
egg cup and of course you can see it has
two<00:03:59.350> spots<00:03:59.680> and<00:03:59.890> you<00:03:59.950> can<00:04:00.340> do<00:04:00.550> two<00:04:00.790> eggs<00:04:00.970> at

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
two spots and you can do two eggs at

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.570 
two spots and you can do two eggs at
once<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:02.410> with<00:04:02.530> this<00:04:02.680> one<00:04:02.860> you<00:04:02.950> just<00:04:02.980> close<00:04:03.430> it

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
once and with this one you just close it

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.870 
once and with this one you just close it
up

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
up

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.680 
up
and<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:05.860> snaps<00:04:06.220> closed<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.880> stay<00:04:07.090> shut<00:04:07.150> and

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
and it snaps closed to stay shut and

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.960 
and it snaps closed to stay shut and
then<00:04:08.650> from<00:04:08.800> there<00:04:09.010> it's<00:04:09.340> ready<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.670> go<00:04:09.730> into

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
then from there it's ready to go into

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.080 
then from there it's ready to go into
the<00:04:10.060> microwave<00:04:14.370> just<00:04:15.370> put<00:04:15.519> this<00:04:15.670> right<00:04:15.880> in

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
the microwave just put this right in

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.159 
the microwave just put this right in
here

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.659 

and<00:04:22.169> it's<00:04:22.710> been<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:22.949> while<00:04:23.159> since<00:04:23.490> I've

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
and it's been a while since I've

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.629 
and it's been a while since I've
actually<00:04:23.699> done<00:04:24.300> this<00:04:24.569> so<00:04:25.470> I'm<00:04:25.889> going<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.370> give

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
actually done this so I'm going to give

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:35.530 
actually done this so I'm going to give
it<00:04:26.729> about<00:04:26.819> a<00:04:27.360> minute<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.409> a<00:04:28.440> half

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.420 

and<00:04:35.810> while<00:04:36.140> that's<00:04:36.320> cooking<00:04:36.620> I'll<00:04:36.980> go<00:04:37.190> ahead

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
and while that's cooking I'll go ahead

00:04:37.430 --> 00:05:04.219 
and while that's cooking I'll go ahead
and<00:04:38.170> speed<00:04:39.170> up<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.530> video

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.640

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:37.820 

and<00:05:26.850> it<00:05:27.210> looks<00:05:27.480> pretty<00:05:27.600> well<00:05:27.960> done

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:47.070 

and<00:05:38.830> it<00:05:38.950> is<00:05:39.160> I<00:05:44.730> just<00:05:45.730> slide<00:05:46.540> that<00:05:46.750> right<00:05:46.810> out

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
and it is I just slide that right out

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:54.120 
and it is I just slide that right out
over<00:05:47.230> the<00:05:47.320> plate<00:05:52.470> doesn't<00:05:53.470> quite<00:05:53.650> look<00:05:53.860> like<00:05:53.920> a

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
over the plate doesn't quite look like a

00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:02.300 
over the plate doesn't quite look like a
normal<00:05:54.760> heart<00:05:54.970> or<00:05:55.210> leg<00:05:55.920> but<00:06:00.690> it'll<00:06:01.690> do<00:06:01.810> the<00:06:01.840> job

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
normal heart or leg but it'll do the job

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.640 
normal heart or leg but it'll do the job
and<00:06:03.750> the<00:06:04.750> fact<00:06:04.990> that<00:06:05.080> it<00:06:05.260> looks<00:06:05.440> a<00:06:05.530> little

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
and the fact that it looks a little

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.540 
and the fact that it looks a little
different<00:06:06.390> if<00:06:07.390> you're<00:06:07.540> giving<00:06:07.840> them<00:06:07.900> to<00:06:08.080> kids

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
different if you're giving them to kids
