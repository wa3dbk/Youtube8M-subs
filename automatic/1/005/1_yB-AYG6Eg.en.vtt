00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.990 

three<00:00:19.080> facts<00:00:19.320> about<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.770> brain<00:00:19.980> fact<00:00:20.670> number

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
three facts about the brain fact number

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.150 
three facts about the brain fact number
one<00:00:21.210> as<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.960> brain<00:00:22.199> changes<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.949> mind

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
one as the brain changes the mind

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.790 
one as the brain changes the mind
changes<00:00:23.550> for<00:00:24.359> better<00:00:24.539> or<00:00:24.750> worse<00:00:24.779> right<00:00:25.350> so

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
changes for better or worse right so

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.670 
changes for better or worse right so
coca-cola<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.910> left<00:00:27.180> side<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.810> an<00:00:28.230> NFL

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
coca-cola on the left side and an NFL

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.529 
coca-cola on the left side and an NFL
player<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.640> moment<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.179> getting<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
player in the moment of getting a

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.510 
player in the moment of getting a
concussion<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> right<00:00:31.439> hand<00:00:31.650> side<00:00:31.859> all

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
concussion on the right hand side all

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.520 
concussion on the right hand side all
right<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.290> better<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:35.130> example<00:00:35.450> more

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
right so in the better for example more

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.350 
right so in the better for example more
activation<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.980> left<00:00:38.250> prefrontal<00:00:38.550> cortex

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
activation in the left prefrontal cortex

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.540 
activation in the left prefrontal cortex
is<00:00:39.629> associated<00:00:40.469> with<00:00:40.500> more<00:00:40.920> positive

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
is associated with more positive

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.270 
is associated with more positive
emotions<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.809> as<00:00:43.110> there<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.559> greater<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
emotions so as there is greater a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.000 
emotions so as there is greater a
symmetry<00:00:45.210> greater<00:00:45.600> relative<00:00:46.050> activation<00:00:46.800> on

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
symmetry greater relative activation on

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.770 
symmetry greater relative activation on
the<00:00:47.100> left<00:00:47.399> front<00:00:47.760> portion<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:48.570> brain

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the left front portion of your brain

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.459 
the left front portion of your brain
there<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.620> also<00:00:50.309> greater<00:00:50.670> well-being

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
there is also greater well-being

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.900 
there is also greater well-being
probably<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.590> large<00:00:52.860> part<00:00:53.190> because<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.579> left

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
probably in large part because the left

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.150 
probably in large part because the left
prefrontal<00:00:54.090> cortex<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.320> major<00:00:55.680> part<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
prefrontal cortex is a major part of the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.520 
prefrontal cortex is a major part of the
brain<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.510> controlling<00:00:57.510> negative<00:00:58.079> emotion

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
brain for controlling negative emotion

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.139 
brain for controlling negative emotion
for<00:00:59.010> putting<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> brakes<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.760> negative

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
for putting the brakes on negative

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.450 
for putting the brakes on negative
effects<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.020> improve<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.530> brakes<00:01:02.219> on

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
effects so if you improve the brakes on

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.219 
effects so if you improve the brakes on
the<00:01:02.879> negative<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.840> more<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
the negative you get more of the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.710 
the negative you get more of the
positive<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.460> other<00:01:05.610> hand<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.180> if<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
positive on the other hand of it if the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.750 
positive on the other hand of it if the
brain<00:01:06.930> changes<00:01:07.439> due<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.710> chronic<00:01:07.890> stress<00:01:08.100> for

of good things today alright so there we

can see that as the brain changes the
mind<00:01:58.409> changes<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.520> takes<00:01:59.759> us<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.210> second

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
fact which really starts getting

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.760 
fact which really starts getting
interesting<00:02:02.700> as<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.689> mind<00:02:04.020> changes<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
interesting as the mind changes the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.950 
interesting as the mind changes the
brain<00:02:05.009> changes<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.969> does<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.329> temporarily

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
brain changes and it does so temporarily

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.770 
brain changes and it does so temporarily

so in a variety of ways for example busy

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.729 
so in a variety of ways for example busy

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
have more traffic also mental activity

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.370 
have more traffic also mental activity
