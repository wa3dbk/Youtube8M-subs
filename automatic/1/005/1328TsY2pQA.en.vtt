00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.819
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:11.010
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:14.370
 581 task kitchen area three times 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.160
 less room area therefore for 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.760
 repairing the kitchen floor took 24 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.900
 linoleum meter less than room 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:31.550
 what is the kitchen area so we have 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.550
 small kitchen and large room 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:41.070
 small kitchen and big room us 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.860
 ask what is the area of ​​the kitchen well 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.629
 let the kitchen area be x if you are x 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.750
 find there and solve the problem 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.670
 most often for x means exactly what 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.829
 need to find in the task what area 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.140
 kitchens ask us we say square 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.840
 Kitchen let it be x kitchen area in three 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.059
 times smaller than the area of ​​the room means 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.560
 room area is three times larger than 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.119
 the kitchen area is therefore 3 x 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.510
 if you plow rooms if kitchen area 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.170
 This x then push room 3 x 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:21.720
 what else do we know what to repair 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:27.110
 the floor of the kitchen took 24 meters 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.110
 linoleum less than for the room 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:36.240
 how to find out how much less look 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.200
 if for repairing the floor of the room 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.110
 it took three X to repair the floor 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.619
 Kitchen need x because there is an area 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.829
 x eat 3x as far as area 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.509
 rooms larger than kitchen area to 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.939
 learn need to subtract from the larger 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.680
 Well , in the same way, if we want to know 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:01.469
 as far as room space 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.969
 less than kitchen area kitchen we have to 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.439
 from the larger area subtract the smaller 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:10.020
 area and what we get we find out what 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:14.060
 it took 24 meters of linoleum 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.060
 less that is 240 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.390
 how did I do it 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:26.260
 it is said that the repair of the kitchen need less 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.720
 linoleum than to repair the room at 24 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.000
 square meter that is exactly on 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.310
 as much as one room more 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.230
 other means need from more room 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.640
 subtract more from the room 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.160
 subtract an area smaller than the room and 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.830
 just 24 meters in the square 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:52.120
 then if we subtract 1 x from the three x's 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:55.030
 then there will be 2 xx what is x can 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.350
 write 1 multiply by x 1 multiply by x 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:04.870
 equals x and here three X 3x minus 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.640
 1 x will be 2x but it's like three bananas minus 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.800
 one ram will be two rams or three 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.930
 apples minus 1 apple will be two apples 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:19.930
 three x minus 1 x will be 2 x 2 x this is 24 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:21.760
 how to find x you need 24 divided by 2 then 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.040
 is if this is a multiplier is a multiplier 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.470
 and this work to find one of 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.730
 multipliers need the product 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.920
 divide by another factor but 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.560
 divide very easily 24 divide by 2 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:41.489
 there will be 12 of which square meters 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.070
 x this is 12 meters gift let's check 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.610
 it turns out that the kitchen is 12 meters 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.790
 square 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:53.230
 then the room is 3 times less than 36 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.690
 square meters if the kitchen is 12 then 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.170
 room turns 36 3 times more 3 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.780
 multiply by 12 will be 36 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.570
 We look if here we have 36 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.200
 and here we have 12 how much however 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:14.110
 I'll start the room more kitchen at 24 just 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:16.810
 because 36 minus 12 this time is 24 so 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.000
 so what do we hope for? 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.169
 you understand the solution write in 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.580
 comments on how much it is to you 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.349
 it turned out clear 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.780
 if you like my videos advise 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:29.979
 their friends classmate acquaintances on 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.979
 that's all for now
