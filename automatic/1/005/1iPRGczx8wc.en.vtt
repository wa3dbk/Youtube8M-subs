and<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.730> think<00:01:02.790> it's<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.240> to<00:01:03.270> work<00:01:03.480> really

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
and I think it's going to work really

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.160 
and I think it's going to work really
well<00:01:04.760> trust<00:01:05.760> me<00:01:05.940> if<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.210> didn't<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.780> would<00:01:07.140> have

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
well trust me if I didn't I would have

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.320 
well trust me if I didn't I would have
said<00:01:07.530> so

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
said so

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.560 
said so
but<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.870> look<00:01:10.050> at<00:01:10.170> our<00:01:10.320> iceberg<00:01:10.920> roses<00:01:11.550> you<00:01:12.420> can

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
but we look at our iceberg roses you can

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.950 
but we look at our iceberg roses you can
see<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.870> one<00:01:13.080> plant<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.620> was<00:01:13.710> suspect<00:01:14.040> where

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
see the one plant that was suspect where

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.420 
see the one plant that was suspect where
when<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:15.990> was<00:01:16.260> digging<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.800> found<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.190> lot<00:01:17.400> of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
when I was digging I found a lot of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.180 
when I was digging I found a lot of
layered<00:01:18.500> dried-up<00:01:19.500> paint<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:21.240> never

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
layered dried-up paint and never

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.490 
layered dried-up paint and never
rebounded<00:01:23.869> it's<00:01:25.850> successfully<00:01:26.850> died<00:01:27.119> off

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
rebounded it's successfully died off

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.930 
rebounded it's successfully died off
this<00:01:28.500> plant<00:01:28.920> will<00:01:29.250> obviously<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.760> to<00:01:29.910> be

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
this plant will obviously have to be

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.150 
this plant will obviously have to be
replaced<00:01:30.420> we'll<00:01:30.720> also<00:01:30.810> wind<00:01:31.260> up<00:01:31.350> removing<00:01:31.800> a

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
replaced we'll also wind up removing a

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.120 
replaced we'll also wind up removing a
great<00:01:32.850> deal<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.300> soil<00:01:33.830> immediately<00:01:34.830> around

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
great deal the soil immediately around

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.790 
great deal the soil immediately around
it<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.360> you're<00:01:36.600> rid<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.930> whatever<00:01:37.110> toxic

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
it so you're rid of whatever toxic

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.690 
it so you're rid of whatever toxic
material<00:01:38.340> went<00:01:38.550> in<00:01:38.729> there<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:43.700> unfortunately

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
material went in there and unfortunately

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.340 
material went in there and unfortunately
the<00:01:44.820> lights<00:01:45.060> coming<00:01:45.600> off<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> little<00:01:45.930> bad<00:01:46.320> that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the lights coming off a little bad that

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.620 
the lights coming off a little bad that
direction<00:01:46.950> looks<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.520> try<00:01:48.300> it<00:01:48.360> from<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
direction looks like try it from a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.170 
direction looks like try it from a
different<00:01:48.840> angle<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:52.560> iceberg<00:01:53.070> roses<00:01:53.640> are

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
different angle the iceberg roses are

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.660 
different angle the iceberg roses are
just<00:01:54.750> breaking<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.530> their<00:01:55.800> new<00:01:56.009> blooms<00:01:58.670> try

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
and get in here with maybe shading it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.770
