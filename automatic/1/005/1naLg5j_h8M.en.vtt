00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.060 
John Cena just because he's facing the
rock<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.360> think<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:47.990> wrong<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.470> do<00:02:48.680> something

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
rock I think it's wrong to do something

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.940 
rock I think it's wrong to do something
like<00:02:49.190> that<00:02:49.459> now<00:02:50.180> as<00:02:50.570> we<00:02:51.200> all<00:02:51.290> know<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.560> y'all

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
new to guys a lot of people it's weird

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.140

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
the other fans are just weird with John

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.910 
the other fans are just weird with John
Cena<00:03:02.510> right<00:03:02.690> now<00:03:02.840> is<00:03:03.020> we<00:03:03.170> all<00:03:03.320> know<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.739> since

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920

the<00:03:04.040> rock<00:03:04.220> came<00:03:04.520> back<00:03:04.760> it's<00:03:05.510> getting<00:03:05.870> half

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
the rock came back it's getting half

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.370 
the rock came back it's getting half
half<00:03:06.860> booze<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.640> him<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.090> have<00:03:08.540> cheers<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.200> him

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
half booze to him and have cheers to him

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.670 
half booze to him and have cheers to him
so<00:03:09.860> John<00:03:10.130> Cena<00:03:10.430> is<00:03:10.489> getting<00:03:10.700> fifty<00:03:11.060> fifty

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
so John Cena is getting fifty fifty

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.630 
so John Cena is getting fifty fifty
fifty<00:03:12.680> percent<00:03:13.070> you<00:03:13.910> know<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:15.190> like<00:03:16.190> I<00:03:16.340> said<00:03:16.400> I

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
fifty percent you know and like I said I

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.820 
fifty percent you know and like I said I
think<00:03:17.300> it's<00:03:17.450> bad<00:03:17.720> that<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:18.170> guys<00:03:18.590> are<00:03:18.800> just

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
think it's bad that you guys are just

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.140 
think it's bad that you guys are just
doing<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.520> John<00:03:19.910> Cena<00:03:20.709> but<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:22.010> can<00:03:22.820> see

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
doing that to John Cena but I can see

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.090 
doing that to John Cena but I can see
that<00:03:23.330> it<00:03:23.510> does<00:03:23.780> not<00:03:23.810> bother<00:03:24.260> him<00:03:25.570> um<00:03:26.769> but<00:03:27.769> the

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
that it does not bother him um but the

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.440 
that it does not bother him um but the
thing<00:03:28.310> is<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:30.410> Rock<00:03:30.620> has<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.670> Reich<00:03:31.880> has<00:03:32.269> not

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
thing is the Rock has the Reich has not

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.810 
thing is the Rock has the Reich has not
been<00:03:32.810> he<00:03:33.200> been<00:03:33.890> in<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.070> dummy<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.430> be<00:03:34.549> for<00:03:34.730> a

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
been he been in the dummy to be for a

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.330 
been he been in the dummy to be for a
long<00:03:35.030> time<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.810> think<00:03:36.620> would<00:03:36.680> be<00:03:36.830> kind<00:03:37.010> of<00:03:37.100> wrong

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
long time I think would be kind of wrong

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.850 
long time I think would be kind of wrong
if<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:38.150> right<00:03:38.330> actually<00:03:38.959> beats<00:03:39.350> John<00:03:39.830> Cena

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
if the right actually beats John Cena

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.070 
if the right actually beats John Cena
which<00:03:40.670> a<00:03:40.820> whole<00:03:41.030> bunch<00:03:41.330> of<00:03:41.450> people<00:03:41.510> will<00:03:41.810> love

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
which a whole bunch of people will love

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.830 
which a whole bunch of people will love
the<00:03:42.500> rock<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.920> beat<00:03:43.100> John<00:03:43.370> Cena<00:03:43.810> because<00:03:44.810> I

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
the rock to beat John Cena because I

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.960

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
John Cena and you know a lot of people

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.789 
John Cena and you know a lot of people
can<00:03:58.519> make<00:03:58.640> a<00:03:58.700> big<00:03:59.030> deal<00:03:59.269> out<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.540> it<00:03:59.690> too<00:03:59.900> but

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
can make a big deal out of it too but

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.050 
can make a big deal out of it too but
you<00:04:00.980> really<00:04:01.130> don't<00:04:01.430> guys<00:04:01.989> so<00:04:02.989> I<00:04:03.910> don't<00:04:04.910> really

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
you really don't guys so I don't really

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.860 
you really don't guys so I don't really
see<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.360> rock<00:04:05.600> going<00:04:05.870> over<00:04:06.200> John<00:04:06.470> Cena<00:04:07.810> but<00:04:08.810> it

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
see the rock going over John Cena but it

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.920 
see the rock going over John Cena but it
would<00:04:09.230> kill<00:04:09.500> Cena's<00:04:09.920> cred<00:04:10.310> as<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:11.060> WDB<00:04:11.600> top

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
would kill Cena's cred as the WDB top

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.910 
would kill Cena's cred as the WDB top
guy<00:04:12.850> so<00:04:13.850> he<00:04:14.120> would<00:04:14.269> have<00:04:14.299> to<00:04:14.720> be<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:14.900> bad<00:04:15.320> guy<00:04:15.680> to

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
guy so he would have to be a bad guy to

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.400 
guy so he would have to be a bad guy to
face<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.489> rock<00:04:16.700> because<00:04:17.570> I<00:04:17.750> really<00:04:18.169> don't

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
face the rock because I really don't

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.990 
face the rock because I really don't
think<00:04:18.500> it<00:04:18.859> would<00:04:19.040> make<00:04:19.250> sense<00:04:19.280> if<00:04:19.700> he<00:04:19.850> was<00:04:19.970> a

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
think it would make sense if he was a

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.250 
think it would make sense if he was a
good<00:04:20.299> guy<00:04:20.329> if<00:04:20.950> he<00:04:21.950> vers<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.580> rock<00:04:22.850> it<00:04:23.300> wouldn't

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
good guy if he vers the rock it wouldn't

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.409 
good guy if he vers the rock it wouldn't
make<00:04:24.350> sense<00:04:24.410> to<00:04:24.919> me<00:04:25.070> so<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:25.700> got<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.120> turn<00:04:26.300> him

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
make sense to me so you got to turn him

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.960 
make sense to me so you got to turn him
into<00:04:26.540> a<00:04:26.690> bad<00:04:26.930> guy<00:04:27.260> rather<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:28.070> fans<00:04:28.430> don't

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
into a bad guy rather the fans don't

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.870 
into a bad guy rather the fans don't
like<00:04:29.060> it<00:04:29.240> or<00:04:29.660> if<00:04:29.840> they<00:04:30.050> do<00:04:30.110> like<00:04:30.590> it<00:04:30.880> that's

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
like it or if they do like it that's

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.850 
like it or if they do like it that's
what's<00:04:32.210> gonna<00:04:32.390> have<00:04:32.660> its<00:04:32.930> they<00:04:33.260> got<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.590> do<00:04:33.710> it
