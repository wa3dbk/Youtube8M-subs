00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.780
 before more than six thousand people colo colo 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.910
 the new season began as 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.860
 finished the previous one losing this time 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.470
 to the union san felipe by 3 to 2 in the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.000
 chili cup debut anyway the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.619
 public arrived with enthusiasm until the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.630
 'monumental' stadium supporting the process 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.970
 of gustavo benítez and waiting for everything 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.110
 improve including the family of one of the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.110
 jason debutantes 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.450
 but we want you to come out champion and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.250
 sorted out there 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.370
 so it's spectacular that he has the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.370
 opportunity 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.380
 It has little and stretching neighborhood 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.380
 hills 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.000
 Who is the largest in South America? 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.190
 unfortunately the team did not play 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.159
 give back those faces and the shows are 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.210
 lost with so much of sebastián his only 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.830
 increase for the ignacio visit that was 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.530
 he came after an error in the exit and 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.940
 discounted mauro olivi of free throw in the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.009
 complement the two diego 80 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.960
 alvarado again deduct the bread for 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.640
 national and felipe florez 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.830
 tie from the 11 meters and the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.659
 discounts after the match the captain 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.920
 louis blondel dt gustavo benitez 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.920
 They spoke with the media 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.440
 it's interesting 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.930
 this is happening 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.700
 our 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.970
 also because he likes that we 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.460
 we are addressed in case you do not need it 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.690
 and sure yes 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.360
 we are expressing defeat 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.770
 but I want to occupy 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.370
 especially to capture what you want 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.659
 we have given in court 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.659
 it is very simple very clear 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:33.950
 and not condition the result 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.040
 asked but I say we are not going to 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.040
 go doing 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.080
 to the bad debut 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.250
 because of the result of the peas 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.440
 higher 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.590
 but we are starting to receive a 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.530
 stage and 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.060
 I see that maybe for this first 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.060
 match before our people 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.349
 with the changes we want to make can 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.170
 that the players have put a little 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:21.150
 nervous blocking jul why 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.860
 I had already shown four days ago 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.460
 party where we did it much better 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.750
 today 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.360
 today I can not move 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.340
 san felipe won well ran a little 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.810
 more than us 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.990
 especially the first part is 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.140
 exceeded in scales 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.570
 two fatalities that we had the 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.740
 problem we could say that it 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.800
 they scored goals and we could not 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.200
 comeback 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.910
 attitude in general the first time 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.630
 it was not good but the team's 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.270
 second part if it has been improved but not 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.470
 it reached us to be able to overcome a 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.330
 party and I repeat that it was a bit 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.240
 nervous 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.880
 we made some mistakes that 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:06.800
 only going back to watch the game and 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:10.010
 working positive 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.370
 I'm not alarmed I would be worried 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.030
 if these parties were already 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.030
 the championship 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.130
 normal 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.920
 it's called opening now 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.540
 where the points are important but 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.370
 we have the possibility of 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.970
 recover our point with that game 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.970
 back and forth 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.550
 we're still having a game and we're going 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.550
 to recover the following
