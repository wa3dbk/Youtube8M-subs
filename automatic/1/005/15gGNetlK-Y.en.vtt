00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.650
 it was a personal beauty we are here with 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.260
 one more video this time the most 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.510
 reviewing playstation 2 games but this 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.430
 Sometimes it 's a little different and this time. 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.590
 I will not be playing live here 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.449
 with you but I'm leaving the gameplay 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.400
 fund there for you to see how the 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.769
 game itself while I say some 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.239
 features beauty game then 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.100
 gameplay that you see there I 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.229
 I played until a little later on 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.330
 game is not in the first phase but already gives 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:42.250
 for you to see how it is 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.409
 how to play the game 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.089
 in yourself, beauty, then you can 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.940
 to realize that the game has a theme 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.830
 very old and takes place in ancient Rome and 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.049
 You play with two characters there, I just 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.659
 I'm playing with one of them I aggro if 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.280
 I'm not mistaken and another octavius they have 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.769
 different characteristics that you are 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.379
 But for the time being, but for now, I 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.600
 I'll talk about the game itself 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.340
 he counts the days that follow 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.650
 assassination of Julius Caesar 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.600
 he counts from before the murder until 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.960
 and his plot goes after the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.940
 murder with the search of who is the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.710
 true guilty I'll tell you more or 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.270
 less for you here how it works 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.520
 how the game works how the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.070
 game plot but without sponge trying 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.950
 here for you beauty is the following 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.310
 Julius Caesar is assassinated and the main 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.710
 suspect of his death is such a time 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.710
 The father of the flu is one of the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.330
 characters you play and the group is 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.120
 very friendly to the other character who 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.860
 octavio and both guard and of course that the 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.740
 two are very fond of this total spam and 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.270
 this trust too much in it they find 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.570
 that it was not him who killed was everything 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.479
 and the 2000 the two characters in the 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.830
 case groups and octavio will join to 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.250
 have to find out who the real 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.120
 killer and who is the principal of 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.590
 murder 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.990
 I will not say anything else here because 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.810
 if not finished in the game spoiler but is 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.549
 at first, this is the same as the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.649
 game and then you will play with both 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.280
 characters with characteristics 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.340
 many different 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.440
 beauty is about agripa or the flu to him 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.510
 then a centurion of rome conclude that 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.430
 You'll play the parts with weapons. 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.200
 swords with cd spear that will catch on 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.269
 heavy whistle hit people 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.610
 already octávio would be a more solid way 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.349
 to talk about it is the system of 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.680
 fight is very simple is not very easy is 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.840
 square x and triangle so you have to 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.299
 option cover text weapons you have to 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.250
 option of hitting them with different 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.799
 different shapes holding x types give 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.319
 a stronger bet we tried once 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.329
 fastest in the weakest punches 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.180
 weapons have a durability system that 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.560
 You have to see it up in the game. 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.870
 depending on the amount of 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.060
 you give that gun the amount of 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.250
 time you have used it it will decrease 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.870
 in the bar and then you will have to change 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.190
 otherwise it will break right in front of the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.450
 your weapon ep 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.099
 you have the option of hitting 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.569
 own hand but then you take a damage 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.060
 smaller than your enemy 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:07.629
 he has several types of weapons like 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.940
 swords and spears clear also shields 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.680
 shields costs lower if you 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.930
 can also hit the risks but 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.609
 especially the use of the shield to 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.120
 defending himself from other enemies 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.340
 archers with arrows or other 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.609
 enemies with same spades and also has 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.829
 how to get an early bow and arrow to 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.959
 You take out how I told you how to 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.510
 tam passes the very weapons you tighten 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.069
 I think that r 2 or milano appeared the aim and 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.650
 you tighten I think the triangle it 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.959
 can cover but this one has a low 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.090
 and drop so that that curve that ball 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.769
 Do when it goes down what you have 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.010
 what do you have to look over at 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.739
 bar for ball did not go to weapon or 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.629
 pro ax you cover hitting your 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.859
 enemy does not go very far then 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.319
 Do you want someone right from afar? 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:56.019
 I suggest you use the bow and arrow 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.870
 at the beginning you play with the flu can 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.730
 the coliseum thus in fights against others 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.769
 Romans in gladiator is 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.109
 so it's all having that audience like this 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.669
 from the side of the step in the coliseum and seeing you 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.560
 fight you have to fight against several 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.930
 gladiators within that one 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.329
 ring there and there they got it 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.269
 to adapt a policy that existed in the 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.070
 rome together in the context of this game 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.470
 that the policy of bread and five I will not 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.270
 explain a lot here but it holds up 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.639
 more or less so is a lot of 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.409
 activities for the public to see then he 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.539
 wanted the high spirits of the public more or 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.790
 less then several routes during the 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.560
 game 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.360
 will have one will have a tummy during 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.980
 I play in this first phase I 'm not mistaken 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.410
 There is more ahead but I think it has 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.660
 but will have that one small bar that 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.240
 and the more you 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.380
 kill more brutally you kill this 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.180
 belly is increasing that means 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.520
 that the public is satisfied enjoying 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.160
 of their performance are always good if 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.230
 leave bays at maximum so that you 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.290
 get several points at the end and other 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.360
 things beauty now about octavius ​​he is 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.670
 a civil you will not play it beating 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.720
 with many swords at most 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:05.930
 Are you going to have a pitcher or a rope? 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.600
 at most but he's the way he is. 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.710
 a more memorable mode will go 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.630
 do style missions will infiltrate 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.940
 political institutions of Rome 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.420
 forum senate so try to find out 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.220
 if someone staged the murder of the judge 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.260
 cezar in there then the missions 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.170
 They are conquered Stélvio not so 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.180
 It's going to be a lot of you hanging out all over 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.700
 world you have the option of hidden 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.010
 inside giant jugs walking crouched 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.720
 and anchor the walls whistle to 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.480
 someone to get the attention of some 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.180
 guard pick up the four suffocating portals 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.220
 already broke in the head in the morning he you 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.470
 can drag is the guard to hide 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.180
 in another place and also to change clothes 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.070
 with guard not to be discovered but 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.590
 you spend very slowly being very 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.810
 silly others will almost not notice 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.820
 that you are not a normal guard and will 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.920
 pursue the life of what was to 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.960
 signal is too low when they 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.480
 with a gait given something 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.060
 so you end up dying like this because you 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.800
 It's very easy for him to kill you several times. 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.290
 You'll get a really big map like this. 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.570
 for you to walk inside the city for you 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.910
 and look for the hospital usually he 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.710
 find some coins like this 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.500
 in the city ​​so you have to put together 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.360
 these coins are for me the game is very 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.310
 Good, I think it's worth to be played. 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.680
 same game has a very good graphic for 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.660
 time his gameplay is very good 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.410
 even the characters are fine 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.330
 easy to control 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.950
 There are some bosses that you will have me. 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.350
 take a little while to destroy more 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.510
 it's not very difficult so he does not 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.950
 takes reality into account because 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.350
 you can see some characters as well 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.900
 other goods strong 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.120
 so large a very strong body even 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.860
 that in reality this would not exist 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.720
 but it's still worth it if you play the 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.430
 game if you should if you can 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.870
 Pick up the game for you to play I think 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.280
 worth it 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.930
 but then this is personal I hope 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.550
 have tried to bring the maximum of 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.560
 information about this game 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.870
 without giving much history to you I think 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.240
 who does not have much sport at the time of 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.500
 game's storyline but that's what I think 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.110
 I'll stay here I hope they have 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.670
 I like this format but then I hope 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.680
 What do you like ? 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:14.170
 I like it if you like it and are not on the channel if 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.370
 register and I'll leave it at your 

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.370
 Next video I went
