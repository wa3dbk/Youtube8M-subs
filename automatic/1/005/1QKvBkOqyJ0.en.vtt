very<00:00:25.619> simple<00:00:25.980> six<00:00:26.340> text<00:00:26.670> step<00:00:27.090> process<00:00:27.630> that

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
very simple six text step process that

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
any time so the incline can get the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.200 
any time so the incline can get the
results<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.550> if<00:00:32.610> you've<00:00:32.700> got<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> pen<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.090> paper

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
want to go it's the second thing is

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.160 
want to go it's the second thing is
resources<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.860> next<00:01:26.159> one<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.340> gaps<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.210> when

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
resources the next one is gaps and when

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.780 
resources the next one is gaps and when
I<00:01:28.200> look<00:01:28.350> at<00:01:28.470> gaps<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.890> think<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> myself<00:01:29.130> what<00:01:29.640> is

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
I look at gaps I think to myself what is

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.850 
I look at gaps I think to myself what is
it<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.030> they<00:01:30.119> need<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.390> develop<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> look

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
it that they need to develop so I look

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.990 
it that they need to develop so I look
in<00:01:32.009> what<00:01:32.310> they've<00:01:32.460> done<00:01:32.700> what<00:01:32.939> they've

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
in what they've done what they've

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.520 
in what they've done what they've
learned<00:01:33.329> what<00:01:33.540> their<00:01:33.689> education<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.350> what

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
learned what their education is what

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.929 
learned what their education is what
sort<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.710> skills<00:01:34.829> they<00:01:35.159> have<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.579> what<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.820> is

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
start developing next is the S which

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.440 
start developing next is the S which
stands<00:01:40.439> for<00:01:40.560> first<00:01:40.979> efforts<00:01:41.670> we're<00:01:42.390> on

client needs to do is it what's the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.490 
client needs to do is it what's the
first<00:01:47.430> small<00:01:47.790> step<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.360> they<00:01:48.479> must<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:49.049> in

I<00:01:53.310> had<00:01:53.460> elicited<00:01:53.850> what<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.570> want

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
I had elicited what that is that I want

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.209 
I had elicited what that is that I want
to<00:01:54.780> wrap<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.049> date<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.439> time<00:01:55.500> around<00:01:56.040> it

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
to wrap the date and the time around it

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.319 
to wrap the date and the time around it
by<00:01:56.549> which<00:01:56.790> they're<00:01:56.969> going<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> actually

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
by which they're going to actually

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.490 
by which they're going to actually
activate<00:01:57.990> or<00:01:58.170> take

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
activate or take

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
action on that process next is the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.910 
action on that process next is the
letter<00:02:01.470> e<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.040> e<00:02:02.610> stands<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:03.380> evaluation<00:02:04.380> so

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
letter e and e stands for evaluation so

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.320 
letter e and e stands for evaluation so
how<00:02:05.100> do<00:02:05.160> you<00:02:05.310> know<00:02:05.430> if<00:02:05.550> it's<00:02:05.670> actually<00:02:05.880> working

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
how do you know if it's actually working

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.150 
how do you know if it's actually working
what<00:02:06.720> systems<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.410> have<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.710> place<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
what systems do you have in place to

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.800 
what systems do you have in place to
track<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.759> measure<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.300> ensure<00:02:09.630> that

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
track it to measure it to ensure that

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.620 
track it to measure it to ensure that
this<00:02:10.170> strategy<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.740> actually<00:02:11.250> being

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
this strategy is actually being

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.880 
this strategy is actually being
effective<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:13.140> once<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.410> go<00:02:13.560> through<00:02:13.590> that

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
effective and once you go through that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.320 
effective and once you go through that
you'll<00:02:14.070> be<00:02:14.160> able<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.340> find<00:02:14.490> out<00:02:14.670> systems<00:02:15.120> of

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
you'll be able to find out systems of

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.810 
you'll be able to find out systems of
metrics<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.260> information<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.070> knowledge

they<00:02:18.209> were<00:02:18.300> late<00:02:18.540> or<00:02:18.570> let<00:02:18.870> yourself<00:02:19.290> know

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
they were late or let yourself know

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.380 
they were late or let yourself know
whether<00:02:19.709> or<00:02:19.920> strategies<00:02:20.760> effective<00:02:21.209> because

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
whether or strategies effective because

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.449 
whether or strategies effective because
one<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.690> things<00:02:21.720> i<00:02:21.900> know<00:02:21.959> about

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
one of the things i know about

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.470 
one of the things i know about
strategies<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.700> they<00:02:23.820> don't<00:02:24.000> work<00:02:24.209> for<00:02:24.450> me

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
strategies is if they don't work for me

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.690 
strategies is if they don't work for me
I<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:25.110> let<00:02:25.260> them<00:02:25.290> go<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.770> change<00:02:26.130> them<00:02:26.370> I'm

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
assistance until I find a strategy that

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.240 
assistance until I find a strategy that
works<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.600> with<00:02:30.900> your<00:02:31.020> clients<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:31.800> best<00:02:32.070> to

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
life has an ultimate strategy it really

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.479 
life has an ultimate strategy it really
dance<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.840> once<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.590> own<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:38.070> piece<00:02:38.340> of

have<00:02:40.290> an<00:02:40.410> ultimate<00:02:40.770> strategy<00:02:41.190> then<00:02:41.640> it's<00:02:41.760> just

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
have an ultimate strategy then it's just

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.370 
have an ultimate strategy then it's just
a<00:02:42.000> matter<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.239> adjusting<00:02:42.390> your<00:02:42.959> strategy

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
a matter of adjusting your strategy

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.410 
a matter of adjusting your strategy
until<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.709> find<00:02:43.980> one<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.160> works<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.850> the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
until you find one that works and the
