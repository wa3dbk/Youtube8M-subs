and he knows he's on Comcast so he's
trying<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.409> make<00:01:39.500> all<00:01:39.650> kinds<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:39.950> attack<00:01:40.159> with

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
trying to make all kinds of attack with

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.340 
trying to make all kinds of attack with
just<00:01:40.700> as<00:01:40.820> a<00:01:40.850> play-action<00:01:41.690> is<00:01:41.900> so<00:01:42.049> effective

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
just as a play-action is so effective

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.080 
just as a play-action is so effective
you<00:01:42.590> know<00:01:42.799> because<00:01:42.979> they<00:01:43.100> think<00:01:43.159> it's<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.549> run

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
you know because they think it's a run

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.240 
you know because they think it's a run
then<00:01:44.240> all<00:01:44.360> sudden<00:01:44.540> surpassed<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.680> Wildcat

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
then all sudden surpassed the Wildcat

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.460 
then all sudden surpassed the Wildcat
ads<00:01:47.060> in<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.479> mystery<00:01:47.930> of<00:01:47.990> who<00:01:48.140> has<00:01:48.320> the

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
ads in the mystery of who has the

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.899 
ads in the mystery of who has the
football<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.430> next<00:01:49.610> part<00:01:49.790> of<00:01:49.820> the

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
football the next part of the

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.609 
football the next part of the
progression<00:01:50.330> is<00:01:50.450> we<00:01:50.570> add<00:01:50.659> in<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:50.930> pitch<00:01:51.350> phase

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
progression is we add in a pitch phase

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.530 
progression is we add in a pitch phase
so<00:01:52.310> we're<00:01:52.400> going<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.580> utilize<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:52.970> wide

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
so we're going to utilize a wide

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.140 
so we're going to utilize a wide
receiver<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.500> go<00:01:54.650> in<00:01:54.830> motion<00:01:55.280> quarterback

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
receiver to go in motion quarterback

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.520 
receiver to go in motion quarterback
will<00:01:56.300> still<00:01:56.540> use<00:01:56.570> his<00:01:56.840> own<00:01:57.020> read<00:01:57.259> but<00:01:57.409> then

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
will still use his own read but then

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.070 
will still use his own read but then
he'll<00:01:57.710> option<00:01:58.580> off<00:01:58.790> another<00:01:59.600> defender

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
he'll option off another defender

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.499 
he'll option off another defender
outside<00:02:00.470> of<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.740> formation<00:02:01.220> so<00:02:02.149> now<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.300> ball

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
outside of the formation so now the ball

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:03.700 
outside of the formation so now the ball
is<00:02:02.540> getting<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.020> perimeter<00:02:03.350> now<00:02:03.500> and

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
is getting to the perimeter now and

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.440 
is getting to the perimeter now and
we're<00:02:03.950> option<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.369> forest<00:02:04.670> player<00:02:04.909> and

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
we're option the forest player and

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.540 
we're option the forest player and
that's<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.659> element<00:02:05.899> that<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:07.159> NFL<00:02:07.340> has<00:02:07.460> been

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
that's the element that the NFL has been

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.040 
that's the element that the NFL has been
a<00:02:07.640> little<00:02:07.820> bit<00:02:07.970> resistant<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.539> go<00:02:08.660> into<00:02:08.690> but

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
a little bit resistant to go into but

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.449 
a little bit resistant to go into but
you<00:02:09.140> do<00:02:09.259> see<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.470> little<00:02:09.679> bit<00:02:09.800> of<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:09.950> now<00:02:10.100> as

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
you do see a little bit of it now as

element<00:02:27.620> now<00:02:28.040> he's<00:02:28.190> faking<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.640> base<00:02:28.820> and

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
element now he's faking the base and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.600 
element now he's faking the base and
he's<00:02:29.180> gonna<00:02:29.300> take<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.600> on<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.810> trap<00:02:30.050> inside

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.949 

they're<00:02:34.610> creating<00:02:35.000> another<00:02:35.209> gap<00:02:35.450> which<00:02:35.840> you

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
they're creating another gap which you

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:36.970 
they're creating another gap which you
don't<00:02:36.050> happen<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.380> have<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.530> come<00:02:36.709> up<00:02:36.769> with<00:02:36.830> an

everyone<00:03:05.980> from<00:03:06.100> there<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.460> think<00:03:06.700> it's<00:03:06.790> one<00:03:06.910> of

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
everyone from there I think it's one of

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.190 
everyone from there I think it's one of
those<00:03:07.030> things<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.300> you're<00:03:07.540> hoping<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:08.050> the

those things that you're hoping that the

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.570 
those things that you're hoping that the
defense<00:03:08.620> has<00:03:08.770> to<00:03:08.890> spend<00:03:09.130> just<00:03:09.160> as<00:03:09.400> much<00:03:09.430> time

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
defense has to spend just as much time

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.580 
defense has to spend just as much time

the<00:03:21.130> preparation<00:03:21.640> time<00:03:22.300> on<00:03:22.510> defense<00:03:22.870> is

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
the preparation time on defense is

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.390 
the preparation time on defense is
certainly<00:03:23.320> probably<00:03:23.650> more<00:03:23.800> than<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.250> would<00:03:24.370> be

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
certainly probably more than it would be

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.370 
certainly probably more than it would be
on<00:03:24.550> offense<00:03:24.880> when<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.090> start<00:03:25.330> to<00:03:25.420> see<00:03:25.600> these

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.740 
on offense when you start to see these
