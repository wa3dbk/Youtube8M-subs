innovation<00:00:13.620> Channel<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.130> know<00:00:14.280> it's<00:00:14.519> been<00:00:14.700> a

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
innovation Channel I know it's been a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.189 
innovation Channel I know it's been a
couple<00:00:14.940> weeks<00:00:15.089> since<00:00:15.480> we've<00:00:15.719> released<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
couple weeks since we've released the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.529 
couple weeks since we've released the
story<00:00:16.500> system<00:00:16.890> but<00:00:17.250> we<00:00:17.970> just<00:00:18.150> haven't<00:00:18.420> had

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
story system but we just haven't had

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.630 
story system but we just haven't had
that<00:00:18.600> much<00:00:18.900> time<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.439> now<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> do<00:00:20.369> have

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
that much time so now that I do have

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.460 
that much time so now that I do have
time<00:00:20.880> I'm<00:00:21.330> gonna<00:00:21.539> show<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.810> how<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.990> make<00:00:22.230> this

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
time I'm gonna show you how to make this

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.439 
time I'm gonna show you how to make this
virtually<00:00:23.220> infinite<00:00:23.369> storage<00:00:24.029> system

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
virtually infinite storage system

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.019 
virtually infinite storage system
actually<00:00:25.230> infinite<00:00:25.590> for<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.460> sake<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.670> time

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
actually infinite for the sake of time

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.880 
actually infinite for the sake of time
I'm<00:00:27.420> going<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.869> show<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.170> how<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.769> on

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
I'm going to show you how to do it on

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.609 
I'm going to show you how to do it on
this<00:00:29.490> sorting<00:00:30.210> system<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:31.199> would<00:00:31.349> just<00:00:31.560> take

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
this sorting system that would just take

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.459 
this sorting system that would just take
too<00:00:31.769> long<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.399> if<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.510> want<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.809> expand<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.290> it

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
too long and if you want to expand it it

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.930 
too long and if you want to expand it it
should<00:00:34.680> be<00:00:34.829> pretty<00:00:35.040> obvious<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.820> I'm

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
should be pretty obvious to do it I'm

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.090 
should be pretty obvious to do it I'm
not<00:00:36.000> gonna<00:00:36.360> go<00:00:36.600> over<00:00:36.930> how<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.620> it

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
not gonna go over how to do that it

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.369 
not gonna go over how to do that it
should<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.370> pretty<00:00:38.610> pretty<00:00:39.180> obvious<00:00:39.600> all

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
should be pretty pretty obvious all

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.720 
should be pretty pretty obvious all

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
to start next what we're gonna do is

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.679 
to start next what we're gonna do is
we're<00:01:25.920> gonna<00:01:25.979> lay<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> rails<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:27.210> which<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
we're gonna lay the rails on which the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.380 
we're gonna lay the rails on which the
chests<00:01:28.110> minecarts<00:01:28.680> will<00:01:28.950> sit<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:30.270> is

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
chests minecarts will sit on this is

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.819 
chests minecarts will sit on this is
probably<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> trickiest<00:01:30.900> part<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.650> watch

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
probably the trickiest part so watch

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.440 
probably the trickiest part so watch
closely<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.490> we're<00:01:32.880> gonna<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.299> we're

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
closely what we're gonna do is we're

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.880 
closely what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:01:33.509> actually<00:01:33.750> place<00:01:34.170> some<00:01:34.380> blocks<00:01:34.619> back

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
gonna actually place some blocks back

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.749 
gonna actually place some blocks back
here<00:01:35.930> on<00:01:36.930> both<00:01:37.710> sides<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.250> these<00:01:38.340> bottom

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
here on both sides of these bottom

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.249 
here on both sides of these bottom
hoppers<00:01:39.180> here<00:01:40.490> like<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.909> then<00:01:42.259> we're

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
hoppers here like that and then we're

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.399 
hoppers here like that and then we're
going<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.619> get<00:01:44.159> our<00:01:44.399> rails<00:01:44.850> ready<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.600> then

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
going to get our rails ready and then

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.590 
going to get our rails ready and then
we're<00:01:47.130> gonna<00:01:47.250> try<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.549> place<00:01:47.820> them<00:01:48.060> parallel

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
we're gonna try to place them parallel

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.450 
we're gonna try to place them parallel
how<00:01:48.990> are<00:01:49.049> we<00:01:49.140> gonna<00:01:49.259> do<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.649> because<00:01:50.100> if<00:01:50.369> I

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
how are we gonna do that because if I

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.190 
how are we gonna do that because if I
just<00:01:50.700> place<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> rail<00:01:51.149> there<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.960> place<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
just place a rail there and I place a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.980 
just place a rail there and I place a
rail<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.710> they're<00:01:53.070> gonna<00:01:53.220> connect<00:01:53.750> so<00:01:54.750> we

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
rail there they're gonna connect so we

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.350 
rail there they're gonna connect so we
have<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.320> prevent<00:01:55.590> that

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
have to prevent that

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.970 
have to prevent that
we're<00:01:56.600> gonna<00:01:56.690> do<00:01:56.900> that<00:01:57.050> so<00:01:57.440> we're<00:01:57.530> gonna<00:01:57.620> start

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
we're gonna do that so we're gonna start

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.310 
we're gonna do that so we're gonna start
down<00:01:58.250> here<00:01:58.640> in<00:01:58.730> the<00:01:58.850> bottom<00:01:59.090> corner<00:01:59.630> and<00:01:59.780> we're

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
down here in the bottom corner and we're

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.320 
down here in the bottom corner and we're
just<00:02:00.440> gonna<00:02:00.590> build<00:02:00.920> our<00:02:01.130> rails<00:02:01.430> going<00:02:01.940> around

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
just gonna build our rails going around

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.380 
just gonna build our rails going around
like<00:02:02.690> this<00:02:03.050> and<00:02:03.380> when<00:02:03.950> we<00:02:04.070> come<00:02:04.250> back<00:02:04.400> here<00:02:04.760> it

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
like this and when we come back here it

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.780 
like this and when we come back here it
will<00:02:05.630> not<00:02:05.810> connect<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.440> therefore<00:02:07.250> our<00:02:07.490> rails

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
will not connect and therefore our rails

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.480 
will not connect and therefore our rails
will<00:02:08.030> be<00:02:08.179> nice<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:08.600> parallel<00:02:09.310> we're<00:02:10.310> just

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
will be nice and parallel we're just

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.400 
will be nice and parallel we're just
gonna<00:02:10.580> go<00:02:10.850> down<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.480> line<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:11.750> keep<00:02:12.140> doing

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
gonna go down the line and keep doing

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.500 
gonna go down the line and keep doing
this<00:02:12.530> we're<00:02:12.770> gonna<00:02:12.890> go<00:02:13.160> back<00:02:13.460> loop<00:02:14.300> around

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
this we're gonna go back loop around

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.770 
this we're gonna go back loop around
come<00:02:15.260> back<00:02:15.290> here<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:17.060> then<00:02:17.270> for<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.540> last

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
come back here and then for this last

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.540 
come back here and then for this last
one<00:02:17.960> you<00:02:18.530> should<00:02:18.710> be<00:02:18.800> able<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.040> just<00:02:19.280> place

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
one you should be able to just place

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.540 
one you should be able to just place
that<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:21.080> once<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.410> got<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.800> all<00:02:21.860> your<00:02:22.310> rails

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
that so once you got that all your rails

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.550 
that so once you got that all your rails
should<00:02:22.820> be<00:02:22.910> parallel<00:02:23.240> we<00:02:23.930> can<00:02:24.110> go<00:02:24.260> ahead<00:02:24.410> and

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
should be parallel we can go ahead and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.330 
should be parallel we can go ahead and
delete<00:02:24.950> these<00:02:25.160> rows<00:02:25.459> of<00:02:25.610> blocks<00:02:25.880> here<00:02:26.950> like<00:02:27.950> so

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
delete these rows of blocks here like so

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.970 
delete these rows of blocks here like so
and<00:02:28.910> now<00:02:29.870> we're<00:02:30.170> ready<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.560> start<00:02:30.740> rebuilding

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
and now we're ready to start rebuilding

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.940 
and now we're ready to start rebuilding
this<00:02:31.459> thing<00:02:31.870> what<00:02:32.870> we're<00:02:32.990> gonna<00:02:33.080> do<00:02:33.350> is<00:02:33.680> we're

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
this thing what we're gonna do is we're

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.670 
this thing what we're gonna do is we're
going<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.540> replace<00:02:35.540> these<00:02:35.810> double<00:02:36.230> chests<00:02:36.560> on

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
going to replace these double chests on

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.070 
going to replace these double chests on
the<00:02:36.770> bottom<00:02:37.100> here<00:02:37.459> just<00:02:38.360> go<00:02:38.540> ahead<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:38.900> do

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
the bottom here just go ahead and do

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.810 
the bottom here just go ahead and do
that<00:02:40.540> should<00:02:41.540> be<00:02:41.630> pretty<00:02:41.959> self-explanatory

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
that should be pretty self-explanatory

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.000 
that should be pretty self-explanatory
take<00:02:44.239> your<00:02:44.390> hoppers<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.110> right<00:02:45.650> click<00:02:45.860> on<00:02:45.950> the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
take your hoppers and right click on the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.710 
take your hoppers and right click on the
sides<00:02:46.489> of<00:02:46.730> these<00:02:46.850> rails<00:02:47.239> here<00:02:49.360> make<00:02:50.360> sure<00:02:50.540> they

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
sides of these rails here make sure they

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.050 
sides of these rails here make sure they
are<00:02:50.900> facing<00:02:51.380> that<00:02:51.500> way

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
are facing that way

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.120 
are facing that way
then<00:02:53.060> we're<00:02:53.180> gonna<00:02:53.300> come<00:02:53.600> up<00:02:53.720> here<00:02:54.130> we're

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
then we're gonna come up here we're

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.960 
then we're gonna come up here we're
gonna<00:02:55.340> get<00:02:55.670> our<00:02:55.790> stairs<00:02:56.650> for<00:02:57.650> our<00:02:57.830> facade<00:02:58.459> once

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
gonna get our stairs for our facade once

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.500 
gonna get our stairs for our facade once
again<00:02:59.739> like<00:03:00.739> that<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:01.220> then<00:03:02.000> we're<00:03:02.180> going<00:03:02.360> to

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
again like that and then we're going to

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.870 
again like that and then we're going to
make<00:03:03.290> these<00:03:03.530> double<00:03:03.890> chests<00:03:04.160> on<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.340> top<00:03:04.549> here

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
make these double chests on the top here

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:13.030 
make these double chests on the top here
like<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:11.080> then<00:03:12.080> I'll<00:03:12.200> fix<00:03:12.410> up<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.739> facade

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
like so and then I'll fix up the facade

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.430 
like so and then I'll fix up the facade
later<00:03:13.450> once<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.540> got<00:03:14.690> that<00:03:14.870> we're<00:03:15.049> gonna<00:03:15.140> come

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
later once you got that we're gonna come

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.860 
later once you got that we're gonna come
around<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.769> back<00:03:15.980> here<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.600> we're<00:03:17.600> going<00:03:17.840> to

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
around the back here and we're going to

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.870 
around the back here and we're going to
place<00:03:18.170> our<00:03:18.410> blocks<00:03:18.830> back<00:03:19.190> in<00:03:19.400> front<00:03:19.670> of<00:03:19.790> these

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
place our blocks back in front of these

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.330 
place our blocks back in front of these
repeaters<00:03:20.299> here<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:20.900> now<00:03:21.830> we're<00:03:22.010> ready<00:03:22.190> to

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
repeaters here and now we're ready to

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.070 
repeaters here and now we're ready to
place<00:03:22.549> our<00:03:22.730> minecarts<00:03:23.269> now<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.630> thing<00:03:23.930> that

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
place our minecarts now the thing that

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.990 
place our minecarts now the thing that
makes<00:03:24.290> this<00:03:24.470> actually<00:03:25.010> infinite<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.790> fact

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
makes this actually infinite is the fact

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.110 
makes this actually infinite is the fact
that<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.239> can<00:03:26.390> place<00:03:27.489> theoretically<00:03:28.489> you<00:03:28.940> can

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
that you can place theoretically you can

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.240 
that you can place theoretically you can
place<00:03:29.360> an<00:03:29.720> infinite<00:03:30.230> number<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.650> chests

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
place an infinite number of chests

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.090 
place an infinite number of chests
minecarts<00:03:31.880> into<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.209> single<00:03:32.690> block<00:03:33.100> now

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
minecarts into a single block now

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.490 
minecarts into a single block now
obviously<00:03:34.910> this<00:03:35.269> can<00:03:35.510> get<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.750> bit<00:03:35.959> out<00:03:36.049> of<00:03:36.110> hand

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
obviously this can get a bit out of hand

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.750 
obviously this can get a bit out of hand
and<00:03:36.769> it<00:03:37.220> will<00:03:37.610> lag<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.540> will<00:03:38.840> lag<00:03:39.370> but<00:03:40.370> it's

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
and it will lag it will lag but it's

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.509 
and it will lag it will lag but it's
virtually<00:03:41.480> infinite<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:42.280> infinity<00:03:43.280> is<00:03:43.459> a

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
virtually infinite and infinity is a

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.140 
virtually infinite and infinity is a
very<00:03:43.940> large<00:03:44.239> number<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:46.489> what<00:03:46.700> we're<00:03:46.820> gonna<00:03:46.880> do

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
very large number so what we're gonna do

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.720 
very large number so what we're gonna do
is<00:03:47.420> we're<00:03:47.660> just<00:03:47.930> going<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.290> place<00:03:48.709> for<00:03:49.610> now

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
is we're just going to place for now

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.640 
is we're just going to place for now
we're<00:03:50.030> just<00:03:50.060> gonna<00:03:50.299> place<00:03:50.600> one<00:03:50.650> chest

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
we're just gonna place one chest

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.680 
we're just gonna place one chest
minecart<00:03:52.160> on<00:03:52.340> each<00:03:52.549> of<00:03:52.670> these<00:03:52.760> rails<00:03:53.060> keep<00:03:53.540> in

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
minecart on each of these rails keep in

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.840 
minecart on each of these rails keep in
mind<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:54.470> if<00:03:54.680> you<00:03:54.799> place<00:03:55.040> two<00:03:55.459> chef's

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
mind that if you place two chef's

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.670 
mind that if you place two chef's
minecarts<00:03:56.390> it<00:03:56.510> will<00:03:56.660> be<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:57.079> double<00:03:57.440> chest

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
minecarts it will be a double chest

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.530 
minecarts it will be a double chest
three<00:03:58.340> chest<00:03:58.610> minecarts<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.299> will<00:03:59.420> be

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
three chest minecarts it will be

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.860 
three chest minecarts it will be
one-and-a-half<00:04:00.230> chests<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:02.000> so<00:04:02.420> on<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.720> so

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
don't have to place anything so let me

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.260 
don't have to place anything so let me

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.020 

all<00:05:35.740> right<00:05:35.950> because<00:05:36.280> this<00:05:36.430> is<00:05:36.490> the<00:05:36.730> smaller

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
all right because this is the smaller

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.060 
all right because this is the smaller
version<00:05:37.389> we<00:05:38.080> don't<00:05:38.290> have<00:05:38.410> to<00:05:38.530> get<00:05:38.680> quite<00:05:38.860> as

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
version we don't have to get quite as

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.090 
version we don't have to get quite as
many<00:05:39.250> items<00:05:39.430> as<00:05:39.760> we<00:05:39.940> had<00:05:40.120> to<00:05:40.240> do<00:05:40.389> over<00:05:40.660> there

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
many items as we had to do over there

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.310 
many items as we had to do over there
but<00:05:42.100> remember<00:05:42.580> if<00:05:43.240> you<00:05:43.540> have<00:05:43.720> a<00:05:43.750> bigger<00:05:44.020> build

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
but remember if you have a bigger build

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.650 
but remember if you have a bigger build
then<00:05:44.919> it<00:05:45.220> should<00:05:45.400> be<00:05:45.430> pretty<00:05:45.700> obvious<00:05:45.820> what<00:05:46.630> to

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
then it should be pretty obvious what to

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.950 
then it should be pretty obvious what to
do<00:05:47.550> this<00:05:48.550> row<00:05:48.820> had<00:05:49.060> diamonds<00:05:49.570> so<00:05:49.750> we're<00:05:49.870> gonna
