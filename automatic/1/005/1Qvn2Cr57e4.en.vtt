that was this tablet that was being

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.019 
that was this tablet that was being
crowdfunded<00:00:28.020> called<00:00:28.289> Earl<00:00:28.619> now<00:00:29.400> Earl<00:00:29.699> was

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
crowdfunded called Earl now Earl was

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.650 
crowdfunded called Earl now Earl was
really<00:00:30.359> sort<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.830> geared<00:00:31.830> towards

because it happens to have an integrated

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.899 
because it happens to have an integrated
solar<00:00:39.479> panel<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.199> back<00:00:40.519> flexible<00:00:41.519> eating

display preloaded with tons of maps tons
of<00:00:46.800> GPS<00:00:47.429> options<00:00:48.530> sensors<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.249> course

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
of GPS options sensors like of course

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:52.840 
of GPS options sensors like of course
your<00:00:51.059> usual<00:00:51.420> accelerometer<00:00:52.139> but<00:00:52.319> it<00:00:52.409> also<00:00:52.559> had

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
your usual accelerometer but it also had

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.849 
your usual accelerometer but it also had
barometers<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:53.879> things<00:00:54.479> like<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.559> it

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
barometers and things like that so it

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.590 
barometers and things like that so it
seemed<00:00:56.249> to<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.729> be<00:00:56.969> geared<00:00:57.239> towards

from<00:01:00.030> everything<00:01:00.379> this<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.620> course<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:02.010> being

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
from everything this of course is being

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.340 
from everything this of course is being
crowd<00:01:02.609> funded<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.179> it's<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.479> completed<00:01:03.989> yet

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
crowd funded so it's not completed yet

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.200 
crowd funded so it's not completed yet
and<00:01:04.589> only<00:01:04.890> time<00:01:05.070> will<00:01:05.309> tell<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.909> how<00:01:06.060> it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
and only time will tell just how it

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.420 
and only time will tell just how it
turns<00:01:06.420> out<00:01:06.690> but<00:01:07.409> that's<00:01:07.799> what<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.100> looks<00:01:08.130> like

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
turns out but that's what it looks like

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.330 
turns out but that's what it looks like
at<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.730> present<00:01:09.120> now<00:01:09.360> notion<00:01:09.930> Inc<00:01:10.230> who<00:01:10.740> made<00:01:11.310> a

tablet early on in the tablet game
called<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> atom<00:01:14.280> which<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.300> actually<00:01:16.640> happen

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
called the atom which I actually happen

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.050 
called the atom which I actually happen
to<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:18.030> one<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.620> notion<00:01:20.100> Inc<00:01:20.370> who<00:01:20.970> had

the street is that it's going to be a
dual<00:01:33.150> screen<00:01:33.480> device<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.440> we'll<00:01:35.070> see<00:01:35.250> how<00:01:35.370> that

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
dual screen device so we'll see how that

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.790 
dual screen device so we'll see how that
turns<00:01:35.580> out<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.870> next<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.380> quite

exciting because Adobe is actually

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.200 
exciting because Adobe is actually
making<00:01:39.990> some<00:01:40.350> hardware<00:01:41.070> devices<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:42.060> your

different<00:01:54.120> geometric<00:01:54.720> shapes<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:55.290> it'll

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
different geometric shapes and it'll

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.290 
different geometric shapes and it'll
actually<00:01:55.650> display<00:01:56.220> it<00:01:56.370> on<00:01:56.550> to<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> tablet
