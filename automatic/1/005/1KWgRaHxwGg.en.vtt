sounds<00:00:29.580> not<00:00:29.640> quite<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.240> good<00:00:30.650> I<00:00:31.650> also<00:00:32.340> didn't

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
sounds not quite as good I also didn't

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.610 
sounds not quite as good I also didn't
do<00:00:33.000> my<00:00:33.149> hair<00:00:33.360> or<00:00:33.570> wear<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> hat<00:00:33.989> today<00:00:34.170> which<00:00:34.469> i

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
do my hair or wear a hat today which i

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.049 
do my hair or wear a hat today which i
think<00:00:34.860> most<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.100> my<00:00:35.190> videos<00:00:35.219> usually<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.940> one

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
think most of my videos usually have one

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.389 
think most of my videos usually have one
of<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.270> other<00:00:36.390> but<00:00:37.020> you'll<00:00:37.559> survive<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:38.160> know<00:00:38.280> I

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
of the other but you'll survive I know I

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.790 
of the other but you'll survive I know I
will<00:00:38.579> maybe<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:39.870> anyway<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:40.350> practicing

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
will maybe but anyway I was practicing

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.340 
will maybe but anyway I was practicing
this<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.160> before<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.899> thought<00:00:43.110> this

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
this just before and I thought this

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.350 
this just before and I thought this
would<00:00:43.500> make<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:44.070> good<00:00:44.250> lesson<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:45.270> I

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
would make a really good lesson I like I

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.520 
would make a really good lesson I like I
mean<00:00:45.510> really<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.110> gonna<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> great

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
mean really this is gonna be a great

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.440 
mean really this is gonna be a great
lesson<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:47.160> you're<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.700> getting<00:00:47.879> into<00:00:48.270> this

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
lesson if you're just getting into this

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.430 
lesson if you're just getting into this
stuff<00:00:49.640> this<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.899> okay<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.170> you're<00:00:52.289> just

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
stuff this is okay so if you're just

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.479 
stuff this is okay so if you're just
getting<00:00:52.590> into<00:00:52.920> jazz<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.309> you're<00:00:53.399> learning

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
getting into jazz and you're learning

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.979 
getting into jazz and you're learning
all<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.730> stuff<00:00:53.940> hopefully<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:54.840> there

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
all this stuff hopefully you know there

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.360 
all this stuff hopefully you know there
has<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.230> some<00:00:55.469> implied<00:00:55.770> knowledge<00:00:56.100> there

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
has to be some implied knowledge there

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.459 
has to be some implied knowledge there
you're<00:00:56.520> going<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.969> probably<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:58.050> a

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
you're going to have to probably know a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.840 
you're going to have to probably know a
little<00:00:58.649> bit<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.890> theory<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.399> I'm<00:00:59.460> relying<00:00:59.789> on

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
little bit of theory so I'm relying on

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.590 
little bit of theory so I'm relying on
that<00:01:00.210> from<00:01:00.510> your<00:01:01.109> from<00:01:01.590> your<00:01:01.620> point<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.250> view

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
that from your from your point of view

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.520 
that from your from your point of view
but<00:01:03.600> basically<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.049> was<00:01:04.170> practicing<00:01:04.500> my

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
but basically I was practicing my

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.370 
but basically I was practicing my
arpeggios<00:01:05.720> b-flat<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:06.990> playing<00:01:07.200> b-flat

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
arpeggios b-flat I was playing b-flat

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.010 
arpeggios b-flat I was playing b-flat
rhythm<00:01:07.860> changes<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.430> min<00:01:08.700> 17<00:01:09.409> g<00:01:10.409> 7c<00:01:11.420> seven<00:01:12.420> if

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
rhythm changes so min 17 g 7c seven if

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.580 
rhythm changes so min 17 g 7c seven if
or<00:01:13.470> diatonic<00:01:14.460> Lee<00:01:14.700> which<00:01:14.850> means<00:01:15.090> without

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
or diatonic Lee which means without

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.810 
or diatonic Lee which means without
basically<00:01:16.590> doing<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.920> slightly<00:01:17.340> different<00:01:17.580> key

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
basically doing a slightly different key

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.910 
basically doing a slightly different key
never<00:01:18.030> record<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.659> look<00:01:18.780> at<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.960> from<00:01:19.080> be

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
never record you can look at it from be

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.710 
never record you can look at it from be
flattened<00:01:20.360> G<00:01:21.360> minor<00:01:22.310> C<00:01:23.310> minus<00:01:23.580> 7<00:01:24.320> f<00:01:25.320> dominant<00:01:25.950> 7

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
flattened G minor C minus 7 f dominant 7

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.940 
flattened G minor C minus 7 f dominant 7
now<00:01:27.720> what<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.869> was<00:01:27.960> doing<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.200> our<00:01:28.409> page<00:01:28.590> 80<00:01:28.799> so

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
now what I was doing was our page 80 so

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.109 
now what I was doing was our page 80 so
I'm<00:01:29.040> going<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.189> quickly<00:01:29.369> show<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.700> how<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> do

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
I'm going to quickly show you how to do

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.740 
I'm going to quickly show you how to do
that<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.540> you're<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> beginner<00:01:31.759> up<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.630> know

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that so if you're a beginner up you know

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.109 
that so if you're a beginner up you know
just<00:01:34.619> simple<00:01:35.130> arpeggios<00:01:35.549> are<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> great<00:01:35.909> way<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
just simple arpeggios are a great way to

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.760 
just simple arpeggios are a great way to
begin<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.990> B<00:01:37.200> flat<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.930> we're<00:01:40.049> going<00:01:40.290> jeet

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
begin so B flat and we're going jeet

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.090 
begin so B flat and we're going jeet
we're<00:01:40.890> thinking<00:01:41.130> g<00:01:41.310> minor<00:01:41.549> coming<00:01:41.880> back<00:01:42.030> with

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
we're thinking g minor coming back with

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.410 
we're thinking g minor coming back with
really<00:01:44.100> we're<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.280> thinking<00:01:44.520> B<00:01:44.820> flat<00:01:45.090> B<00:01:45.390> flat

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
really we're just thinking B flat B flat

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.600 
really we're just thinking B flat B flat
G<00:01:46.020> minor<00:01:46.229> basically<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.770> same<00:01:46.920> cause<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.460> what

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
G minor basically the same cause so what

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.920 
G minor basically the same cause so what
we're<00:01:50.729> going<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.909> look<00:01:51.000> at<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.270> how<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.479> go<00:01:51.750> from

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
we're going to look at is how we go from

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.300

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
guess you would say ok so the next thing

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.090 
guess you would say ok so the next thing
we<00:03:56.130> do<00:03:56.280> let's<00:03:56.790> stick<00:03:57.450> with<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.810> c<00:03:58.410> minor<00:03:58.800> for

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
we do let's stick with the c minor for

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.460 
we do let's stick with the c minor for

but that f7 instead of playing if
natural<00:04:12.670> we're<00:04:13.670> gonna<00:04:13.790> play<00:04:14.060> in<00:04:14.480> his<00:04:14.770> shop

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
natural we're gonna play in his shop

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.310 
natural we're gonna play in his shop
which<00:04:16.609> while<00:04:17.030> orange<00:04:17.450> a<00:04:17.570> flattening<00:04:18.079> and

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
which while orange a flattening and

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.130 
which while orange a flattening and
that's<00:04:18.950> gonna<00:04:19.130> create<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:19.790> sound<00:04:20.030> of<00:04:20.359> an<00:04:20.480> f7

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
that's gonna create the sound of an f7

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.600 
that's gonna create the sound of an f7
flat<00:04:21.470> 9<00:04:23.440> so<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:24.590> were<00:04:24.710> my<00:04:24.830> eyebrow<00:04:25.250> goes<00:04:25.460> up

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
flat 9 so that were my eyebrow goes up

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.630 
flat 9 so that were my eyebrow goes up
that's<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:25.940> best<00:04:26.150> note<00:04:26.890> that<00:04:27.890> was<00:04:28.010> both<00:04:28.220> means

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
that's the best note that was both means

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:41.680 
that's the best note that was both means
it<00:04:28.760> was<00:04:28.850> a<00:04:28.880> doubly<00:04:29.240> good<00:04:29.390> night<00:04:30.460> okay<00:04:40.300> I<00:04:41.300> can't

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
it was a doubly good night okay I can't

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:49.000 
it was a doubly good night okay I can't
do<00:04:41.810> it<00:04:41.840> when<00:04:42.020> I'm<00:04:42.110> thinking<00:04:42.230> too<00:04:47.020> now<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.380> really

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
do it when I'm thinking too now a really

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.280 
do it when I'm thinking too now a really
good<00:04:49.190> tip<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.610> if<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:50.450> can't<00:04:50.660> catch<00:04:50.900> every<00:04:51.170> one

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
good tip is if you can't catch every one

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.360 
good tip is if you can't catch every one
of<00:04:51.380> those<00:04:51.440> cords<00:04:51.800> when<00:04:51.920> you're<00:04:52.010> playing<00:04:52.190> it

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
of those cords when you're playing it

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.810 
of those cords when you're playing it
doesn't<00:04:52.580> really<00:04:52.670> matter<00:04:52.850> let's<00:04:53.450> say<00:04:57.640> if<00:04:58.640> you

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
doesn't really matter let's say if you

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.730 
doesn't really matter let's say if you
just<00:04:59.060> if<00:04:59.180> you<00:04:59.450> just<00:04:59.480> look<00:04:59.900> for<00:05:00.080> that<00:05:00.200> one<00:05:00.440> cool

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
just if you just look for that one cool

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.870 
just if you just look for that one cool
no<00:05:00.890> this<00:05:01.100> is<00:05:01.190> something<00:05:01.280> i<00:05:01.490> really<00:05:01.700> emphasize

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
no this is something i really emphasize

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.720 
no this is something i really emphasize
and<00:05:02.510> I<00:05:02.900> hear<00:05:03.110> Django<00:05:03.410> do<00:05:03.560> it<00:05:03.650> a<00:05:03.710> lot<00:05:03.860> add<00:05:04.130> a<00:05:04.190> no

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
and I hear Django do it a lot add a no

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.670 
and I hear Django do it a lot add a no
way<00:05:04.910> he<00:05:05.060> just<00:05:05.090> grabs<00:05:05.510> that<00:05:05.690> corner<00:05:06.080> and<00:05:06.380> it's

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
way he just grabs that corner and it's

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.680 
way he just grabs that corner and it's
not<00:05:06.919> necessarily<00:05:07.070> part<00:05:07.669> of<00:05:07.880> an<00:05:07.940> arpeggio<00:05:08.270> of

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
not necessarily part of an arpeggio of

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.250 
not necessarily part of an arpeggio of
that<00:05:09.590> f7<00:05:09.980> flat<00:05:10.160> 9<00:05:10.370> but<00:05:10.640> being<00:05:11.510> aware<00:05:11.810> of<00:05:11.870> those

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
that f7 flat 9 but being aware of those

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.830 
that f7 flat 9 but being aware of those
really<00:05:12.620> cool<00:05:12.890> dokes<00:05:13.160> like<00:05:13.430> that<00:05:13.640> one<00:05:13.820> is<00:05:14.780> easy

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
really cool dokes like that one is easy

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.659 
really cool dokes like that one is easy
because<00:05:15.290> you<00:05:15.560> can<00:05:15.710> just<00:05:15.740> look<00:05:15.980> at<00:05:16.100> it<00:05:16.250> from<00:05:16.400> B

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
because you can just look at it from B

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:23.080 
because you can just look at it from B
flat<00:05:19.060> and<00:05:20.060> you<00:05:20.630> can<00:05:20.840> just<00:05:21.020> say<00:05:21.669> well<00:05:22.669> in<00:05:22.940> the

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
flat and you can just say well in the

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.850 
flat and you can just say well in the
shape<00:05:23.330> we've<00:05:23.570> got<00:05:23.690> this<00:05:23.780> note<00:05:23.960> here<00:05:24.260> if<00:05:24.530> we're

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
shape we've got this note here if we're

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.290 
shape we've got this note here if we're
coming<00:05:24.979> back<00:05:25.250> to<00:05:25.460> a<00:05:25.490> b-flat<00:05:25.820> have<00:05:26.750> this<00:05:26.960> one

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
coming back to a b-flat have this one

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.090 
coming back to a b-flat have this one
etc<00:05:29.300> you<00:05:29.690> can<00:05:29.720> really<00:05:30.169> break<00:05:30.470> it<00:05:30.530> down<00:05:30.680> just

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
etc you can really break it down just

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.400 
etc you can really break it down just
from<00:05:31.220> a<00:05:31.310> major<00:05:31.729> scale<00:05:32.030> but<00:05:32.690> that's<00:05:33.229> all<00:05:33.380> I

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
from a major scale but that's all I

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.260 
from a major scale but that's all I
really<00:05:33.530> have<00:05:33.680> time<00:05:34.010> for<00:05:34.220> today<00:05:34.370> so<00:05:34.550> just<00:05:34.850> to

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
really have time for today so just to

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.510 
really have time for today so just to
emphasize<00:05:35.900> that<00:05:36.169> again<00:05:36.620> practice<00:05:37.490> your

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
emphasize that again practice your

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.880 
emphasize that again practice your
arpeggios<00:05:37.970> outlining<00:05:38.690> our<00:05:38.960> outline<00:05:39.770> your

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
arpeggios outlining our outline your

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.880 
arpeggios outlining our outline your
arpeggios<00:05:40.130> said<00:05:40.580> that<00:05:40.700> backwards<00:05:44.350> and<00:05:45.350> then

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
arpeggios said that backwards and then

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.159 
arpeggios said that backwards and then
make<00:05:46.610> little<00:05:47.090> alterations<00:05:47.630> to<00:05:47.720> orbit<00:05:48.050> day<00:05:48.140> and

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
make little alterations to orbit day and

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.860 
make little alterations to orbit day and
you<00:05:48.380> can<00:05:48.500> get<00:05:48.620> some<00:05:48.710> really<00:05:48.830> cool<00:05:49.040> sounds

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:00.290 

so<00:05:54.870> yeah<00:05:58.250> yeah<00:05:59.250> I<00:05:59.280> really<00:05:59.580> can't<00:05:59.850> do<00:06:00.000> this<00:06:00.120> one

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
so yeah yeah I really can't do this one

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.880 
so yeah yeah I really can't do this one
I<00:06:00.330> think<00:06:00.810> we<00:06:00.900> need<00:06:01.110> on<00:06:01.230> a<00:06:01.260> video<00:06:01.470> if<00:06:01.680> I<00:06:01.740> got

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
I think we need on a video if I got

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.840 
I think we need on a video if I got
something<00:06:02.070> else<00:06:02.100> they're<00:06:02.340> watching<00:06:02.730> it's
