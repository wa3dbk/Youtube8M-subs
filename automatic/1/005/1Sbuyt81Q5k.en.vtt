00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
of what I'm thinking I've just gotten

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.910 
of what I'm thinking I've just gotten
better<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:17.940> being<00:01:18.710> able<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> stay<00:01:19.890> awake

just<00:01:27.240> uh<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.899> also<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:29.100> focused<00:01:29.550> this

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
just uh and also I really focused this

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.790 
just uh and also I really focused this
past<00:01:30.270> week<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.780> adjusting<00:01:31.289> my<00:01:31.440> sleep<00:01:31.679> schedule

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
past week on adjusting my sleep schedule

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.410 
past week on adjusting my sleep schedule
which<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.670> something<00:01:32.819> I<00:01:33.030> didn't<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.300> before

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
which is something I didn't do before

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.510 
which is something I didn't do before
where<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.530> guess<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.979> past<00:01:35.190> two<00:01:35.369> weeks

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
worked on my hiking something i didn't i

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.750 
worked on my hiking something i didn't i
think<00:05:42.630> was<00:05:43.050> a<00:05:43.080> really<00:05:43.350> weak<00:05:43.530> point<00:05:43.860> for<00:05:43.920> me<00:05:44.070> the

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
think was a really weak point for me the

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.980 
think was a really weak point for me the
first<00:05:44.940> Jerry<00:05:45.150> an<00:05:45.300> LED<00:05:45.450> though<00:05:45.570> and<00:05:45.690> I<00:05:45.720> think<00:05:45.780> I

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
first Jerry an LED though and I think I

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.940 
first Jerry an LED though and I think I
had<00:05:46.110> this<00:05:46.200> time<00:05:46.380> with<00:05:46.500> a<00:05:46.530> head<00:05:46.620> to<00:05:46.710> run<00:05:46.800> all<00:05:46.890> the

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
had this time with a head to run all the

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.040 
had this time with a head to run all the
way<00:05:46.980> up<00:05:47.100> hope<00:05:47.250> ass<00:05:47.460> on<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.180> way<00:05:48.300> out<00:05:48.330> I<00:05:48.480> ran<00:05:48.780> a

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
way up hope ass on the way out I ran a

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.350 
way up hope ass on the way out I ran a
lot<00:05:49.290> of<00:05:49.500> Hope<00:05:49.920> past<00:05:50.160> and<00:05:50.460> I<00:05:50.520> definitely<00:05:50.940> like

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
lot of Hope past and I definitely like

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.420 
lot of Hope past and I definitely like
bomb<00:05:51.630> down<00:05:51.930> power<00:05:52.230> lines<00:05:52.350> which<00:05:53.280> I<00:05:53.370> don't

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
bomb down power lines which I don't

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.160 
bomb down power lines which I don't
think<00:05:53.760> was<00:05:54.360> good<00:05:54.510> for<00:05:54.660> me<00:05:54.720> um<00:05:55.590> so<00:05:56.550> I<00:05:57.060> think<00:05:57.960> I've
