have a beard but he doesn't quite look

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.910 
have a beard but he doesn't quite look
like<00:00:56.270> this<00:00:56.540> this<00:00:56.600> was<00:00:56.930> kind<00:00:57.110> of<00:00:57.200> his<00:00:57.380> all-out

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
like this this was kind of his all-out

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.240 
like this this was kind of his all-out
war<00:00:58.640> sort<00:00:59.239> of<00:00:59.390> look<00:00:59.690> just<00:01:00.020> before<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:01.040> time

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
war sort of look just before the time

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.070 
war sort of look just before the time
skip<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:01.760> all<00:01:01.850> that<00:01:02.360> kind<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.540> stuff<00:01:02.600> happened

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
skip and all that kind of stuff happened

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.900 
skip and all that kind of stuff happened
so<00:01:03.680> this<00:01:03.860> is<00:01:03.890> really<00:01:04.160> cool<00:01:04.400> because<00:01:04.520> this<00:01:04.759> is

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
so this is really cool because this is

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.609 
so this is really cool because this is
kind<00:01:05.089> of<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.210> way<00:01:05.360> I<00:01:05.390> tend<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:05.990> think<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.350> Rick

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
kind of the way I tend to think of Rick

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.160 
kind of the way I tend to think of Rick
at<00:01:06.800> least<00:01:07.009> still<00:01:07.490> up<00:01:08.000> until<00:01:08.450> maybe<00:01:08.660> a<00:01:08.840> few<00:01:08.990> more

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
at least still up until maybe a few more

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.960 
at least still up until maybe a few more
issues<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:09.740> we<00:01:10.009> get<00:01:10.160> used<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.550> seeing<00:01:10.729> him

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
issues and we get used to seeing him

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.390 
issues and we get used to seeing him
with<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.240> shaved<00:01:11.450> head<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:11.690> all<00:01:11.869> that<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:12.770> in

one<00:01:51.530> because<00:01:51.740> most<00:01:52.100> of<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.310> time<00:01:52.490> in<00:01:52.670> the

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
one because most of the time in the

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.279 
one because most of the time in the
comic<00:01:52.940> book<00:01:53.060> series<00:01:53.209> from<00:01:53.660> right<00:01:53.840> off<00:01:53.959> the<00:01:54.110> bat

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
comic book series from right off the bat

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.680 
comic book series from right off the bat
almost<00:01:54.470> after<00:01:55.459> a<00:01:55.490> couple<00:01:55.610> trades<00:01:56.000> he<00:01:56.390> starts

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
almost after a couple trades he starts

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.919 
almost after a couple trades he starts
looking<00:01:56.959> like<00:01:56.990> this<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:57.860> this<00:01:58.039> is<00:01:58.190> really<00:01:58.369> cool

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
looking like this so this is really cool

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.300 
looking like this so this is really cool
so<00:01:59.929> I<00:01:59.959> was<00:02:00.259> pretty<00:02:00.440> excited<00:02:00.590> for<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:00.979> figure

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
so I was pretty excited for the figure

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.590 
so I was pretty excited for the figure
and<00:02:01.550> I'll<00:02:01.880> say<00:02:02.119> that<00:02:02.149> I'm<00:02:02.660> not<00:02:02.929> disappointed

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
and I'll say that I'm not disappointed

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.490 
and I'll say that I'm not disappointed
but<00:02:05.600> there<00:02:05.750> are<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.899> few<00:02:05.959> things<00:02:06.229> here<00:02:06.470> and

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
but there are a few things here and

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.960 
but there are a few things here and
there<00:02:06.649> mine<00:02:07.009> you<00:02:07.250> probably<00:02:07.520> can't<00:02:07.700> see<00:02:07.759> it<00:02:07.910> on

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
there mine you probably can't see it on

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.910 
there mine you probably can't see it on
my<00:02:08.030> camera<00:02:08.360> because<00:02:08.660> it's<00:02:08.840> not<00:02:08.959> that<00:02:09.020> good<00:02:09.590> but

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
my camera because it's not that good but

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.460 
my camera because it's not that good but
mine<00:02:10.610> has<00:02:10.819> a<00:02:10.850> paint<00:02:11.240> imperfection<00:02:12.080> where<00:02:12.290> they

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
mine has a paint imperfection where they

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.980 
mine has a paint imperfection where they
painted<00:02:12.890> his<00:02:13.240> let's<00:02:14.240> see<00:02:14.390> if<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.569> can<00:02:14.599> see

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
painted his let's see if you can see

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.870 
painted his let's see if you can see
they<00:02:15.770> painted<00:02:16.190> his<00:02:16.340> mustache<00:02:16.940> down<00:02:17.870> into<00:02:18.500> his

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
they painted his mustache down into his

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.699 
they painted his mustache down into his
you<00:02:19.880> know<00:02:19.910> his<00:02:20.000> upper<00:02:20.450> lip<00:02:20.690> right<00:02:20.930> here<00:02:20.990> so

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
you know his upper lip right here so

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.100 
you know his upper lip right here so
he's<00:02:22.520> got<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:22.880> black<00:02:23.150> splotch<00:02:23.630> right<00:02:23.930> there

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
he's got this black splotch right there

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.720 
he's got this black splotch right there
you<00:02:24.230> probably<00:02:24.470> can't<00:02:24.770> see<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.069> on<00:02:25.160> my<00:02:25.220> camera

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
you probably can't see it on my camera

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.309 
you probably can't see it on my camera
yeah<00:02:26.270> I<00:02:26.330> don't<00:02:26.510> think<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.840> can<00:02:27.020> because<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
yeah I don't think you can because the

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.190 
yeah I don't think you can because the
quality<00:02:27.590> but<00:02:28.150> yeah<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:29.569> does<00:02:29.780> bother<00:02:30.020> me

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
quality but yeah so that does bother me

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.380 
quality but yeah so that does bother me
quite<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.560> bit<00:02:30.730> let's<00:02:31.730> just<00:02:31.790> see<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.180> get<00:02:32.270> my

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
quite a bit let's just see and get my

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.830 
quite a bit let's just see and get my
focus<00:02:32.599> here<00:02:32.959> yeah<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:33.830> there's<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.840> aside

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
focus here yeah so there's that aside

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.910 
focus here yeah so there's that aside
from<00:02:35.959> that<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.260> blood<00:02:36.470> splatter<00:02:36.680> on<00:02:36.830> the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
from that the blood splatter on the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.380 
from that the blood splatter on the
shirt<00:02:37.130> looks<00:02:37.340> really<00:02:37.730> really<00:02:37.970> good<00:02:38.000> as<00:02:38.299> you

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
shirt looks really really good as you

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.839 
shirt looks really really good as you
can<00:02:38.510> see<00:02:38.750> they<00:02:39.680> did<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:40.099> great<00:02:40.310> job<00:02:40.430> with<00:02:40.670> the

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
can see they did a great job with the

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.580 
can see they did a great job with the
detail<00:02:41.180> on<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.780> does<00:02:41.930> look<00:02:42.170> clean<00:02:42.290> it

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
detail on that it does look clean it

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.880 
detail on that it does look clean it
does

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
does

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.460 
does
good<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:44.510> detail<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.960> muscles<00:02:45.380> and

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
stuff is pretty cool too like it looks

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.820 
stuff is pretty cool too like it looks
pretty<00:02:47.090> defined<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.810> everything<00:02:48.140> like<00:02:48.620> he's

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
pretty defined and everything like he's

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.930 
pretty defined and everything like he's
been<00:02:48.980> starving<00:02:49.370> for<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.550> while<00:02:49.700> from<00:02:49.880> the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
been starving for a while from the

been starving for a while from the
zombie<00:02:50.300> apocalypse<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.500> pants<00:02:52.220> do<00:02:52.430> have

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.270 
holder for his gun here which you'll
probably<00:02:57.080> have<00:02:57.470> him<00:02:57.560> using<00:02:57.950> because<00:02:58.100> I<00:02:58.160> don't

probably have him using because I don't

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.460 
probably have him using because I don't
know<00:02:58.370> if<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.520> can<00:02:58.670> tell<00:02:58.819> from<00:02:58.880> here<00:02:59.330> but<00:02:59.470> with

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
know if you can tell from here but with

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.680

the gun his trigger finger he cannot
hold<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:03.290> he<00:03:03.530> can't<00:03:03.800> do<00:03:04.070> he<00:03:04.670> can't<00:03:04.910> do<00:03:05.060> this

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
hold it so he can't do he can't do this

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.910 
hold it so he can't do he can't do this
with<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.450> gun<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:05.810> put<00:03:05.990> it<00:03:06.110> through<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.500> hole

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
with a gun and put it through the hole

all<00:03:07.490> he<00:03:07.820> can<00:03:08.000> do<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.180> kind<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.660> hold<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:09.050> in<00:03:09.230> his

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
hand it does not fit properly so that

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.470 
hand it does not fit properly so that
does<00:03:13.190> kind<00:03:13.520> of<00:03:13.610> bother<00:03:13.819> me<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.090> little<00:03:14.300> bit

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
does kind of bother me a little bit

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.510 
does kind of bother me a little bit
since<00:03:14.840> this<00:03:15.050> you<00:03:15.560> know<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.800> detail<00:03:16.100> on<00:03:16.370> the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
since this you know the detail on the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.820 
since this you know the detail on the
gun<00:03:16.670> is<00:03:16.880> is<00:03:17.120> really<00:03:17.780> good<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.260> does<00:03:18.410> look<00:03:18.650> good

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
gun is is really good it does look good

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.560 
gun is is really good it does look good
and<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.220> Python<00:03:19.610> you<00:03:19.940> know<00:03:20.060> this<00:03:20.330> is<00:03:20.450> probably

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
and the Python you know this is probably

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.940 
and the Python you know this is probably
one<00:03:20.810> of<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:20.959> better<00:03:21.080> sculpted<00:03:21.560> pythons

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
one of the better sculpted pythons

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.880 
one of the better sculpted pythons
they've<00:03:22.160> released<00:03:22.310> for<00:03:22.640> Rick<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:23.769> for<00:03:24.769> me

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
they've released for Rick so for me

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.350 
they've released for Rick so for me
personally<00:03:24.920> it's<00:03:25.640> just<00:03:25.820> going<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.000> end<00:03:26.090> up<00:03:26.209> in

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
personally it's just going to end up in

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.540 
personally it's just going to end up in
the<00:03:26.480> sheath<00:03:26.690> basically<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:28.400> know<00:03:28.519> I

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
the sheath basically and you know I

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.400 
the sheath basically and you know I
don't<00:03:29.060> know<00:03:29.120> if<00:03:29.239> it's<00:03:29.420> okay<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.810> guess<00:03:30.110> it

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
don't know if it's okay I guess it

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.160 
don't know if it's okay I guess it
doesn't<00:03:30.709> look<00:03:30.800> that<00:03:30.860> great<00:03:31.280> with<00:03:31.550> it<00:03:31.730> but<00:03:32.420> you

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
doesn't look that great with it but you

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.600 
doesn't look that great with it but you
know<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.410> sticks<00:03:33.650> out<00:03:33.769> of<00:03:33.890> at<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.130> top<00:03:34.370> but

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
know it sticks out of at the top but

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.120 
know it sticks out of at the top but
whatever<00:03:34.970> i<00:03:35.209> guess<00:03:36.019> it<00:03:36.170> fits<00:03:36.380> decently<00:03:36.950> enough

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
whatever i guess it fits decently enough

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.199 
whatever i guess it fits decently enough
he<00:03:38.060> also<00:03:38.090> has<00:03:38.540> his<00:03:39.250> axe<00:03:40.250> which<00:03:40.820> has<00:03:41.000> pretty

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.440 
kind of
like<00:04:54.160> if<00:04:54.280> he's<00:04:54.430> going<00:04:54.640> to<00:04:54.760> war<00:04:55.030> or<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.300> type

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
like if he's going to war or that type

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.210 
like if he's going to war or that type
of<00:04:55.510> thing<00:04:55.720> so<00:04:56.350> have<00:04:56.740> played<00:04:56.950> with<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:57.190> bit

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
of thing so have played with it a bit

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.580 
of thing so have played with it a bit
but<00:04:57.370> yeah<00:04:57.730> it's<00:04:57.880> not<00:04:58.000> too<00:04:58.030> bad<00:04:58.180> so<00:04:58.930> all<00:04:59.260> around

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
but yeah it's not too bad so all around

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.340 
but yeah it's not too bad so all around
yeah<00:04:59.980> I<00:05:00.010> am<00:05:00.340> pretty<00:05:01.030> happy<00:05:01.210> with<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:01.630> figure<00:05:02.110> I

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
yeah I am pretty happy with the figure I

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.510 
yeah I am pretty happy with the figure I
guess<00:05:02.500> I<00:05:02.620> should<00:05:02.800> go<00:05:02.890> over<00:05:03.100> his<00:05:03.190> articulation

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
guess I should go over his articulation

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.130 
guess I should go over his articulation
because<00:05:04.000> it<00:05:04.060> is<00:05:04.150> a<00:05:04.180> bit<00:05:04.480> different<00:05:04.720> from<00:05:04.960> the

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
because it is a bit different from the

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.740 
because it is a bit different from the
earlier<00:05:05.170> ones<00:05:05.650> they've<00:05:06.610> added<00:05:07.030> in<00:05:07.180> this<00:05:07.420> part

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
earlier ones they've added in this part

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.380 
earlier ones they've added in this part
here<00:05:08.050> as<00:05:08.320> like<00:05:08.530> a<00:05:08.590> tea<00:05:09.490> at<00:05:09.670> the<00:05:09.700> top<00:05:09.970> I<00:05:10.210> guess

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
here as like a tea at the top I guess

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.270 
here as like a tea at the top I guess
where<00:05:11.110> you<00:05:11.320> know<00:05:11.440> they<00:05:11.560> can<00:05:11.590> do<00:05:11.830> like<00:05:11.980> a<00:05:12.040> full

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
where you know they can do like a full

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.720 
where you know they can do like a full
splits<00:05:13.860> still<00:05:14.860> have<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:15.100> ratchet<00:05:15.400> joint<00:05:15.580> at

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
splits still have the ratchet joint at

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.020 
splits still have the ratchet joint at
the<00:05:15.760> knee<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.690> foot<00:05:17.290> actually<00:05:17.860> a<00:05:18.070> little<00:05:18.730> bit

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
the knee the foot actually a little bit

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.490 
the knee the foot actually a little bit
a<00:05:19.210> little<00:05:19.240> bit<00:05:19.420> of<00:05:19.570> movement<00:05:19.720> there<00:05:20.020> left<00:05:20.290> and

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
a little bit of movement there left and

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.120 
a little bit of movement there left and
right<00:05:20.800> no<00:05:21.640> pivot<00:05:22.030> no<00:05:22.840> rocker<00:05:23.080> so<00:05:23.620> there<00:05:23.920> isn't

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
right no pivot no rocker so there isn't

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.800 
right no pivot no rocker so there isn't
that<00:05:24.310> now<00:05:24.550> one<00:05:24.730> problem<00:05:25.000> about<00:05:25.210> this<00:05:25.420> too<00:05:25.630> is

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
that now one problem about this too is

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.620 
that now one problem about this too is
that<00:05:25.930> he<00:05:26.050> can't<00:05:26.350> bend<00:05:27.160> his<00:05:27.490> his<00:05:27.910> waist<00:05:28.270> or<00:05:28.510> he

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
that he can't bend his his waist or he

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.540 
that he can't bend his his waist or he
can't<00:05:28.870> turn<00:05:29.260> his<00:05:29.320> waster<00:05:29.920> his<00:05:30.010> torso<00:05:30.280> or

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
can't turn his waster his torso or

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.920 
can't turn his waster his torso or
anything<00:05:30.970> because<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.360> sculpting<00:05:31.780> of<00:05:31.780> the

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
anything because the sculpting of the

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.160 
anything because the sculpting of the
shirt<00:05:32.170> he<00:05:32.770> can't<00:05:33.070> he<00:05:33.310> can't<00:05:33.340> twist<00:05:33.880> so<00:05:34.870> that

well it's not too bad and he's got the
ball<00:05:39.730> joints<00:05:40.090> at<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.240> shoulder<00:05:40.660> he's<00:05:40.810> got

basically straight on which we've seen
before<00:06:07.390> but<00:06:07.540> that's<00:06:07.660> also<00:06:08.020> because<00:06:08.230> the<00:06:08.440> hair

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.270 
point five out of ten I was a little bit
more<00:06:20.290> excited<00:06:20.680> for<00:06:20.860> it<00:06:20.950> it<00:06:21.100> hasn't
