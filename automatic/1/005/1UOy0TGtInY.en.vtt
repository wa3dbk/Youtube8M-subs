the first one and then what's been
happening<00:06:01.470> is<00:06:01.710> as<00:06:02.220> my<00:06:02.400> barrels<00:06:02.760> been<00:06:02.940> heating

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
happening is as my barrels been heating

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.540

up<00:06:03.390> and<00:06:03.720> I've<00:06:04.050> been<00:06:04.200> dropping<00:06:04.650> and<00:06:05.310> it

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
up and I've been dropping and it

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.940 
up and I've been dropping and it
happened<00:06:05.850> again<00:06:06.090> today<00:06:06.240> I<00:06:06.720> know<00:06:07.590> that<00:06:07.740> was<00:06:07.830> my

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
happened again today I know that was my

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.730 
happened again today I know that was my
first<00:06:08.160> one<00:06:08.520> I<00:06:08.790> suspect<00:06:09.690> that<00:06:10.020> motivating<00:06:10.650> my

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
first one I suspect that motivating my

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.490 
first one I suspect that motivating my
second<00:06:11.070> one<00:06:11.190> but<00:06:11.340> I'm<00:06:11.430> not<00:06:11.460> sure<00:06:15.380> when<00:06:16.380> the

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
second one but I'm not sure when the

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.790 
second one but I'm not sure when the
actual<00:06:16.620> barrel<00:06:17.100> gets<00:06:17.220> warm<00:06:17.550> so<00:06:17.970> a<00:06:18.530> cold<00:06:19.530> ball

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
actual barrel gets warm so a cold ball

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.840 
actual barrel gets warm so a cold ball
shots<00:06:20.100> gonna<00:06:20.400> be<00:06:20.640> be<00:06:21.630> pretty<00:06:21.870> tough<00:06:22.850> that's

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
shots gonna be be pretty tough that's

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.810 
shots gonna be be pretty tough that's
kind<00:06:24.180> of<00:06:24.950> probably<00:06:25.950> one<00:06:26.100> of<00:06:26.130> the<00:06:26.250> worst<00:06:26.430> groups

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
kind of probably one of the worst groups

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.960 
kind of probably one of the worst groups
I've<00:06:27.030> got<00:06:27.210> a<00:06:27.240> thousand<00:06:27.870> yards<00:06:27.990> my<00:06:28.740> best<00:06:29.040> is<00:06:29.250> is

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
I've got a thousand yards my best is is

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.820 
I've got a thousand yards my best is is
five<00:06:30.300> inches<00:06:30.890> yeah<00:06:32.240> five<00:06:33.240> in<00:06:33.540> there<00:06:33.750> that's<00:06:34.650> my

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
five inches yeah five in there that's my

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.530 
five inches yeah five in there that's my
best<00:06:35.480> but<00:06:36.480> I'm<00:06:36.630> pretty<00:06:36.870> happy<00:06:37.110> with<00:06:37.290> that<00:06:38.540> I'm

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540 
best but I'm pretty happy with that I'm

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.290 
best but I'm pretty happy with that I'm
thinking<00:06:39.840> that<00:06:40.320> as<00:06:40.950> the<00:06:41.220> barrel<00:06:41.550> warms<00:06:41.880> up<00:06:42.090> I

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
thinking that as the barrel warms up I

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.600 
thinking that as the barrel warms up I
actually<00:06:42.419> was<00:06:42.840> dialed<00:06:43.410> in<00:06:43.560> but<00:06:44.310> when<00:06:44.430> I<00:06:44.460> do

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
actually was dialed in but when I do

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.720 
actually was dialed in but when I do
ballistics<00:06:45.300> on<00:06:45.480> my<00:06:45.630> barrels<00:06:46.020> warm<00:06:46.280> about<00:06:47.280> 12

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730 
ballistics on my barrels warm about 12

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.720 
ballistics on my barrels warm about 12
or<00:06:48.060> 10<00:06:48.300> inches<00:06:48.630> below<00:06:48.840> center<00:06:49.440> when<00:06:50.340> I<00:06:50.460> shot

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 
or 10 inches below center when I shot

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.120 
or 10 inches below center when I shot
him<00:06:50.880> cold

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
him cold

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.340 
him cold
