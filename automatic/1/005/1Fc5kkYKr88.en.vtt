00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
with background behind you and with

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.950 
with background behind you and with
Vegas<00:00:22.050> take<00:00:22.380> out<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.740> entire<00:00:23.010> background

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
Vegas take out the entire background

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.620 
Vegas take out the entire background
there's<00:00:24.960> two<00:00:25.109> ways<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:26.420> one<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.539> them

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
there's two ways to do this one of them

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.160 
there's two ways to do this one of them
works<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.529> solid<00:00:29.189> color<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:30.750> other<00:00:30.960> one

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
works for a solid color the other one

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.830 
works for a solid color the other one
works<00:00:31.349> for<00:00:31.769> basically<00:00:32.309> anything<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:33.480> easier

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
works for basically anything it's easier

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.000 
works for basically anything it's easier
to<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.260> solid<00:00:34.620> color<00:00:34.800> though

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
to do this with solid color though

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.500 
to do this with solid color though
because<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.520> only<00:00:35.670> one<00:00:35.910> click<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.390> you're

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
because it's only one click and you're

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.610 
because it's only one click and you're
done<00:00:36.829> now<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.700> called<00:00:38.879> green<00:00:39.270> screening

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
done now this is called green screening

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.840 
done now this is called green screening
to<00:00:40.620> do<00:00:40.739> green<00:00:40.950> screen<00:00:41.219> you're<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.700> need

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
see that my character is actually little

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.370 
see that my character is actually little
bit<00:03:02.890> darker<00:03:03.340> than<00:03:03.519> he<00:03:03.820> was<00:03:03.970> before<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:05.170> can<00:03:05.290> go

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
bit darker than he was before you can go

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.530 
bit darker than he was before you can go
to<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.650> event<00:03:05.769> effects<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.549> you<00:03:06.760> can<00:03:07.000> mess

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
to the event effects and you can mess

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.350 
to the event effects and you can mess
around<00:03:07.570> with<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.170> high<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.620> low<00:03:08.680> threshold

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
around with the high and low threshold

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.890 
around with the high and low threshold
like<00:03:10.360> this<00:03:11.700> see<00:03:12.700> just<00:03:12.850> a<00:03:13.090> little<00:03:13.480> bit<00:03:13.570> of<00:03:13.660> grain

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
like this see just a little bit of grain

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.090 
like this see just a little bit of grain
in<00:03:14.049> the<00:03:14.140> background<00:03:14.560> so<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.709> want<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:14.950> try<00:03:15.070> to

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
in the background so you want to try to

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.070 
in the background so you want to try to
get<00:03:15.250> rid<00:03:15.400> of<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.630> basically<00:03:16.630> going<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.900> mess

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
get rid of that basically going to mess

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.539 
get rid of that basically going to mess
with<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.350> high<00:03:17.380> threshold<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.160> T<00:03:18.310> gauge

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
with the high threshold and T gauge

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:19.949 
with the high threshold and T gauge
where<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.910> can't<00:03:19.120> see<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.390> background<00:03:19.600> but

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
where you can't see the background but

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.690 
where you can't see the background but
your<00:03:20.080> character<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.530> still<00:03:20.830> visible<00:03:21.190> for<00:03:21.640> the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
your character is still visible for the

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.850 
your character is still visible for the
most<00:03:21.850> part<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.330> then<00:03:23.110> when<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.320> play<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.650> back

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.440 

there<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:28.950> go<00:03:29.099> you've<00:03:29.760> got<00:03:29.940> your<00:03:30.090> character

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
there you go you've got your character

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.710 
there you go you've got your character
only<00:03:30.659> no<00:03:30.870> more<00:03:31.019> background<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:32.599> that<00:03:33.599> is

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
only no more background and that is

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.190 
only no more background and that is
called<00:03:33.930> once<00:03:34.319> again<00:03:34.730> green<00:03:35.730> screen<00:03:35.909> or<00:03:36.330> chroma

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
called once again green screen or chroma

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.190 
called once again green screen or chroma
keyer<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:38.849> other<00:03:39.030> way<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.299> can<00:03:39.510> do<00:03:39.659> this<00:03:39.870> is

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
keyer the other way you can do this is

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.280 
keyer the other way you can do this is
by<00:03:40.680> masking<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:42.299> do<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.599> basically<00:03:43.080> what

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
by masking and to do that basically what

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.500 
by masking and to do that basically what
you<00:03:43.440> would<00:03:43.560> do<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:44.099> let<00:03:44.760> me<00:03:44.849> remove<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.299> chroma

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
you would do is let me remove the chroma

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.250 
you would do is let me remove the chroma
keyer<00:03:47.480> basically<00:03:48.480> what<00:03:48.629> you<00:03:48.780> would<00:03:48.870> do<00:03:49.049> is<00:03:49.230> you

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
keyer basically what you would do is you

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.130 
keyer basically what you would do is you
would<00:03:49.379> go<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.830> event<00:03:49.920> pan/crop<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:51.140> you

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
would go to the event pan/crop and you

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.280 
would go to the event pan/crop and you
have<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.440> check<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.280> mask<00:03:53.640> button<00:03:54.200> masking<00:03:55.200> is

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
have to check the mask button masking is

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.280 
have to check the mask button masking is
