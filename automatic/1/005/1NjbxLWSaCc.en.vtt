from being straight the focus today was

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.150 
from being straight the focus today was
to<00:00:20.570> get<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> suspension<00:00:22.080> mocked<00:00:22.500> up<00:00:22.680> which<00:00:23.010> we

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
to get the suspension mocked up which we

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.390 
to get the suspension mocked up which we
chose<00:00:23.369> an<00:00:23.580> air<00:00:23.699> ride<00:00:24.529> it's<00:00:25.529> an<00:00:25.680> easy<00:00:25.859> install

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
chose an air ride it's an easy install

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700 
chose an air ride it's an easy install
it's<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.910> pretty<00:00:27.510> simplistic<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.439> don't<00:00:28.590> have

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
it's a pretty simplistic we don't have

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.169 
it's a pretty simplistic we don't have
to<00:00:28.830> weld<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.550> anything

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
to weld or do anything

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.790 
to weld or do anything
the<00:00:30.359> original<00:00:30.660> suspension<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> car<00:00:31.470> was

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
the original suspension on the car was

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.150 
the original suspension on the car was
coil<00:00:32.460> springs<00:00:32.820> front<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.270> back<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.160> we

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
coil springs front and back and we

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.100 
coil springs front and back and we
decided<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.610> go<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:35.760> an<00:00:35.940> air<00:00:36.090> ride<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.960> get<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
decided to go with an air ride to get a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.200 
decided to go with an air ride to get a
much<00:00:37.290> smoother<00:00:37.739> ride<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.250> much<00:00:38.430> nicer<00:00:38.940> ride

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
much smoother ride of a much nicer ride

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.690 
much smoother ride of a much nicer ride
and<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.290> gives<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.559> lot<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.739> adjustability<00:00:41.129> to

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and it gives a lot of adjustability to

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.430 
and it gives a lot of adjustability to
set<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> right<00:00:42.660> heights<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.170> we're<00:00:43.320> looking

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
set the right heights that we're looking

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
set the right heights that we're looking
for<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.100> then<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.789> kind<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.000> cool<00:00:45.210> when<00:00:45.360> you

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
for and then it's kind of cool when you

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.209 
for and then it's kind of cool when you
pull<00:00:45.780> up<00:00:45.809> somewhere<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.620> air<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:46.920> all<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
pull up somewhere and you air it all the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.549 
pull up somewhere and you air it all the
way<00:00:47.309> down<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.840> this<00:00:48.840> car<00:00:49.079> will<00:00:49.230> go<00:00:49.260> pretty

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
way down and this car will go pretty

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.959 
way down and this car will go pretty
close<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.010> sitting<00:00:50.309> on<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> ground<00:00:50.730> there's<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
close to sitting on the ground there's a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.810 
close to sitting on the ground there's a
lot<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.180> travel<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.930> air<00:00:52.079> ride<00:00:52.230> kit<00:00:52.820> these

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
lot of travel in this air ride kit these

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.240

bags slam the impala up or down a good 6
inches<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.030> yeah<00:00:57.570> there's<00:00:58.020> some<00:00:58.199> stress

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
inches so yeah there's some stress

progress in all honesty I think we're
behind<00:02:16.430> on<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.150> build<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.690> I'm<00:02:19.000> not<00:02:20.000> nervous

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
behind on the build so I'm not nervous

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.320 
behind on the build so I'm not nervous
at<00:02:20.630> this<00:02:20.900> time<00:02:21.200> but<00:02:21.440> I'm<00:02:21.590> getting<00:02:22.040> there

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
at this time but I'm getting there

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.850 
at this time but I'm getting there
there's<00:02:23.330> been<00:02:23.390> some<00:02:23.780> delays<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.380> think<00:02:24.620> on<00:02:24.770> the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
there's been some delays I think on the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.160 
there's been some delays I think on the
motor<00:02:25.100> I<00:02:25.220> think<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:25.550> motors<00:02:25.850> two<00:02:26.060> weeks<00:02:26.270> out<00:02:26.510> I

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
motor I think the motors two weeks out I

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.470 
motor I think the motors two weeks out I
don't<00:02:28.130> believe<00:02:28.310> we<00:02:28.460> have<00:02:28.490> brakes<00:02:28.910> yet<00:02:29.240> and

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
don't believe we have brakes yet and

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.270 
don't believe we have brakes yet and
this<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.840> all<00:02:29.990> imperative<00:02:30.530> for<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:30.800> mock-up

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
this is all imperative for the mock-up

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.960 
this is all imperative for the mock-up
so<00:02:31.990> I'm<00:02:32.990> getting<00:02:33.170> nervous<00:02:33.610> we're<00:02:34.610> starting<00:02:34.880> to

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
so I'm getting nervous we're starting to

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.180 
so I'm getting nervous we're starting to
see<00:02:35.030> some<00:02:35.120> progress<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:36.380> body's<00:02:36.710> been<00:02:36.950> dipped

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190
