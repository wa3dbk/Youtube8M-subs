metro and it means in the metro you

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.220 
metro and it means in the metro you
can't<00:03:11.340> get<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.670> kills<00:03:11.910> outside<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.660> seems<00:03:12.930> and

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.660 
and there is the f2000 unlocked and
let's<00:04:10.500> go<00:04:10.740> and<00:04:10.920> try<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.190> out<00:04:12.740> so<00:04:13.740> the<00:04:13.920> f2000<00:04:14.640> is

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
let's go and try it out so the f2000 is

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.520 
let's go and try it out so the f2000 is
pretty<00:04:14.940> unique<00:04:15.300> in<00:04:15.510> terms<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:16.019> loadout

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630

you can do this on these days and if you

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
could be that sneaky why would you do it

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.970 
could be that sneaky why would you do it
as<00:05:44.700> an<00:05:44.790> assault<00:05:45.120> surely<00:05:46.050> develop<00:05:46.560> toon<00:05:46.740> is<00:05:46.860> a

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
or anything other than assault really so

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.750 
or anything other than assault really so
it's<00:05:54.410> quite<00:05:54.590> effective<00:05:54.740> at<00:05:55.130> dropping<00:05:55.400> people

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
it's quite effective at dropping people

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.650 
it's quite effective at dropping people
it<00:05:56.240> just<00:05:56.540> feels<00:05:56.900> a<00:05:57.140> bit<00:05:57.170> strange<00:05:58.160> and<00:05:58.730> I<00:05:59.600> don't

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
it just feels a bit strange and I don't

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.470 
it just feels a bit strange and I don't
know<00:05:59.990> why<00:06:00.200> I<00:06:00.530> think<00:06:01.340> it's<00:06:01.670> probably<00:06:02.180> because

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
know why I think it's probably because

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.480 
know why I think it's probably because
it's<00:06:02.720> a<00:06:02.840> bit<00:06:02.990> different<00:06:03.620> to<00:06:03.860> all<00:06:04.160> the<00:06:04.220> other

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
it's a bit different to all the other

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.270 
it's a bit different to all the other
assault<00:06:04.970> rifles<00:06:05.620> from<00:06:06.620> the<00:06:06.770> previous

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
assault rifles from the previous

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.480 
assault rifles from the previous
expansions<00:06:08.740> it<00:06:09.740> seems<00:06:10.340> to<00:06:10.790> be<00:06:11.410> low<00:06:12.410> recoil<00:06:12.710> but

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
expansions it seems to be low recoil but

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.220 
expansions it seems to be low recoil but
also<00:06:13.670> low<00:06:14.300> accuracy<00:06:15.020> and<00:06:16.990> it's<00:06:17.990> an

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
also low accuracy and it's an

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:24.220 
also low accuracy and it's an
interesting<00:06:19.160> combination<00:06:22.720> so<00:06:23.720> let's<00:06:23.870> recap

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
interesting combination so let's recap

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.590 
interesting combination so let's recap
on<00:06:24.410> the<00:06:24.560> assignment<00:06:25.130> so<00:06:25.610> for<00:06:25.850> express<00:06:26.240> train

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
on the assignment so for express train

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.840 
on the assignment so for express train
you<00:06:26.870> need<00:06:27.050> one<00:06:27.290> assault<00:06:27.650> rifle<00:06:28.190> ribbit<00:06:28.550> which

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850 
you need one assault rifle ribbit which

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.630 
you need one assault rifle ribbit which
you<00:06:28.970> can<00:06:29.090> get<00:06:29.270> in<00:06:29.510> any<00:06:29.660> round<00:06:30.040> you<00:06:31.040> need<00:06:31.250> to

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
you can get in any round you need to

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.880 
you can get in any round you need to
kill<00:06:32.120> assist<00:06:32.240> ribbons<00:06:32.810> which<00:06:33.170> must<00:06:33.530> come<00:06:33.740> from

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:33.890 
kill assist ribbons which must come from

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.340 
kill assist ribbons which must come from
the<00:06:34.070> same<00:06:34.310> round<00:06:34.610> and<00:06:35.420> you<00:06:35.630> need<00:06:35.780> to<00:06:35.870> get<00:06:36.020> 10

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
the same round and you need to get 10

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.920 
the same round and you need to get 10
kills<00:06:36.650> inside<00:06:37.340> of<00:06:37.550> metro<00:06:38.030> now<00:06:38.600> I<00:06:38.630> have<00:06:38.900> a

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
kills inside of metro now I have a

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.960 
kills inside of metro now I have a
feeling<00:06:39.470> that<00:06:39.620> these<00:06:39.800> kills<00:06:40.160> must<00:06:40.550> be<00:06:40.700> inside

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
feeling that these kills must be inside

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.960 
feeling that these kills must be inside
the<00:06:41.180> station<00:06:41.720> or<00:06:41.840> inside<00:06:42.740> the<00:06:42.770> metro<00:06:43.340> itself

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.880 
the station or inside the metro itself
I<00:06:44.000> played<00:06:44.480> several<00:06:44.960> rounds<00:06:45.290> of<00:06:45.380> metro<00:06:45.830> to

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:45.890 
I played several rounds of metro to

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.450 
I played several rounds of metro to
unlock<00:06:46.430> this<00:06:46.730> and<00:06:47.260> the<00:06:48.260> kills<00:06:48.830> that<00:06:49.340> the

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
unlock this and the kills that the

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.370 
unlock this and the kills that the
assignment<00:06:50.090> said<00:06:50.300> always<00:06:50.630> seem<00:06:51.080> to<00:06:51.110> be

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
assignment said always seem to be

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.410 
assignment said always seem to be
slightly<00:06:51.590> lower<00:06:52.070> than<00:06:52.400> the<00:06:52.580> kills<00:06:53.060> at<00:06:53.330> the

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:53.420 
slightly lower than the kills at the

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.660 
slightly lower than the kills at the
scoreboard<00:06:53.750> said<00:06:54.320> and<00:06:55.010> I<00:06:55.130> think<00:06:55.460> that's

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670 
scoreboard said and I think that's

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.200 
scoreboard said and I think that's
because<00:06:55.910> they<00:06:56.300> have<00:06:56.570> to<00:06:56.810> be<00:06:57.020> inside<00:06:58.090> so<00:06:59.090> that's

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210 
because they have to be inside so that's

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.800 
because they have to be inside so that's
it<00:06:59.480> how<00:06:59.780> this<00:07:00.080> lets<00:07:00.470> you<00:07:00.740> unlock<00:07:01.100> the<00:07:01.720> f2000<00:07:02.720> a

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
it how this lets you unlock the f2000 a

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.500 
it how this lets you unlock the f2000 a
little<00:07:03.050> easier<00:07:03.350> and<00:07:03.610> it<00:07:04.610> is<00:07:05.090> going<00:07:05.240> to<00:07:05.360> be<00:07:05.480> a

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:05.510 
little easier and it is going to be a

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.960 
little easier and it is going to be a
bit<00:07:05.720> of<00:07:05.840> a<00:07:05.930> grind<00:07:06.230> because<00:07:06.620> it's<00:07:07.130> metro<00:07:07.730> and

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:07.970 
bit of a grind because it's metro and

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.720 
bit of a grind because it's metro and
metro<00:07:08.480> is<00:07:08.630> a<00:07:08.660> grind<00:07:08.990> but<00:07:09.290> it's<00:07:09.800> not<00:07:10.220> that<00:07:10.460> hard

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:10.730 
metro is a grind but it's not that hard

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.890 
metro is a grind but it's not that hard
