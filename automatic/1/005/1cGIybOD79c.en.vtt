00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.350
 but 9 and they very complicated piece 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.280
 I always find this compares to the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.280
 asked for ahlers 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.559
 here 2 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.049
 it all easier this is real 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.890
 complicated work to which note i were 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.310
 way 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.560
 work where I am very erratic but like me 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.140
 once in your system then is 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.470
 the most fantastic music further there 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.470
 exists 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.200
 No 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.620
 is a bit known as his 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.190
 kind of farewell greeting 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.290
 placing part is a long slow 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.600
 part and he has one himself 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.610
 number are credited from goodbye 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.500
 to the world and 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.650
 kind of farewell symphony and it is 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.680
 really so it's the end of romance 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:51.080
 they are also very much it 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.480
 sounds that those that anyway with 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.360
 hers are true to the one 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.180
 little project and then music consists of 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.820
 lots of layers 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.290
 you have to listen incredibly through it 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.290
 there is fantastic 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:36.140
 especially the position is tricky because there 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.910
 also with the strings or we different 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.150
 rhythms make things happen to you 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.560
 you have to be incredibly careful that you do that 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.080
 He still can music her 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.950
 combing can play and challenge and that 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.730
 remains 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.730
 laughed every time 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.090
 bitch all natural balance 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.020
 And yes that is just a kind of perfection 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.740
 is incredible 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:20.709
 and I also think our conductor cat that 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.740
 he dares to have incredible control 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.920
 so really really very slow too 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.640
 go and rest 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.640
 really mailing 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.130
 Ah 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.320
 nice is that it is just a huge 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.060
 very long tension arc has such 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.280
 symbolic and you hope it until 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.710
 that the tension remains that it is that 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.510
 it as a whole already a piece and a half 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.060
 hour because it is not 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.110
 patchy and and now you know this one 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.240
 bit that becomes but that it 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.830
 coherent and that that's the public 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.530
 that make work that one or beautiful 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.690
 tension is in the room and that it is from 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.700
 the beginning to end is fascinating with every one 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.220
 part is actually strong in this 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.980
 family fancy home that are all 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.100
 interesting very characteristic but 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:31.030
 the last part is just so awful 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.890
 nice ends like that 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.720
 healthy way that is a total 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.720
 rest I think that's great
