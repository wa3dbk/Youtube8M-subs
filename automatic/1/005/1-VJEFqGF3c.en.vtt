two<00:00:45.629> parallel<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.770> when<00:00:47.579> he<00:00:47.610> comes<00:00:47.700> in

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
two parallel to you when he comes in

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.500 
two parallel to you when he comes in
he's<00:00:48.899> kind<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.440> pawel<00:00:49.980> wolak<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.090> bad

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
hands it's a two-handed attack so in my

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.050 
hands it's a two-handed attack so in my
opinion<00:01:01.670> he<00:01:02.670> leaves<00:01:03.000> himself<00:01:03.300> more<00:01:04.080> open<00:01:05.060> than
