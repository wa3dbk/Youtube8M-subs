was<00:04:02.140> simply<00:04:02.500> because<00:04:02.800> when<00:04:03.040> we<00:04:03.190> set<00:04:03.520> up<00:04:03.730> the

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
was simply because when we set up the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.180 
was simply because when we set up the
chest<00:04:04.239> its<00:04:04.570> case<00:04:04.900> sensitive<00:04:04.930> so<00:04:05.440> we<00:04:05.950> called

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
chest its case sensitive so we called

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.300 
chest its case sensitive so we called
all<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.459> banks<00:04:06.760> banks<00:04:07.560> but<00:04:08.560> when<00:04:08.800> Chris<00:04:09.040> made

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
all the banks banks but when Chris made

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.370 
all the banks banks but when Chris made
it<00:04:09.459> it<00:04:09.640> was<00:04:09.790> lower<00:04:10.209> case<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:10.989> this<00:04:11.230> is

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
it it was lower case and this is

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.680 
it it was lower case and this is
supposed<00:04:11.709> to<00:04:11.739> be<00:04:11.830> upper<00:04:12.130> case<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:13.420> just<00:04:13.600> a

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
supposed to be upper case so just a

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.140 
supposed to be upper case so just a
mistake<00:04:13.989> on<00:04:14.110> our<00:04:14.170> part<00:04:14.290> but<00:04:15.190> now<00:04:15.670> if<00:04:15.850> we<00:04:15.970> come

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
mistake on our part but now if we come

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150 
mistake on our part but now if we come
in<00:04:16.269> here<00:04:16.450> it<00:04:16.630> will<00:04:16.780> say<00:04:17.080> hi<00:04:17.350> in<00:04:17.739> any<00:04:17.919> of<00:04:18.040> the
