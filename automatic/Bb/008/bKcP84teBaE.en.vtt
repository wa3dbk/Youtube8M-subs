00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:26.189
 hello everyone and again we lead our 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.439
 report from the city of Orlando 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:35.850
 and we will present you a house today 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.690
 A view inside this house is also 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.250
 in the metro area instead 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.250
 very cute stones strings around 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:54.740
 here it is a gated community 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.670
 then a one-story well garage here also 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.670
 but two cars 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.500
 what is remarkable here is the roof tile 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:12.920
 not shingle and that means he 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:17.920
 more valued and so here's the price of 289,000 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:21.729
 dollars bargaining as appropriate 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.729
 2003 wait

 and grandfather color here even we have furniture 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:53.320
 to make it look better 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.320
 the flooring is also lined here and 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.320

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.579
