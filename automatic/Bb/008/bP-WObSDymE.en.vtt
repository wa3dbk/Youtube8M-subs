really<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.159> well<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.789> the<00:01:33.539> all<00:01:33.869> of

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
really really well so that the all of

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.850 
really really well so that the all of
the<00:01:34.170> flour<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.770> mixed<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.250> butter<00:01:35.630> and

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
the flour is mixed with the butter and

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.669 
the flour is mixed with the butter and
if<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.159> don't<00:01:38.849> have<00:01:39.149> an<00:01:39.450> electric<00:01:39.539> mixer<00:01:40.020> you

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
if you don't have an electric mixer you

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.679 
if you don't have an electric mixer you
can<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.069> it<00:01:41.189> all<00:01:41.280> by<00:01:41.429> hand<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:42.149> I<00:01:42.179> just<00:01:42.239> find<00:01:42.599> it

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
can do it all by hand but I just find it

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.260 
can do it all by hand but I just find it
easier<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.200> an<00:01:43.319> electric<00:01:43.679> mixer<00:01:43.829> because<00:01:44.640> it's

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
easier in an electric mixer because it's

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.740 
easier in an electric mixer because it's
just<00:01:45.599> cleaner<00:01:45.929> and<00:01:46.289> quicker<00:01:46.739> as<00:01:47.069> well

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.000 

the<00:01:50.750> reason<00:01:51.050> why<00:01:51.140> I'm<00:01:51.230> combining<00:01:51.470> all<00:01:51.890> these

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
the reason why I'm combining all these

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.530 
the reason why I'm combining all these
ingredients<00:01:52.220> together<00:01:52.610> is<00:01:53.120> it<00:01:53.300> make<00:01:53.510> sure

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
ingredients together is it make sure

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.220 
ingredients together is it make sure
that<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:54.050> have<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.530> nice<00:01:54.740> crispy<00:01:55.720> pastry<00:01:56.720> when

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
that you have a nice crispy pastry when

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.740 
that you have a nice crispy pastry when
you<00:01:57.380> fry<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.710> Selassie<00:01:58.390> we're<00:01:59.390> going<00:01:59.600> to

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
start slowly adding lukewarm water I

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.420 
start slowly adding lukewarm water I
used<00:02:02.180> about<00:02:02.330> 200<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.229> 300<00:02:03.830> millilitres<00:02:04.400> of

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
used about 200 to 300 millilitres of

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.020 
used about 200 to 300 millilitres of
water<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.770> start<00:02:06.770> off<00:02:06.920> slowly<00:02:07.160> mixing<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:07.880> and

into the middle of your semicircle and

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.370 
into the middle of your semicircle and
just<00:05:22.210> make<00:05:22.360> sure<00:05:22.510> that<00:05:22.540> there's<00:05:22.870> enough<00:05:22.930> gap

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
just make sure that there's enough gap

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.880 
just make sure that there's enough gap
around<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.740> edges<00:05:24.100> to<00:05:25.410> dab<00:05:26.410> some<00:05:26.650> water

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
around the edges to dab some water

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.030 
around the edges to dab some water
around<00:05:27.490> it

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
around it

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.320 
around it
so<00:05:30.040> once<00:05:30.250> you've<00:05:30.460> dubbed<00:05:30.730> all<00:05:31.000> your<00:05:31.120> water

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
so once you've dubbed all your water

so once you've dubbed all your water
around<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.080> edges<00:05:32.580> making<00:05:33.580> sure<00:05:33.820> that

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
around the edges making sure that

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.180 
around the edges making sure that
everything<00:05:34.360> is<00:05:34.510> covered<00:05:35.140> in<00:05:35.440> water<00:05:35.650> because

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
everything is covered in water because

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.310 
everything is covered in water because
if<00:05:36.400> there's<00:05:36.640> anything<00:05:36.820> that's<00:05:37.120> left<00:05:37.720> if<00:05:38.200> they

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
if there's anything that's left if they

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.110 
if there's anything that's left if they
won't<00:05:38.470> stick<00:05:38.770> together<00:05:39.070> properly<00:05:40.980> then<00:05:42.120> take

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
won't stick together properly then take

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.820 
won't stick together properly then take
one<00:05:44.460> corner<00:05:45.460> and<00:05:46.230> bring<00:05:47.230> it<00:05:47.440> to<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.680> middle

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
one corner and bring it to the middle

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.250 
one corner and bring it to the middle

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
dough so that it sticks then bring the

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.660 
dough so that it sticks then bring the
other<00:05:53.260> corner<00:05:54.000> into<00:05:55.000> the<00:05:55.030> middle<00:05:56.160> again<00:05:57.160> using

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:57.670 
other corner into the middle again using

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.400 
other corner into the middle again using
your<00:05:57.790> finger<00:05:58.150> to<00:05:58.480> make<00:05:58.630> sure<00:05:58.750> that<00:05:58.900> everything

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
your finger to make sure that everything

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.890 
your finger to make sure that everything
is<00:05:59.650> stuck<00:06:00.190> down<00:06:00.490> especially<00:06:01.120> the<00:06:01.450> corner<00:06:01.750> at

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
is stuck down especially the corner at

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.430 
is stuck down especially the corner at
the<00:06:01.960> top<00:06:03.690> so<00:06:04.690> just<00:06:04.930> make<00:06:05.080> sure<00:06:05.110> that

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
the top so just make sure that

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.920 
the top so just make sure that
everything<00:06:05.890> is<00:06:06.070> nicely<00:06:06.340> stuck<00:06:06.850> down<00:06:07.120> using

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
everything is nicely stuck down using

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.760 
everything is nicely stuck down using
your<00:06:08.080> finger<00:06:09.030> and<00:06:10.030> that's<00:06:10.900> your<00:06:11.140> first<00:06:11.440> small

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770

your finger and that's your first small
side<00:06:11.950> done

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.240 

so<00:06:15.420> once<00:06:15.600> you've<00:06:15.810> done<00:06:15.930> your<00:06:15.990> massage<00:06:16.770> place

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
so once you've done your massage place

so once you've done your massage place
them<00:06:17.460> on<00:06:17.580> the<00:06:17.610> tray<00:06:17.940> that<00:06:18.240> you<00:06:18.300> lined<00:06:18.600> with

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
them on the tray that you lined with

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.790 
them on the tray that you lined with
baking<00:06:19.100> paper<00:06:20.100> and<00:06:20.780> then<00:06:21.780> what<00:06:22.140> you<00:06:22.260> do<00:06:22.440> is<00:06:22.470> you

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
baking paper and then what you do is you

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.700 
baking paper and then what you do is you
basically<00:06:22.920> get<00:06:23.850> the<00:06:23.970> square<00:06:24.360> pieces<00:06:25.020> of<00:06:25.410> paper

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
basically get the square pieces of paper

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.260 
basically get the square pieces of paper
