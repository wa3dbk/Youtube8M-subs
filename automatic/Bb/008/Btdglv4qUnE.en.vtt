00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
all right really short video so we gotta

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.270 
all right really short video so we gotta
set<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:05.910> custom<00:00:06.359> mix<00:00:06.540> on<00:00:07.670> this<00:00:08.670> switch<00:00:09.240> G<00:00:09.599> here

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
set a custom mix on this switch G here

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.499 
set a custom mix on this switch G here
for<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.309> throttle<00:00:11.969> cut<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.389> accra<00:00:12.780> mode<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:14.509> she

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
for a throttle cut in accra mode so she

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.730 
for a throttle cut in accra mode so she
see<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:15.839> have<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.080> servo<00:00:16.470> here<00:00:18.740> hooked

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
see I just have this servo here hooked

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.099 
see I just have this servo here hooked
up<00:00:19.920> just<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.550> can<00:00:20.699> see<00:00:20.820> what's<00:00:20.939> happening<00:00:21.270> all

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
up just we can see what's happening all

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.880 
up just we can see what's happening all
right<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:23.029> I'll<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.180> go<00:00:24.390> here<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.720> I'll<00:00:25.650> go

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
right so I'll just go here and I'll go

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.269 
right so I'll just go here and I'll go
to<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.250> programmable<00:00:27.170> programmable<00:00:28.170> mix<00:00:28.500> one

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.549 

then<00:00:32.279> make<00:00:32.460> sure<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.759> turned<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:34.130> okay<00:00:36.559> set

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
then make sure it's turned on okay set

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.889 
then make sure it's turned on okay set
these<00:00:37.770> both<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.219> channel<00:00:38.610> three<00:00:44.539> and<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.750> want

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
these both to channel three and I want

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.850 
these both to channel three and I want
to<00:00:45.960> set<00:00:46.170> switch<00:00:46.530> G<00:00:48.170> okay<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.440> make<00:00:49.590> sure<00:00:49.710> it's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
to set switch G okay just make sure it's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.580 
to set switch G okay just make sure it's
on<00:00:49.980> when<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.219> hit<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.550> switch<00:00:53.360> okay<00:00:54.360> good<00:00:54.590> so

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
on when I hit the switch okay good so

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.420 
on when I hit the switch okay good so
when<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> switch<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:58.250> okay<00:00:59.250> okay

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
when the switch is up it's on okay okay

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.560 
when the switch is up it's on okay okay
all<00:01:02.430> right<00:01:02.579> now<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> set<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.940> offsets<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:05.570> what

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
all right now to set the offsets so what

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.080 
all right now to set the offsets so what
we<00:01:06.630> want<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:09.020> we<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:11.000> anywhere<00:01:12.000> in

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
we want to do is we want anywhere in

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.719 
we want to do is we want anywhere in
this<00:01:12.210> range<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.740> zero<00:01:14.040> when<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.430> hit<00:01:14.549> this

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
this range just be zero when we hit this

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.399 
this range just be zero when we hit this
switch<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.650> so<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.680> turn<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> mix<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.409> put

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
switch up so I turn the mix on and put

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.560 
switch up so I turn the mix on and put
the<00:01:19.530> throttle<00:01:19.740> stick<00:01:20.100> all<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> way<00:01:20.400> up<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the throttle stick all the way up and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.679 
the throttle stick all the way up and
I'm<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.740> set<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.540> move

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
I'm going to set this to you just move

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.160 
I'm going to set this to you just move
this<00:01:24.810> servo<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:25.979> see<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:27.170> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
this servo here so we can see it you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.719 
this servo here so we can see it you
know<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.710> -100

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
know just to -100

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.429 
know just to -100
okay<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:32.630> okay<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.220> did<00:01:35.430> go<00:01:35.610> back<00:01:36.380> didn't<00:01:37.380> go

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
okay so okay so it did go back didn't go

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.429 
okay so okay so it did go back didn't go
back<00:01:37.590> all<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.799> way<00:01:37.890> back<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.310> zero<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.439> did

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
back all the way back to zero but I did

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.030 
back all the way back to zero but I did
go<00:01:40.590> back<00:01:40.759> what<00:01:41.759> find<00:01:42.329> offsets<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.020> I'm<00:01:43.860> going

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
go back what find offsets so I'm going

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.440 
go back what find offsets so I'm going
to<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.490> looks<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:45.770> half<00:01:46.770> stick<00:01:47.130> here<00:01:47.450> it's

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
to do is looks like half stick here it's

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.510 
to do is looks like half stick here it's
got<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> different<00:01:48.840> mix<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:51.649> so<00:01:52.649> what<00:01:53.399> we

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
got a different mix going on so what we

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.690 
got a different mix going on so what we
do<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.820> looks<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:55.280> I'm<00:01:56.280> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> set

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
do is looks like the I'm going to set

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.060 
do is looks like the I'm going to set
this<00:01:56.850> throttle<00:01:57.299> stick<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.840> minimum<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> that's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
this throttle stick to minimum so that's

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.630 
this throttle stick to minimum so that's
where<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:03.329> know<00:02:03.360> like<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.689> mix<00:02:03.899> will<00:02:04.079> start

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
where you know like the mix will start

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.280 
where you know like the mix will start
so<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:05.729> we<00:02:05.850> hold<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.329> stick<00:02:07.049> all<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.259> way

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
so if we hold this stick all the way

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.919 
so if we hold this stick all the way
down<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.799> then<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:08.039> go<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.929> little

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
down and then we go to this little

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.950 
down and then we go to this little
offset<00:02:10.170> here

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
offset here

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
offset here
just<00:02:11.110> move<00:02:11.320> your<00:02:12.180> cursor<00:02:13.180> down<00:02:13.560> then<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:14.680> push

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
just move your cursor down then you push

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.040 
just move your cursor down then you push
and<00:02:15.130> hold<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.400> button<00:02:16.800> this<00:02:17.800> will<00:02:17.980> set<00:02:18.280> that

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
and hold this button this will set that

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.720 
and hold this button this will set that
stick<00:02:20.050> mix<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:22.330> know<00:02:23.280> pretty<00:02:24.280> much<00:02:24.430> lock

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
stick mix to you know pretty much lock

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.480 
stick mix to you know pretty much lock
it<00:02:24.940> at<00:02:25.060> zero<00:02:25.680> all<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.830> way<00:02:26.920> throughout<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:27.400> if

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
it at zero all the way throughout so if

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.040 
it at zero all the way throughout so if
you<00:02:27.550> hit<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.880> switch<00:02:28.150> here<00:02:28.570> you'll<00:02:28.870> see<00:02:29.170> it

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.420 

okay<00:02:35.050> so<00:02:35.110> it's<00:02:35.380> totally<00:02:35.800> disabled<00:02:36.250> here

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
okay so it's totally disabled here

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.480 
okay so it's totally disabled here
nothing<00:02:37.090> happening<00:02:37.890> turn<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.010> switch<00:02:39.250> back

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
nothing happening turn the switch back

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.410 
nothing happening turn the switch back
on<00:02:39.670> off<00:02:40.200> turn<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.320> mix<00:02:41.500> off<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:43.180> have

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
on off turn the mix off and you have

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.420 
on off turn the mix off and you have
control<00:02:44.280> there<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.370> go<00:02:47.730> it's<00:02:48.730> pretty<00:02:49.090> much<00:02:49.240> it
