00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.650
 hello everybody i am a caterpillar to 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.440
 that we will spend a different day from 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.570
 We didn't usually stay in the kitchen 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.960
 given the heat we thought we would come 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.240
 a little cooler even if it does here 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.900
 so hot it will show you too 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.150
 some wild wild herbs and that 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.630
 can be found in these areas of 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.120
 mountain of countryside and mountains and that 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.280
 we use the first one in the kitchen 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.570
 will go edible that I show you is 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.240
 the core 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.180
 and it is this tree here and already the first 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.560
 there are two kitchens now there are 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.930
 two 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.270
 another head in short already begin to 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.610
 however being there in the core is still 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.550
 a lot of greens what you will eat between 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.880
 a little bit the carriage I already had now 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:25.000
 shown in the old video on 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.090
 nice spontaneous herbs and we have them 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.369
 found another little bit here but so much is 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.520
 easy to find it is also found 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.380
 even in the plains, in short, not only 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.310
 in the countryside and mountains 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.640
 we collect no wild stripes that 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.130
 I have nothing to do with that 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.890
 short cigan of the south is also very much 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.619
 nice to see because that one more 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.299
 common green leaflets flowers are 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:58.960
 green instead this here is almost fuchsia 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:03.720
 very very bright purple and very pretty 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.720
 a little perfume always oregano 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.030
 this is the cornel the fruits of the 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.950
 dogwood which are these Russian berries 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.250
 usually we make jam though 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.900
 we have discovered a way not to 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.230
 waste them because with the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.200
 jam I don't know sap by now the 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.680
 whole fruit and we put them in 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:35.569
 brine and then we eat them as they were 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.130
 pickles are very good take advantage 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.650
 also to collect a little of neither 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.600
 pity this is me in the kitchen at 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.570
 use as aromatic 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.700
 now it serves more than anything else to flavor 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.550
 these are our dogwood boats 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.130
 who we gathered and I told you that 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.810
 these are made in brine that is 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.200
 usually we will make jam though them 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.720
 we pickle when you go to 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.060
 collect the cornel to do this 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.629
 recipe I found on this book 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.319
 it's not my 20's 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.510
 recognition of plant use 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.049
 very pretty wild this book 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.579
 previous there are so many recipes when 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.439
 pick up the banks you don't have to 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.530
 collect the overripe then 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.720
 when they are too Russian starting 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.700
 being very dark may not be good 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.010
 those are more suitable for the 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.159
 jam instead those that are fine 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.680
 they are a little clearer a little more 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.290
 verdini to make the brine in brine 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.980
 it is very simple procedure in practice 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.889
 where the boats boil in the water 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.530
 very salty salt the book says in 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:45.980
 salting water then as tightly as possible 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.409
 You can boil them for a few minutes 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.049
 and let it soak in the same water 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.689
 in the cooking water one day passed 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.970
 that day you drained the cornel and it 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:58.340
 then put in the classic brine 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.489
 however under the box in the deck of 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.280
 information you will have all things 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.340
 written to make the brine to redo 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.949
 the recipe in general leaves them in 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.739
 this room wants and after twenty days 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:15.709
 a month or so they are ready and you can 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.630
 consume when you prepare the brine 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.700
 obviously flavor it with 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.410
 the herbs you like best I have 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.540
 collected right here to do the 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.580
 brine a little bit of fennel 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.310
 wild the oregano but this done 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:34.590
 also see and birth or mint 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.270

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.540
 you happen to take a ride in the areas a 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.910
