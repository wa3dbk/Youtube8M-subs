00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.819
 let's talk now about the multiplication of whole numbers represented seminar 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.839
 but before doing that 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.749
 let's see for a moment 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.790
 what is the displacement to the left 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:18.230
 in numbers 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.970
 stored in binary memory that we mean by this displacement to 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.710
 the left in English say 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.820
 6 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.159
 the 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:33.760
 and in intel chips like the pen who dares with the three letters s 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.310
 what does this mean before we see it, remember that a monkey in this first 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.610
 position is worth simply one 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.600
 but that he himself one in the second position is worth 2 and in this position 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.720
 is worth 4 and in the following way 8 and 16 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.140
 i 32 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.300
 and 64 and 128 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.090
 in short that any one is worth twice its neighbor on the right 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.820
 and any one is worth half of its neighbor on the left 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.470
 in other words 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.100
 when we grab 1 and move it to the left we are double 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.450
 2 its value 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.290
 to 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.730
 and what we do with that let's see 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.250
 imagine 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.250
 that we have a number like this 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.729
 a number like this that is a number that we know what numbers 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.670
 and this is a four therefore 1 and 4 and 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.780
 sun 5 in terrible value 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.790
 what happens when this one 5 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.740
 we take 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.580
 all of his 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.700
 dexia and the mounts plaza moscu a position on the left this one goes to 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.150
 have here 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.810
 and it is that one is going to have here 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.810
 and the other counselors 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.149
 and we introduce a zero to specify the octet here what star values 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.039
 let's see this is a trial 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:14.899
 and this is a 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:19.369
 so this number is none other than the iess in week option 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:23.230
 it's no surprise to anyone then that when we take a 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.230
 number in binary and we move it one position to the left 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.469
 we double 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.109
 no more we multiply by all 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.379
 so simple multiply by 2 in binary 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.600
 we move 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.059
 a position 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.059
 on the left 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.189
 we're going to use the offset to the left in name multiplication 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.230
 let's take this number of quique we have already seen 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.230
 that's 10 simply notation 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:07.749
 binary that's a good without designating 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:12.639
 and suppose we're going to multiply it by this other number that we know is 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.179
 number 5 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:16.849
 in designating 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.980
 we multiply them and to do that we say 1 by the number above 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.650
 it is the same number of rivas and we copy that number 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.239
 and we put it down here 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.609
 that's one for the one above 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.750
 be or by the one above is zero 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.790
 very well and this number that does not deserve that this is a four 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:42.999
 four times the number above multiply by four points itch by 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:45.569
 all and then two 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.679
 and we already know that to multiply by 2 we simply move to the left 

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:52.189
 in a position to the number 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.609
 so what we do is we take the one above we all express to the left not 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.179
 one but twice to make it 4 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:01.709
 and we write it down here 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.699
 and then add it together let's add 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:08.699
 the sum of its 12 0 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.469
 zero and zero is zero 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.919
 one and one at zero and one came 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:19.199
 and two injured 1 it was very good 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.419
 and that's the result creams 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.060
 are of course what number is this 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:27.930
 so let's see 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.830
 This number is a 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.379
 4 8 16 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:38.039
 if it's a 16 is 18 and this is a 32 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.970
 along with 18 are without account in designating 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.630
 so the result of 50 indeci mal what is not surprise multiply to 10 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.749
 for 5 and I do not follow 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.479
 fifty 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.849
 and so we multiply in binary 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:56.979
 we'll see 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.860
 another example 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.119
 in this case let's take this multiplying 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:09.699
 we were going to operate a multiplication with this multiplier 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:15.429
 let's see what is the result of that multiplication one by the above 

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:19.269
 because it is simply the disc number above and nothing has changed 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.789
 be or by the river 0 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:28.009
 0 by the number of river 0 but this one multiplied by the one above 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.059
 does this number is 8 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:32.309
 that are all by two 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:37.359
 by two in other words as mossos number from above we do not displace the 

00:05:37.359 --> 00:05:41.689
 left three times we do not write here below and we add 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:42.870
 A) Yes 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.009
 we are ready to add 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.300
 the result is zero 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.090
 siero 1 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.050
 one of seros 1 0 one and one zero that arrived 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:57.849
 1 and one at zero cy young 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:00.430
 one 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.080
 iniesta 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.029
 what number is this as you know 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:08.270
 this is a four 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.619
 and this is a lot 

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:16.009
 They are 12 16 32 64 128 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.289
 i 200 56 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.469
 his mom 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:25.069
 all those numbers 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:28.539
 we have the result that is 300 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.669
 96 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:36.080
 that is the result we got 396 in designating 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.080
 let's see what we multiply this number down here 

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:41.229
 is 1 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:44.229
 plus 8 although this number is a nine 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.979
 and the one above 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.189
 let's see this is a four 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:52.759
 and this is a lot 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:55.759
 16 this is a 32 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.949
 this number is 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:01.169
 44 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:02.729
 in tenth 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.180
 and it is true that 44 by 9 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.850
 They are 300 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.889
 96 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:12.159
 let's look at something interesting in this case 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:13.490
 the result 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.719
 it does not have 8 bits it has nine 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:20.869
 what happens if the results are going to be stored only 

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:24.669
 an 8-bit ballet in that case 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:27.680
 the only thing that we can really store 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.930
 and let me make another color 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.439
 this part is our part 

00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:39.339
 but that part is missing this stake is missing 256 

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:40.649
 then 

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:44.860
 the stored result would be only 140 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.879
 what without wrong result 

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:50.809
 so that this multiplication functions 

00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:56.229
 we have to make sure that the final result was enough to senate not in a ballet 

00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:59.449
 casino at least and that's the whole country 

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:01.219
 many of them have been 

00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:02.059
 for all
