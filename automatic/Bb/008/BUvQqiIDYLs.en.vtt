00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.450 
on februari 20th 2013 many people's
lives<00:00:09.780> were<00:00:10.230> affected<00:00:10.349> by<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:10.889> landslide

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
lives were affected by this landslide

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.850 
lives were affected by this landslide
ADOT<00:00:12.120> set<00:00:12.450> out<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.929> three<00:00:13.380> prong<00:00:13.650> approach

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
ADOT set out on a three prong approach

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.410 
ADOT set out on a three prong approach
to<00:00:14.429> restore<00:00:14.880> traffic<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.080> area<00:00:17.150> step<00:00:18.150> one

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
to restore traffic in the area step one

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.380 
to restore traffic in the area step one
was<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.230> restore<00:00:19.580> emergency<00:00:20.580> access<00:00:20.820> and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
was to restore emergency access and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.900 
was to restore emergency access and
begin<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> initial<00:00:22.230> geotechnical<00:00:22.949> work<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
begin the initial geotechnical work the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.490 
begin the initial geotechnical work the
second<00:00:24.330> part<00:00:24.600> was<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.230> pave<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.949> n20<00:00:26.550> detour

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
second part was to pave the n20 detour

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.759 
second part was to pave the n20 detour
and<00:00:28.500> now<00:00:29.429> we've<00:00:29.849> begun<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.689> final<00:00:31.140> repair<00:00:31.529> of

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
and now we've begun the final repair of

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:40.580 
and now we've begun the final repair of
the<00:00:31.830> u.s.<00:00:32.489> 89<00:00:38.300> in<00:00:39.300> order<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.780> realign<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the u.s. 89 in order to realign the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.500 
the u.s. 89 in order to realign the
roadway<00:00:40.920> 60<00:00:41.309> foot<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.700> east<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.239> need<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
roadway 60 foot to the east we need to

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.810 
roadway 60 foot to the east we need to
excavate<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.260> existing<00:00:43.710> slope<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.460> most

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
excavate the existing slope the most

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.940 
excavate the existing slope the most
important<00:00:45.210> part<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.570> get<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> fracturing<00:00:46.739> into

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
important part is get it fracturing into

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.139 
important part is get it fracturing into
a<00:00:46.980> size<00:00:47.190> where<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.850> lock

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
a size where we can get it to lock

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.619 
a size where we can get it to lock
together<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> buttress<00:00:50.329> will<00:00:51.329> take<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
together in the buttress will take the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.569 
together in the buttress will take the
excavation<00:00:52.260> from<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> hillside<00:00:52.710> transport

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
excavation from the hillside transport

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.150 
excavation from the hillside transport
it<00:00:53.670> down<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.270> off-road<00:00:54.840> rock<00:00:55.530> trucks<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
it down in off-road rock trucks and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250 
it down in off-road rock trucks and
place<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.239> buttress<00:00:57.690> consisting

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
place it in the buttress consisting

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.110 
place it in the buttress consisting
mainly<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.070> rock<00:00:59.280> material<00:00:59.520> from<00:00:59.969> the

mainly of the rock material from the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.029 
mainly of the rock material from the
excavation<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.199> amount<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.530> material<00:01:02.010> that

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
excavation the amount of material that

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.189 
excavation the amount of material that
needs<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.520> be<00:01:02.640> moved<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.239> project<00:01:03.539> is

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
needs to be moved on this project is

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.560 
needs to be moved on this project is
enormous<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.250> approximately<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:06.240> million

to go down and the buttress is going to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.160 
to go down and the buttress is going to
come<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.610> until<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.299> point<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.810> could<00:01:21.990> have

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
come up until that point we could have

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.960 
come up until that point we could have
more<00:01:22.320> movement<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.130> all<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> activity

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
more movement and with all the activity

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.910 
more movement and with all the activity
that's<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.630> there<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.170> triggered<00:01:25.680> some

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
that's going on there it triggered some

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.590 
that's going on there it triggered some
movement<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.430> slide<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.240> same

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
movement of the slide it's that same

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.380 
movement of the slide it's that same
mass<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:29.040> decided<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.820> move<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
mass that just decided to move just a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.760 
mass that just decided to move just a
little<00:01:30.420> bit<00:01:30.720> further<00:01:30.900> down<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.380> hill<00:01:31.530> it's

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
little bit further down the hill it's

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.859 
little bit further down the hill it's
nothing<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.579> can't<00:01:32.880> control<00:01:33.240> by<00:01:33.540> getting

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
nothing that we can't control by getting

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.749 
nothing that we can't control by getting
that<00:01:33.990> buttress<00:01:34.470> put<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:34.950> place<00:01:35.189> that's<00:01:35.520> when

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
that buttress put in place that's when

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.819 
that buttress put in place that's when
we<00:01:35.850> think<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.299> slide<00:01:36.570> will<00:01:36.780> lock<00:01:36.810> itself<00:01:37.229> into

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
we think the slide will lock itself into

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.830 
we think the slide will lock itself into
that<00:01:37.979> buttress<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.240> shift<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
that buttress and then we can shift the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.020 
that buttress and then we can shift the
road<00:01:40.079> over<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.619> build<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.670> its<00:01:41.850> new

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
road over and build it on its new

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.510 
road over and build it on its new
alignment<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.899> project<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.590> very<00:01:43.829> important

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
alignment this project is very important

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.359 
alignment this project is very important
to<00:01:44.729> those<00:01:45.149> communities<00:01:45.649> that<00:01:46.649> weren't<00:01:47.070> able

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
to those communities that weren't able

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
to benefit from the n20 detour and we

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.870 
to benefit from the n20 detour and we
