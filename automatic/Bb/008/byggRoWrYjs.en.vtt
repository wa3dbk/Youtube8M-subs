let's<00:00:10.089> talk<00:00:10.330> about<00:00:10.480> co2<00:00:10.839> bow-bow<00:00:11.469> maintenance

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:12.089 
let's talk about co2 bow-bow maintenance

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.970 
let's talk about co2 bow-bow maintenance
one<00:00:13.089> take<00:00:13.869> your<00:00:13.990> toolkit<00:00:14.349> periodically

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
one take your toolkit periodically

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.679 
one take your toolkit periodically
please<00:00:15.549> let's<00:00:15.730> say<00:00:15.879> you're<00:00:16.029> out<00:00:16.119> shooting<00:00:16.390> and

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:16.689 
please let's say you're out shooting and

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.170 
please let's say you're out shooting and
you<00:00:16.750> shoot<00:00:16.930> 50<00:00:17.289> 60<00:00:17.650> shots<00:00:17.829> ensure<00:00:18.730> that<00:00:18.910> all<00:00:19.150> of

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
you shoot 50 60 shots ensure that all of

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.659 
you shoot 50 60 shots ensure that all of
your<00:00:19.390> fasteners<00:00:20.079> are<00:00:20.289> tight<00:00:20.470> so<00:00:21.070> periodic

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:21.669 
your fasteners are tight so periodic

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.580 
your fasteners are tight so periodic
maintenance<00:00:21.820> for<00:00:22.480> example<00:00:22.930> I'm<00:00:23.380> going<00:00:23.529> to

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
maintenance for example I'm going to

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.679 
maintenance for example I'm going to
take<00:00:23.770> the<00:00:23.890> bow<00:00:24.070> and<00:00:24.369> I'm<00:00:24.820> gonna<00:00:24.969> go<00:00:25.480> in<00:00:25.660> and

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
take the bow and I'm gonna go in and

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.720 
take the bow and I'm gonna go in and
check<00:00:26.050> and<00:00:26.590> make<00:00:26.680> sure<00:00:26.800> that<00:00:26.980> all<00:00:27.189> of<00:00:27.579> the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
check and make sure that all of the

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.850 
check and make sure that all of the
fasteners<00:00:28.509> basically<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.200> two<00:00:29.379> here<00:00:29.680> that

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
fasteners basically the two here that

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.740 
fasteners basically the two here that
hold<00:00:30.009> the<00:00:30.129> rail<00:00:30.309> to<00:00:30.520> the<00:00:30.550> trigger<00:00:30.910> group<00:00:31.119> the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
hold the rail to the trigger group the

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.209 
hold the rail to the trigger group the
two<00:00:31.930> up<00:00:32.110> here<00:00:32.320> that<00:00:32.529> hold<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.829> front<00:00:32.860> limb

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
two up here that hold the front limb

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.260 
a bad bowstring is any kind of serving
where<00:01:56.950> where<00:01:57.490> you're<00:01:57.609> serving<00:01:57.939> is<00:01:57.999> coming

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
where where you're serving is coming

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.629 
where where you're serving is coming
apart<00:01:58.599> are<00:01:59.169> really<00:01:59.439> starting<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.859> split<00:02:00.369> and

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:00.639 
apart are really starting to split and

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:03.330 
apart are really starting to split and
you're<00:02:01.090> seeing<00:02:01.329> the<00:02:01.499> underlying<00:02:02.499> portion<00:02:03.219> of

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
you're seeing the underlying portion of

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.029 
you're seeing the underlying portion of
the<00:02:03.429> bowstring<00:02:03.880> this<00:02:04.869> is<00:02:05.109> a<00:02:05.139> continuously

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
the bowstring this is a continuously

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.029 
the bowstring this is a continuously
woven<00:02:06.579> string<00:02:07.270> so<00:02:07.539> it's<00:02:07.689> really<00:02:07.989> one<00:02:08.229> set<00:02:08.920> of

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
woven string so it's really one set of

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.889 
woven string so it's really one set of
strands<00:02:09.459> that<00:02:09.550> go<00:02:09.700> back<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.090> forth<00:02:10.270> like<00:02:10.330> this

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
strands that go back and forth like this

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.710 
strands that go back and forth like this
also<00:02:11.680> if<00:02:11.920> any<00:02:12.130> of<00:02:12.280> these<00:02:12.370> individual<00:02:13.030> strands

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
also if any of these individual strands

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.870 
also if any of these individual strands
are<00:02:13.900> compromised<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:15.010> really<00:02:15.370> compromised

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
are compromised you really compromised

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.700 
are compromised you really compromised
your<00:02:16.060> bowstring<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:17.050> in<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.290> case<00:02:17.500> that

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
your bowstring so in this case that

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.170 
your bowstring so in this case that
would<00:02:17.830> be<00:02:17.950> another<00:02:18.190> good<00:02:18.400> indicator<00:02:18.460> I

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
would be another good indicator I

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.210 
would be another good indicator I
changed<00:02:19.960> my<00:02:20.080> bowstring<00:02:20.590> every<00:02:21.040> two<00:02:21.190> years

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
changed my bowstring every two years

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.770 
changed my bowstring every two years
whether<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.850> needs<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.180> or<00:02:22.300> not

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
