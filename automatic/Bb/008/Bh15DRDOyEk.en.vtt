00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
helps diffuse the flash so you won't

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.600 
helps diffuse the flash so you won't
experience<00:01:57.960> any<00:01:58.200> flash<00:01:58.650> back<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.400> really

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
experience any flash back it's a really

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.370 
experience any flash back it's a really
slick<00:01:59.940> looking<00:02:00.270> case<00:02:00.510> as<00:02:00.690> you<00:02:00.810> guys<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:01.170> see

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
slick looking case as you guys can see

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.899 
slick looking case as you guys can see
here<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.770> light<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.159> kind<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.430> shines<00:02:02.670> off

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
here in the light it kind of shines off

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.410 
here in the light it kind of shines off
it's<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:04.050> basically<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.560> pixel<00:02:05.040> skin<00:02:05.420> HD

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
it's just basically the pixel skin HD

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.180 
it's just basically the pixel skin HD
and<00:02:06.690> what<00:02:07.290> they<00:02:07.380> mean<00:02:07.500> by<00:02:07.650> that<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> spec

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
and what they mean by that is the spec

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.190 
and what they mean by that is the spec
pixel<00:02:08.549> skin<00:02:08.759> was<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> silicone<00:02:09.569> case<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.080> had

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
pixel skin was a silicone case that had

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.839 
pixel skin was a silicone case that had
some<00:02:10.349> smoke<00:02:10.679> bigger<00:02:10.979> squares<00:02:11.400> all<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> way

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
some smoke bigger squares all the way

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.430 
some smoke bigger squares all the way
around<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.540> basically<00:02:12.720> they<00:02:13.019> took<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.349> and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
around and basically they took it and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.530 
around and basically they took it and
put<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:14.040> into<00:02:14.340> smaller<00:02:14.730> squares<00:02:15.090> all<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.450> way

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
put it into smaller squares all the way

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.839 
put it into smaller squares all the way
around<00:02:15.900> as<00:02:16.830> well<00:02:17.159> which<00:02:17.340> gives<00:02:17.549> it<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.700> really

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
around as well which gives it a really

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.059 
around as well which gives it a really
nice<00:02:18.060> look<00:02:18.170> across<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.319> back<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.830> sides

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
nice look across the back and the sides

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.670 
nice look across the back and the sides
are<00:02:20.310> solid<00:02:20.700> black<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:21.209> is<00:02:21.750> made<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.379> kind<00:02:22.620> of

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
are solid black it is made of kind of

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.100 
are solid black it is made of kind of
like<00:02:22.799> a<00:02:22.860> polymer<00:02:23.459> material<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.659> hybrid

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
like a polymer material it's a hybrid

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.320 
like a polymer material it's a hybrid
case<00:02:25.379> between<00:02:25.860> kind<00:02:26.099> of<00:02:26.159> a<00:02:26.280> hard<00:02:26.819> case<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.299> a

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
case between kind of a hard case and a

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.820 
case between kind of a hard case and a
silicone<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.349> definitely<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> lot

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
silicone so it's definitely a lot

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.920 
silicone so it's definitely a lot
slicker<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.340> won't<00:02:29.670> grasp<00:02:29.999> on<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.659> anything

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
slicker and won't grasp on to anything

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.110 
slicker and won't grasp on to anything
or<00:02:31.290> collect<00:02:31.590> any<00:02:31.739> dust<00:02:32.069> like<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> like<00:02:32.909> the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
or collect any dust like a like the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.420 
or collect any dust like a like the
pixel<00:02:33.540> skin<00:02:33.779> would<00:02:34.019> so<00:02:34.499> I<00:02:34.529> do<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.099> a<00:02:35.129> lot

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
pixel skin would so I do like this a lot

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.830 
pixel skin would so I do like this a lot
better<00:02:35.579> in<00:02:35.760> comparison<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.329> pixel<00:02:36.659> skin

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
better in comparison to the pixel skin

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.890 
better in comparison to the pixel skin
material-wise<00:02:37.650> now<00:02:38.459> as<00:02:39.030> far<00:02:39.299> as<00:02:39.359> buttons<00:02:39.750> are

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
material-wise now as far as buttons are

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.369 
material-wise now as far as buttons are
concerned<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:41.659> sleep/wake<00:02:42.659> button<00:02:42.689> as

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
concerned the the sleep/wake button as

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.199 
concerned the the sleep/wake button as
well<00:02:43.680> as<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.099> volume<00:02:44.459> up<00:02:44.609> and<00:02:44.760> down<00:02:44.790> buttons

well as the volume up and down buttons

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.899 
well as the volume up and down buttons
are<00:02:45.359> extremely<00:02:46.230> hard<00:02:46.469> to<00:02:46.560> press<00:02:46.829> I<00:02:47.099> mean<00:02:47.519> the

from clicking on the volume up and down
buttons<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.599> really<00:03:18.959> don't<00:03:19.169> like<00:03:19.319> that<00:03:19.379> at<00:03:19.650> all

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
buttons I really don't like that at all

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
and you see I just pushed there and it

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.899 
and you see I just pushed there and it
took<00:03:22.349> me<00:03:22.530> like<00:03:22.560> three<00:03:23.010> times<00:03:23.250> before<00:03:23.579> I<00:03:23.730> could

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
took me like three times before I could

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.610 
took me like three times before I could
actually<00:03:24.030> push<00:03:24.389> hard<00:03:24.659> enough<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.349> get<00:03:25.500> the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
actually push hard enough to get the

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.319 
actually push hard enough to get the
phone<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:25.980> go<00:03:26.099> back<00:03:26.280> into<00:03:26.459> sleep<00:03:26.790> mode<00:03:26.819> with<00:03:27.209> it

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
phone to go back into sleep mode with it

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.030 
phone to go back into sleep mode with it
turning<00:03:27.629> the<00:03:27.719> screen<00:03:27.930> off<00:03:28.139> so<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.650> really

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
turning the screen off so I really

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.979 
turning the screen off so I really
didn't<00:03:29.280> like<00:03:29.459> that<00:03:29.730> guys<00:03:29.939> it<00:03:30.569> does<00:03:30.750> have<00:03:30.959> a

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
didn't like that guys it does have a

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.479 
didn't like that guys it does have a
really<00:03:31.290> nice<00:03:31.409> feel<00:03:31.709> in<00:03:31.859> your<00:03:31.919> hand<00:03:32.159> doesn't

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
really nice feel in your hand doesn't

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.860 
really nice feel in your hand doesn't
add<00:03:32.579> too<00:03:32.819> much<00:03:32.939> bulk<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.359> the<00:03:33.480> phone<00:03:33.659> it's

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
add too much bulk to the phone it's

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.740 
add too much bulk to the phone it's
really<00:03:34.139> slick<00:03:34.790> great<00:03:35.790> form<00:03:36.120> factor<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:36.599> think

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
really slick great form factor I think

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.629 
really slick great form factor I think
spec<00:03:37.230> always<00:03:37.560> does<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.739> great<00:03:37.980> job<00:03:38.040> with<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
spec always does a great job with the

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.939 
spec always does a great job with the
finish<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:39.209> their<00:03:39.449> cases<00:03:39.840> but<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.319> really<00:03:40.680> wish

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
finish on their cases but I really wish

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.860 
finish on their cases but I really wish
neither<00:03:41.729> one<00:03:42.030> they<00:03:42.209> didn't<00:03:42.479> cover<00:03:42.659> these

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.360 
butt guys for that reason I really do
not<00:04:45.270> recommend<00:04:45.659> this<00:04:45.960> case<00:04:46.229> it's<00:04:46.740> very<00:04:47.039> sleek

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
the really difficult application removal

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.860 
the really difficult application removal
because<00:04:59.860> it<00:04:59.980> really<00:05:00.160> is<00:05:00.280> easy<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.790> reply<00:05:01.120> the
