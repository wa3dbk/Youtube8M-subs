00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
navy blue and say Maul masters so this

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.270 
navy blue and say Maul masters so this
paint<00:01:45.570> will<00:01:45.810> not<00:01:46.020> come<00:01:46.259> off<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.950> sealed

not an easy figure to do one of the more
difficult<00:02:11.560> designs<00:02:12.280> especially<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:13.060> helmet

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.210 

with<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.660> really<00:02:17.080> really<00:02:17.260> thin<00:02:17.590> lines<00:02:17.860> kind

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
with the really really thin lines kind

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.770 
with the really really thin lines kind
of<00:02:18.280> had<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.490> go<00:02:18.640> back<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:18.880> repaint<00:02:19.450> over<00:02:19.660> and

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
of had to go back and repaint over and

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.870 
of had to go back and repaint over and
over<00:02:19.930> again<00:02:20.020> this<00:02:20.770> was<00:02:21.040> actually<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.550> little

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
over again this was actually a little

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.640 
over again this was actually a little
bit<00:02:22.000> difficult<00:02:22.210> as<00:02:22.690> well<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.080> try<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.320> get<00:02:23.500> that

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
bit difficult as well to try to get that

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.270 
bit difficult as well to try to get that
symmetrical<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.610> straight<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:27.070> wolf

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
symmetrical and straight and the wolf

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.180 
symmetrical and straight and the wolf
was<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.520> little<00:02:28.150> bit<00:02:28.270> of<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.390> challenge<00:02:28.810> as<00:02:28.959> well

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
was a little bit of a challenge as well

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.160 
was a little bit of a challenge as well
so<00:02:30.190> anyhow<00:02:30.580> one<00:02:31.300> last<00:02:31.510> thing<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.750> I<00:02:31.959> want<00:02:32.140> to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
so anyhow one last thing that I want to

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.570 
so anyhow one last thing that I want to
show<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.410> about<00:02:32.590> my<00:02:32.740> commander<00:02:33.130> wolf<00:02:33.310> if<00:02:33.459> you

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580

know<00:02:33.700> anything<00:02:34.090> about<00:02:34.180> him<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:34.890> believe<00:02:35.890> it's

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
know anything about him I believe it's

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.680 
know anything about him I believe it's
in<00:02:36.100> one<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.459> comic<00:02:36.820> books<00:02:37.030> commander<00:02:37.510> wolf

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
in one of the comic books commander wolf

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.130 
in one of the comic books commander wolf
actually<00:02:38.350> in<00:02:39.340> battle<00:02:39.880> loses<00:02:40.330> his<00:02:40.510> eye<00:02:40.780> and

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
actually in battle loses his eye and

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.199 
actually in battle loses his eye and
they<00:02:41.350> replace<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.800> with<00:02:42.070> a<00:02:42.100> cybernetic<00:02:42.670> eye<00:02:42.940> so

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
they replace it with a cybernetic eye so

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.030 
they replace it with a cybernetic eye so
I<00:02:43.239> went<00:02:43.570> ahead<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:44.020> gave<00:02:44.260> him<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.560> detail

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
I went ahead and I gave him that detail

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.170 
I went ahead and I gave him that detail
as<00:02:45.280> well<00:02:45.489> and<00:02:45.900> gave<00:02:46.900> him<00:02:47.050> his<00:02:47.200> cybernetic<00:02:47.920> eye

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
as well and gave him his cybernetic eye

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.520 
as well and gave him his cybernetic eye
so<00:02:49.180> anyhow<00:02:49.570> that's<00:02:49.750> going<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.050> do<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.260> for<00:02:50.410> this
