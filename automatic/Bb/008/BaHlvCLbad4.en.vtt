00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.249 
my question with this is first of all
this<00:01:31.650> obviously<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.490> bypassing<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.630> taxis

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
this obviously is bypassing the taxis

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.170 
this obviously is bypassing the taxis
dispatch<00:01:34.860> service<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.150> like

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
dispatch service so so is this like

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.240 
dispatch service so so is this like
kosher<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.900> all<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> taxi<00:01:37.710> companies<00:01:38.100> I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
kosher with all of the taxi companies I

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.649 
kosher with all of the taxi companies I
don't<00:01:38.490> know<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.790> kosher<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> taxi

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
don't know if it's kosher with the taxi

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.780 
don't know if it's kosher with the taxi
companies<00:01:40.049> but<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.290> absolutely<00:01:40.409> does<00:01:41.040> build

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
companies but it absolutely does build

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.789 
companies but it absolutely does build
its<00:01:41.970> own<00:01:42.060> network<00:01:42.600> outside<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.170> them<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.560> it'll

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
its own network outside of them so it'll

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.830 
its own network outside of them so it'll
call<00:01:44.009> any<00:01:44.369> cab<00:01:44.700> driver<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.240> has<00:01:45.390> signed<00:01:45.689> up

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
call any cab driver that has signed up

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.319 
call any cab driver that has signed up
for<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.200> app<00:01:46.470> for<00:01:46.950> many<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.820> cab<00:01:48.000> drivers

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
for this app for many so the cab drivers

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.520 
for this app for many so the cab drivers
themselves<00:01:48.450> sign<00:01:48.899> up<00:01:49.020> they've<00:01:49.200> got<00:01:49.380> their

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
themselves sign up they've got their

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.050 
themselves sign up they've got their
smartphone<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.250> their<00:01:50.369> smartphone<00:01:50.820> talks

directly your smartphone and it in a

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.490 
directly your smartphone and it in a
marriage<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:54.000> me<00:01:54.119> my<00:01:54.840> favorite<00:01:55.290> thing<00:01:55.320> about

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
marriage as me my favorite thing about

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.800 
marriage as me my favorite thing about
this<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.070> as<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.579> cab<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.000> coming<00:01:57.299> towards<00:01:57.719> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
this is as the cab is coming towards you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.560 
this is as the cab is coming towards you
you<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.140> watch<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.009> map<00:01:59.189> mm-hmm<00:01:59.850> my

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
you can watch it on the map mm-hmm my

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.359 
you can watch it on the map mm-hmm my
second<00:02:00.960> favorite<00:02:01.200> part<00:02:01.409> about<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.189> cab

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
second favorite part about it is the cab

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.889 
second favorite part about it is the cab
doesn't<00:02:02.549> change<00:02:02.880> direction<00:02:03.240> depending<00:02:03.509> on

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
doesn't change direction depending on

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.330 
doesn't change direction depending on
where<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.200> going<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.560> sometimes<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.250> drives

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
where it's going so sometimes it drives

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.050 
where it's going so sometimes it drives
backwards<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.920> guy<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.429> feature<00:02:08.849> i

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
backwards the guy like that feature i

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.580 
backwards the guy like that feature i
get<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> little<00:02:09.629> kick<00:02:09.899> out<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.440> would

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
get a little kick out of that one would

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.199 
get a little kick out of that one would
be<00:02:10.619> very<00:02:10.920> upsetting<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.310> see<00:02:11.520> your<00:02:11.700> cab<00:02:11.910> coming

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.620 
be very upsetting to see your cab coming
and<00:02:12.330> then<00:02:12.420> go

and then go

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.720
