on<00:04:13.269> the<00:04:13.299> planet<00:04:13.750> it's<00:04:13.870> what<00:04:14.049> they<00:04:14.170> use<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.349> make

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
on the planet it's what they use to make

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.860 
on the planet it's what they use to make
everything<00:04:15.310> from<00:04:16.180> computer<00:04:16.659> case

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
everything from computer case

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.520 
everything from computer case
cases<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.880> all<00:04:18.880> kinds<00:04:19.180> of<00:04:19.389> accessories<00:04:19.630> these

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
cases to all kinds of accessories these

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.950 
cases to all kinds of accessories these
components<00:04:21.220> are<00:04:21.340> made<00:04:21.519> out<00:04:21.850> of<00:04:21.960> polycarbonate

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
components are made out of polycarbonate

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.219 
components are made out of polycarbonate
plastic<00:04:23.680> and<00:04:23.830> so<00:04:24.490> is<00:04:24.729> the<00:04:25.660> swiveling

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
plastic and so is the swiveling

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.990 
plastic and so is the swiveling
mechanism<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:26.979> can<00:04:27.130> see<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.610> swiveling

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
mechanism you can see that the swiveling

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.810 
mechanism you can see that the swiveling
mechanism<00:04:28.600> is<00:04:28.780> very<00:04:29.500> very<00:04:29.770> thin<00:04:30.160> it's<00:04:30.580> got<00:04:30.790> a

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
mechanism is very very thin it's got a

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.960 
mechanism is very very thin it's got a
thin<00:04:31.120> profile<00:04:31.630> so<00:04:32.380> it<00:04:32.530> doesn't<00:04:32.949> take<00:04:33.160> up<00:04:33.190> add<00:04:33.910> a

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
thin profile so it doesn't take up add a

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.780 
thin profile so it doesn't take up add a
lot<00:04:34.240> of<00:04:34.360> bulk<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.930> but<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:35.919> become<00:04:36.580> all

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
lot of bulk to it but it is become all

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.460 
lot of bulk to it but it is become all
of<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.000> components<00:04:37.300> here<00:04:37.690> are<00:04:37.900> made<00:04:38.169> out<00:04:38.440> of

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
of the components here are made out of

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.500 
of the components here are made out of
polycarbonate<00:04:39.100> plastic<00:04:39.639> the<00:04:40.030> strongest

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
polycarbonate plastic the strongest

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.260 
polycarbonate plastic the strongest
plastic<00:04:41.320> on<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.530> planet<00:04:41.919> so<00:04:42.070> if<00:04:42.940> you<00:04:43.060> take

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
plastic on the planet so if you take

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.480 
plastic on the planet so if you take
this<00:04:43.570> let<00:04:43.960> me<00:04:44.050> straight<00:04:44.650> how<00:04:44.770> strong<00:04:45.100> this<00:04:45.250> is

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
this let me straight how strong this is

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.659 
this let me straight how strong this is
let's<00:04:46.330> open<00:04:46.660> this<00:04:46.780> up<00:04:46.960> a<00:04:47.110> little<00:04:47.229> bit<00:04:47.669> tighten

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
let's open this up a little bit tighten

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.740 
let's open this up a little bit tighten
it<00:04:48.850> down<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:51.100> let<00:04:51.340> this<00:04:51.520> snap<00:04:51.850> back<00:04:52.120> and<00:04:52.389> it's

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
it down and let this snap back and it's

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.879 
it down and let this snap back and it's
not<00:04:52.960> going<00:04:53.229> to<00:04:53.699> it's<00:04:54.699> not<00:04:55.030> going<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.630> affect

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
not going to it's not going to affect

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.469 
not going to it's not going to affect
its<00:04:56.889> operation<00:04:57.520> it<00:04:57.639> might<00:04:57.789> snap<00:04:58.090> into<00:04:58.330> the

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
its operation it might snap into the

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:59.700 
its operation it might snap into the
next<00:04:58.720> position<00:04:58.840> but<00:04:59.260> it's<00:04:59.380> not<00:04:59.500> going<00:04:59.620> to

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
next position but it's not going to

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.620 
next position but it's not going to
break<00:04:59.919> and<00:05:00.190> that's<00:05:00.970> the<00:05:01.090> important<00:05:01.510> part

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
break and that's the important part

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.920 
break and that's the important part
about<00:05:01.900> this<00:05:02.139> so<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.250> then<00:05:03.639> to<00:05:03.789> remove<00:05:04.210> it<00:05:04.389> you

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
about this so and then to remove it you

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.230 
about this so and then to remove it you
take<00:05:05.169> push<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:05.800> button<00:05:06.100> again<00:05:06.340> pull<00:05:07.120> it

your knee as I'm doing and then you can

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.860 
your knee as I'm doing and then you can
work<00:05:53.979> on<00:05:54.099> your<00:05:54.160> iPad<00:05:54.660> comfortably<00:05:55.660> let<00:05:55.780> me

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
work on your iPad comfortably let me

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.020 
work on your iPad comfortably let me
turn<00:05:56.020> a<00:05:56.080> little<00:05:56.199> profile<00:05:56.680> for<00:05:56.949> you<00:05:57.039> so<00:05:57.669> and

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
turn a little profile for you so and

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.230 
turn a little profile for you so and
another<00:05:58.780> way<00:05:58.990> we<00:05:59.169> have<00:05:59.380> of<00:05:59.410> doing<00:05:59.560> this<00:05:59.979> is<00:06:00.250> one

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
another way we have of doing this is one

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.480 
another way we have of doing this is one
thumb<00:06:01.539> and<00:06:02.410> one<00:06:02.620> finger<00:06:02.979> as<00:06:03.099> I<00:06:03.220> showed<00:06:03.460> you

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
thumb and one finger as I showed you

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.029 
thumb and one finger as I showed you
earlier<00:06:03.669> and<00:06:04.270> this<00:06:04.780> kind<00:06:05.229> of<00:06:05.380> creates<00:06:05.740> a<00:06:05.830> very
