make<00:04:38.100> this<00:04:38.250> work<00:04:38.310> I<00:04:39.590> guess<00:04:40.590> now<00:04:40.830> we<00:04:40.889> got<00:04:41.160> the

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
make this work I guess now we got the

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.280 
make this work I guess now we got the
green<00:04:42.060> and<00:04:42.210> blue<00:04:42.590> striped<00:04:43.590> shirt<00:04:45.260> actually<00:04:46.260> I

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
green and blue striped shirt actually I

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.780 
green and blue striped shirt actually I
had<00:04:46.380> noticed<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.740> couple<00:04:46.860> things<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.580> actually

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
had noticed a couple things it actually

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.090 
had noticed a couple things it actually
has<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.090> red<00:04:48.450> stitching<00:04:48.900> on<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.229> bottom<00:04:49.950> and

has a red stitching on the bottom and
the<00:04:50.520> top<00:04:50.550> button<00:04:51.090> which<00:04:51.960> i<00:04:52.050> think<00:04:52.139> is<00:04:52.229> a<00:04:52.290> nice

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
the top button which i think is a nice

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.710 
the top button which i think is a nice
little<00:04:52.680> touch<00:04:53.090> 54<00:04:54.090> usually<00:04:54.360> does<00:04:54.510> that<00:04:54.660> with

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
little touch 54 usually does that with

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.879 
little touch 54 usually does that with
the<00:04:54.870> clothes<00:04:55.110> they'll<00:04:55.350> have<00:04:55.530> a<00:04:55.560> couple

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
the clothes they'll have a couple

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.580 
the clothes they'll have a couple
buttons<00:04:56.100> or<00:04:56.370> stuff<00:04:56.610> that<00:04:56.790> are<00:04:56.990> sewn<00:04:57.990> in<00:04:58.169> red<00:04:58.380> I

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
buttons or stuff that are sewn in red I

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.440 
buttons or stuff that are sewn in red I
like<00:04:58.860> that<00:04:58.889> cuz<00:04:59.490> spreads<00:04:59.880> one<00:05:00.000> of<00:05:00.090> my<00:05:00.150> favorite

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
like that cuz spreads one of my favorite

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.320 
like that cuz spreads one of my favorite
colors<00:05:00.780> so<00:05:01.100> this<00:05:02.100> actually<00:05:02.280> fits<00:05:02.639> better<00:05:03.060> than

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
colors so this actually fits better than

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.170 
colors so this actually fits better than
I<00:05:03.419> remember<00:05:03.990> I<00:05:04.860> remember<00:05:05.100> being<00:05:05.669> a<00:05:05.789> little<00:05:05.820> too

so they're not so baggy over here so you

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.879

really really well material is actually
really<00:06:07.830> nice<00:06:08.099> I<00:06:08.430> can't<00:06:08.699> really<00:06:08.789> describe<00:06:09.090> it
