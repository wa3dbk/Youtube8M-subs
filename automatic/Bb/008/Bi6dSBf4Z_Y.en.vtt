have<00:00:51.449> direct<00:00:52.140> inflation<00:00:52.649> which<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.949> money

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
have direct inflation which is money

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.100 
have direct inflation which is money
printing<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> after<00:00:54.780> effects

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
printing then you have the after effects

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.319 
printing then you have the after effects
which<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.710> higher<00:00:55.890> which<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.640> rising<00:00:57.059> prices

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
which is higher which is rising prices

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.490 
which is higher which is rising prices
right<00:00:58.969> crazy<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.410> know

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
right crazy so it's going to be you know

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.840 
right crazy so it's going to be you know
I've<00:01:01.620> heard<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.920> going<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> 70s

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
I've heard it's going to be like the 70s

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.990 
I've heard it's going to be like the 70s
only<00:01:03.030> worse<00:01:04.369> those<00:01:05.369> dollars<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.909> go

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
only worse those dollars have to go

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.600 
only worse those dollars have to go
somewhere<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:07.229> they<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.490> go

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
somewhere right they have to go

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.950 
somewhere right they have to go
somewhere<00:01:08.880> when<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.240> print<00:01:09.570> these<00:01:09.689> things

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
somewhere when they print these things

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.359 
somewhere when they print these things
they're<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.200> even<00:01:10.530> absolutely<00:01:10.979> positive

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
they're not even absolutely positive

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.780 
they're not even absolutely positive
where<00:01:11.490> they're<00:01:11.580> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.760> go<00:01:13.520> then<00:01:14.520> they<00:01:14.640> have

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
where they're going to go then they have

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.700 
where they're going to go then they have
to<00:01:14.820> deal<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> issue<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.810> rising<00:01:16.470> prices

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
to deal with the issue of rising prices

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.020 
to deal with the issue of rising prices
in<00:01:16.950> whatever<00:01:17.130> area<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.210> they've<00:01:18.780> landed<00:01:18.990> in

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
in whatever area that they've landed in

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.460 
in whatever area that they've landed in
all<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.240> means<00:01:21.479> higher<00:01:21.659> prices<00:01:22.170> history<00:01:22.439> i

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
all this means higher prices history i

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.990 
all this means higher prices history i
like<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:22.950> statement<00:01:23.369> history<00:01:23.850> does<00:01:23.970> not

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
like this statement history does not

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.690 
like this statement history does not
repeat<00:01:24.330> itself<00:01:24.920> history<00:01:25.920> does<00:01:26.070> not<00:01:26.100> repeat

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
repeat itself history does not repeat

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.569 
repeat itself history does not repeat
itself<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.659> does<00:01:27.689> rhyme<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> 70s

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
itself but it does rhyme like in the 70s

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.580 
itself but it does rhyme like in the 70s
we<00:01:29.700> had<00:01:29.850> crazy<00:01:30.090> inflation<00:01:30.810> we're<00:01:31.380> probably

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
we had crazy inflation we're probably

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.890 
we had crazy inflation we're probably
going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.159> again<00:01:32.369> only<00:01:32.610> worse<00:01:32.970> so

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
going to have it again only worse so

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.440 
going to have it again only worse so
it's<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.759> reminiscent<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.880> 70s

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
it's going to be reminiscent of the 70s

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.319 
it's going to be reminiscent of the 70s
but<00:01:38.119> much<00:01:39.119> worse<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.579> 70s<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.030> had<00:01:42.150> hit

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
but much worse and the 70s you had hit

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.660 
but much worse and the 70s you had hit
