00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.830
 hello friends with you tiberian 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.529
 another week has passed which means the most 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.740
 time for fresh release heading master 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.109
 all tanks for 8 in a row well, hero 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.050
 our today's release will be the most 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.689
 best medium tank american m 3 or 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.060
 4 levels last time you are very 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.980
 insistently asked to show this tank and 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.950
 of course I could not leave it without 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.590
 attention well then let's start on this 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.270
 I spent 10 units fighting this time 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.350
 enough to get the length twice 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.390
 master class 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.789
 and understand that I am more on it in life 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.649
 I will not play oh well kidding guys 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.450
 actually m3 is very cool mean 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.160
 tank first he has no tower 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.379
 secondly he can apply big 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.410
 the amount of damage is true if in 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.930
 Top third, he is very good tank 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.620
 but only machine gun tanks and fourthly 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.110
 he glows very well and fifthly he 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.400
 uno can ride in general guys tank 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.110
 very cool recommend you 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.939
 be sure to take a ride on it if you 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.070
 this has not done the gameplay just 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.720
 Stunning ineffable I have long 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.330
 This did not feel well, now let's 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.549
 just in case, let's talk a little about him 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.750
 technical specifications and since i 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.790
 and said whether m3 u 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.619
 a lot of positive quality 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.330
 In general, all cool such an average tank 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.520
 but most importantly its positive 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.070
 side this is dynamics it is pretty fast 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.810
 for Fri-shki drive maximum speed 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.000
 38 kilometers per hour 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.250
 gaining he will hold very well 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.509
 maximum speed back as much as 16 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.340
 kilometers per hour that is if you 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.020
 lit up then you can so well 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.479
 relatively quickly roll back 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.009
 very quickly it spins in place 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.439
 turning speed there just 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.930
 an exorbitant 43 degrees per second is 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.509
 very much that is you pkh-shki others not 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.030
 will be able to twist well and even st-patches 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.070
 probably will not be able to 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.469
 other parameters well it implements 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.149
 also a pretty good break through with a piece of paper 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.630
 there are ninety-two millimeters and 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.670
 subcibber 127 and perhaps damage 110 units 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.469
 guns very fast reload 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.450
 send them will be about two 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.230
 and a half seconds true accuracy is not 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.360
 very good 0 41 times 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.519
 From the tools you are the main thing from driving to 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.720
 end and the time information by the way is 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.530
 just over two seconds 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.810
 shot out 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.220
 reloaded si just a gun came down and 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.140
 by the way still very good angles 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.700
 vertical aiming of guns down she 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.709
 goes down by 9 degrees 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.879
 rises to 20 meaning you can 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.760
 go turn the tower 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.480
 and no tower you will not turn and no you 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.340
 can go 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.670
 here is your healthy body 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.920
 lower the gun here neatly sometimes 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.260
 and shoot or raise a weapon too 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.110
 shoot now but this is also not bad in 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.450
 overall well it is so good honestly 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.220
 my guys I actually got you 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.260
 said a little bit what's great about it 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.359
 tank this dynamic is actually not 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.400
 so the coolest thing in this tank 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.890
 This is her radio communication range of the whole 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.170
 615 meters that is you will see 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.060
 almost always all allies and all 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.310
 opponents on the map and it is very important 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.170
 as for booking then for 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.870
 average tank level 4 she basically 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.790
 good almost everywhere albu 50 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.859
 millimeters under slight slopes then 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.500
 have some classmates you may 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.930
 not bounce rebounds can be but 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.090
 armor sides and poop is very weak 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.680
 only 38 millimeters that is even 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.169
 machine gun tanks you will be there 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.579
 punch and artillery to artillery she 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.530
 even mine bombs can pierce and 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.380
 accordingly can you svanshot 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.180
 but it is very unpleasant do or take a right 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.980
 but in conclusion you must 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.530
 recall such important parameters for 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.000
 pt as a disguise review though about 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.220
 disguise one might not 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.019
 remember because it is not very tank 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.599
 high and glows constantly 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.150
 The survey is 320 meters even for 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.780
 tank level 4 is pretty low 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.370
 indicator 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.739
 I therefore recommend that you compensate 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.840
 This lack of stereo tube view 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.400
 I did it and so with the characteristics 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.889
 finished not now finally possible 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.840
 go to the suffering that is to how 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:01.120
 can get on classy master on 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.400
 this wonderful medium tank is the most 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.870
 easy way is to get to the top of the list and 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.910
 shoot shoot for those who 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.709
 moves to shoot for those who do not move 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.290
 generally do as much damage as possible 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.449
 and at the end of the battle if you put two or three 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.609
 thousands of damage then most likely you will have 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:17.829
 mark of klassnost master true in this 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.239
 There is one little problem in the plan. 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.969
 in that they have three lines so often 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.110
 gets to the top of the list so if you 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.020
 it still managed 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.759
 then try 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.949
 struggling because next fight 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.900
 unlikely to have such an opportunity 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.940
 now let's talk about situations 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.740
 that happens much more frequently and 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.080
 exactly when you are in the middle 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.879
 or bottom of the list actually if you 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.159
 hit the bottom of the list then the special influence 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:42.110
 so you will not be able to fight 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.479
 stand better away from the main combat 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.490
 action try to damage someone 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.919
 you can even shoot with bombs 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.289
 Gods do not break through and live like 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.569
 can be longer in the middle or at the end of the fight 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.520
 your tank can play a crucial role 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.620
 if you are in the middle of the list 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.110
 then in this situation you can bring 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.000
 some benefits to your team first 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.039
 you can fight with your peers 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.470
 classmates and some tanks 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.819
 level five there are cardboard machines on 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.220
 fifth level which you even 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:12.409
 armor piercing shells can punch 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.360
 but then again forward it is better not to climb on 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:16.550
 help their allies from the second line 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.440
 or you can try to act 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.750
 more aggressive for example like me in this 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.849
 the battle which took place on the map fishing 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.099
 bay and in which I actually got 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.169
 the next sign of class master in 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.270
 the beginning of the battle I am like a real middle 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.099
 the tank decided to go to the center of the card and 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.659
 took a position that allows me 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:35.060
 shoot through enemy tanks 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:36.740
 if they went to the city but the players 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.690
 the red team decided not to occupy 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.699
 urban part of the map so allies 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.509
 passed the city and met no 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.340
 resistance 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.800
 And I already managed to catch on the center 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.050
 reckless enemy st-shku fifth 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.000
 level which I safely disassembled and 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.870
 I only got one 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.969
 shot back 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.740
 after that I decided to change position and 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:57.259
 go to the city because on the center 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.960
 also glowed also enemy top square-1 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.639
 very dangerous opponent for our m3 whether 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.099
 while i was moving just managed 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:06.080
 highlight this kv-1 and our allies 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.330
 thank them very much building his distance 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.340
 safely dismantled while I 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.529
 not getting one hit from him 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.539
 then I decided to return to the center again 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:16.849
 to check if there are still opponents 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:19.130
 and shoot in the light of our allies 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:21.080
 who went out of town in the hamlet 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.849
 there was a French b1 on the center 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.009
 together with the allies we quickly 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:26.840
 destroyed and as I imagined 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.699
 managed to shoot the center on light 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.150
 our allies who left from 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.310
 cities 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.960
 what is this position on the center so good 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.060
 so that it allows not only to shoot 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.320
 in the direction of the enemy base but also 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.630
 defend yours because what magician 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.010
 I managed to see allies 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.810
 help on base defense 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.090
 you gruel we also quickly pretty 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.920
 dismantled at this time two of our heavy 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.780
 tanks that succeeded in attack rose 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.640
 on capture and I after helped 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.860
 allies on defa loaded land mines and 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.960
 set off to look for artillery regret 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.880
 I could not finish it off but we 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.400
 won and in this fight I finally 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.200
 got the coveted master in conclusion 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.970
 I want to say that we want trill pretty 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.100
 specific medium tank and more 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.230
 reminds ptshku after all he has 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.450
 good dynamics and pretty good 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.670
 cannon for level four with excellent 

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:14.400
 vertical alignment angles therefore with 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.140
 it is not so bad Well friends on 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.730
 that's all for today thanks for all 

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.440
 attention with you was tiberian
