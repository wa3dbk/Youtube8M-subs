00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 hello dear people today there is one 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.360
 small picture and no time 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.430
 I just have a quick garden 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.490
 would like to have an automatic more pay of 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.430
 tree and a fully automatic with 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.869
 daylight sensor and that's where we start 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.210
 Best of all, not at the same time 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.029
 Girl was the inventory 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.400
 I need the slopes I need 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.060
 there 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.130
 i need redstone torches i need 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.680
 one day light sensor i need red 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.680
 storm and i need 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.360
 Yes, I would say that's enough these 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.310
 ask only once and then I'm me 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.510
 now the stopwatch and then go the 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.510
 already going on 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.420
 First of all we sit a few 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.739
 Of course we set six of them 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.930
 eight pieces exactly and a day 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.230
 I need a light sensor and a repeater 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.910
 I can still see that is also happening 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.050
 and we too will become the comparators 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.850
 still need 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.320
 so sit here the roma to the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.420
 We are now setting the repeaters 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.300
 just turn it all on 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.580
 trigger at the same time and that too 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:21.280
 a little better hoppala works 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:23.320
 so and his comes the round on it with 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.330
 the rewarding film which can grow 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:33.450
 behind it, we will now continue to be 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:37.149
 and again a small frame 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.009
 then we have the farmland here too 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.320
 can still take it 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.710
 a cow 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:50.720
 before service water otherwise the whole 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.220
 not even water in here and then 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.500
 the whole country will be short here once 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.020
 worked 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.130
 then that can be very nice and gone 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.880
 we still want each other 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.649
 but here it was correct and so on 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.630
 that worked well now 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.630
 very nice 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.790
 Well that would be the first part 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.099
 if we trigger that now then see 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.950
 We raise the horse and if there are times 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.200
 it would then would then also 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.420
 disappear accordingly 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.110
 Of course not alone 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.290
 we also need a crate or 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.849
 stent everything else is landed in it 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.000
 this fully automatic million form yes 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.819
 for an ass so additionally held 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.430
 his box in it funnel because 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.260
 so really works and wants 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.290
 ewald judge also only bet here 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.280
 because it's so easy 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:50.480
 then we have to go from up there, yes 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.569
 Also make sure that the things 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.239
 bahrain fall so we put up here 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.530
 but it is again 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.270
 actually 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.580
 Well , it does not matter 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.610
 the control does not want to be quite so 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.540
 as I like it 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.550
 that's how it works, of course 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.160
 it does not matter what kind of slopes to use 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:20.180
 that is completely irrelevant that works now 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.030
 First of all only because that's me 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.780
 it may seem that way, too 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.980
 need it again there and now 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.690
 we no longer need the funnels 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.730
 That's why I can do that too 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.550
 omitting 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:38.740
 Zack zack Zack the whole is totally 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:42.250
 simple here and will have purely a torch 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.350
 somewhere we have to change one here 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.740
 so that has triggered because here zack 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.990
 zack perfectly all are triggered and 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.550
 so that it does not trigger right now 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:57.640
 it must be we build it the whole way 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.720
 that connect with it 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.150
 and then we actually have the 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.140
 We are already ready to finish the melon 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.330
 all you need now is one circuit 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:14.350
 the driven by the daylight sensor 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:19.730
 we will build it accordingly 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:22.280
 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 or 3 respectively 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.050
 it only and here we sit the 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.030
 to want daylight and as we see 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.580
 is something like that but not exactly 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.770
 what I would like 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.340
 That's why we're doing this now 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.930
 Imagine that and if we now do that 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.210
 partly light sensor bet again 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.270
 because that should actually work 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.940
 but it does not do it because it's all here 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.810
 has not been hidden yet 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:50.419
 We do it the best way we do 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.249
 the whole thing a bit further 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.059
 put back 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:58.879
 that is the most sensible variant so so 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:04.189
 a daytime light sensor sits here 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:07.489
 repeater here there and the whole comes to 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:09.529
 because now here again with the 

00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:10.269
 corresponding delay zag zack 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:13.129
 pow 

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:16.309
 and now that should be completely 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.419
 usually run smoothly when I am 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:19.009
 because this is the last one 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.529
 Of course I would have used that 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.419
 not done because sometimes I do not 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:27.159
 forgetful bitkom we are 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:31.279
 works that is very good 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:33.709
 We now put more money on it 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:38.079
 we can test that too and then it is 

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:38.079
 that officially finished too 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.809
 Ballack and overlooked everything is beautiful in 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:50.029
 The judges fell for us and we did 

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:52.539
 a time of 5 minutes and eight 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:55.069
 seconds and a finished one 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.299
 fully automatic melons form even if 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.860
 there's nothing like that now 

00:05:56.299 --> 00:05:59.840
 box is in it 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.569
 but I think that will come, she is 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.020
 he there are the 38 million 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:07.490
 yes good as we are now rather finished with 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.539
 I can also try to build that 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.419
 she slower to talk the whole 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:14.590
 history explain times for that is 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.590
 everything very simple
