00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 Toni, everything's okay with you. 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.250
 today to record a video of a boxing 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.960
 and I know that you must already be 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.059
 tired of seeing this kind of video you 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.980
 so tired because a lot of people ask me and 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.529
 so are the 20 some videos that I 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.060
 I have some visualizations so yes I 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.130
 I think you like to see at least 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.990
 I love this kind of video then like this 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.550
 As long as you do not have claudio I'll 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.500
 continue recording every time it arrives 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.810
 something for me means every time 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.699
 They do not want to see if there's a little package there. 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.210
 I'm waiting for a while, the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.740
 other 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.110
 that's when I went to open because I'm not going 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.790
 to record video from a small package is not 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.829
 which is a very large package knows that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.930
 I'm very curious so 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.329
 Thank you, but for this I only 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.969
 it gets worse when it's another package in it 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.800
 So, this time, a little later 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.840
 arrived another I waited and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.610
 Now I'll show you 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.949
 So you want to know what you have? 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.270
 inside you the envelopes here is just 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.270
 Do you keep watching videos? 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.519
 I'll start with a beautiful one for this one. 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.040
 well levinho and such and it was the first to 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.979
 I have no idea what 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.600
 it's not going very light on one thing 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:18.950
 appears to be small and light 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:20.960
 then can not you have no drive is 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.680
 a pendrive I bought this galera that 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:29.720
 for pink I know but no it's so 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.030
 zinho here rose and he 8th gigas ae 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.340
 it cost $ 99 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.149
 then you do so right and it closes 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.950
 habitual 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:41.030
 here is space for you have a 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.950
 rope if you want I bought it 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.690
 but because it actually has an HD 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.000
 then ask me is not even 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.190
 so useful sometimes it takes some 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.070
 quick thing once to carry and 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.960
 that I can not take the external guard 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.570
 who is greater knows the truth one thing 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.950
 little stay in your pocket block 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.899
 outside a little bigger than mine 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.030
 It was then that's how easy it is 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.369
 carry it is not that big like that 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.590
 but for sure the pen drive is much more 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.729
 easy so I like the option 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.560
 to have a thumb drive 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.690
 I have other pen drives including a 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.220
 What is a beautiful camera that I bought? 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.900
 in the air express too but here is just 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.569
 two days hence I bought here from eight 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.690
 steps on approval as I said I am 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.730
 2 99 dollars the order on the 15th day of the dolce 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.500
 I'll leave the link today, they'll always stay 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.040
 in the blog post is there 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.720
 It's just you guys, come in now, let's open it. 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.090
 this other package what it looks like 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.050
 to be a case I wish nothing is not 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.069
 appearing that is to say not 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.370
 stagnant 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:48.200
 I think you do not want to see samsung dot com 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.350
 is a case of the flip gaucho 74 but it is 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.670
 orange 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.130
 in orange it came as if it were title 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.370
 Original even from samsung 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.500
 I do not know if it's us 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.380
 Then came here in the sport kitchen and is 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.450
 that case that has this neighbor clip 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.870
 so you fuck her cell phone here 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.300
 comes with this plastic protection for 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.440
 I want to scratch here in addition to 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.710
 velvet out here type of leather and here 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:25.670
 behind plastic people but I swear that 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.670
 is not asking is who orange is people 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.040
 I even asked for another lighter 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:36.900
 hence he did not remember asking for 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.820
 finally put a dollar and 51 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.830
 I'll try to find the link because I 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.940
 I was thinking that you're going to buy her. 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:48.440
 but I recovered and it was orange so there is not 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.400
 no one near a color I like 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.350
 but anyway 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.080
 and it was already companies that arrived to 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.890
 This case was me and the pedals and the two 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.540
 things 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.860
 I hope you have enjoyed the basket in 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.710
 three games on the blog as I quoted and the Czech 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.820
 state decides who liked me spoke 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.820
 A kiss, bye, bye.
