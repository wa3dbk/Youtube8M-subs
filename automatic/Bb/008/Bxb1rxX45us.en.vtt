00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.290
 we will see how to adjust his 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.940
 carburation according to your candles 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.980
 so you'll see when they tell you 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.750
 set the carburation it will be by 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.550
 compared to sprinklers so what 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.689
 is that a sprinkler a jet is 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:20.179
 this little room with a hole in 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.949
 middle of the fish see it well and who 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.989
 allows you to pass more gasoline 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.429
 the hole is big plus you're going to have 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.529
 senses that will pass through these 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.419
 logical so the bigger the hole will be 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.420
 plus the figure that will be shown on the 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.620
 sprinklers will be fat could finally see if 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.270
 you will see the video but on the way 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.300
 of you will see you have a figure that 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.710
 will be just above we do not see well 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.500
 but serious and just above you have 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.890
 a figure here is 62 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.800
 that means it's a jet of 62 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.670
 when you take a jet of 68 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.730
 you have a hole that will be 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.470
 automatically bigger than 62 so 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.329
 when we are going to ask you rise of a 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.310
 low point you will go up one size 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.579
 if you are in 68 you can go up to 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:06.289
 69 or 70 when it says go down if you 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.749
 are in 68 you go from 66 to 65 the 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:10.009
 jet or is it found that my 

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:12.499
 it's not complicated you disassemble the 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.509
 gas tank of your carburetor so 

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:16.880
 there you have one of their rates acs h at 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.270
 helmet 15 sec the mold principle she 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.929
 even especially the goal gap is here you 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.130
 have the jet so original on one 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:31.789
 their rates is 68 you have school 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.850
 loosen and tighten to remove them 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.469
 to put it back then one thing 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.270
 before I tighten them directly and 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.880
 caton of life that moves take a 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.109
 flat screwdriver for tours but I 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.789
 I realized for a moment that I had a 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.459
 breakdown ie my sprinklers 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.439
 often this butcher but I searched 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:48.920
 sought is the source was beautiful 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.959
 screwdriver 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.249
 then the metal they use for 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.020
 make the sprinklers at post it's 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:54.889
 but that metal cows hear me that's to 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.939
 to say that every time I put a 

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:57.829
 little shot of screwdriver yet I 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.999
 will not be strong every time I put 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.209
 a little screwdriver 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:05.270
 go back I was doing a micro image 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.799
 in the jet that was coming into the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.990
 tank and which ended up by butcher's 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.280
 jets the pij dessert to the maj and serves 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.790
 pretty strong in the hand and frankly I 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.230
 am so summer pom to settle your 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.670
 carburation compared to candles 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.470
 beautiful will have to look at your candles 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.510
 so of course have to have low candles 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.920
 you have already shot with the best 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.570
 is that you take you poke a 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.870
 tip with your mobile is all bike 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.220
 and once you're inside you 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.190
 cut you off everything you cut the 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.390
 engine you stop accelerating and you 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.280
 you stop engines at you put in 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.760
 position stops and there you go power 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.080
 see directly on your candle 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.270
 it was easy before when there was 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.310
 great because great was with 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.440
 lead and what allowed to color 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.540
 candles more or less loud 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.590
 now with the lead-free it's 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.830
 much harder to watch 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.890
 so I'm using this a substitute of 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.830
 lead it costs seven bogus roles with that 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.600
 you treat 50 liters of fuel you 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.840
 are quiet is what allows to 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.160
 color a little more candles and 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.830
 it will be much easier for them 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.090
 carburetion 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.600
 then at the candle color level 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.640
 you will first of all this one you 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.080
 so go see when we talk about the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.850
 color of the candle 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.370
 it's mostly at the electrode 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.550
 then the electrode is what it is 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.990
 part that you will find here see 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:30.230
 there an original name sas and white there you 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.630
 see he is tending towards the light brown he is 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.310
 clear sent even there it's clear when 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.410
 you see that it starts from 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.790
 the white these bells you are not 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.620
 quite rich ie you have 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.990
 far too much air compared to 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.850
 gasoline too little gasoline so if 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.710
 you have not enough gasoline you 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.110
 mount sprinkler size ie 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.240
 than if you are in 68 and you have 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.730
 a candle that is white like that you 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.230
 can try 70 to try with a 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.730
 new candle so for cons for 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.140
 settings every time you change 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.360
 of sprinklers I advise you to change 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.240
 of candles role a little bit and you 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.700
 look after the state of the candle 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.260
 when you are dry you can 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.180
 know or six years look at the state of the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.280
 candle when you see you're at 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.440
 background and that your mobile is she grazes 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.590
 after you play with the starter 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.950
 if you press the choke and that 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.440
 your mobile is going faster is that 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.360
 you have too much air you returning 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.340
 are forced to lower the air so you 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.290
 have senses that do not happen enough 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.200
 so when you lean on the 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.840
 starter evokes mobile is at best it's 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.760
 that it is necessary to go up in size of jets 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.800
 if by cons you see that when you 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.480
 press the starter she gets bogged down 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.790
 and alcohol there is that you have a 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.020
 jet that will be too big the nozzle 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.870
 too big anyway you go 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.970
 find on this type of candles see 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.890
 so we see squarely the color the 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.230
 color difference there you are black 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.180
 shiny black it's really that too 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.010
 of too much oil with oil 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.570
 far too much gas 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.940
 there you are obliged on this type of 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.770
 candles to go down in size from 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.180
 sprinklers if you're in 68 and you 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.400
 have that you are obliged to smugglers in 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.900
 combining 65 66 66 65 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.520
 after you have the color that is 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.290
 perfect 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.960
 finally for word that is perfect it's 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.720
 this one so we do not see so well 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.650
 in video but the electrode starts to 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.690
 become brick red 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.330
 when you have a brick red color 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.310
 chocolate milk chocolate we will say 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.800
 it's pile hair 2 we see it becomes 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.540
 Brown chestnut is what you need 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.360
 the man you are stacking hair by squirting 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:37.590
 changed nothing everything is beautiful the most the 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.639
 little trick that you can try 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.530
 also if your candle 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.050
 we will say that the jet is too big 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.280
 so your candle is too black what 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.479
 you can do you can change from 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.430
 air filter if you have a filter to 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.090
 original air like this one you can 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.800
 try sport air filter 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.779
 elop that lets in more air so 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.729
 if you have more dr that will mix 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:00.650
 better with the more gasoline so you 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.969
 risk you can find we're going to say 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.969
 a random setting like this
