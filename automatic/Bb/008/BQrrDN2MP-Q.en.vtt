yes but uh the cool thing about these

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.520 
yes but uh the cool thing about these
constructs<00:01:12.780> cockpits<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.970> that<00:01:15.350> they<00:01:16.350> come

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
constructs cockpits is that they come

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.510 
constructs cockpits is that they come
apart<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.250> use<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> constructs<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.720> base

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
apart I use the constructs as the base

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.160 
apart I use the constructs as the base
specifically<00:01:20.520> because<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.840> do<00:01:21.990> things

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
specifically because I can do things

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.580 
specifically because I can do things
like<00:01:22.350> this

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.370 

I'll<00:01:27.549> always<00:01:27.760> I<00:01:28.330> could<00:01:28.900> have<00:01:29.049> done<00:01:29.200> the

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
I'll always I could have done the

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.719 
I'll always I could have done the
cockpit<00:01:29.950> but<00:01:30.490> side<00:01:31.330> notes<00:01:31.659> so<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:33.400> is<00:01:33.549> the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
cockpit but side notes so this is the

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.899 
cockpit but side notes so this is the
chair<00:01:34.000> it's<00:01:34.210> got<00:01:34.390> vents<00:01:34.690> here<00:01:35.340> cables<00:01:36.340> more

sorry if it's too close there's a handle

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.319 
sorry if it's too close there's a handle
that<00:02:35.950> goes<00:02:36.220> right<00:02:36.430> here<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:39.120> snapped<00:02:40.120> off

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
that goes right here that snapped off

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.800 
that goes right here that snapped off
for<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.019> time<00:02:41.230> being<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.709> need<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.040> reglue<00:02:42.489> it

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:57.690 
or replace it I haven't decided
and<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:52.060> reach<00:02:53.340> goes<00:02:54.340> back<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:56.519> see<00:02:57.519> our

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
and so that reach goes back in see our

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.199 
and so that reach goes back in see our
pilot<00:02:58.090> in<00:02:58.209> this<00:02:58.420> 360<00:02:59.109> cockpit

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.500 

I'll<00:03:05.840> stick<00:03:06.290> his<00:03:06.409> helmet<00:03:06.739> on<00:03:07.360> rather<00:03:08.360> space

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.650 

there<00:03:12.110> we<00:03:12.290> go

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:25.970 

and<00:03:16.200> then<00:03:16.640> comp<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:19.490> plugs<00:03:20.490> in<00:03:20.820> here<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:25.680> sits

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
and then comp it plugs in here just sits

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.160 
and then comp it plugs in here just sits
there

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.890 

so<00:03:34.170> there's<00:03:34.500> wires<00:03:34.769> in<00:03:35.219> the<00:03:35.430> frame<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.090> this

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
so there's wires in the frame and this

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.709 
so there's wires in the frame and this
is<00:03:37.109> like<00:03:37.349> an<00:03:37.530> alternate<00:03:38.159> design<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.209> Alex

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:39.719 
is like an alternate design to the Alex

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.110 
is like an alternate design to the Alex
as<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.170> know<00:03:40.319> phthalic<00:03:40.709> has<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.040> different<00:03:41.519> 360

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
as you know phthalic has a different 360

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.959 
as you know phthalic has a different 360
cockpit<00:03:42.659> but<00:03:43.379> the<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.950> storyline<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.640> that

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:44.969 
cockpit but the the storyline is that

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.020 
cockpit but the the storyline is that
the<00:03:45.090> oxygen<00:03:45.480> actually<00:03:46.170> has<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.349> cop<00:03:47.030> 360-degree

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
the oxygen actually has a cop 360-degree

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.099 
the oxygen actually has a cop 360-degree
cockpit<00:03:48.569> first<00:03:49.280> but<00:03:50.280> having<00:03:51.060> not<00:03:51.510> won<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.810> bid

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
cockpit first but having not won the bid

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.920 
cockpit first but having not won the bid
for<00:03:52.319> mass<00:03:52.469> production<00:03:53.450> when<00:03:54.450> they<00:03:54.569> decide<00:03:54.900> to

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
for mass production when they decide to

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.860 
for mass production when they decide to
make<00:03:55.230> Amuro<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.769> new<00:03:55.980> gun<00:03:56.219> them<00:03:56.400> with<00:03:56.969> the<00:03:57.239> Alex

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
make Amuro a new gun them with the Alex

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.140 
make Amuro a new gun them with the Alex
gun<00:03:58.109> them<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.950> know<00:03:59.069> built<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.700> new<00:03:59.879> types

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
gun them you know built the new types

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.289 
gun them you know built the new types
they<00:04:00.599> stole<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.139> idea<00:04:01.439> of<00:04:02.250> having<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.670> 360

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
they stole the idea of having a 360

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.170 
they stole the idea of having a 360
panoramic<00:04:04.109> view<00:04:04.579> but<00:04:05.579> as<00:04:05.669> you<00:04:05.730> could<00:04:05.819> see<00:04:05.879> the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
panoramic view but as you could see the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.140 
panoramic view but as you could see the
the<00:04:06.209> design<00:04:06.900> is<00:04:07.200> different<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.790> this<00:04:09.090> is

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
the design is different and and this is

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.229 
the design is different and and this is
partially<00:04:09.689> for<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.349> ease<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.530> filming<00:04:11.280> that

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
partially for the ease of filming that

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.409 
partially for the ease of filming that
inspired<00:04:12.629> the<00:04:12.810> design<00:04:12.989> cuz<00:04:13.639> the<00:04:14.639> truth<00:04:14.909> is<00:04:15.120> I

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
inspired the design cuz the truth is I

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:16.839 
inspired the design cuz the truth is I
could<00:04:15.629> have<00:04:15.659> just<00:04:15.900> had<00:04:16.049> a<00:04:16.079> seat<00:04:16.470> and

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849 
could have just had a seat and

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:19.789 
could have just had a seat and
green-screen<00:04:17.849> the<00:04:18.329> pilot<00:04:18.750> in<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.169> little<00:04:19.500> you

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
green-screen the pilot in and little you

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.439 
green-screen the pilot in and little you
know<00:04:19.919> things<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.459> make<00:04:20.699> him<00:04:20.880> look<00:04:21.180> like<00:04:21.239> he's

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
know things to make him look like he's

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.800 
know things to make him look like he's
in<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.780> big<00:04:21.930> cockpit<00:04:22.500> but<00:04:23.310> I<00:04:23.550> like<00:04:24.000> tangible

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
in a big cockpit but I like tangible

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.110 
in a big cockpit but I like tangible
sets<00:04:25.139> that's<00:04:25.620> why<00:04:26.009> I<00:04:26.039> have<00:04:26.370> all<00:04:26.520> these<00:04:26.699> trees

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
sets that's why I have all these trees

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.150 
sets that's why I have all these trees
and<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.690> sky<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:27.960> don't<00:04:28.139> green-screen<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.949> sky

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
and the sky I don't green-screen the sky

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.110 
and the sky I don't green-screen the sky
in<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.340> trees<00:04:29.520> in<00:04:29.669> because<00:04:29.880> they're<00:04:30.000> gonna

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
in the trees in because they're gonna

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.050 
in the trees in because they're gonna
look<00:04:30.419> like<00:04:30.479> they're<00:04:30.750> green<00:04:31.139> screened<00:04:31.530> in<00:04:32.060> for

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
look like they're green screened in for

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.550 
look like they're green screened in for
our<00:04:33.150> space<00:04:33.479> stuff<00:04:33.750> we<00:04:33.930> have<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.139> do<00:04:34.259> a<00:04:34.289> lot<00:04:34.530> of

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
our space stuff we have to do a lot of

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.010 
our space stuff we have to do a lot of
that<00:04:34.800> but<00:04:35.280> of<00:04:35.490> green<00:04:36.180> screening<00:04:36.510> but<00:04:36.810> I

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
that but of green screening but I

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.379 
that but of green screening but I
believe<00:04:37.409> things<00:04:38.220> look<00:04:38.490> best<00:04:38.699> when<00:04:38.880> you<00:04:39.000> have<00:04:39.180> a

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
believe things look best when you have a

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.990 
believe things look best when you have a
tangible<00:04:39.900> set<00:04:40.260> and<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:41.430> great<00:04:41.639> thing<00:04:41.909> about

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
tangible set and the great thing about

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.990 
tangible set and the great thing about
this<00:04:42.389> is<00:04:43.039> the<00:04:44.039> camera<00:04:44.310> can't<00:04:44.520> go<00:04:44.639> on<00:04:44.729> super

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
this is the camera can't go on super

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.640 
this is the camera can't go on super
macro<00:04:45.210> in<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.599> modes<00:04:45.810> in<00:04:46.110> at<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.470> moment

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
macro in the modes in at the moment

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.670 
macro in the modes in at the moment
where<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.550> pilot<00:04:47.820> won't<00:04:47.940> be<00:04:48.120> all<00:04:48.240> fuzzy<00:04:48.720> but

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
where the pilot won't be all fuzzy but

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.879 
where the pilot won't be all fuzzy but
when<00:04:50.370> we<00:04:50.520> film<00:04:50.909> that<00:04:51.120> can<00:04:51.330> be<00:04:51.510> but<00:04:52.260> I<00:04:52.409> can<00:04:52.650> drop

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
when we film that can be but I can drop

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.930 
when we film that can be but I can drop
this<00:04:53.430> cockpit<00:04:53.940> into<00:04:54.690> any<00:04:54.930> setting<00:04:55.760> you<00:04:56.760> know

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
this cockpit into any setting you know

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.640 
this cockpit into any setting you know
and<00:04:57.320> I<00:04:58.639> mean<00:04:59.639> pretty<00:04:59.880> much<00:05:00.090> watch<00:05:01.020> this<00:05:01.349> watch

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
and I mean pretty much watch this watch

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.230 
and I mean pretty much watch this watch
this

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240

cockpits into any set I want so I can

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:50.500 
cockpits into any set I want so I can
you<00:05:41.939> know<00:05:42.000> fly
