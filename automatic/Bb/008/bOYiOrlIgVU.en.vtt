00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.259 
they ask me how do you stretch your ears
the<00:00:29.130> first<00:00:29.369> way<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.550> stretch<00:00:29.789> ears<00:00:30.090> is

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the first way to stretch ears is

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.549 
the first way to stretch ears is
obviously<00:00:30.689> getting<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.080> taper<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.710> taper<00:00:32.489> is

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.310 

it's<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:38.600> it<00:00:39.600> looks<00:00:40.280> small<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.670> point

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
it's this it looks small at one point

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.380 
it's this it looks small at one point
and<00:00:43.320> then<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.559> gets<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.309> flat<00:00:44.820> surface<00:00:44.850> at

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and then it gets to a flat surface at

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.630 
and then it gets to a flat surface at
the<00:00:45.510> other<00:00:45.600> point<00:00:45.899> which<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.250> size<00:00:47.610> you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the other point which is a size you

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.819 
the other point which is a size you
would<00:00:47.940> go<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.140> currently<00:00:49.440> my<00:00:49.590> four

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
would go and this is currently my four

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.990 
would go and this is currently my four
gauge<00:00:49.980> taper<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:52.320> yeah<00:00:52.770> Lulu<00:00:53.399> taper<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:53.940> I

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
always used to do it would be um don't

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.790 
always used to do it would be um don't
ever<00:00:57.180> dead<00:00:57.360> stretch<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:58.020> dead<00:00:58.260> stretch<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.649> when

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
ever dead stretch a dead stretch is when

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.220 
ever dead stretch a dead stretch is when
you<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:00.300> no<00:01:00.449> lubricant<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
you just do it in with no lubricant and

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.979 
you just do it in with no lubricant and
if<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:01.949> use<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> lubricant<00:01:02.520> use<00:01:02.879> oil<00:01:03.329> like

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
if you can use a lubricant use oil like

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.920 
if you can use a lubricant use oil like
Kohala<00:01:04.710> vitamin<00:01:05.129> e<00:01:05.339> those<00:01:06.240> are<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.420> oils<00:01:06.689> I

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
Kohala vitamin e those are the oils I

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.410 
Kohala vitamin e those are the oils I
recommend<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.650> stretching<00:01:08.240> pretty<00:01:09.240> much

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
