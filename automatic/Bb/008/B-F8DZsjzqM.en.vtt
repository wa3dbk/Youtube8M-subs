00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
i'll show you guys how to do them

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.230 
i'll show you guys how to do them
they're<00:02:51.320> really<00:02:51.560> simple<00:02:51.950> stay<00:02:52.760> tuned<00:02:53.000> for

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
they're really simple stay tuned for

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.460 
they're really simple stay tuned for
that<00:02:53.270> but<00:02:53.720> this<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.230> 4<00:02:54.800> x<00:02:55.010> 3<00:02:55.400> x<00:02:55.610> 3<00:02:56.470> opening

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
that but this is it 4 x 3 x 3 opening

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.430 
that but this is it 4 x 3 x 3 opening
the<00:02:57.950> house<00:02:58.100> heart<00:02:58.430> door<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:59.440> that's

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
basically it so stay tuned maybe next

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.140 
basically it so stay tuned maybe next
week<00:03:03.740> i'll<00:03:03.860> do<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.010> video<00:03:04.190> on<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.670> enclosures
