build quality when discussing the build

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.430 
build quality when discussing the build
quality<00:02:48.250> are<00:02:48.670> these<00:02:48.970> cracks<00:02:49.540> or<00:02:49.959> one<00:02:50.260> not

cracks these lines that separate the
screen<00:02:52.570> from<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.080> metal<00:02:53.380> there's<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.160> little

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
screen from the metal there's a little

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.270 
screen from the metal there's a little
bit<00:02:54.820> of<00:02:54.880> space<00:02:55.270> between<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.990> met<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.890> metal

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
bit of space between the met the metal

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.040 
bit of space between the met the metal
and<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.490> screen<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:59.020> same<00:02:59.230> is<00:02:59.410> here<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:01.050> the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
and the screen the same is here and the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.690 
and the screen the same is here and the
spacing<00:03:02.560> between<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.920> screen<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.490> metal

spacing between the screen and the metal

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.080 
spacing between the screen and the metal
can<00:03:04.480> easily<00:03:04.840> go<00:03:04.990> and<00:03:05.200> collect<00:03:05.320> dust<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:06.090> think

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
can easily go and collect dust I think

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.860 
can easily go and collect dust I think
this<00:03:07.209> is<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:08.370> not<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.400> good<00:03:09.670> thing<00:03:09.940> for<00:03:10.209> a

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
this is a not a good thing for a

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.170 
this is a not a good thing for a
manufacturer<00:03:11.800> of<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:12.100> phone<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.459> do<00:03:12.610> they

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
manufacturer of a phone to do they

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.500 
manufacturer of a phone to do they
should<00:03:13.240> have<00:03:13.600> put<00:03:14.410> this<00:03:14.590> better<00:03:14.920> together<00:03:15.510> so

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
should have put this better together so

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.509 
should have put this better together so
that<00:03:16.540> there<00:03:16.900> was<00:03:17.110> no<00:03:17.290> space<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:17.620> between<00:03:17.860> the

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
that there was no space in between the

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.550 
that there was no space in between the
screen<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.030> phone<00:03:19.330> and<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:20.230> metal<00:03:20.410> I

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
screen and the phone and the metal I

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.550 
screen and the phone and the metal I
mean<00:03:22.830> all<00:03:23.830> right<00:03:24.100> then<00:03:24.340> on<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:24.610> hardware

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
mean all right then on to the hardware

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.220 
mean all right then on to the hardware
first<00:03:26.560> of<00:03:26.709> all<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:27.100> screen<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:28.750> screen<00:03:28.900> of

the jod 3 is really good it's real nice

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.770 
the jod 3 is really good it's real nice
and<00:03:34.900> bright<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.470> viewing<00:03:35.890> angles<00:03:36.250> are<00:03:36.519> good

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
and bright the viewing angles are good

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.390 
and bright the viewing angles are good
I've<00:03:37.780> heard<00:03:38.050> someone<00:03:38.530> say<00:03:38.800> that<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.160> color

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
I've heard someone say that the color

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.270 
I've heard someone say that the color
reproduction<00:03:40.150> is<00:03:40.330> not<00:03:40.660> very<00:03:40.870> good<00:03:40.959> but<00:03:41.890> well

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
reproduction is not very good but well

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.640 
reproduction is not very good but well
okay<00:03:42.940> I<00:03:43.470> don't<00:03:44.470> think<00:03:44.560> that's<00:03:44.860> very<00:03:44.920> important

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
okay I don't think that's very important

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.539 
okay I don't think that's very important
it<00:03:47.650> looked<00:03:47.920> really<00:03:48.100> nice<00:03:48.370> in<00:03:48.690> my<00:03:49.690> opinion<00:03:50.549> the

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
it looked really nice in my opinion the

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.940 
it looked really nice in my opinion the
other<00:03:51.700> hardware<00:03:52.209> like<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.350> camera<00:03:53.739> for

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
other hardware like the camera for

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.720 
other hardware like the camera for
instance<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:55.170> not<00:03:56.170> very<00:03:56.410> good<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:57.280> photos

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
instance is not very good the photos

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.860 
instance is not very good the photos
which<00:03:58.330> it<00:03:58.570> takes<00:03:58.769> leg<00:03:59.769> detail<00:04:00.750> because<00:04:01.750> the

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
which it takes leg detail because the

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.640 
which it takes leg detail because the
compression<00:04:02.410> is<00:04:02.530> pretty<00:04:03.360> aggressive<00:04:04.650> there's

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
compression is pretty aggressive there's

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.350 
compression is pretty aggressive there's
because<00:04:06.040> there's<00:04:06.250> no<00:04:06.549> detail<00:04:06.940> there's<00:04:07.180> also

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
because there's no detail there's also

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.000 
because there's no detail there's also
no<00:04:07.630> sharpness<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.900> video<00:04:11.200> this<00:04:11.410> this<00:04:11.650> camera

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
no sharpness the video this this camera

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.509 
no sharpness the video this this camera
records<00:04:12.489> is<00:04:12.670> also<00:04:13.090> quite<00:04:13.299> bad<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:14.739> maximum

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.850 
once you view them on a computer or TV
they<00:04:26.889> look<00:04:27.190> really<00:04:28.090> below<00:04:28.449> average<00:04:31.860> another

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
they look really below average another

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.060 
they look really below average another
good<00:04:33.190> point<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.729> this<00:04:33.940> phone<00:04:34.240> is<00:04:34.419> a<00:04:34.479> battery

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
good point of this phone is a battery
