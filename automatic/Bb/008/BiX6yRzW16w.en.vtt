hey<00:00:06.330> guys<00:00:06.569> Chris<00:00:06.960> here<00:00:07.160> today<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.189> want<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.370> be

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
hey guys Chris here today I want to be

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.520 
hey guys Chris here today I want to be
showing<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.760> how<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:08.940> allocate<00:00:09.240> more<00:00:09.870> RAM<00:00:10.139> for

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
showing you how to allocate more RAM for

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.610 
showing you how to allocate more RAM for
your<00:00:10.650> minecraft<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.090> can<00:00:12.210> get<00:00:12.420> a

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
your minecraft so that you can get a

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.499 
your minecraft so that you can get a
performance<00:00:13.620> boost<00:00:14.269> from<00:00:15.269> it

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
performance boost from it

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.560 
performance boost from it
and<00:00:15.630> also<00:00:16.109> be<00:00:16.500> able<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.850> install<00:00:17.850> more<00:00:18.060> mods<00:00:18.359> at

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
and also be able to install more mods at

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.380 
and also be able to install more mods at
once<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.770> maybe<00:00:20.010> even<00:00:20.310> HD<00:00:20.670> tech<00:00:21.029> specs

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
once and maybe even HD tech specs

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.410 
once and maybe even HD tech specs
without<00:00:22.289> your<00:00:22.500> minecraft<00:00:22.890> lagging<00:00:23.420> so

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
without your minecraft lagging so

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.429 
without your minecraft lagging so
allocating<00:00:25.140> more<00:00:25.289> RAM<00:00:25.529> will<00:00:26.369> help<00:00:26.990> if<00:00:27.990> you're

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
allocating more RAM will help if you're

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.659 
allocating more RAM will help if you're
looking<00:00:28.769> into<00:00:29.179> doing<00:00:30.179> those<00:00:30.449> things<00:00:30.689> now

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
looking into doing those things now

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.360 
looking into doing those things now
basically<00:00:33.530> yeah<00:00:34.530> first<00:00:34.920> thing<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.190> guys<00:00:35.309> want

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
basically yeah first thing you guys want

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.400 
basically yeah first thing you guys want
to<00:00:35.790> want<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.480> actually<00:00:36.690> find<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.260> how

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
to want to do is actually find out how

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.910 
to want to do is actually find out how
much<00:00:37.559> RAM<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.920> have<00:00:38.540> okay<00:00:39.590> some<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.770> may

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
much RAM you have okay some of you may

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.410 
much RAM you have okay some of you may
know<00:00:41.070> from<00:00:41.280> memory<00:00:41.489> from<00:00:41.700> when<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.270> bought

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
know from memory from when you bought

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.479 
know from memory from when you bought
the<00:00:42.540> computer<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.469> if<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.710> don't<00:00:43.980> know<00:00:44.219> how

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the computer but if you don't know how

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.970 
the computer but if you don't know how
much<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.320> easy<00:00:46.590> you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
much you have then it's really easy you

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.360 
much you have then it's really easy you
can<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.610> go<00:00:47.780> control-alt-delete<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.370> then

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
can just go control-alt-delete and then

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.479 
can just go control-alt-delete and then
go<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> start<00:00:51.270> task<00:00:51.570> manager<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.289> then<00:00:53.070> once

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
go to start task manager and then once

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.819 
go to start task manager and then once
you<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> task<00:00:54.090> manager<00:00:54.329> open<00:00:54.800> go<00:00:55.800> to

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
you have the task manager open go to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.279 
you have the task manager open go to
performance<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.199> then<00:00:58.399> it<00:00:59.399> will<00:00:59.550> tell<00:00:59.820> you

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
performance and then it will tell you

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.959 
performance and then it will tell you
down<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.739> says<00:01:01.770> physical<00:01:02.430> memory<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
down here it says physical memory and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.410 
down here it says physical memory and
then<00:01:03.390> total<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.739> I've<00:01:04.860> got<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> total<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.670> 8.1

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
then total so I've got a total of 8.1

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.260 
then total so I've got a total of 8.1
gigabytes<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.320> RAM<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.240> a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
gigabytes of RAM so if you have a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.289 
gigabytes of RAM so if you have a
thousand<00:01:09.890> ok<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.130> means<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.549> 1<00:01:11.820> gigabyte

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
thousand ok it means you have 1 gigabyte

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.370 
thousand ok it means you have 1 gigabyte
of<00:01:12.360> RAM<00:01:13.159> I<00:01:14.159> would<00:01:14.580> not<00:01:14.760> recommend<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.689> this

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
of RAM I would not recommend you do this

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.240 
of RAM I would not recommend you do this
method<00:01:16.909> I<00:01:18.650> would<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:19.799> recommend<00:01:20.070> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
method I would not recommend you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.219 
method I would not recommend you
allocate<00:01:20.640> more<00:01:20.790> RAM<00:01:21.030> unless<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.170> a

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
allocate more RAM unless you have a

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.899 
allocate more RAM unless you have a
minimum<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.890> 4<00:01:23.369> gigs

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
minimum of 4 gigs

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.980 
minimum of 4 gigs
ok<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.100> 4<00:01:26.430> gigs<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.820> RAM<00:01:27.060> then<00:01:27.450> you

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
ok so if you have 4 gigs of RAM then you

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.690 
ok so if you have 4 gigs of RAM then you
should<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.290> good<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.470> go<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.490> have

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
should be good to go but if you have

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.510 
should be good to go but if you have
less<00:01:30.030> than<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.140> would<00:01:31.560> stay<00:01:32.280> away

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
less than that then I would stay away

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.870 
less than that then I would stay away
from<00:01:32.549> doing<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.119> since<00:01:34.460> your<00:01:35.460> computer

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
from doing this since your computer

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.899 
from doing this since your computer
needs<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.360> RAM<00:01:36.570> elsewhere<00:01:37.280> instead<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.369> you

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
needs the RAM elsewhere instead of you

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.560 
needs the RAM elsewhere instead of you
know<00:01:38.939> allocating<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.689> all<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.930> Minecraft<00:01:41.570> so

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
know allocating it all to Minecraft so

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.480 
know allocating it all to Minecraft so
I've<00:01:43.020> got<00:01:43.200> eight<00:01:43.380> gigs<00:01:43.649> about<00:01:43.890> gigabytes<00:01:44.369> I

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
I've got eight gigs about gigabytes I

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.730 
I've got eight gigs about gigabytes I
should<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.759> good<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.000> go<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.530> we<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.619> just

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
should be good to go so we can just

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.520 
should be good to go so we can just
close<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.149> now<00:01:48.149> if<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:49.200> check<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
close that now if you check the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.200 
close that now if you check the
description<00:01:50.070> there's<00:01:50.759> going<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.939> be<00:01:51.030> this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
description there's going to be this

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.420 
description there's going to be this
line<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.720> code<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.259> I'll<00:01:52.920> make<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.250> visible

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
line of code and I'll make it visible

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.380 
line of code and I'll make it visible
there<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.950> line<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.310> code<00:01:56.549> we're

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
there and this line of code we're

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.270 
there and this line of code we're
basically<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.930> put<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.500> our<00:01:58.619> launcher

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
basically going to put in our launcher

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.249 
basically going to put in our launcher
but<00:02:00.149> first<00:02:00.360> I'm<00:02:00.540> gonna<00:02:00.630> explain<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.200> it

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
but first I'm gonna explain what it

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.899 
but first I'm gonna explain what it
means<00:02:02.479> these<00:02:03.479> numbers<00:02:03.990> here<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:05.040> how<00:02:05.310> much<00:02:05.490> ram

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
means these numbers here is how much ram

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.999 
means these numbers here is how much ram
we<00:02:06.240> are<00:02:06.270> allocating<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:08.340> Minecraft<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:10.009> 2048

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
we are allocating to Minecraft so 2048

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.730 
we are allocating to Minecraft so 2048
we<00:02:11.879> are<00:02:11.970> allocating<00:02:12.360> 2048<00:02:13.230> key

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
we are allocating 2048 key

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.860 
we are allocating 2048 key
of<00:02:14.040> rain<00:02:14.340> for<00:02:14.670> Minecraft<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.360> believe<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.460> the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
of rain for Minecraft I believe the the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.760 
of rain for Minecraft I believe the the
default<00:02:19.670> Ram<00:02:20.670> which<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.810> used<00:02:22.170> for<00:02:22.290> Minecraft

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
default Ram which is used for Minecraft

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.030 
default Ram which is used for Minecraft
is<00:02:22.920> one<00:02:23.160> gigabyte<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.660> if<00:02:24.900> we<00:02:25.080> allocate<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.860> you

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
is one gigabyte so if we allocate to you

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.890 
is one gigabyte so if we allocate to you
by<00:02:26.220> two<00:02:26.280> basically<00:02:26.910> doubling<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.630> amount<00:02:27.660> of

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
by two basically doubling the amount of

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.030 
by two basically doubling the amount of
memory<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.860> minecraft<00:02:29.100> can<00:02:29.520> use<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:31.170> you

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
memory that minecraft can use so you

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.210 
memory that minecraft can use so you
guys<00:02:32.220> can<00:02:32.490> play<00:02:33.180> around<00:02:33.390> with<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.220> with

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
guys can play around with that and with

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.120 
guys can play around with that and with
how<00:02:35.340> much<00:02:35.490> RAM<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.930> want<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.440> allocate<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:38.100> I

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
how much RAM you want to allocate but I

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.590 
how much RAM you want to allocate but I
do<00:02:38.250> recommend<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:39.360> keep<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.560> as<00:02:40.710> used<00:02:41.130> as<00:02:41.600> 2

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
do recommend you keep it as used as 2

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.990 
do recommend you keep it as used as 2
gigabytes<00:02:43.140> now<00:02:44.010> if<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.250> do<00:02:44.400> notice<00:02:44.670> your

Minecraft then be sure to lower that
