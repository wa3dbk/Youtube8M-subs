with other water and make more water or
maybe<00:00:59.609> it's<00:00:59.789> doing<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.149> all<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.300> time<00:01:00.590> water

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
maybe it's doing that all the time water

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.479 
maybe it's doing that all the time water
is<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.949> one<00:01:02.270> constant<00:01:03.270> pour<00:01:03.480> no<00:01:03.629> gross<00:01:04.489> or

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
looking for life what if they don't have

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.819 
looking for life what if they don't have
things<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.180> are<00:01:54.420> cells<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.229> us<00:01:55.380> what<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.680> they

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
things that are cells to us what if they

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
have things that are more like salami

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.810 
have things that are more like salami

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
if they don't die what if they're just

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.080 
if they don't die what if they're just
there<00:02:01.439> all<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.490> time<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.939> they<00:02:03.000> don't

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
there all the time and they don't

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.969 
there all the time and they don't
reproduce<00:02:03.420> they're<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:04.020> thirds<00:02:04.530> there<00:02:04.829> but

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
reproduce they're just thirds there but

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.469 
reproduce they're just thirds there but
they<00:02:05.070> also<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.490> feelings<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:06.119> then<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:06.360> they

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
they also have feelings do then do they

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.089 
they also have feelings do then do they
have<00:02:06.509> life<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.110> dying<00:02:07.500> some<00:02:07.920> day<00:02:08.069> a

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
have life so is dying some day a

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.770 
have life so is dying some day a
requirement<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:08.940> having<00:02:09.149> life<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.690> I

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
requirement for having life so is it I

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
requirement for having life so is it I
think<00:02:10.110> therefore<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.530> am

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
think therefore I am

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.430 
think therefore I am
or<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.160> it

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
or is it

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.610 
or is it
I<00:02:11.470> think<00:02:11.890> grow<00:02:12.310> get<00:02:13.000> busy<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.390> bunch<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.320> die

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
I think grow get busy a bunch and die

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.920 
I think grow get busy a bunch and die
and<00:02:15.040> therefore<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.030> am<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.360> it's<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.540> very<00:02:16.750> tough

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
and therefore I am so it's a very tough

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.150 
and therefore I am so it's a very tough
question<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.350> seems<00:02:17.530> like<00:02:17.650> we're<00:02:17.800> defining

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
question it seems like we're defining

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.330 
question it seems like we're defining
life<00:02:18.370> as<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.520> process<00:02:19.000> like<00:02:19.240> photosynthesis<00:02:20.050> or

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
life as a process like photosynthesis or

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.240 
life as a process like photosynthesis or
collating<00:02:21.340> or<00:02:24.090> pooping<00:02:25.090> while<00:02:25.990> eating<00:02:26.440> then

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
collating or pooping while eating then

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.270 
collating or pooping while eating then
pooping<00:02:27.700> though<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:29.050> digestive<00:02:29.650> system

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.280 

I<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:32.970> wanted<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.240> say<00:02:33.360> pooping<00:02:33.750> okay<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.080> for

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
I just wanted to say pooping okay so for

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.720 
I just wanted to say pooping okay so for
the<00:02:34.350> sake<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.530> argument<00:02:34.830> let's<00:02:35.040> just<00:02:35.310> say<00:02:35.459> life

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
the sake of argument let's just say life

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.400 
the sake of argument let's just say life
is<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.150> time<00:02:36.270> between<00:02:36.450> when<00:02:36.630> you're<00:02:36.900> born<00:02:37.170> and

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
is the time between when you're born and

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.580 
is the time between when you're born and
when<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.920> die<00:02:38.069> not<00:02:38.310> Jason<00:02:38.819> Bourne<00:02:39.080> born<00:02:40.080> as<00:02:40.380> in

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
when you die not Jason Bourne born as in

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.650 
when you die not Jason Bourne born as in
you<00:02:40.830> have<00:02:41.040> been<00:02:41.190> birthed<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.880> your<00:02:42.330> your

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
you have been birthed in your your

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.840 
you have been birthed in your your
mother's<00:02:42.959> privates<00:02:43.950> throughout<00:02:44.700> through

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
mother's privates throughout through

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.490 
mother's privates throughout through
that<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.060> mean<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.300> emerged<00:02:45.660> from<00:02:45.840> them<00:02:46.230> okay

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
that I mean you emerged from them okay

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.230 
that I mean you emerged from them okay
enough<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.010> now<00:02:47.190> as<00:02:47.400> for<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.670> meaning<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.180> life

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
enough of now as for the meaning of life

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.479 
enough of now as for the meaning of life
oh<00:02:48.660> geez<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.290> don't<00:02:50.130> want<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.310> generalize

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
oh geez I don't want to generalize

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.490 
oh geez I don't want to generalize
because<00:02:51.150> generalization<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.230> bad<00:02:52.470> idea

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
because generalization is a bad idea

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.309 
because generalization is a bad idea
always<00:02:53.340> always<00:02:53.640> for<00:02:54.180> me<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.840> meaning<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.170> life

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
always always for me the meaning of life

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.820 
always always for me the meaning of life
is<00:02:55.530> into<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.580> between<00:02:56.880> time<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.690> like<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.650> try

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
is into that between time I like to try

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.590 
is into that between time I like to try
