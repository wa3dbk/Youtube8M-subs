 safe driving tips for motorcycles and mopeds 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.190
 14% 5% of the vehicles are motorcycles and mopeds and the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.409
 percentage is continuously increasing 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:17.179
 with the bike, avoid traffic jams and park better but you have to take 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.900
 account that in the coexistence with other vehicles the motorist is the most

 weak 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.800
 the safety on the bike the helmet 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.100
 obviously you have to use the helmet to use it means to wear it correctly 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.589
 fastened and adjusted 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:31.899
 how to choose it 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.500
 Find a place where they can advise you 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.030
 the integrals are safer but in any case they have to be approved and 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.450
 be your size 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.190
 the sar report evaluates the level of safety offered by helmets 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.070
 the helmets expire their useful life is about five years but you'll have to 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.750
 change it before if it receives a strong impact 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.750
 It can be perfect on the outside and deteriorated inside 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.560
 the safety of a motorcycle driving 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.350
 the fragility of the bike makes a double anticipation necessary before any 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.760
 unexpected 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.409
 provides for the maneuvers of other vehicles such as lane changes and turns 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.880
 and clouds of course they have seen you 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.830
 for example in a street with cars parked in battery, keep in mind that 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.860
 probably will not see you until they have half a car outside 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.580
 see if there are cars that are going to start up with people inside with lights and 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.940
 so you will avoid scares avoid the blind spot of the rear view mirror of the 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.750
 vehicles circulate and decent in a position where you are sure that 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.760
 can see you do not trust you when the traffic is intense braking occur 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.330
 brusque it is advisable to go with your fingers ready to brake 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.980
 remember that the front brake supports most of the braking but the 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.520
 rear 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.000
 It is necessary to stabilize the bike and not go to the ground 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.420
 and also keep the safe distance learn to read the signals and 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.869
 not just traffic 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.530
 If there are works on the road, it is likely that the asphalt is full of gravel or 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.750
 ground if it rains pavement paint or metal bars 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:01.940
 they will slip even more 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.210
 soften your movements do not make sudden maneuvers avoid the cracks that 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.200
 they are formed in the roadway because the wheel of the motorcycle can fit and the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.329
 Exit will be complicated 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.129
 on a motorcycle, especially on long trips, a natural and relaxed posture is 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.209
 fundamental 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.349
 a forced position will not only make you tired before but will slow down 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.429
 response times 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:29.619
 do not drive more than 150 kilometers today an hour and a half without stopping as 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.839
 accumulate fatigue for more often 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.709
 in curves the safest and easiest rule 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:36.980
 at lower visibility 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.459
 reduce the speed and take the curve stuck to the right 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.930
 If you go out in a group, indicate to the rest the possible dangers but never sometimes 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.389
 others when can they overtake 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.430
 do not circulate in parallel and keep the safety distance 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.779
 drive with your head 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:56.169
