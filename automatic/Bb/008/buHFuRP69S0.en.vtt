00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
the prices for the seats for the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.210 
the prices for the seats for the
pay-per-view<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.950> maybe<00:02:44.100> the

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
pay-per-view and maybe the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.610 
pay-per-view and maybe the
closed-circuit<00:02:44.520> as<00:02:44.790> well<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.780> it's<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.380> shame

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
closed-circuit as well so it's a shame

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.830 
closed-circuit as well so it's a shame
but<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.100> will<00:02:47.520> say<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.940> everyone<00:02:48.660> doesn't

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
but I will say this everyone doesn't

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.390 
but I will say this everyone doesn't
have<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:49.380> chance<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.770> see<00:02:49.920> whether<00:02:50.220> it's

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
have a chance to see whether it's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.460 
have a chance to see whether it's
pay-per-view<00:02:50.790> or<00:02:50.910> closed-circuit<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.660> I

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
pay-per-view or closed-circuit and I

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.020 
pay-per-view or closed-circuit and I
think<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.250> it's<00:02:53.400> going<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.610> be<00:02:53.700> one<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:53.970> those

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
think that it's going to be one of those

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.880 
think that it's going to be one of those
events<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.720> we<00:02:54.840> can<00:02:54.990> tell<00:02:55.140> generations<00:02:55.740> from

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
events that we can tell generations from

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.490 
events that we can tell generations from
now<00:02:55.980> hey<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.550> was<00:02:56.820> there<00:02:57.060> or<00:02:57.270> I<00:02:57.300> saw<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.930> live<00:02:58.170> and

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
now hey I was there or I saw it live and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.070 
now hey I was there or I saw it live and
you<00:02:58.860> know<00:02:58.950> we<00:02:59.310> got<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.580> pay-per-view<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.480> so

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
you know we got the pay-per-view and so

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.320 
you know we got the pay-per-view and so
I<00:03:01.380> think<00:03:02.010> it's<00:03:02.100> gonna<00:03:02.220> be<00:03:02.400> very<00:03:02.430> well<00:03:02.820> worth<00:03:03.000> it

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
I think it's gonna be very well worth it

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.510 
I think it's gonna be very well worth it
another<00:03:03.990> knock<00:03:04.200> obviously<00:03:04.770> is<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.070> it

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
another knock obviously is that it

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.880 
another knock obviously is that it
should<00:03:05.670> have<00:03:05.760> happened<00:03:05.850> in<00:03:06.090> 2010<00:03:06.690> not<00:03:06.960> 2015

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
should have happened in 2010 not 2015

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.010 
should have happened in 2010 not 2015

for boxing there's a lot of interest in

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.100 
for boxing there's a lot of interest in
boxing<00:03:39.420> right<00:03:39.780> now<00:03:39.960> and<00:03:40.580> I<00:03:41.780> think<00:03:42.780> it's<00:03:42.900> coming

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
boxing right now and I think it's coming

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.260 
boxing right now and I think it's coming
at<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.440> good<00:03:43.920> time<00:03:44.130> that's<00:03:44.700> all<00:03:44.850> I<00:03:44.880> can<00:03:45.030> say<00:03:45.150> I

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
at a good time that's all I can say I

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.730 
at a good time that's all I can say I
don't<00:03:45.390> know<00:03:45.570> when<00:03:45.840> would<00:03:45.990> be<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.290> best<00:03:46.500> but

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
don't know when would be the best but

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.170 
don't know when would be the best but
it's<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.950> very<00:03:47.280> good<00:03:47.400> time<00:03:47.760> right<00:03:48.000> now<00:03:48.150> and

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
it's a very good time right now and

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.580 
it's a very good time right now and
that's<00:03:48.510> why<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.660> predict<00:03:49.050> this<00:03:49.140> will<00:03:49.320> be<00:03:49.440> the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
that's why I predict this will be the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.640 
that's why I predict this will be the
biggest<00:03:50.250> fight<00:03:50.400> ever<00:03:50.670> ever<00:03:51.630> seen<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.380> it's

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
biggest fight ever ever seen so it's

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.810 
biggest fight ever ever seen so it's
gonna<00:03:52.770> break<00:03:52.950> pretty<00:03:53.190> much<00:03:53.310> all<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.520> records

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
gonna break pretty much all the records

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.150 
gonna break pretty much all the records

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
I will predict it'll break all records
