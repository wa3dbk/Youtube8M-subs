to accomplish you know the reef runner

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.700 
to accomplish you know the reef runner
is<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.360> great<00:00:18.600> crankbait<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.530> get<00:00:19.620> this

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
is a great crankbait we can get this

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.350 
is a great crankbait we can get this
down<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.040> about<00:00:20.070> 28<00:00:20.580> feet<00:00:20.610> but<00:00:20.970> I'd<00:00:21.090> have<00:00:21.240> to

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
down to about 28 feet but I'd have to

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.480 
down to about 28 feet but I'd have to
let<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.600> back<00:00:21.720> 200<00:00:22.500> feet<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.800> accomplish<00:00:23.310> that

using a tadpole diver I can take this

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.980 
using a tadpole diver I can take this
same<00:00:26.190> crank<00:00:26.550> bait<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.970> get<00:00:27.120> it<00:00:27.210> down<00:00:27.330> 28<00:00:27.780> feet

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
serving on our line counter and letting

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.930 
serving on our line counter and letting
our<00:00:33.179> reef<00:00:33.390> runner<00:00:33.570> back<00:00:33.780> about<00:00:34.199> 20<00:00:34.620> feet<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.640> 30

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
our reef runner back about 20 feet to 30

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.119 
our reef runner back about 20 feet to 30
feet<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:37.289> this<00:00:37.379> instance<00:00:37.589> I'm<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:38.070> to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.809 
feet and in this instance I'm going to
go<00:00:38.219> ahead<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.489> go<00:00:38.550> at<00:00:38.640> let<00:00:38.789> out<00:00:38.909> 30<00:00:39.210> feet<00:00:39.769> and

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:40.819 
go ahead and go at let out 30 feet and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:43.459 
go ahead and go at let out 30 feet and
then<00:00:41.819> what<00:00:42.149> I'm<00:00:42.239> gonna<00:00:42.359> do<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.809> I'm<00:00:43.289> going<00:00:43.409> to

are sixteen I'm going to put it on to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.810 
are sixteen I'm going to put it on to
the<00:01:03.600> line<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.080> what's<00:01:04.770> happening<00:01:05.160> now<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the line so what's happening now is the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.410 
the line so what's happening now is the
tadpole<00:01:06.300> is<00:01:06.540> attached<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.350> line<00:01:08.070> alright<00:01:08.850> so

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
tadpole is attached in line alright so

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.210 
tadpole is attached in line alright so
when<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> take<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.110> tadpole<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.680> drop<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.130> in

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
when I take this tadpole and drop it in

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.590 
when I take this tadpole and drop it in
the<00:01:11.310> water<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.820> actually<00:01:12.030> going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.420> start

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the water it's actually going to start

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.590 
the water it's actually going to start
diving<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.260> pulling<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.250> crank<00:01:14.460> bait<00:01:14.670> down<00:01:14.850> so

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
diving in pulling the crank bait down so

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.060 
diving in pulling the crank bait down so
what<00:01:15.690> I'll<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:15.960> I'll<00:01:16.170> zero<00:01:16.410> out<00:01:16.560> my<00:01:16.710> counter

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
what I'll do is I'll zero out my counter

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.000 
what I'll do is I'll zero out my counter
again<00:01:17.340> now<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.930> let<00:01:19.140> out<00:01:19.290> additional

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
again now and I can let out additional

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.790 
again now and I can let out additional
line<00:01:20.250> as<00:01:20.550> much<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.750> need<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
line as much as I need to get the

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.560 
line as much as I need to get the
tadpole<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.550> depth<00:01:23.760> that<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.000> want<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
tadpole to the depth that I want and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.850 
tadpole to the depth that I want and
right<00:01:24.690> now<00:01:24.840> what<00:01:25.050> seems<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.380> working<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
right now what seems to be working the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.630 
right now what seems to be working the
best<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.250> us

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
best for us

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.300 
best for us
30-foot<00:01:27.150> lead<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.720> then<00:01:28.410> behind<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.980> we're

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
30-foot lead and then behind that we're

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.180 
30-foot lead and then behind that we're
letting<00:01:29.460> out<00:01:29.700> 60<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.780> 90<00:01:31.200> foot<00:01:31.410> additional

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
letting out 60 to 90 foot additional

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.760 
letting out 60 to 90 foot additional
lead<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:33.600> that's<00:01:34.020> what's<00:01:34.260> getting<00:01:34.440> this<00:01:34.620> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
lead and that's what's getting this to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.350 
lead and that's what's getting this to
the<00:01:34.890> depth<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.250> we're<00:01:35.370> trying<00:01:35.580> to<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:36.180> catch
