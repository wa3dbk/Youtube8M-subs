00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:08.030
 hello friends how about here I bring you a 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.030
 little quick and effective tutorial without more 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.340
 good for those who have their 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:19.960
 terminal sony xperia is with the logo 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:24.050
 infinite work as you want to call it 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:28.330
 for wanting to put a new room things 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:31.720
 of these and that in some step 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.239
 since the operation failed them and the 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.850
 phone does not turn on or it simply 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.210
 it was in the logo of the beginning 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.910
 This is the fastest and most effective solution 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.280
 do not look in this program 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.040
 and many tutorials with flash flash tool 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.150
 It did not help us at all 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:58.270
 I was three days with my cell phone like this 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.550
 that was not good for anything 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.970
 he learned it and he kept the logo of 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.310
 start 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:09.490
 Do not pull forward or backward 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.530
 well after three days 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.520
 it occurred to me to come here to hyper zone 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.520
 shake company 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.690
 the easiest 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.520
 and simple super simple 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.520
 let's lose sony ps company yum 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.460
 we open it 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.439
 and this option will appear 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.900
 this we have to do it remember in 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.230
 friends without the phone connected to 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.060
 computer 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.630
 if we do not see the description that 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.259
 we will see next 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.259
 then 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.640
 and we give it here 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.330

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.930

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.520
 approximately 5 hours 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.110
 but it will be worth it I assure you 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.450
 that if he continues 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.430
 this will take them here 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.560
 about 54 hours 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.989
 the penalty will be worth the wait because 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.840
 your mobile will fix it is like he will 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.660
