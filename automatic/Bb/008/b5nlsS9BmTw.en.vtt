look<00:00:00.210> at<00:00:00.329> the<00:00:00.390> bottom<00:00:00.539> of<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:00.810> heatsink<00:00:01.469> see

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
look at the bottom of the heatsink see

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.280 
look at the bottom of the heatsink see
this<00:00:02.490> ledge<00:00:02.700> here<00:00:02.970> let's<00:00:03.840> cut<00:00:03.990> out<00:00:04.080> of<00:00:04.200> there

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
this ledge here let's cut out of there

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.000 
this ledge here let's cut out of there
for<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.500> reason<00:00:04.759> look<00:00:05.759> at<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.910> shape<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.240> that

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
for a reason look at the shape of that

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.299 
for a reason look at the shape of that
notice<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:08.570> this<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:10.260> higher<00:00:10.679> elevation

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
notice this this is a higher elevation

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.839 
notice this this is a higher elevation
than<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.450> CPU<00:00:12.630> socket<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.250> ledge<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.670> cut

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
than the CPU socket so this ledge is cut

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.450 
than the CPU socket so this ledge is cut
out<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.269> go<00:00:15.299> up<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.809> over<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.470> CPU<00:00:16.980> socket

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
out to go up and over the CPU socket

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.099 
out to go up and over the CPU socket
this<00:00:18.119> could<00:00:18.300> make<00:00:18.420> all<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.630> difference<00:00:19.020> in

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
this could make all the difference in

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.840 
this could make all the difference in
the<00:00:19.170> world<00:00:19.350> if<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.070> put<00:00:20.220> on<00:00:20.340> backwards

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
the world if this is put on backwards

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.609 
the world if this is put on backwards
what'll<00:00:21.270> happen<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> heatsink<00:00:22.289> will<00:00:22.410> ramp

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
what'll happen is the heatsink will ramp

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.970 
what'll happen is the heatsink will ramp
up<00:00:22.830> onto<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.490> cam<00:00:23.789> box<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:25.500> CPU<00:00:25.859> will

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
up onto this cam box and the CPU will

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.099 
up onto this cam box and the CPU will
overheat<00:00:26.400> because<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.849> die<00:00:27.060> part<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> CPU

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
overheat because the die part of the CPU

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.599 
overheat because the die part of the CPU
that's<00:00:28.410> actually<00:00:28.769> generating<00:00:29.220> all<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> heat

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
that's actually generating all the heat

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.209 
that's actually generating all the heat
is<00:00:29.820> not<00:00:30.330> getting<00:00:30.599> proper<00:00:31.109> cooling<00:00:31.380> I've<00:00:32.040> seen

is not getting proper cooling I've seen

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.770 
is not getting proper cooling I've seen
a<00:00:32.250> lot<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.489> chips<00:00:32.730> die<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.149> way<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.480> real

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
a lot of chips die this way a real

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.290 
a lot of chips die this way a real
common<00:00:33.960> mistake<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.430> want<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
common mistake what you want to do is

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.479 
common mistake what you want to do is
just<00:00:36.450> make<00:00:36.630> sure<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.809> ledge<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.649> over<00:00:38.129> this

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
just make sure that ledge is over this

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.569 
just make sure that ledge is over this
cam<00:00:38.820> box<00:00:39.230> sure<00:00:40.230> most<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.129> time<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.520> means

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
cam box sure most of the time that means

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.280 
cam box sure most of the time that means
your<00:00:41.820> fan<00:00:42.000> wire<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.420> going<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.629> come<00:00:42.750> out<00:00:42.899> this

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
your fan wire is going to come out this

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.770 
your fan wire is going to come out this
side<00:00:43.850> that<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.059> means<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.570> to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
side that just means you just have to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.510 
side that just means you just have to
run<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.960> wire<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> little<00:00:46.500> curved<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:47.160> or

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
run the wire a little curved here or

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.549 
run the wire a little curved here or
have<00:00:47.670> even<00:00:47.940> some<00:00:48.090> seen<00:00:48.750> some<00:00:48.960> people<00:00:49.110> take<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
have even some seen some people take the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.619 
have even some seen some people take the
fan<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.950> turn<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.640> screw<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.239> back<00:00:51.420> down

this is a retail heatsink you can see
that<00:00:57.600> there's<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:57.930> pink<00:00:58.170> pad<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.530> thermal

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
that there's this pink pad of thermal

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.160 
that there's this pink pad of thermal
compound<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.210> most<00:01:00.660> commonly

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
compound on here this is most commonly

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.020 
compound on here this is most commonly
used<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.710> called<00:01:01.920> phase<00:01:02.190> change<00:01:02.609> thermal

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030

installed this backwards at any time you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.410 
installed this backwards at any time you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
would find that it's melted here these

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.969 
would find that it's melted here these

than they need to be and normally you

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.120 
than they need to be and normally you

Silver Company for example it's the same

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.139 
Silver Company for example it's the same
cover<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.500> makes<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> Antec<00:01:56.219> silver<00:01:56.670> has

worked on making the greases higher and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.310 
worked on making the greases higher and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
reason why thermal grease is not

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.209 
reason why thermal grease is not
recommended<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.290> because<00:02:04.590> typically<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.130> a

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
recommended is because typically it's a

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.789 
recommended is because typically it's a
low<00:02:05.340> viscosity<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:06.600> through<00:02:06.930> powering<00:02:07.710> up

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
low viscosity and through powering up

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
a good tight clip if they go off and on

a good tight clip if they go off and on
too<00:03:32.830> many<00:03:33.040> times<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.730> spring<00:03:34.030> steel<00:03:34.300> wears

out they don't hold down as tight and an
