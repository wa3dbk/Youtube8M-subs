well<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.140> tend<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.739> see<00:00:46.950> both<00:00:47.219> sides<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
well I tend to see both sides of the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.119 
well I tend to see both sides of the
argument<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.660> sit<00:00:48.989> right<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.739> fence<00:00:49.980> I

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
argument and I sit right on the fence I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.220 
argument and I sit right on the fence I
mean<00:00:50.280> let's<00:00:50.489> face<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.969> Russell<00:00:51.570> Westbrook<00:00:52.079> is

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
mean let's face it Russell Westbrook is

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.380 
mean let's face it Russell Westbrook is
probably<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.860> most<00:00:52.890> dynamic<00:00:53.460> point<00:00:54.000> guard<00:00:54.239> in

think there are more complete teams in
the<00:02:20.420> Western<00:02:20.750> Conference<00:02:20.810> than<00:02:21.379> the<00:02:21.469> Oklahoma

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
the Western Conference than the Oklahoma

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.830 
the Western Conference than the Oklahoma
City<00:02:22.189> Thunder<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.819> think<00:02:23.180> if<00:02:23.269> they<00:02:23.390> want<00:02:23.629> to<00:02:23.689> go

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840

City Thunder I think if they want to go
out<00:02:23.989> there<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.319> compete<00:02:24.439> they're<00:02:25.040> gonna<00:02:25.250> have

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
to put the load on both Kevin Durant and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.160 
to put the load on both Kevin Durant and
Russell<00:02:27.620> Westbrook<00:02:28.510> maybe<00:02:29.510> they<00:02:29.840> can<00:02:29.989> make

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
Russell Westbrook maybe they can make

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.869

something<00:02:30.439> happen<00:02:30.590> between<00:02:30.920> now<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.670> June

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
something happen between now and June

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.670 
something happen between now and June
