00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 most recently we talked about how 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.290
 choose a bike and listing classes we 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.780
 decided to tell you about the very 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.370
 spectacular in my personal opinion and types 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.889
 bicycle which began its 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.650
 existence in the late sixties 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.650
 which was considered motocross for silent 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.770
 hello to you lana and in this video 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.770
 from hello company i will tell you about bmx 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.410
 This class appeared as a result of that 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.570
 that the kids really wanted to participate in 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.790
 motocross but because of their age not 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.519
 had tolerances for it so the kids 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.409
 I cling to myself motorcycle equipment and chased 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.990
 on specially built tracks 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.170
 imitating motocross tracks namely 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.080
 so the bmx racing discipline appeared 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.680
 later added Flatland bmx bmx Wörth 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.649
 shit 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.479
 and bmx street flatland tricks on a flat 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.479
 surfaces are very spectacular 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.730
 dead tricks in ramp help and such a floor 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.650
 pipe 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.750
 when an athlete accelerates one by one 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.210
 slope and vertically flies up 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.070
 going up the second dear tricks on 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.260
 dirt track and dirt jumps 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.880
 which are usually huge 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.160
 hence in jumping from such 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.160
 springboards athlete flies higher and farther 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.740
 street tricks in an urban setting where 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.080
 such landscape elements are used 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.860
 like a bench rung railing curbs and 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.860
 other curbs 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.940
 key moment for any bmx 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.610
 is the strength of the frame 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.350
 this class has no depreciation 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.260
 therefore, the frame has to withstand 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.780
 enormous load frame essentially two 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.610
 triangle with a common base frame 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.410
 cheaper made of steel 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.110
 Well, those that are more expensive made of 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.330
 aluminum titanium or alloy steel 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.450
 that is, with the addition of chromium and molybdenum 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.580
 so stayed on the steering wheel in the vast 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.830
 most cases have a crossbar 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.440
 this element increases the strength of the steering wheel 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.880
 as well as a striking difference bmx from others 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.830
 classes are kogi 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.990
 they need to slip on everyones 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.850
 railing curb and for extra 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.730
 supports during the execution of elements 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.390
 flat they are made of plastic or 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.910
 become 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.610
 or chromium molybdenum alloy or 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.160
 titanium depending on the destination they are 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.900
 vary in length and diameter before and on 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.870
 any case I'll warn you
