00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
the greater I think this already get at

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.330 
the greater I think this already get at
least<00:05:21.270> an<00:05:22.080> eight<00:05:22.290> and<00:05:22.470> a<00:05:22.500> half<00:05:22.530> on<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:23.070> scale

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
least an eight and a half on the scale

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.510
