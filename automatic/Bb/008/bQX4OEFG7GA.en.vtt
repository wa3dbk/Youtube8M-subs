00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.160
 I'm going to show you how to repair the operating system 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.050
 in case this can not be detected when the error is shown 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.559
 mtl of recoil the first step what we should do is set rivers 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:14.429
 to start from the teheran unit 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.789
 then we must insert itself 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.789
 of installation of windows xp service pack 3 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.190
 we are going to 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.670
 in that case we're going to start the computer using 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.679
 avn inzko as 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.169
 and positive primary start 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.169
 press on the key when the list does not request it 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.950
 and with this the only thing we have to do is wait 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.420
 here it fits 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.240
 ee the whole package aa windows xp installer in this case not 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.270
 the procedure is the same only that we are not going to 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.680
 suddenly to install if we are not going to press the r key to repair the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.880
 system 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.880
 then we will use the special commands 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.390
 to be able to correct the primary sector 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.320
 and then we're going to replace some system files that are missing 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.330
 but I'm pretty simple 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.220
 and it can save us from a new nickname tremendous place reformat the windows 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.160
 we can choose to correct it 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
 If the seriousness of the problem is not that they are not complicated 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.910
 like we're going to the bottom 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.630
 is loading 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.340
 the windows installation program 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.670
 this is going to take about a minute 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.300
 we already leave normal load 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.300
 no we should not press any key 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.140
 project loins wait already finished the first stage 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.070
 and now he's going to ask me in which is the function that I want to perform 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.920
 in the bottom of or that I have 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.690
 laus who come 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.900
 to continue and then r to repair I'm going to press r 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.470
 right now I've asked myself if 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.440
 I wait patiently I will not give it 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.199
 In nothing 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.569
 by the way if I want to account an option appears 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.189
 with a second folder 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.369
 indicates that on that hard drive there is only one installation of venues of this 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.369
 operating system hit the key by its number one 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.819
 i mourners 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.869
 if you ask me when did you point 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:29.869
 morakot as much blank as it is going to sell 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:33.529
 correct 1 now let's write sms 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.879
 clean all the screen agreement 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.889
 now we are going to start correcting the operating system 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:45.899
 the first command that we are going to use is fix mdr 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.409
 let's write true fiction and let's go for your opponent 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:55.999
 asks me and a warning that I was fleeing about writing no percent and the sector 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.949
 primary sector hard disk master 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:00.289
 the problem 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:03.019
 there is no problem with that 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.259
 let's describe the black 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:07.329
 that and ender 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.319
 and there it is 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.379
 we have updated the 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.989
 baxter by record 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.319
 it is advisable to do it when a virus affects our system 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.429
 now let's go for 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:21.729
 correct the start a 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:25.099
 we saw the command put putin 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.840
 anyway we will not say laws as if in that case 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.239
 s 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.239
 if necessary we can do a disk check 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.879
 using the che sticks 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.889
 we receive chkdsk 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:44.569
 Right 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.569
 let's see the help we have available 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.069
 that and can not die for the hard disk use this command 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:54.519
 chk 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.869
 dsk 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:01.069
 unit 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.579
 islands 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.769
 the PR 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.800
 with that we could repair the hard drive if it had any damage not 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.059
 in this case as the hard disk does not present any fault 

00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:19.059
 everything be quick 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:24.069
 forget you the most important command we've seen so far is tics bush 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:27.099
 ix mdr 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.820
 percent the cdh lacks carÃ¡quez elche es 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.490
 diz allows digi-cards and the hard drive has errors and in case of 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.770
 find 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.770
 one allows you to correct 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:56.069
 koke and after loading the chelsea did 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.240
 What we still need to do is replace 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.260
 the two system files that should be damaged in the most 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:03.389
 important 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.300
 that's why we should know in which unit our installer 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.830
 would normally be the one hundred unit 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.639
 to check how you throw two points 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.849
 and we're going to write the dir command 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.680
 correct if the folders appear 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.069
 self robbery percent 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.820
 yes that parisi and you have 8 6 the folder two 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.819
 that means they are installer 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.819
 of windows then let's go back when forgetting 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.169
 Right 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.469
 what we are going to do is use the copy command 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.080
 copy 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.279
 let's write the drive where is the installer windows xp 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.479
 let's write the folder 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.449
 i 3 8 6 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.550
 which is a folder that is inside the installers 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.150
 and then because we were referencing the file called inite 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.110
 the leader of iu 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.349
 so I'm going to send all this to the children in 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.479
 let's place a slash bar 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.309
 famous for being a mentor 

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:16.219
 you ask yourself and wishes about if well n 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.219
 ndr I say yes 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:25.400
 I have already corrected it 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.400
 now we do the same with him feel the goat 

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:31.740
 space 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.740
 and what would come the reader 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.249
 i 3 8 6 which is a system folder inside the installer 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.460
 and the file that we're going to the clay abbot martinete 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.490
 dt 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.949
 so much with 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.259
 that we are going to copy it and we will automatically attach it 

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:55.309
 in unit c do not forget that to remove the block your use 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:58.460
 at 92 enter 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.460
 I wonder if I want to overwrite I say yes 

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.849
 kim indicative chivo been copied 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:07.849
 that's all after we will be subtracted by restarting the computer 

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:11.959
 send shipments the primary boot from the hard drive
