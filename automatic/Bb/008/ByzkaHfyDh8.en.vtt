got this camera for a review together
with<00:00:49.410> an<00:00:49.710> optional<00:00:50.250> extra<00:00:50.850> grip<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
with an optional extra grip this is the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.610 
with an optional extra grip this is the
one<00:00:52.110> over<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.190> costs<00:00:53.760> extra<00:00:54.050> $40<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.440> it

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
one over here it costs extra $40 and it

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.459 
one over here it costs extra $40 and it
should<00:00:55.800> allow<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:57.030> camera<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.660> more

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
should allow the camera to be more

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.450 
should allow the camera to be more
easily<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.920> hold<00:00:59.250> but<00:01:00.590> nevertheless<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:02.219> don't

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
easily to hold but nevertheless I don't

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.850 
easily to hold but nevertheless I don't
think<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.879> camera<00:01:03.270> handles<00:01:04.049> quite<00:01:04.290> good<00:01:04.530> as

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
think this camera handles quite good as

this both the right side of the body so

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.690 
this both the right side of the body so
all<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.020> weight<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.770> camera<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.549> lens

I<00:01:21.180> found<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.920> camera<00:01:23.310> feels<00:01:23.790> quite

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
I found that this camera feels quite

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.950 
I found that this camera feels quite
heavy<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.840> hand<00:01:25.110> also<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:26.430> next<00:01:27.330> rep<00:01:27.600> is

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
heavy in hand also this next rep is

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.700 
heavy in hand also this next rep is
placed<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.189> relatively<00:01:29.909> bad<00:01:30.180> position<00:01:30.869> so

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
placed on a relatively bad position so

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.510 
placed on a relatively bad position so
when<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.979> hold<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.570> it<00:01:33.590> always<00:01:34.590> gets<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.490> the

whatever you want there is a quite a lot
of<00:02:26.380> options<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:27.280> problem<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.820> although<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
of options the problem is although the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.190 
of options the problem is although the
the<00:02:29.140> outer<00:02:29.910> control<00:02:30.910> ring<00:02:31.120> rotates<00:02:31.480> very

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
the outer control ring rotates very

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.180 
the outer control ring rotates very
smoothly<00:02:32.910> dinner<00:02:33.910> one<00:02:34.300> has<00:02:35.110> clicks<00:02:35.500> but<00:02:35.920> the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
smoothly dinner one has clicks but the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.130 
smoothly dinner one has clicks but the
problem<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.210> it<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.930> very<00:02:38.200> hard<00:02:38.560> to

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
problem is that it is very hard to

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.090 
problem is that it is very hard to
rotate<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:42.480> for<00:02:43.480> example<00:02:43.990> you<00:02:44.170> can<00:02:44.410> rotate<00:02:44.620> the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
rotate it for example you can rotate the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.450 
rotate it for example you can rotate the
front<00:02:45.310> one<00:02:45.610> only<00:02:45.940> with<00:02:46.360> one<00:02:46.570> finger<00:02:47.340> but<00:02:48.340> the

front one only with one finger but the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.230 
front one only with one finger but the
inner<00:02:48.640> one<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.950> cannot<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.820> need<00:02:52.030> two

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
inner one you cannot you need two

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.390 
inner one you cannot you need two
fingers<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.870> operate<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.440> smoothly<00:02:53.920> this

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
fingers to operate it smoothly this

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.800

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.140 
the camera is packed with features and I
am<00:07:10.150> sure<00:07:10.450> it<00:07:10.690> will<00:07:10.930> sell<00:07:11.410> very<00:07:11.680> good<00:07:12.060> but<00:07:13.060> the

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.150 
am sure it will sell very good but the

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.990 
am sure it will sell very good but the
problem<00:07:13.540> is<00:07:13.720> that<00:07:14.620> this<00:07:14.980> is<00:07:15.130> still<00:07:15.370> a<00:07:15.640> compact

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 
problem is that this is still a compact

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.670 
problem is that this is still a compact
camera<00:07:16.240> and<00:07:16.660> you<00:07:16.840> can<00:07:17.020> feel<00:07:17.230> that<00:07:17.260> when<00:07:17.590> you

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 
camera and you can feel that when you

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.700 
camera and you can feel that when you
use<00:07:17.830> it<00:07:18.040> it<00:07:18.670> is<00:07:18.850> slower<00:07:19.270> than<00:07:19.660> the<00:07:19.750> DSLR<00:07:20.380> you

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.710 
use it it is slower than the DSLR you

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.680 
use it it is slower than the DSLR you
cannot<00:07:21.070> change<00:07:21.610> the<00:07:21.820> lens<00:07:22.000> like<00:07:22.300> you<00:07:22.480> would<00:07:22.660> on

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:22.690 
cannot change the lens like you would on

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.350 
cannot change the lens like you would on
a<00:07:22.900> mirrorless<00:07:23.320> and<00:07:23.860> it<00:07:24.670> has<00:07:24.910> a<00:07:24.940> motor-driven

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
a mirrorless and it has a motor-driven

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.500 
a mirrorless and it has a motor-driven
zoom<00:07:26.020> lens<00:07:26.230> I<00:07:26.530> would<00:07:26.800> prefer<00:07:27.040> having<00:07:27.730> a<00:07:27.760> manual

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:28.510 
zoom lens I would prefer having a manual

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.840 
zoom lens I would prefer having a manual
one<00:07:28.780> I<00:07:29.050> can<00:07:29.470> recommend<00:07:29.710> this<00:07:29.980> camera<00:07:30.250> but

there are certain some shortcomings and

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.360
