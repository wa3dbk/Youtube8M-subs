00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.360
 Warhol that was percent I think we started the game so well 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.239
 concentrated in defense 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.529
 then throwing Bakiyev was so nervous 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.589
 and a pity that we do not have Michel at half time anymore 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.980
 could settle around I think that was quite in it 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.910
 Per cent, of course, the Rosat was also on our side to both teams 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.880
 have 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.880
 quite a few turnovers made ball losses 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.130
 Percent the hit rate was percent low but that's all 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.170
 percent 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.170
 so that the light out of the importance of the game 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.790
 in the second half of Zeller Bremerhafen had demanded the first leg couple 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.320
 Throws hit from the outside 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.200
 the game equalized and from the 25 minute game about the game was 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.500
 completely balanced 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.680
 around 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.680
 but in that I think that would 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.480
 the offensive tasks have also spread more players than great at 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.329
 have those 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.079
 a light only played two percent of the DNA role or maybe with one 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.110
 there are three more 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.629
 Percent with us they were more about 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.770
 and in extra time we just had to throw better this year too 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.760
 I miss the Torsten Cloos you have to enjoy 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.260
 even if central gray hair and up to ten percent of his car later cost 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.590
 to give one's ear that one must enjoy between two players of the 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.960
 Game was not a nice game 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.550
 but empires eagles are not to expect any nice games games anyway 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.200
 Rossi's year as well as being one more 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.439
 who generally times finals 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.760
 Manila traffic light he her feel the real 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.370
 No 48 hours after winning the semi-finals have reached the Leos 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.279
 we had to lose the first game clearly lost 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.550
 because they 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.150
 still those who have taken this euphoria 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.300
 Percent I haue we hope that we do not care about that 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.000
 it happens that we also submit these to now will take to Bamberg that we 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.790
 Maybe in Bamberg a surprise in the game number one
