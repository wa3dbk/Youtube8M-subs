00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.370 
okay good look at the Morgans there now
the<00:03:18.610> other<00:03:18.850> thing<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:19.270> would<00:03:19.420> suggest<00:03:19.570> doing<00:03:20.080> is

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
the other thing I would suggest doing is

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.040 
the other thing I would suggest doing is
using<00:03:20.800> a<00:03:20.860> magnet<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:21.910> is<00:03:21.970> another<00:03:22.390> easy<00:03:22.720> way

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
using a magnet that is another easy way

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.760 
using a magnet that is another easy way
to<00:03:23.080> detect<00:03:24.070> fake<00:03:24.640> Morgans<00:03:25.390> because<00:03:26.350> they're

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
to detect fake Morgans because they're

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.260 
to detect fake Morgans because they're
made<00:03:26.950> out<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.130> steel<00:03:27.520> and<00:03:27.550> they'll<00:03:28.000> stick

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
made out of steel and they'll stick

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.830 
made out of steel and they'll stick
right<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.720> magnet<00:03:30.300> so<00:03:31.300> let's<00:03:31.480> run<00:03:31.690> the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
right to the magnet so let's run the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:49.960 
right to the magnet so let's run the
magnet<00:03:32.320> over<00:03:32.500> here<00:03:36.930> so<00:03:37.930> far<00:03:38.200> so<00:03:38.500> good

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:58.449 

we've<00:03:50.970> got<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.209> winner<00:03:51.510> here<00:03:53.180> okay

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.759 

see<00:03:59.090> if<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.269> can<00:03:59.420> get<00:03:59.569> the<00:03:59.689> camera<00:03:59.930> to<00:04:00.140> focus<00:04:00.230> on

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
see if I can get the camera to focus on

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:09.839 
see if I can get the camera to focus on
that

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:17.960 

my<00:04:10.390> camera<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:10.810> not<00:04:10.930> focusing<00:04:10.989> but

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.910 

the<00:04:18.480> mint<00:04:18.750> mark<00:04:18.959> is<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.320> Carson<00:04:20.040> City<00:04:20.390> mint<00:04:21.390> mark

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
the mint mark is a Carson City mint mark

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.860 
the mint mark is a Carson City mint mark
so<00:04:23.120> today's<00:04:24.120> value<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:25.290> this<00:04:25.590> Carson<00:04:26.130> City

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
so today's value of this Carson City

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.440 
so today's value of this Carson City
I've<00:04:27.870> got<00:04:28.140> it<00:04:28.260> circled<00:04:28.740> here<00:04:29.040> in<00:04:29.450> this

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
I've got it circled here in this

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.250 
I've got it circled here in this
condition<00:04:31.110> in<00:04:31.260> 1881<00:04:32.010> Carson<00:04:32.670> City<00:04:33.020> only<00:04:34.020> two

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
condition in 1881 Carson City only two

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.470 
condition in 1881 Carson City only two
hundred<00:04:34.680> ninety<00:04:35.040> six<00:04:35.250> thousand<00:04:35.820> minted<00:04:36.240> which

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
hundred ninety six thousand minted which

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.140 
hundred ninety six thousand minted which
is<00:04:36.660> very<00:04:36.990> low<00:04:37.350> would<00:04:38.310> come<00:04:38.550> around<00:04:38.700> five

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
is very low would come around five

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.990 
is very low would come around five
hundred<00:04:39.180> fifty<00:04:39.990> dollars<00:04:40.530> which<00:04:40.920> is<00:04:41.070> a<00:04:41.100> you

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
hundred fifty dollars which is a you

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.990 
hundred fifty dollars which is a you
know<00:04:42.030> huge<00:04:42.540> profit<00:04:43.080> if<00:04:43.920> you<00:04:44.400> get<00:04:44.550> this<00:04:44.730> coin

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
know huge profit if you get this coin

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.820 
know huge profit if you get this coin
for<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.330> reasonable<00:04:45.810> value<00:04:51.260> which<00:04:52.260> you<00:04:52.290> can<00:04:52.590> see

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
for a reasonable value which you can see

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.810 
for a reasonable value which you can see
right<00:04:52.860> there<00:04:56.330> okay<00:04:58.220> it's<00:04:59.220> also<00:04:59.370> a<00:04:59.550> good<00:04:59.760> idea

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
right there okay it's also a good idea

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.020 
right there okay it's also a good idea
to<00:05:00.210> bring<00:05:00.390> a<00:05:00.510> loop<00:05:00.750> with<00:05:00.990> you<00:05:01.200> when<00:05:01.530> you<00:05:01.620> go<00:05:01.860> to

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
to bring a loop with you when you go to

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.980 
to bring a loop with you when you go to
get<00:05:03.030> these<00:05:03.270> coins<00:05:04.280> now<00:05:05.480> I'm<00:05:06.480> also<00:05:06.660> going<00:05:06.840> to

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
get these coins now I'm also going to

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:18.560 
get these coins now I'm also going to
let<00:05:07.140> you<00:05:07.350> hear<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.770> sound<00:05:08.100> of<00:05:08.340> this<00:05:17.570> totally

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
let you hear the sound of this totally

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:52.690 
let you hear the sound of this totally
different<00:05:18.960> sounds

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.240 

I<00:05:52.820> mean<00:05:53.360> look<00:05:53.600> at<00:05:53.720> the<00:05:53.960> detail<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:54.920> the<00:05:55.070> fake

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
I mean look at the detail and the fake

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.550 
I mean look at the detail and the fake
now<00:05:58.250> I<00:05:58.340> got<00:05:58.610> this<00:05:58.790> in<00:05:59.030> a<00:05:59.060> lot<00:05:59.450> at<00:05:59.840> the<00:06:00.320> flea

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
now I got this in a lot at the flea

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.240 
now I got this in a lot at the flea
market<00:06:01.390> 9<00:06:02.390> out<00:06:02.660> of<00:06:02.690> 10<00:06:03.020> were<00:06:03.200> real<00:06:03.470> and<00:06:03.890> I<00:06:04.040> got

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
market 9 out of 10 were real and I got

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.240 
market 9 out of 10 were real and I got
one<00:06:04.520> fake<00:06:04.880> coin<00:06:05.300> out<00:06:05.750> of<00:06:06.080> the<00:06:06.290> entire<00:06:06.620> lot<00:06:06.950> and

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
one fake coin out of the entire lot and

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.160 
one fake coin out of the entire lot and
when<00:06:07.460> I<00:06:07.490> got<00:06:07.700> home<00:06:07.970> and<00:06:08.030> I<00:06:08.300> checked<00:06:08.600> a<00:06:08.690> lot<00:06:08.870> and

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
when I got home and I checked a lot and

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.200 
when I got home and I checked a lot and
I<00:06:09.290> saw<00:06:09.650> that<00:06:09.950> one<00:06:10.130> of<00:06:10.160> them<00:06:10.370> was<00:06:10.520> a<00:06:10.550> Carson<00:06:10.970> City

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
I saw that one of them was a Carson City

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.690 
I saw that one of them was a Carson City
I<00:06:11.480> almost<00:06:12.080> had<00:06:12.290> his<00:06:12.410> heart<00:06:12.650> attack<00:06:12.800> because<00:06:13.220> I

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
I almost had his heart attack because I

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.900 
I almost had his heart attack because I
paid<00:06:14.570> face<00:06:14.960> value<00:06:15.590> for<00:06:15.860> all<00:06:15.980> the<00:06:16.010> coins<00:06:16.370> so

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
paid face value for all the coins so

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.900 
paid face value for all the coins so
that<00:06:17.240> would<00:06:17.390> have<00:06:17.510> been<00:06:17.600> a<00:06:17.690> massive<00:06:18.350> profit

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
that would have been a massive profit

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.320 
that would have been a massive profit
but<00:06:20.560> unfortunately<00:06:21.640> at<00:06:22.640> closer<00:06:22.970> inspection

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
scale stuck right to the magnet this is

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:44.020 
scale stuck right to the magnet this is
the<00:06:31.730> real<00:06:32.420> one

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030
