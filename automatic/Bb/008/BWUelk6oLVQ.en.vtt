you can't find it without data recovery

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.049 
you can't find it without data recovery
software<00:00:31.009> so<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.099> order<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.550> those<00:00:32.730> files

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
software so in order to get those files

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.310 
software so in order to get those files
back<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.870> restore<00:00:34.680> your<00:00:35.540> trash<00:00:36.540> folder<00:00:36.900> I

back and restore your trash folder I

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.440 
back and restore your trash folder I
recommend<00:00:38.190> downloading<00:00:38.310> data<00:00:38.970> recovery

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
recommend downloading data recovery

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.050 
recommend downloading data recovery
software<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.350> act<00:00:41.070> as<00:00:41.250> soon<00:00:41.400> as<00:00:41.520> possible

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
software and act as soon as possible

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.940 
software and act as soon as possible
because<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.390> data<00:00:42.810> can<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.140> overwritten<00:00:43.740> at

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
because that data can be overwritten at

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.770 
because that data can be overwritten at
any<00:00:44.160> time<00:00:44.400> so<00:00:44.820> what<00:00:44.970> we're<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.240> do<00:00:45.390> first

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
install the software I already have the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.160 
install the software I already have the
software<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.999> I<00:01:27.030> won't<00:01:27.329> be<00:01:27.479> doing<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.899> step

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
software so I won't be doing this step

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.800 
software so I won't be doing this step
but<00:01:28.380> simply<00:01:28.920> follow<00:01:29.219> the<00:01:29.429> instructions

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
but simply follow the instructions

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.899 
but simply follow the instructions
here's<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.929> software<00:01:31.469> first<00:01:32.459> what<00:01:32.670> we'll<00:01:32.789> do

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
here's the software first what we'll do

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.899 
here's the software first what we'll do
is<00:01:33.029> click<00:01:33.299> recover<00:01:33.659> data<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.639> you<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.850> see

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
is click recover data and as you can see

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.459 
is click recover data and as you can see
this<00:01:36.209> uh<00:01:36.389> there's<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.079> whole<00:01:37.229> bunch<00:01:37.409> of

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
this uh there's a whole bunch of

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:38.980 
this uh there's a whole bunch of
different<00:01:37.590> options<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.490> what<00:01:38.549> type<00:01:38.819> of

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
different options for what type of

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.709 
different options for what type of
recovery<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.229> want<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.469> do<00:01:41.060> for<00:01:42.060> restoring

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
recovery you want to do for restoring

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.029 
recovery you want to do for restoring
the<00:01:42.840> trash<00:01:43.170> folder

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
the trash folder

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.039 
the trash folder
I'd<00:01:44.849> actually<00:01:45.029> recommend<00:01:45.270> first<00:01:45.779> to<00:01:45.929> do<00:01:46.020> a

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
I'd actually recommend first to do a

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.809 
I'd actually recommend first to do a
quick<00:01:46.349> recovery<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:47.069> is<00:01:47.130> by<00:01:47.340> far<00:01:47.609> the

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
quick recovery this is by far the

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.899 
quick recovery this is by far the
fastest<00:01:48.389> it's<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:49.679> least<00:01:49.859> intensive<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.759> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
fastest it's the least intensive so it

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.789 
fastest it's the least intensive so it
might<00:01:51.029> not<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.509> most<00:01:51.539> effective<00:01:52.109> but<00:01:52.649> it

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
might not be the most effective but it

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.149 
might not be the most effective but it
does<00:01:53.069> go<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.939> quickest<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.069> if

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
does go the quickest and you can see if

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.279 
does go the quickest and you can see if
it<00:01:56.249> recovers<00:01:56.670> anything<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.509> way<00:01:57.749> before<00:01:58.200> you

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
it recovers anything that way before you

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.739 
it recovers anything that way before you
move<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.469> one<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.740> these<00:01:58.829> other<00:01:59.069> options<00:01:59.749> next

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:00.749 
move to one of these other options next

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:02.510 
move to one of these other options next
I<00:02:00.840> would<00:02:00.990> say<00:02:01.139> deleted<00:02:01.560> recovery<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.189> probably

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
I would say deleted recovery is probably

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.120 
I would say deleted recovery is probably
