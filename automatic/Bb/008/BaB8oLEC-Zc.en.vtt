now we're going to alter this horses

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.690 
now we're going to alter this horses
trot<00:00:02.550> into<00:00:02.879> too<00:00:03.480> slow<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.870> gait<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.520> you<00:00:05.520> can

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
trot into too slow a gait and you can

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.700 
trot into too slow a gait and you can
really<00:00:05.879> tell<00:00:06.240> if<00:00:06.420> one's<00:00:06.660> trotting<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.230> 2-bit

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
really tell if one's trotting a 2-bit

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.339 
really tell if one's trotting a 2-bit
gait<00:00:08.010> like<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:08.940> said<00:00:09.210> if<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.570> diagonal<00:00:09.929> pairs

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
gait like I said if the diagonal pairs

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.669 
gait like I said if the diagonal pairs
of<00:00:10.590> legs<00:00:10.860> leave<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.700> ground<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.559> hit<00:00:13.559> the

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
of legs leave the ground and hit the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.910 
of legs leave the ground and hit the
ground<00:00:13.950> simultaneously<00:00:15.199> now<00:00:16.199> she's<00:00:16.500> got<00:00:16.740> him

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
ground simultaneously now she's got him

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.250 
ground simultaneously now she's got him
so<00:00:17.130> slow<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.090> left<00:00:18.330> front<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.810> leaving

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
so slow that the left front is leaving

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.849 
so slow that the left front is leaving
the<00:00:19.350> ground<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.640> right<00:00:21.390> hand<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:22.109> late

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
the ground and the right hand is late

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.609 
the ground and the right hand is late
coming<00:00:23.220> through<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.539> get<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.080> one<00:00:25.140> in

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
coming through so you get this one in

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.769 
coming through so you get this one in
the<00:00:25.710> two<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.250> A<00:00:26.310> one<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.699> A<00:00:26.789> two<00:00:27.029> look<00:00:27.330> instead

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the two and A one and A two look instead

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:36.590 
the two and A one and A two look instead
of<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.109> sharp<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.859> crisp<00:00:29.189> 1<00:00:29.670> 2<00:00:34.640> 1<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.880> 2<00:00:35.910> 1

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
of that sharp and crisp 1 2 1 and a 2 1

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.040 
of that sharp and crisp 1 2 1 and a 2 1
and<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.840> 2<00:00:36.870> 1<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.770> 2<00:00:37.800> 1<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.700> 2<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.180> that's

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
and a 2 1 and a 2 1 and a 2 so that's

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.490 
and a 2 1 and a 2 1 and a 2 so that's
too<00:00:40.500> slow<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.090> horse<00:00:42.450> now<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.200> all<00:00:43.469> she

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
too slow for this horse now if all she

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.580 
too slow for this horse now if all she
has<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.070> do<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.460> fix<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.840> kick<00:00:46.110> him<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
has to do to fix that just kick him up a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.729 
has to do to fix that just kick him up a
notch

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.700 

now<00:00:51.430> she<00:00:51.520> just<00:00:51.730> drew<00:00:52.239> on<00:00:52.270> his<00:00:52.570> face<00:00:52.870> closed<00:00:53.530> her

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
now she just drew on his face closed her

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.520 
now she just drew on his face closed her
legs<00:00:53.950> a<00:00:54.219> little<00:00:54.489> and<00:00:54.899> put<00:00:55.899> him<00:00:56.020> back<00:00:56.199> in<00:00:56.440> the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
legs a little and put him back in the

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.040 
legs a little and put him back in the
correct<00:00:56.860> gay

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.460 

now<00:01:03.710> she<00:01:03.770> has<00:01:04.280> him<00:01:04.580> loping<00:01:05.150> extremely<00:01:05.960> broken

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
now she has him loping extremely broken

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.570 
now she has him loping extremely broken
up<00:01:06.820> instead<00:01:07.820> of<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.120> three<00:01:08.480> beat<00:01:08.720> gate<00:01:09.580> he

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
up instead of a three beat gate he

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.490 
up instead of a three beat gate he
turned<00:01:10.910> it<00:01:11.000> into<00:01:11.150> a<00:01:11.300> two-bit<00:01:11.720> gate<00:01:12.020> because<00:01:12.380> he

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
turned it into a two-bit gate because he

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.990 
turned it into a two-bit gate because he
broke<00:01:12.770> to<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.070> truck<00:01:13.430> because<00:01:13.640> it<00:01:13.730> was<00:01:13.850> very

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
broke to a truck because it was very

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.780 
broke to a truck because it was very
uncomfortable<00:01:14.420> for<00:01:14.690> him<00:01:14.960> also<00:01:15.400> but<00:01:16.400> now<00:01:16.580> it's

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
uncomfortable for him also but now it's

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.140 
uncomfortable for him also but now it's
a<00:01:16.880> four<00:01:17.180> beat<00:01:17.420> gate<00:01:18.430> which<00:01:19.430> is<00:01:19.610> what<00:01:19.820> people

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
a four beat gate which is what people

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.210 
a four beat gate which is what people
refer<00:01:20.480> to<00:01:20.690> when<00:01:20.930> they<00:01:21.050> call<00:01:21.290> one<00:01:21.530> for<00:01:21.560> beating

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
refer to when they call one for beating

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.730 
refer to when they call one for beating
he<00:01:22.550> is<00:01:22.730> taking<00:01:23.540> a<00:01:23.600> different<00:01:23.630> step<00:01:24.350> on<00:01:24.560> every

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
he is taking a different step on every

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.450 
he is taking a different step on every
foot

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
foot

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.070 
foot
there's<00:01:25.790> no<00:01:26.030> unison<00:01:26.690> to<00:01:26.900> his<00:01:27.020> stride<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:29.420> it

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
there's no unison to his stride and it

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.110 
there's no unison to his stride and it
looks<00:01:30.320> like<00:01:30.590> one<00:01:30.980> in<00:01:31.160> a<00:01:31.250> two<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:31.730> A<00:01:31.820> three<00:01:31.850> and

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
looks like one in a two and A three and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.590 
looks like one in a two and A three and
a<00:01:32.330> four

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
a four

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.840 
a four
it<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:32.990> extremely<00:01:33.620> broken<00:01:34.490> up

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.370 

so<00:01:39.850> it's<00:01:40.000> very<00:01:40.090> simple<00:01:40.689> to<00:01:40.900> tell<00:01:41.200> the

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
so it's very simple to tell the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.670 
so it's very simple to tell the
difference<00:01:41.890> between<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:43.450> 4<00:01:43.840> beat<00:01:44.080> lope<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.560> a

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
difference between a 4 beat lope and a

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.330 
difference between a 4 beat lope and a
three<00:01:44.950> beat<00:01:45.159> low<00:01:45.400> if<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.330> count<00:01:47.040> 1<00:01:48.040> 2<00:01:48.610> 3<00:01:49.240> 4

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
three beat low if you count 1 2 3 4

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.580 
three beat low if you count 1 2 3 4
instead<00:01:51.340> of<00:01:51.399> 1<00:01:51.790> 2<00:01:51.909> 3<00:01:52.000> 1<00:01:52.210> 2<00:01:52.240> 3<00:01:52.360> 1<00:01:52.540> 2<00:01:52.659> 3<00:01:52.899> it's<00:01:53.290> just

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
instead of 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 it's just

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.070 
instead of 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 it's just
very<00:01:53.710> difficult<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:54.430> count<00:01:54.789> that<00:01:55.060> quick<00:01:55.450> count

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
very difficult to count that quick count

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.920 
very difficult to count that quick count
the<00:01:56.289> whole<00:01:56.500> stride<00:01:57.009> and<00:01:57.430> see<00:01:58.210> if<00:01:58.509> your<00:01:58.690> voice

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
the whole stride and see if your voice

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.490 
the whole stride and see if your voice
has<00:01:59.289> rhythm<00:01:59.680> and<00:02:00.100> cadence<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.930> if<00:02:02.080> it<00:02:02.200> does

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
has rhythm and cadence and if it does

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.550 
has rhythm and cadence and if it does
that<00:02:02.530> horse<00:02:03.220> is<00:02:03.460> probably<00:02:03.789> loping<00:02:04.689> quite<00:02:05.289> nice

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
that horse is probably loping quite nice

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:15.000 
that horse is probably loping quite nice

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 this will come in handy

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.330 
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 this will come in handy
later<00:02:15.280> on<00:02:15.900> when<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:16.989> change<00:02:17.319> leads<00:02:17.769> and<00:02:18.160> you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
later on when you change leads and you

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.490 
later on when you change leads and you
need<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.910> keep<00:02:19.090> track<00:02:19.450> of<00:02:19.660> your<00:02:19.780> cadence<00:02:20.110> and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
need to keep track of your cadence and

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:32.660 
need to keep track of your cadence and
in<00:02:20.709> your<00:02:21.250> rhythm

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.930 

now<00:02:33.300> she<00:02:33.360> sped<00:02:33.990> this<00:02:34.230> horse<00:02:34.500> up<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.160> his<00:02:35.610> count

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
now she sped this horse up and his count

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.620 
now she sped this horse up and his count
has<00:02:36.210> become<00:02:36.569> one<00:02:37.080> two<00:02:37.620> three<00:02:38.310> four<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:39.150> much

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
has become one two three four a much

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.800 
has become one two three four a much
quicker<00:02:39.959> count<00:02:40.440> than<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.770> was<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> minute<00:02:41.400> ago

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
quicker count than it was a minute ago

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.780 
quicker count than it was a minute ago
which<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.020> fine<00:02:43.319> count<00:02:43.770> if<00:02:44.100> she<00:02:44.490> meant<00:02:44.700> to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
which is a fine count if she meant to

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.790 
which is a fine count if she meant to
gallop<00:02:45.270> on<00:02:45.800> but<00:02:46.800> it's<00:02:47.459> pretty<00:02:47.730> quick<00:02:48.410> say<00:02:49.410> for

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
gallop on but it's pretty quick say for

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.420 
gallop on but it's pretty quick say for
a<00:02:49.830> rail<00:02:50.100> class<00:02:50.490> one<00:02:50.880> two<00:02:51.360> three<00:02:52.020> four<00:02:52.560> one<00:02:53.070> two

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
a rail class one two three four one two

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.410 
a rail class one two three four one two
three<00:02:54.060> four<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.530> gate<00:02:55.770> itself<00:02:56.209> itself<00:02:57.209> is

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
three four the gate itself itself is

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.380 
three four the gate itself itself is
pretty<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:58.380> it's<00:02:59.010> flowy<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.790> it's<00:03:00.000> smooth

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
pretty and it's flowy and it's smooth

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.199 
pretty and it's flowy and it's smooth
but<00:03:00.840> it's<00:03:00.959> just<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.650> hair<00:03:01.890> too<00:03:02.220> quick<00:03:02.580> for<00:03:03.180> a

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
but it's just a hair too quick for a

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.949 
but it's just a hair too quick for a
rail<00:03:03.450> event<00:03:06.980> now<00:03:07.980> we're<00:03:08.459> back<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:09.060> one<00:03:09.330> two

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
rail event now we're back to one two

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.520 
rail event now we're back to one two
three<00:03:10.769> four<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:12.090> she<00:03:12.870> made<00:03:13.080> all<00:03:13.110> these

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
three four and she made all these

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.820 
three four and she made all these
differences<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.430> speed<00:03:14.989> between<00:03:15.989> her<00:03:16.560> hands

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
differences in speed between her hands

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.620 
differences in speed between her hands
and<00:03:17.070> feet<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.670> remember<00:03:18.060> we're<00:03:18.209> looking<00:03:18.239> for

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
and feet and remember we're looking for

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.680 
and feet and remember we're looking for
the<00:03:18.840> invisible<00:03:19.530> queue<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:20.760> never<00:03:21.000> really<00:03:21.390> saw

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
the invisible queue you never really saw

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.520 
the invisible queue you never really saw
where<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.280> speed<00:03:23.640> started<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.540> where<00:03:25.440> he

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
where the speed started and where he

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.140 
where the speed started and where he
backed<00:03:25.800> off<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.489> this<00:03:26.640> is<00:03:26.700> what<00:03:26.850> you're

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
backed off and this is what you're

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.250 
backed off and this is what you're
hunting<00:03:27.510> for<00:03:28.310> he<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.610> waiting<00:03:30.390> for<00:03:30.720> her<00:03:30.900> to

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
hunting for he is waiting for her to

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.320 
hunting for he is waiting for her to
tell<00:03:31.470> him<00:03:31.650> what<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.980> do<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.400> that's<00:03:32.910> what<00:03:33.180> we

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
tell him what to do and that's what we

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.570
