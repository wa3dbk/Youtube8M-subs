let me get the blue Spartan out of the
way<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> review<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
way because this is the review of the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.870 
way because this is the review of the
red<00:01:46.049> Spartan<00:01:46.469> so<00:01:47.130> as<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.369> see<00:01:47.579> though<00:01:47.729> he

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
red Spartan so as you can see though he

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.310 
red Spartan so as you can see though he
does<00:01:48.090> come<00:01:48.270> with<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.420> sniper<00:01:48.659> rifle<00:01:48.810> he<00:01:49.110> holds

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.230 
does come with a sniper rifle he holds
it<00:01:49.409> relatively<00:01:49.860> well<00:01:50.219> so<00:01:50.610> that's<00:01:50.820> always<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
it relatively well so that's always a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.240 
it relatively well so that's always a
good<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.869> good<00:01:52.259> indication<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.130> know

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250

maybe<00:04:02.260> just<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.829> little<00:04:03.070> bit<00:04:03.250> in<00:04:03.489> my<00:04:03.640> opinion

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
maybe just a little bit in my opinion

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.849

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
because it seems a little bit more flush

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.559 
because it seems a little bit more flush

nicely<00:04:35.320> as<00:04:35.680> an<00:04:35.830> extended<00:04:36.250> peg<00:04:36.490> so<00:04:36.820> it<00:04:37.330> can<00:04:37.510> pick

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
nicely as an extended peg so it can pick

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.300 
nicely as an extended peg so it can pick
on<00:04:37.840> there<00:04:38.050> pretty<00:04:38.230> nicely<00:04:38.500> even<00:04:38.860> pegging<00:04:39.220> it

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
on there pretty nicely even pegging it

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.460 
on there pretty nicely even pegging it
more<00:04:39.490> if<00:04:39.550> you<00:04:39.640> want<00:04:39.670> but<00:04:40.120> it's<00:04:40.780> just<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.080> general

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
more if you want but it's just a general

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.650 
more if you want but it's just a general
glimpse<00:04:41.950> of<00:04:42.010> it<00:04:42.240> overall<00:04:43.240> I<00:04:43.270> think<00:04:43.450> this

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
glimpse of it overall I think this

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.720 
glimpse of it overall I think this

don't mind but I think this is a really
cool<00:04:56.200> figure<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.620> sculpting<00:04:57.100> is<00:04:57.550> just

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
cool figure the sculpting is just

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.930 
cool figure the sculpting is just
phenomenal<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.600> detail<00:04:58.960> on<00:04:59.140> it<00:04:59.170> is<00:04:59.350> great

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
phenomenal the detail on it is great

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.430 
phenomenal the detail on it is great
overall<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:01.060> figure<00:05:01.390> is<00:05:01.540> awesome<00:05:01.960> I<00:05:02.110> really

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
overall the figure is awesome I really

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.480 
overall the figure is awesome I really
don't<00:05:02.500> have<00:05:02.650> any<00:05:02.800> problems<00:05:03.190> isn't<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.430> only

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
don't have any problems isn't the only

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.700 
don't have any problems isn't the only
thing<00:05:03.670> I<00:05:03.940> don't<00:05:04.000> like<00:05:04.300> is<00:05:04.690> how<00:05:05.050> narrow<00:05:05.440> his

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
thing I don't like is how narrow his

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.590 
thing I don't like is how narrow his
feet<00:05:06.010> are<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:06.460> if<00:05:07.060> you<00:05:07.150> can<00:05:07.270> look<00:05:07.390> at<00:05:07.540> them

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
feet are and if you can look at them

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.150 
feet are and if you can look at them
it's<00:05:07.750> seen<00:05:08.020> they're<00:05:08.170> not<00:05:08.350> like<00:05:08.560> level<00:05:09.040> with

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
it's seen they're not like level with

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.500 
it's seen they're not like level with
each<00:05:09.190> other<00:05:09.400> as<00:05:09.610> you<00:05:09.700> can<00:05:09.820> see<00:05:09.970> this<00:05:10.180> part

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
each other as you can see this part

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.580 
each other as you can see this part
comes<00:05:10.720> down<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:10.990> little<00:05:11.080> bit<00:05:11.200> further<00:05:11.440> than

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
comes down a little bit further than

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.890 
comes down a little bit further than
that<00:05:11.800> so<00:05:12.640> it<00:05:13.000> just<00:05:13.060> makes<00:05:13.450> it<00:05:13.540> a<00:05:13.600> little<00:05:13.630> bit

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
that so it just makes it a little bit

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.170 
that so it just makes it a little bit
more<00:05:14.050> difficult<00:05:14.260> to<00:05:14.650> stand<00:05:15.030> but<00:05:16.030> if<00:05:16.090> you

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
more difficult to stand but if you

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.550 
more difficult to stand but if you
fiddle<00:05:16.480> with<00:05:16.510> it<00:05:16.600> for<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:16.870> while<00:05:16.930> you<00:05:17.440> can

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
fiddle with it for a while you can

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.260 
fiddle with it for a while you can
generally<00:05:17.920> get<00:05:18.070> it<00:05:18.220> to<00:05:18.400> to<00:05:18.730> stand<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.150> way<00:05:19.240> you

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
generally get it to to stand the way you

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.420 
generally get it to to stand the way you
want<00:05:19.630> but<00:05:19.840> other<00:05:20.230> than<00:05:20.380> that<00:05:20.470> it's<00:05:21.130> a<00:05:21.220> great

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
want but other than that it's a great

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.950 
want but other than that it's a great
figure<00:05:21.640> I<00:05:21.760> just<00:05:22.090> really<00:05:22.330> don't<00:05:22.420> like<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.870> way

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
figure I just really don't like the way

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.380 
figure I just really don't like the way
they<00:05:23.140> did<00:05:23.320> that<00:05:23.970> however<00:05:24.970> I'm<00:05:25.060> not<00:05:25.180> going<00:05:25.330> to

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
they did that however I'm not going to

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.820 
they did that however I'm not going to
knock<00:05:25.540> down<00:05:25.570> the<00:05:25.990> rating<00:05:26.380> of<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.500> figure<00:05:26.800> I

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
knock down the rating of the figure I

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.650 
knock down the rating of the figure I
think<00:05:27.070> this<00:05:27.130> is<00:05:27.190> still<00:05:27.490> a<00:05:27.550> great<00:05:28.000> great<00:05:28.300> figure

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
think this is still a great great figure

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.270 
think this is still a great great figure
