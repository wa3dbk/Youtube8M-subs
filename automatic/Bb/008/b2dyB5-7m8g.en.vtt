00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 this section 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.500
 hello welcome to the section 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.680
 mechanical hobby bike tips today 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.340
 I'm going to talk about the technical data sheet 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.710
 get in emails asking what 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.840
 I must see that it is important to send a 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.730
 technical sheet because if they give it to you what 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.619
 You look very nice the bike a photo 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.669
 fantastic but I would like to know a 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.120
 little bit better here I have a 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:30.740
 technical sheet 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:33.680
 of a sling cbr 600f a motorcycle is very 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.470
 sold here in Spain and let's see it 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.390
 a little bit and we will explain the motor part 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.990
 which is an important part that we 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.000
 interesting to know that we need what 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.520
 first we have the displacement not you 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.160
 Mark the cubic centimeters 599 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.500
 usually these motorcycles would be about 600 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.309
 you will see that it never reaches any of 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.530
 the cubic in is by regulation by 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.760
 legislation must not exceed 600 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.010
 cubic centimeters and will exceed it 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.140
 would pass a following category both in 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.089
 insurance as in taxes where the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.860
 manufacturers are pretty well assured of 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.990
 that does not exceed in any way in 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.550
 no tolerance of 600 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.740
 cubic centimeters that's why it's funny and 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.780
 you will see 599 598 597 what is what 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.850
 we call 600 centimeters 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.640
 cubic is rounded 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.310
 we have the power in this case 102 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.299
 horses at 12,000 revolutions 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.189
 he marks the maximum power careful with 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.079
 this data because many times you will say 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.520
 102 horses 12,000 revolutions and 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.399
 means that my maximum power is 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.049
 there but not this is not the maximum turn in 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.479
 this motorcycle should possibly turn 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.220
 about 14 thousand 15 thousand laps always 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.890
 after the maximum power 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.840
 we need a lap fall because 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.149
 if we would not reach the maximum power and 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.090
 the engine would cut and then it is not is not 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.759
 It is not logical for many manufacturers in the 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.830
 technical sheets that want to sell the 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.020
 vehicle they can put you or they will put you 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.970
 a power curve so that it can 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.740
 observe worth the 102 horses because it is 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.569
 by subject carnets is what you have to 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.400
 look because you can limit or not 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.409
 and often comes with the pair 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.230
 of this case not but sometimes it exposes you 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:19.260
 in the torque to the laps that is 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.540
 to show if the engine is an engine 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.879
 that the mind has low as an engine 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.910
 that accelerates or is an engine designed to 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.970
 turn in this case 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.240
 we turn to what would be the engine part 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.390
 Four four cylinders in line 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.990
 we have the typical four engine online 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.520
 it's worth four times 16 valves that is 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.130
 4 valves per cylinder 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.320
 now they are all like that are the 16 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.090
 valves that are going to score in many 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.720
 missions a lot escape we are working 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.700
 with a lot of area and a lot of speed but 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.530
 they are engines that get a lot of performance 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.480
 in this case this engine pulls 102 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.700
 horses but I could take many 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.810
 more more than the conception of the motorcycle is 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.580
 to make a motorcycle that lasts many 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.810
 kilometer 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.640
 is expressed in the diameter per race 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:12.700
 all 67 millimeters that would be diameter 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.740
 piston by 40 and 2.5 millimeters which is 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.270
 Piston stroke is without movement of the 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.310
 piston 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.680
 we are dealing then with careers 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.710
 short what we call a race engine 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.470
 cut the boats face short your engine is 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.550
 quite ideal for high revolutions 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.120
 actually the race is used a lot 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.620
 short to eliminate inertias and so they do 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.920
 that the vibrations in the motor are 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.319
 much smaller 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.690
 someone will think good if the piston 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.750
 it is very big, it will weigh more the good piston 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.750
 currently interested pistons 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.210
 that are made in japan smelting that 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.480
 they are put with with silicon and silicon in 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.910
 ceramic one part are ceramic weigh 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.560
 very little they are very large but they weigh 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.900
 very little and have terrible resistance 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.400
 and they are very expensive to do also not 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.400
 think that the piston is one of the things 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.430
 that lasts longer in an engine can break 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.660
 the engine and the pistons look good 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.170
 It is also one of the most expensive parts 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.030
 of the engine to repair then good 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.000
 we have very large pistons and in this 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.650
 case whenever we see a diameter more 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.470
 great that the race we will have what 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.010
 you call a short race engine if it were 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.630
 we would have a square engine two 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.630
 engines widely used in the subject of 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.650
 competition and they no longer exist or if the one that 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.210
 the race was bigger than the 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.320
 diameter we have a long career that 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.330
 they are very little used 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.220
 the liquid initiation so we'll count 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.170
 with radiator and water pump 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.430
 this what to do is stabilize a lot 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:46.110
 more what would be the engine block and 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.820
 stabilizing the block as you can 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.090
 get better performance to others 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.090
 turns 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.590
 what is food 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.650
 the electronic injection of gasoline pcm 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.060
 efe which is the wave injection 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.500
 in this case 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.919
 this type of address has been used 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.780
 very much is super reliable super reliable and 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.730
 the fact that you're not going to 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.010
 be able to modify the bike like us 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.630
 we want not because in this case 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.980
 we would have measurement problems 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.840
 electronics has been thought for not 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.830
 pollute and to get eliminate 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.630
 all the pollution and it 's works well 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.580
 we do not have to have these six changes 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.810
 Currently all six gears 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.730
 marches because they are engines that seeing the 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.760
 theme that is short career work 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.680
 high turns if they work high turns 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.960
 You need a change totally very 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.570
 closed where closed changes are sought 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.150
 so they work well high 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.460
 revolutions transmission chains are 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.139
 call this may surprise you for not 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.820
 you know what is in network is a street a 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.889
 race with detents that we talked about in 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.610
 other programs is chain that comes with 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:57.529
 fat inside so that they last very many 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.589
 kilometer 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:02.719
 and they always specify a little the subject 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:05.689
 of chassis here is a discovering 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:09.079
 Each manufacturer puts his name by 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:11.389
 example we would have in chassis is the monkey 

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:13.699
 black with an aluminum casting by 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.019
 gravity with rectangular section that is 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.329
 this is good because I have a double beam 

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:20.119
 in many double beam typical in all 

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:23.419
 motorcycles the base each motorcycle where it puts a 

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:25.519
 name as yamaha initiated the issue with the 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.939
 delta box delta box one two three 

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:30.919
 four then wave in this case it has 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:32.059
 the blackburn monkey that is really a 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.480
 double beam with some difference 

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:36.930
 structural 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.689
 for the issue of patents but the issue is 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.179
 practically the same 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:44.039
 the next program we will talk about the subject 

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:46.559
 chassis that is also important 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:48.360
 observe it to choose the bike that 

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:50.200
 we want until we program 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.450
 must go until next week 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.370
 if you want to make your way as a mechanic 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.200
 of the competition come to our course of 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:02.820
 motorcycle mechanics call us at
