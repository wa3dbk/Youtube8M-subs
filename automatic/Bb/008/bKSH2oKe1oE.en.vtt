traffic<00:00:27.869> update<00:00:29.269> so<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.570> did<00:00:30.750> purchase

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
traffic update so I did purchase

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.690

actually<00:00:31.679> my<00:00:31.740> family<00:00:32.070> purchased<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.520> just

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
actually my family purchased it just

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.940 
actually my family purchased it just
because<00:00:32.910> we're<00:00:33.059> going<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> trip<00:00:33.620> soon<00:00:34.620> and

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
because we're going on the trip soon and

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.830 
because we're going on the trip soon and
we<00:00:35.550> don't<00:00:35.700> know<00:00:35.880> where<00:00:36.000> we're<00:00:36.120> going<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> be

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
we don't know where we're going to be

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.139 
we don't know where we're going to be
just<00:00:37.230> we<00:00:37.350> don't<00:00:37.469> know<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.649> area<00:00:37.879> so<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.000> just

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
just we don't know the area so we just

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.569 
just we don't know the area so we just
figure<00:00:39.329> 2<00:00:39.420> out<00:00:39.570> by<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.440> probably<00:00:41.070> use<00:00:41.430> it

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
figure 2 out by this and probably use it

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.360 
figure 2 out by this and probably use it
more<00:00:42.059> even<00:00:42.930> where<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.530> were<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.160> not<00:00:44.309> just

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
more even where we were so it's not just

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.750 
more even where we were so it's not just
a<00:00:44.610> secret<00:00:45.030> they<00:00:45.750> did<00:00:45.989> come<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.760> dear

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
a secret they did come up this dear

00:00:47.760 --> 00:01:04.630 
a secret they did come up this dear
increase<00:00:47.910> go<00:00:55.129> there<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.480> does<00:00:57.480> garment

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
own I guess so let's actually take a

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.300 
own I guess so let's actually take a
look<00:01:12.299> at<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.479> garmin<00:01:12.840> nuvi<00:01:13.110> system<00:01:13.470> at<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
look at the garmin nuvi system at the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.580 
look at the garmin nuvi system at the
front<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> box<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.330> has<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> device<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
front of the box that has the device the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.789

top<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:17.220> garment<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> back<00:01:19.110> actually

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
top just garment on the back actually

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.520 
top just garment on the back actually
gives<00:01:20.100> some<00:01:20.250> information<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.909> some<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
gives some information and some of the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.020 
gives some information and some of the
what<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> interface<00:01:23.070> looks<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:23.909> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
what the interface looks like it's a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.850 
what the interface looks like it's a
pretty<00:01:24.210> simple<00:01:24.360> interface<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:25.110> darkness

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
pretty simple interface as darkness

bottom<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.619> some<00:01:31.950> specs<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.180> think

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
bottom this is some specs and I think

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.850 
bottom this is some specs and I think
that's<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.780> guess<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> back<00:01:34.530> so

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
that's I guess it's on the back so

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.710 
that's I guess it's on the back so
actually<00:01:35.460> how<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.579> open<00:01:35.759> stair<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.270> passed

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
actually how you open stair just passed

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.690 
actually how you open stair just passed
here<00:01:37.140> open<00:01:37.920> off

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.789 

this<00:01:42.700> is<00:01:42.939> the<00:01:43.450> roadside<00:01:44.049> service<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.619> guess

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
this is the roadside service I guess

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.760 
this is the roadside service I guess
this<00:01:45.329> she<00:01:46.329> has<00:01:46.479> a<00:01:46.509> code<00:01:46.840> at<00:01:47.079> the<00:01:47.200> back<00:01:47.380> and

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
this she has a code at the back and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.550 
this she has a code at the back and
there's<00:01:48.040> something<00:01:48.310> like<00:01:48.399> that<00:01:48.579> I'm<00:01:49.409> here<00:01:50.409> is

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
there's something like that I'm here is

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.249 
there's something like that I'm here is
actually<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:51.070> Jew<00:01:51.220> kiss<00:01:51.399> itself<00:01:52.090> I'll<00:01:53.049> put

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
actually the Jew kiss itself I'll put

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.990 
actually the Jew kiss itself I'll put
that<00:01:53.290> off<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.680> side<00:01:53.740> this<00:01:54.520> one<00:01:54.729> thing<00:01:54.909> to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
that off to the side this one thing to

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.620 
that off to the side this one thing to
note<00:01:55.149> is<00:01:55.270> that<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:56.140> is<00:01:56.259> really<00:01:57.450> something<00:01:58.450> that

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
note is that it is really something that

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.100 
note is that it is really something that
it's<00:01:58.840> really<00:01:59.080> small<00:01:59.289> I<00:01:59.560> guess<00:02:00.369> they're<00:02:00.549> just

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
it's really small I guess they're just

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.370 
it's really small I guess they're just
pops<00:02:02.110> up<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:03.600> i'm<00:02:04.600> not<00:02:04.750> sure<00:02:04.840> what<00:02:04.960> this<00:02:05.080> is<00:02:05.259> i

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
pops up and i'm not sure what this is i

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.139 
pops up and i'm not sure what this is i
think<00:02:05.409> it's<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:05.799> pace<00:02:06.039> for<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.369> gene<00:02:06.520> suction<00:02:06.970> cup

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
think it's a pace for a gene suction cup

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.759 
think it's a pace for a gene suction cup
not<00:02:07.659> sure<00:02:07.869> yet<00:02:08.019> maybe<00:02:08.979> have<00:02:09.160> an<00:02:09.250> annotation<00:02:09.489> on

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
not sure yet maybe have an annotation on

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.059 
not sure yet maybe have an annotation on
here<00:02:11.769> is<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.220> actually<00:02:13.030> car<00:02:13.540> charger<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:14.950> it

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
here is the actually car charger so it

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.160 
here is the actually car charger so it
is<00:02:15.100> it's<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.959> cigarette<00:02:16.959> lighter<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:19.170> mini

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
is it's the cigarette lighter to a mini

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.830 
is it's the cigarette lighter to a mini
USB<00:02:20.580> cable<00:02:22.080> here's<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.350> octave<00:02:23.799> power<00:02:24.840> here

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
USB cable here's the octave power here

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.150 
USB cable here's the octave power here
is<00:02:26.019> he<00:02:26.260> now<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:28.269> car<00:02:28.620> saving<00:02:29.620> put<00:02:29.799> on<00:02:29.920> the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
is he now the car saving put on the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.509 
is he now the car saving put on the
windshield<00:02:30.540> here's<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:31.989> guess<00:02:32.350> eclipse<00:02:32.739> will

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
windshield here's I guess eclipse will

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.340 
windshield here's I guess eclipse will
just<00:02:33.730> like<00:02:33.850> snaps<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.930> then<00:02:38.049> it

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
just like snaps on that and then it

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.630 
just like snaps on that and then it
obviously<00:02:38.739> one<00:02:38.920> that's<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.310> beyond<00:02:39.519> the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
obviously one that's so beyond the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.550 
obviously one that's so beyond the
windshield<00:02:40.000> they're<00:02:40.690> just<00:02:40.720> mapped<00:02:41.080> onto<00:02:41.319> the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
windshield they're just mapped onto the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.759 
windshield they're just mapped onto the
back<00:02:41.709> there<00:02:44.100> here's<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:46.230> USB<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.380> micro<00:02:47.650> s

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
back there here's the USB to micro s

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.699 
back there here's the USB to micro s
micro<00:02:48.700> see<00:02:49.090> i<00:02:49.269> guess<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.750> plug<00:02:50.230> into<00:02:50.410> your

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
micro see i guess to plug into your

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.509 
micro see i guess to plug into your
computer<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.970> get<00:02:52.090> those<00:02:52.299> lovely<00:02:53.260> updates<00:02:53.590> and

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
computer to get those lovely updates and

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.860 
computer to get those lovely updates and
you<00:02:54.609> have<00:02:54.700> some<00:02:54.880> manuals<00:02:55.329> activate<00:02:55.750> your

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
you have some manuals activate your

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.349 
you have some manuals activate your
lifetime<00:02:56.200> maps<00:02:56.549> up<00:02:57.549> some<00:02:57.760> other<00:02:57.880> manuals

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
lifetime maps up some other manuals

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.569 
lifetime maps up some other manuals
let's<00:02:59.140> take<00:02:59.320> a<00:02:59.380> look<00:02:59.590> at<00:02:59.620> that<00:02:59.799> so<00:03:00.310> that's<00:03:00.430> all

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
let's take a look at that so that's all

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.599 
let's take a look at that so that's all
that's<00:03:00.730> inside<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.180> box<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:03.160> actually<00:03:03.310> let's

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
that's inside the box so actually let's

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.340 
that's inside the box so actually let's
actually<00:03:03.790> take<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.090> look<00:03:04.269> at<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.480> garmin<00:03:04.870> nuvi

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
actually take a look at the garmin nuvi

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.289 
actually take a look at the garmin nuvi
system<00:03:05.680> itself<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.220> just<00:03:06.970> pull<00:03:07.120> up<00:03:07.150> that

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
system itself I just pull up that

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.940 
system itself I just pull up that
sticker<00:03:07.570> hopefully<00:03:08.019> I<00:03:08.049> get<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.290> call<00:03:08.590> center

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
sticker hopefully I get that call center

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.300 
sticker hopefully I get that call center
I<00:03:09.430> heard<00:03:10.359> it<00:03:10.390> I<00:03:10.660> know<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:10.870> guys<00:03:11.109> did<00:03:11.319> so

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
I heard it I know you guys did so

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.470 
I heard it I know you guys did so
actually<00:03:12.609> let's<00:03:12.730> take<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:12.940> look<00:03:13.120> around<00:03:13.239> the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
actually let's take a look around the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.780 
actually let's take a look around the
device<00:03:13.859> on<00:03:14.859> the<00:03:14.950> top<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.310> has<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.579> power

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
device on the top it has the power

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.460 
device on the top it has the power
button<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.239> that<00:03:16.810> holder<00:03:17.170> for<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.970> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
button and that holder for the the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.690 
button and that holder for the the
windshield<00:03:20.470> on<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:21.549> right<00:03:21.760> nothing<00:03:22.319> bottom<00:03:23.319> I

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
windshield on the right nothing bottom I

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.430 
windshield on the right nothing bottom I
just<00:03:24.700> saying<00:03:24.910> thats<00:03:25.090> bluetooth<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.810> the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
just saying thats bluetooth and the

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.120 
just saying thats bluetooth and the
other<00:03:26.530> connection<00:03:27.100> on<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:28.090> left<00:03:28.750> side<00:03:29.130> what

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
other connection on the left side what

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.250 
other connection on the left side what
is<00:03:30.220> it<00:03:30.569> actually<00:03:31.569> know<00:03:31.720> how<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.840> deal<00:03:32.019> with<00:03:32.139> it

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
is it actually know how to deal with it

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.440 
is it actually know how to deal with it
oh<00:03:32.350> I<00:03:32.380> think<00:03:32.709> that's<00:03:32.859> the<00:03:32.950> connector<00:03:33.340> for<00:03:33.519> the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.720 

for<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.480> car<00:03:38.049> charger<00:03:38.500> or<00:03:38.680> something<00:03:39.010> else<00:03:39.160> on

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
for the car charger or something else on

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.490 
for the car charger or something else on
the<00:03:40.000> back<00:03:40.180> actually<00:03:40.900> now<00:03:40.959> there's<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.319> mini

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
the back actually now there's the mini

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.520 
the back actually now there's the mini
us<00:03:41.739> before<00:03:42.100> and<00:03:42.220> speaker<00:03:42.910> grill<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:44.200> actually

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
us before and speaker grill and actually

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:56.250 
us before and speaker grill and actually
guess<00:03:45.459> i<00:03:45.639> will<00:03:45.700> power<00:03:46.030> on<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.359> device

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:04.680 

okay<00:03:56.890> does<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.489> not<00:03:57.549> have<00:03:57.610> any<00:03:57.909> better

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.950 

I<00:04:04.750> guess<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:05.800> does<00:04:05.890> not<00:04:06.040> any<00:04:06.160> better<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:07.390> wonder

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
I guess it does not any better I wonder

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.710 
I guess it does not any better I wonder
if<00:04:08.080> it<00:04:08.170> actually<00:04:08.380> tells<00:04:08.710> you<00:04:08.980> screen<00:04:09.850> size<00:04:10.060> yes

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
if it actually tells you screen size yes

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.360 
if it actually tells you screen size yes
so<00:04:11.110> it<00:04:11.230> is<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:12.060> 4.3<00:04:13.060> inch<00:04:13.330> screen<00:04:13.450> size<00:04:14.370> look

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
so it is a 4.3 inch screen size look

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.670 
so it is a 4.3 inch screen size look
nearly<00:04:15.840> actually<00:04:16.840> this<00:04:16.900> is<00:04:17.019> actually<00:04:17.140> cool

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
nearly actually this is actually cool

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.900 
nearly actually this is actually cool
the<00:04:17.830> fact<00:04:18.100> that<00:04:18.160> it<00:04:18.340> comes<00:04:18.489> with<00:04:18.549> nearly<00:04:18.820> six

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
the fact that it comes with nearly six

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.240 
the fact that it comes with nearly six
million<00:04:19.600> points<00:04:20.080> of<00:04:20.260> interest<00:04:20.350> so<00:04:20.950> that's<00:04:21.130> how

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
million points of interest so that's how

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.670 
million points of interest so that's how
you<00:04:21.310> know<00:04:21.540> it's<00:04:22.540> really<00:04:22.720> going<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:22.990> do<00:04:23.440> some

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
you know it's really going to do some

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.560 
you know it's really going to do some
good<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:24.040> actually<00:04:24.700> I<00:04:24.940> guess<00:04:25.180> let<00:04:25.360> me<00:04:25.450> tell

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
good and actually I guess let me tell

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.480 
good and actually I guess let me tell
you<00:04:25.660> some<00:04:25.810> more<00:04:25.840> about<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.140> gps<00:04:26.620> it<00:04:26.890> does<00:04:27.220> give

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
you some more about the gps it does give

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.890 
you some more about the gps it does give
you<00:04:27.700> masher<00:04:28.240> North<00:04:28.870> America<00:04:29.350> Puerto<00:04:30.310> Rico

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900

you masher North America Puerto Rico
Bahamas<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.200> other<00:04:32.800> places<00:04:33.100> like<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:34.290> those

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
Bahamas and other places like that those

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.360 
Bahamas and other places like that those
are<00:04:35.440> going<00:04:35.620> ones<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:35.860> can<00:04:35.980> remember<00:04:36.250> off<00:04:36.340> the

are going ones that can remember off the

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.130 
are going ones that can remember off the
top<00:04:36.460> of<00:04:36.640> my<00:04:36.760> head<00:04:36.850> unless<00:04:37.150> it<00:04:37.450> tell<00:04:37.780> you<00:04:37.900> some

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
more here well actually does it now

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.870 
more here well actually does it now
wonder<00:04:41.890> if<00:04:41.950> I<00:04:42.010> won't<00:04:42.220> turn<00:04:42.370> on<00:04:42.520> I've<00:04:42.700> seen

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
wonder if I won't turn on I've seen

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.190 
wonder if I won't turn on I've seen
other<00:04:43.000> boxing's<00:04:43.630> where<00:04:43.780> people<00:04:44.050> actually

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
other boxing's where people actually

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.410 
other boxing's where people actually
have<00:04:44.590> enough<00:04:45.040> time<00:04:45.400> right<00:04:45.460> here<00:04:47.520> well<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.970> guess

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
have enough time right here well I guess

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.860 
have enough time right here well I guess
long<00:04:49.720> power<00:04:49.960> on<00:04:50.170> um<00:04:50.410> can't<00:04:51.190> show<00:04:51.640> anything<00:04:51.880> so

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
long power on um can't show anything so
