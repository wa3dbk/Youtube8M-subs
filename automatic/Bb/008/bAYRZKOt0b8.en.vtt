00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.720
 We all know that year is in the wind 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 the hunt 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.919
 because of the hunting season but why go 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.120
 I actually said so forward to the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.190
 hunting in the winter 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.490
 we are in a village 3 in the closet my 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.260
 fair passionate hunter I'm looking forward 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.760
 to that 28 because in the end it 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.470
 final piece is the whole year 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.480
 manage what we have done in it 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.250
 spring that is beautiful then you see the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.800
 power of nature and all that is 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.930
 when a young animal comes in again 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.330
 the sun we want to do a lot of management and damage 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.830
 around the farmers but autumn and the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.660
 winter then the time that you can 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.040
 harvesting work which the image 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.480
 all the splendor in nature amazed with 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.520
 dots on large 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.290
 you have to deal with resilient animals 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.329
 then you go together with friends or 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.059
 colleagues or with the members of the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.530
 association or rather alone 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.820
 yes we have a fixed group of friends that 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.860
 hunting together for 30 years 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.870
 so we usually go to more path 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.160
 wk duels guests imprinted and i on the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.160
 message series different years 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.740
 are you actually looking at 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.880
 well we just chased away the whole and 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.810
 then I am new and see where they go 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.710
 travel by plane 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.420
 but maybe I want a colleague 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.350
 hunt just to warn him then 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.140
 there too 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.790
 it causes no harm come 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.740
 you don't really have a bad vision 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.210
 in the winter with hunting 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.490
 you can see them better in the winter than in the 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.290
 summer and if you look here you see 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.330
 day can look through pretty well 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.890
 but in the summer when you are on the two 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.630
 months it is completely green 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.520
 and opaque 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.560
 and then you can handle the minor and reasons 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.900
 so much harder to find so winter is 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.430
 the season for years then it gives 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.780
 namely more satisfaction than hurry up 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.320
 really want your place from clay pigeon 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.300
 shoot 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.530
 yes that is really not too 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.759
 comparing in the hunt is the total 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.009
 happening of nature 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.050
 management and on a piece of meat you have 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.250
 bart when you have hunted well and 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.930
 lost more with sheltered rice 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.850
 speak of a league athletes order 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.430
 not to myself 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.640
 yes exactly and what will feel is 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.229
 actually killing his team 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.450
 can you kill animals for fun? 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.769
 not but it has a certain function 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.690
 here again we have to for the farmers 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.760
 we must fight the damage you have to 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.080
 a piece of nature management do that oil too 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.880
 many rabbits don't come to people 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.800
 get a lot of damage in the rod 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.300
 and thereby you also become the dead of 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.040
 an animal 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.750
 oh is going to work with the stuff to van der 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:29.980
 First of all you have to hunt of course 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:34.390
 culinary home and then the shot game 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.250
 care wait and then it goes now 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.570
 exactly so often what you actually 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.520
 has shot 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:44.060
 yes and myself 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.280
 archeology and I myself because of the image 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.340
 from chelsea roxana I judge the best 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.320
 quality japanese yacht varnish now we miss 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.210
 now spring and how 20 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.500
 November wait until we tried to 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.350
 provided channels 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.720
 ground is on through corridor and now whole 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.720
 so long photograms stay around
