00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.639 
gonna discuss later what exactly I'm
doing<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:48.710> tempo<00:00:49.010> is<00:00:49.210> 120<00:00:50.379> here<00:00:51.379> is<00:00:51.559> the

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
doing so the tempo is 120 here is the

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.330 
doing so the tempo is 120 here is the
backing<00:00:51.920> track<00:00:52.070> in<00:00:53.000> my<00:00:53.120> computer

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
backing track in my computer

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.119 
backing track in my computer
126<00:00:55.340> tablets<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.629> it's<00:00:56.809> 12<00:00:57.320> notes<00:00:57.649> per<00:00:57.800> second

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
126 tablets so it's 12 notes per second

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.360 
126 tablets so it's 12 notes per second
it's<00:00:58.390> pretty<00:00:59.390> fast<00:00:59.629> actually<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:00.500> let's<00:01:01.250> go

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
it's pretty fast actually so let's go

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.009 
it's pretty fast actually so let's go
straight<00:01:01.429> to<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.730> lick<00:01:01.910> and<00:01:02.059> then<00:01:02.329> I'm<00:01:02.750> gonna

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
straight to the lick and then I'm gonna

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:15.860 
straight to the lick and then I'm gonna

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.480 

this<00:01:16.870> is<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.020> lick<00:01:17.229> I<00:01:17.500> wanna<00:01:18.010> pick<00:01:18.220> one<00:01:18.430> more

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
this is a lick I wanna pick one more

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:32.670 
this is a lick I wanna pick one more
time<00:01:20.580> 1<00:01:21.580> 2<00:01:22.030> 3<00:01:22.479> go

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.100 

so<00:01:33.680> this<00:01:33.830> is<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:33.980> lick<00:01:34.160> and<00:01:34.720> let's<00:01:35.720> go<00:01:35.870> straight

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
so this is a lick and let's go straight

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.040 
so this is a lick and let's go straight
now<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.620> analyze<00:01:37.040> first<00:01:37.940> of<00:01:38.090> all<00:01:38.210> I'm<00:01:38.750> using

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
now and analyze first of all I'm using

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.890 
now and analyze first of all I'm using
the<00:01:39.260> a<00:01:39.470> Ionian<00:01:40.160> scale<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:40.970> they<00:01:41.390> have<00:01:41.600> no

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
the a Ionian scale so they have no

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.550 
the a Ionian scale so they have no
sharps<00:01:42.320> no<00:01:42.380> flats<00:01:42.910> and<00:01:43.910> I'm<00:01:44.540> gonna<00:01:44.780> divide<00:01:45.050> the

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
sharps no flats and I'm gonna divide the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.090 
sharps no flats and I'm gonna divide the
lick<00:01:45.740> in<00:01:45.920> two<00:01:46.100> parts<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:46.550> first<00:01:46.580> part<00:01:51.010> so<00:01:52.010> this

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
lick in two parts the first part so this

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.640 
lick in two parts the first part so this
is<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:52.280> first<00:01:52.490> part<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:52.820> I'm<00:01:53.479> playing<00:01:54.200> the

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
is the first part and I'm playing the

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.140 
is the first part and I'm playing the
notes<00:01:54.830> a<00:01:55.010> b<00:01:55.700> c<00:01:55.729> d<00:01:56.420> e<00:01:56.840> f<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.100> it's<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.640> first<00:01:58.910> six

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
notes a b c d e f so it's the first six

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.250 
notes a b c d e f so it's the first six
notes<00:01:59.390> of<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.600> a<00:01:59.630> Aeolian<00:02:00.170> scale<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:02.260> the

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
notes of the a Aeolian scale and the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:12.929 
notes of the a Aeolian scale and the
lick<00:02:03.830> goes<00:02:04.070> like<00:02:07.780> one<00:02:08.780> more<00:02:08.869> time
