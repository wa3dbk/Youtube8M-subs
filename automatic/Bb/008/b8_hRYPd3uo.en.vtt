to<00:00:39.180> low-income<00:00:39.920> immigrants<00:00:40.920> we<00:00:41.340> didn't<00:00:41.610> have

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
to low-income immigrants we didn't have

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.090 
to low-income immigrants we didn't have
much<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.000> an<00:00:42.239> education<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.710> went<00:00:43.980> into

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
much of an education and I went into

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.250 
much of an education and I went into
getting<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.610> master's<00:00:45.329> degree<00:00:45.360> from<00:00:45.600> Carnegie

Mellon<00:00:46.289> University<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.250> MIT<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.480> think

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
Mellon University and MIT so I think

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.690 
Mellon University and MIT so I think
that<00:00:48.930> education<00:00:49.020> was<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:50.070> key<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.520> my

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
that education was a key to my

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.250 
that education was a key to my
professional<00:00:51.300> personal<00:00:51.570> success<00:00:51.809> and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
professional personal success and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
think that first of all this is the this

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.750 
think that first of all this is the this
is<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.269> race<00:03:05.599> for<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.080> Board<00:03:06.890> of<00:03:06.980> Education<00:03:07.099> so

is a race for the Board of Education so

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.220 
is a race for the Board of Education so
has<00:03:07.970> nothing<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.510> do<00:03:08.660> with<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.900> charter

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230

changes anything in this town what we

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.340 
changes anything in this town what we
have<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.400> change<00:03:40.670> is<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:40.910> system<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:42.170> might

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
have to change is the system you might

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.530 
have to change is the system you might
bring<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.859> best<00:03:43.190> superintendent<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.359> the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
bring the best superintendent in the

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.539 
bring the best superintendent in the
country<00:03:45.019> but<00:03:45.500> if<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:45.709> bring<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.280> guy

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
country but if you bring that guy

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.729 
country but if you bring that guy
through<00:03:46.880> a<00:03:46.910> corrupted<00:03:47.540> system<00:03:47.720> then<00:03:48.500> he's

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
through a corrupted system then he's

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.949 
through a corrupted system then he's
going<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:49.040> where<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:49.880> can<00:03:50.060> have<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.420> best<00:03:50.720> the

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
going to where you can have the best the

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.910 
going to where you can have the best the
brightest<00:03:51.440> student<00:03:51.799> but<00:03:52.130> who<00:03:52.400> goes<00:03:52.700> through<00:03:52.730> a

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
brightest student but who goes through a

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.069 
brightest student but who goes through a
poor<00:03:54.920> educational<00:03:55.549> system<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.120> he<00:03:56.359> won't<00:03:56.569> be

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
poor educational system and he won't be

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.599 
poor educational system and he won't be
a<00:03:57.109> good<00:03:57.319> a<00:03:57.380> student<00:03:57.590> so<00:03:57.980> I<00:03:58.010> think<00:03:58.130> we<00:03:58.370> have<00:03:58.400> to

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
a good a student so I think we have to

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.309 
a good a student so I think we have to
focus<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:59.090> change<00:03:59.299> the<00:03:59.450> system<00:03:59.780> this<00:04:00.049> is<00:04:00.170> what

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
focus and change the system this is what

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.370 
focus and change the system this is what
I<00:04:00.350> mean<00:04:00.530> for<00:04:00.920> example<00:04:00.950> if<00:04:01.670> you<00:04:01.970> are<00:04:02.000> a

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
I mean for example if you are a

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
I mean for example if you are a
high-performing<00:04:03.380> teacher<00:04:03.620> a<00:04:03.920> teacher<00:04:03.980> who

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
high-performing teacher a teacher who

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.030 
high-performing teacher a teacher who
cares<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.060> you<00:04:05.600> know<00:04:05.900> that<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.560> fate<00:04:06.799> of<00:04:06.829> your

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
cares and you know that the fate of your

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.090 
cares and you know that the fate of your
career<00:04:07.430> is<00:04:07.730> based<00:04:08.030> no<00:04:08.510> it's<00:04:09.410> not<00:04:09.590> based<00:04:09.799> on<00:04:09.920> how

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
career is based no it's not based on how

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.400 
career is based no it's not based on how
hard<00:04:10.400> you<00:04:10.489> work<00:04:10.700> but<00:04:10.910> rather<00:04:11.180> on<00:04:11.870> who<00:04:12.260> you

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
hard you work but rather on who you

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.039 
hard you work but rather on who you
contribute<00:04:13.010> for<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.310> campaign<00:04:13.730> or<00:04:14.060> who<00:04:14.780> you

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
contribute for a campaign or who you

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.599 
contribute for a campaign or who you
align<00:04:15.319> politically<00:04:15.980> that<00:04:16.160> is<00:04:16.250> unfair<00:04:16.549> and

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
align politically that is unfair and

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.759 
align politically that is unfair and
that<00:04:16.940> is<00:04:17.030> what<00:04:17.150> we<00:04:17.239> have<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.510> change<00:04:17.840> changing

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
that is what we have to change changing

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.860 
that is what we have to change changing
people<00:04:19.160> doesn't<00:04:20.000> solve<00:04:20.120> anything

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
people doesn't solve anything

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.780 
people doesn't solve anything
in<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.049> long<00:04:21.229> run<00:04:21.260> right<00:04:22.040> we<00:04:22.190> have<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.430> focus

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
in the long run right we have to focus

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.670 
in the long run right we have to focus
on<00:04:23.090> changing<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.419> system<00:04:23.690> and<00:04:24.080> by<00:04:24.410> that<00:04:24.620> I

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
on changing the system and by that I

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.950 
on changing the system and by that I
mean<00:04:24.919> simply<00:04:25.250> removing<00:04:25.699> politics<00:04:26.479> out<00:04:26.630> of<00:04:26.690> the

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
mean simply removing politics out of the

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.980 
mean simply removing politics out of the

the politics of the race stressing his
independence<00:04:32.510> I<00:04:32.780> was<00:04:33.410> offered<00:04:33.889> actually<00:04:34.220> to

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
independence I was offered actually to

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.140 
independence I was offered actually to
do<00:04:35.150> a<00:04:35.180> run<00:04:35.540> as<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:36.530> slate<00:04:36.889> however<00:04:37.760> what<00:04:38.120> I

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
do a run as a slate however what I

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.110 
do a run as a slate however what I
realized<00:04:38.660> that<00:04:38.960> most<00:04:39.380> candidates<00:04:39.919> align<00:04:40.430> you

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
realized that most candidates align you

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.300 
realized that most candidates align you
know<00:04:41.240> with<00:04:41.419> a<00:04:41.449> politician<00:04:42.110> and<00:04:42.260> there<00:04:43.190> is<00:04:43.280> a

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310
