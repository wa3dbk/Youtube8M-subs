your<00:01:02.219> computer<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.850> by<00:01:03.300> USB<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.080> I'm<00:01:04.140> just

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
your computer is by USB so I'm just

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.070 
your computer is by USB so I'm just
going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.500> move<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:05.900> unfortunately<00:01:06.900> it

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
going to move this here unfortunately it

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.310 
going to move this here unfortunately it
does<00:01:07.290> take<00:01:07.710> two<00:01:08.130> USB<00:01:08.820> cables<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.810> plug<00:01:09.840> into

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
does take two USB cables to plug into

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.620 
does take two USB cables to plug into
your<00:01:10.680> computer<00:01:11.000> but<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.150> wasn't<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> really

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
your computer but that wasn't a really

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.810 
your computer but that wasn't a really
big<00:01:12.810> deal<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.020> me<00:01:13.290> because<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.979> does<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.310> USB

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
big deal for me because it does have USB

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.940 
big deal for me because it does have USB
hub<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.600> dock<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.380> I'm<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.590> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.799> go

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
hub and a dock so I'm just going to go

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.560 
hub and a dock so I'm just going to go
ahead<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.250> plug<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.820> right<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.299> into

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
ahead and plug that in right here into

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.800 
ahead and plug that in right here into
one<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.530> my<00:01:19.619> USB<00:01:19.979> hubs<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.700> several<00:01:21.540> at

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
one of my USB hubs I have several at

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.450 
one of my USB hubs I have several at
this<00:01:22.020> point<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.680> doesn't<00:01:23.009> really<00:01:23.100> take

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
this point so it doesn't really take

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.249 
this point so it doesn't really take
doesn't<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.150> imply<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.689> big<00:01:24.869> deal<00:01:25.110> to

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
doesn't really imply really big deal to

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.800 
doesn't really imply really big deal to
me<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.400> does<00:01:26.580> plug<00:01:26.880> into<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.240> way<00:01:27.570> so

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
me but it does plug into that way so

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.270 
me but it does plug into that way so
once<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.140> plugged<00:01:28.439> them<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.950> pretty<00:01:29.130> much

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
once I plugged them in I can pretty much

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.190 
once I plugged them in I can pretty much
push<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> out<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> way<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.930> use<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
push it out the way and I can use the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.370 
push it out the way and I can use the
keyboard<00:01:31.380> full<00:01:32.310> feature<00:01:32.549> from<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
keyboard full feature from here so the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.980 
keyboard full feature from here so the
driver<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.799> obviously<00:01:35.220> plug<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.790> play<00:01:35.990> I'm

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
driver is obviously plug and play I'm

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.660 
driver is obviously plug and play I'm
going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> zoom<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.590> little<00:01:37.710> bit<00:01:37.920> here<00:01:38.130> onto

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
going to zoom in a little bit here onto

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.810 
going to zoom in a little bit here onto
this<00:01:39.360> right-hand<00:01:40.110> side<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.409> keyboard

this right-hand side of the keyboard

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.160 
this right-hand side of the keyboard

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
might not even focus that well but

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.740 
might not even focus that well but
here's<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> volume<00:01:44.250> up<00:01:44.460> volume<00:01:44.490> down<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.479> mute

big feature of the selling point of this

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.690 
big feature of the selling point of this
this<00:01:54.990> configuration<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.130> has<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> dock

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
this configuration is that it has a dock

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.300 
this configuration is that it has a dock
up<00:01:57.000> top<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.200> see<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> USB

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
up top as you can see this is the USB

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.219 
up top as you can see this is the USB
2.0<00:01:59.850> dock<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.390> I'm<00:02:00.479> going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> zoom<00:02:00.810> back<00:02:00.840> out

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
2.0 dock so I'm going to zoom back out

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.050 
2.0 dock so I'm going to zoom back out
again

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
again

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.050 
again
so<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.240> USB<00:02:03.659> 2.0<00:02:04.110> dock<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.680> basically<00:02:05.250> it's

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
so the USB 2.0 dock is basically it's

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.850 
so the USB 2.0 dock is basically it's
not<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> huge<00:02:06.750> deal<00:02:07.020> except<00:02:07.380> for<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.560> fact<00:02:07.770> that

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
not a huge deal except for the fact that

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.449 
not a huge deal except for the fact that
is<00:02:08.069> stay<00:02:08.280> facing<00:02:09.149> one<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> hubs

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
is stay facing one of the hubs

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.490 
is stay facing one of the hubs
and<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:10.970> say<00:02:11.180> that<00:02:11.360> because<00:02:11.480> on<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.930> back<00:02:12.140> there

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
and I say that because on the back there

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.750 
and I say that because on the back there
is<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.680> USB<00:02:13.310> 2.0<00:02:13.939> hub<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:15.260> there<00:02:15.829> are<00:02:15.980> three<00:02:16.400> USB

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
is a USB 2.0 hub so there are three USB

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.350 
is a USB 2.0 hub so there are three USB
ports<00:02:17.299> out<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.290> one<00:02:18.620> USB<00:02:18.799> error<00:02:19.519> to<00:02:19.849> USB<00:02:20.120> is

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
ports out and one USB error to USB is

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.869 
ports out and one USB error to USB is
plugged<00:02:20.629> into<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.019> computer<00:02:21.459> on<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.610> side

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
plugged into the computer on the side

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.580 
plugged into the computer on the side
you<00:02:23.150> can<00:02:23.269> obviously<00:02:23.599> tell<00:02:23.750> there's<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.200> height

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
you can obviously tell there's a height

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.860 
you can obviously tell there's a height
adjustment<00:02:25.129> right<00:02:25.280> there<00:02:25.489> so<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.790> can<00:02:26.000> adjust

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
adjustment right there so I can adjust

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.630 
adjustment right there so I can adjust
the<00:02:27.019> height<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.230> pretty<00:02:28.069> much<00:02:28.189> have<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.489> as

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
the height and pretty much have it as

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.539 
the height and pretty much have it as
high<00:02:28.790> as<00:02:29.000> tilt<00:02:29.269> as<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.510> want<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:30.709> USB<00:02:31.099> 2.0

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
high as tilt as I want the USB 2.0

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.130 
high as tilt as I want the USB 2.0
keyboard<00:02:31.939> is<00:02:32.060> really<00:02:32.329> long<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.810> don't<00:02:32.989> really

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
travel I would be typing I was actually

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.080 
travel I would be typing I was actually
typing<00:03:08.959> one<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.739> my<00:03:09.859> essays<00:03:10.280> with<00:03:10.549> this<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:10.970> it

typing<00:03:13.310> was<00:03:13.459> slowed<00:03:13.819> down<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.090> bit<00:03:14.239> by<00:03:15.019> using

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
typing was slowed down a bit by using

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.610 
typing was slowed down a bit by using
this<00:03:15.530> keyboard<00:03:16.959> so<00:03:17.959> you<00:03:18.049> know<00:03:18.260> that's<00:03:18.410> true

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
this keyboard so you know that's true

Start<00:03:40.190> key<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:40.639> not<00:03:40.819> a<00:03:40.849> big<00:03:41.060> deal<00:03:41.409> that's
