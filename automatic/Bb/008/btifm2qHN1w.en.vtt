00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.049
 like everything is hello to everyone so 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.639
 I'm back for a little video 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.639
 I'm not going to do anything 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.540
 ok I'm here again so I'm going to make a 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:27.460
 idea of â€‹â€‹hairstyle inspired by miss wave 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:29.410
 it's the famous top noc bun so I'm going 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.110
 put the link of this video 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:39.010
 below in the box the description 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:42.040
 so I already made my wet mac like 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.620
 here I have not left all night 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.070
 because unfortunately I have some 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.280
 difficulties well well well tackled my 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.900
 hair but well short if you have this 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.640
 kind of problem like me you can 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.320
 do this at night do not over tighten 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.240
 and I have blackouts I 'll be 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.980
 not too much can otherwise you go 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.670
 have a headache and your night is going 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.909
 to be horrible 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.090
 good brief so first thing I'm going 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.030
 to do is to hide because I have 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.680
 used confirming to but evokes a 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.180
 lace power tie the hair because 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.249
 that with an elastic is complicated 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.719
 I have a lot of hair 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:22.450
 as long as it is in addition to my 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:27.939
 hair is thicker so I took 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.350
 a lace a rolling cabbage hockey brief this 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.329
 is just going on 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.090
 separate your shower a big head 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:38.469
 you separate your can in two 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:43.509
 parties is you put it behind 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:45.520
 like that it's as simple as that eh 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:51.569
 Well, after that, you take pins to 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.569
 hair and tie you 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.080
 no 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.440
 ah ah 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.940
 if the next day and this time I 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.350
 meaning the pourcel version for hair 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.840
 so short as the base 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:59.840
 the first do 1-1 hockey quilt 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.070
 like these and the goal is to 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.650
 add lashes so I'm going 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.930
 inspire me with a youtube buzz that did 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.310
 absolutely not the same texture and the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.900
 same length as me it's a 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.320
 Caucasian that there is a type of hair 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.940
 healthy and that's the method she has 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.820
 used and I really liked the rendering 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.610
 final so I'll try his hairstyle and 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.030
 as the first method I would put his 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.230
 video in the description box she 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.510
 do not really have hair at all 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.730
 frizzy and not at all the same length 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.520
 but I really liked that at his hairstyle 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.800
 so I'm going to take inspiration from her for 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.150
 to be able to do it so I'm going 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.560
 take wicks of the marlins take 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.700
 the image you want but I'm going 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.450
 try to take guys who have the 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.150
 a posture quite similar to mine 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:52.250
 ok so I'll I kept the elastic 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:55.390
 of the package but of that here it's the same 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.390
 but marley in two 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:10.190
 I'm just going to attach them 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:15.799
 like that take a good amount of 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:18.880
 wicks that I keep for the end it's 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.880
 why I hated marley 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:28.240
 before I cross I'll already separate them 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.690
 parts that I would need for the 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.670
 after 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.860
 ok I look at this side and I 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.530
 keep that aside 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.010
 do I do it's going to be more 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.010
 simple like that 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.890
 okay 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.640
 the like 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:30.590
 I loved him there but I will take care of him 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:33.740
 the end ok but just fold down 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:41.360
 the strands bar in front to cover 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:43.390
 my own hair ok I'm going to do this 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.390
 than 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:04.130
 and there and I have more than afterwards 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:18.410
 take my hair like that 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:18.410
 wind up hockey and but is not settled 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:37.339
 and the goal in the sequel here and if you 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:39.080
 need to add pins this 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:43.819
 what happens is that eventually I have 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:46.460
 had to redo the wick and I added 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.740
 color locks because it was not 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:55.189
 quite long and we did not see enough 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:57.469
 well the address I do not know if it's going to be 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:07:00.229
 no one in any case so I added some 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:01.729
 color highlights and a little more 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:04.039
 mails anyway my long choices 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:08.449
 Matray be long is what happens 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:13.249
 just what am I going to spend the 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:15.699
 truce above my bun as 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:15.699
 this 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:29.449
 now I'm going to secure with 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.449
 a hairpin 

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.750
 he
