00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
American company out of Daytona Beach in

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.420 
American company out of Daytona Beach in
Florida<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:30.170> I<00:00:31.170> believe<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.070> company

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
Florida and I believe that the company

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.110 
Florida and I believe that the company
was<00:00:32.550> founded<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:33.120> 2003<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.850> with<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> owner

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
was founded in 2003 and with the owner

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.940 
was founded in 2003 and with the owner
thinking<00:00:36.570> there<00:00:36.690> was<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> need<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.079> safe

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
thinking there was a need for safe

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.389 
thinking there was a need for safe
simple<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.520> affordable<00:00:39.440> firearms<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:41.250> this

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
simple and affordable firearms so this

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.139 
simple and affordable firearms so this
is<00:00:41.550> what<00:00:41.700> they<00:00:41.850> came<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:43.070> this<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.700> CP

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
is what they came up with this is the CP

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.830 
is what they came up with this is the CP
x2<00:00:45.920> there<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> CP<00:00:47.789> x1<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.510> difference

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
x2 there is a CP x1 the difference

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.020 
x2 there is a CP x1 the difference
between<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.289> two<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.590> them<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.219> CP<00:00:50.550> x2

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
between the two of them is the CP x2

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.240 
between the two of them is the CP x2
does<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:54.170> thumb<00:00:55.170> safety<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> CP<00:00:59.129> x

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
does not have a thumb safety so the CP x

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.840 
does not have a thumb safety so the CP x
one<00:00:59.579> does<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.840> believe<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> CP<00:01:01.859> x1<00:01:02.460> has

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
one does I do believe the CP x1 has

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.620 
one does I do believe the CP x1 has
gotten<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:04.290> couple<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.979> bad<00:01:05.159> reviews<00:01:05.630> but
