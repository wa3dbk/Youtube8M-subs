get<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.050> my<00:00:28.199> thoughts<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.010> second

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
get to my thoughts on that in a second

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.099 
get to my thoughts on that in a second
but<00:00:29.580> they're<00:00:30.090> pretty<00:00:30.330> much<00:00:30.390> at<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.689> time<00:00:30.929> in

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
but they're pretty much at the time in

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.900 
but they're pretty much at the time in
the<00:00:31.199> season<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.590> Vikings<00:00:31.980> where<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.430> think

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
the season the Vikings where I think

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.180 
the season the Vikings where I think
it's<00:00:33.000> pretty<00:00:33.239> clear<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.930> my<00:00:33.989> eyes<00:00:34.770> at<00:00:34.980> least

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
it's pretty clear in my eyes at least

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.950 
it's pretty clear in my eyes at least
that<00:00:35.730> Christian<00:00:36.120> Ponder<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.510> probably<00:00:36.840> not

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
that Christian Ponder is probably not

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.200 
that Christian Ponder is probably not
going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> franchise<00:00:38.010> guy<00:00:38.280> they're<00:00:39.059> not

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
going to be a franchise guy they're not

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.270 
going to be a franchise guy they're not
going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> give<00:00:39.480> him<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.780> extension<00:00:40.379> I'm<00:00:40.770> off

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
going to give him that extension I'm off

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.400 
going to give him that extension I'm off
of<00:00:41.309> his<00:00:41.760> rookie<00:00:42.210> contract<00:00:42.420> nor<00:00:43.110> do<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.320> think

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
of his rookie contract nor do I think

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.440 
of his rookie contract nor do I think
they<00:00:43.710> should<00:00:43.950> they're<00:00:44.760> hoping<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.270> Matt

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
they should they're hoping that Matt

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.299 
they should they're hoping that Matt
Cassel<00:00:45.899> can<00:00:46.050> come<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.379> with<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.010> injury<00:00:47.250> to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
Cassel can come in with the injury to

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.520 
Cassel can come in with the injury to
ponder<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.879> provide<00:00:48.149> some<00:00:48.450> kind<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.750> spark<00:00:49.079> to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
ponder and provide some kind of spark to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.830 
ponder and provide some kind of spark to
get<00:00:49.710> them<00:00:49.950> up<00:00:50.129> from<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.430> depths<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.910> 0<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.390> 3

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.149 
depend very much on how Matt Cassel
plays<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.750> don't<00:01:25.409> really<00:01:25.530> see<00:01:25.650> much<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
plays I don't really see much of a

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.980 
plays I don't really see much of a
difference<00:01:26.189> between<00:01:26.549> Matt<00:01:26.880> Cassel<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.509> Josh

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
difference between Matt Cassel and Josh

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.690 
difference between Matt Cassel and Josh
Freeman<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.500> tell<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> truth<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.610> if

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
Freeman to tell you the truth so if

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700 
Freeman to tell you the truth so if
Cassel<00:01:29.970> fails<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.750> they<00:01:31.200> don't<00:01:31.320> want<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.619> go

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
Cassel fails and they don't want to go

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.039 
Cassel fails and they don't want to go
back<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.890> ponder<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:32.610> ponder<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.420> more<00:01:33.750> injured

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
back to ponder or ponder is more injured

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.840 
back to ponder or ponder is more injured
than<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.259> think<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:35.009> maybe<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.430> see<00:01:35.579> up<00:01:35.700> a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
than we think then maybe you see up a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.050 
than we think then maybe you see up a
trade<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.479> Josh<00:01:36.810> Freeman<00:01:37.430> but<00:01:38.430> look<00:01:38.909> I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
trade for Josh Freeman but look I

trade for Josh Freeman but look I
wouldn't<00:01:39.390> be<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.869> rush<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> trade<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.650> Josh

if the Vikings do this move I think it's

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.480 
if the Vikings do this move I think it's
for<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> quick<00:01:45.750> fix<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.259> year<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.740> can't<00:01:47.280> see
