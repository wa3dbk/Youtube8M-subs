pretty high on it is 40 feet and then

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.300 
pretty high on it is 40 feet and then
we've<00:02:01.460> got<00:02:01.610> another<00:02:01.730> one<00:02:02.060> at<00:02:02.180> 70<00:02:02.770> 70<00:02:03.770> feet<00:02:03.980> yep

it's actually a freefall for a certain

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.630 
it's actually a freefall for a certain
portion<00:02:06.530> of<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.800> then<00:02:06.920> what<00:02:07.070> happens<00:02:07.370> is<00:02:07.490> the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
portion of it then what happens is the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.730 
portion of it then what happens is the
device<00:02:07.970> that's<00:02:08.630> called<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:09.050> quick<00:02:09.200> jump<00:02:09.410> will

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
device that's called a quick jump will

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.710 
device that's called a quick jump will
catch<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.130> and<00:02:10.460> I'll<00:02:10.640> bring<00:02:10.760> you<00:02:10.880> down<00:02:10.910> slowly

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
so it's not like a bungee where you have

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.950 
so it's not like a bungee where you have
an<00:02:13.430> impact<00:02:13.760> it's<00:02:13.970> got<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.570> freefall

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
an impact it's got a the freefall

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.570 
an impact it's got a the freefall
element<00:02:15.440> but<00:02:15.740> then<00:02:15.860> what<00:02:16.010> happens<00:02:16.340> is<00:02:16.460> this

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
element but then what happens is this

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.010 
element but then what happens is this
