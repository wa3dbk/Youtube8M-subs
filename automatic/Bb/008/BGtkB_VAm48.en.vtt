00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.770 
they're going to die so the monkeys make
up<00:01:52.869> gods<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.679> then<00:01:53.859> they<00:01:54.070> worship<00:01:54.729> them<00:01:54.969> then

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
up gods and then they worship them then

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.209 
up gods and then they worship them then
the<00:01:55.899> monkey<00:01:56.170> start<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:56.500> argue<00:01:56.649> over<00:01:57.039> who's

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
the monkey start to argue over who's

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.429 
the monkey start to argue over who's
made<00:01:57.549> up<00:01:57.700> God<00:01:57.939> is<00:01:57.969> better<00:01:58.390> then<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.289> monkeys

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
made up God is better then the monkeys

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.899 
made up God is better then the monkeys
get<00:01:59.740> really<00:02:00.039> pissed<00:02:00.280> off<00:02:00.429> and<00:02:00.700> this<00:02:00.759> is

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
get really pissed off and this is

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.609 
get really pissed off and this is
usually<00:02:01.240> when<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.689> monkeys<00:02:01.990> decide<00:02:02.380> that

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
usually when the monkeys decide that

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.410 
usually when the monkeys decide that
it's<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.799> good<00:02:03.009> time<00:02:03.249> to<00:02:03.520> start<00:02:03.759> killing<00:02:04.359> each

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
it's a good time to start killing each

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.319 
it's a good time to start killing each
other<00:02:04.630> so<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.679> monkeys<00:02:05.979> wage<00:02:06.219> war<00:02:06.579> the

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
other so the monkeys wage war the

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.160 
other so the monkeys wage war the
monkeys<00:02:07.659> make<00:02:07.899> hydrogen<00:02:08.380> bombs

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
monkeys make hydrogen bombs

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.020 
monkeys make hydrogen bombs
the<00:02:09.590> monkeys<00:02:09.860> have<00:02:09.979> got<00:02:10.099> their<00:02:10.250> entire<00:02:10.550> planet

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
the monkeys have got their entire planet

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.510 
the monkeys have got their entire planet
wired<00:02:11.270> up<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.480> explode<00:02:12.080> that<00:02:12.950> monkeys<00:02:13.280> just

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
wired up to explode that monkeys just

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.790 
wired up to explode that monkeys just
can't<00:02:13.700> help<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:14.120> some<00:02:14.959> of<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.140> monkeys<00:02:15.470> play

something<00:02:24.040> some<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.190> monkeys<00:02:25.459> think

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
something some of the monkeys think

something some of the monkeys think
they've<00:02:25.760> got<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.030> all<00:02:26.120> figured<00:02:26.390> out<00:02:26.600> some<00:02:27.200> of

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
they've got it all figured out some of

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.410 
they've got it all figured out some of
