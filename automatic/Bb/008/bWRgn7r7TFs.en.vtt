that I'm analyzing in you know pretty
solid<00:01:30.020> 2<00:01:30.890> all<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.759> way<00:01:31.789> to<00:01:32.440> like<00:01:33.440> tip-top

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:34.099 
solid 2 all the way to like tip-top

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:36.910 
solid 2 all the way to like tip-top
shape<00:01:34.160> condition<00:01:35.060> newly<00:01:35.929> renovated<00:01:36.530> kind<00:01:36.800> of

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
shape condition newly renovated kind of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.320 
shape condition newly renovated kind of
thing<00:01:37.119> so<00:01:38.119> that's<00:01:38.780> your<00:01:39.080> retail<00:01:39.619> value<00:01:40.330> which

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
thing so that's your retail value which

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.880 
thing so that's your retail value which
is<00:01:41.539> also<00:01:42.050> known<00:01:42.349> as<00:01:42.429> ARV<00:01:43.459> after<00:01:44.090> repair<00:01:44.479> value

bedrooms<00:03:00.740> can<00:03:01.330> definitely<00:03:02.330> throw<00:03:02.690> off<00:03:02.930> value

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
bedrooms can definitely throw off value

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.030 
bedrooms can definitely throw off value
by<00:03:04.150> tens<00:03:05.150> of<00:03:05.330> thousands<00:03:05.870> of<00:03:05.960> dollars<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:06.560> you

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
by tens of thousands of dollars so you

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.920 
by tens of thousands of dollars so you
want<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.370> make<00:03:07.490> sure<00:03:07.520> square<00:03:08.390> footage<00:03:08.780> is

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
want to make sure square footage is

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.840 
want to make sure square footage is
similar<00:03:09.460> style<00:03:10.460> of<00:03:10.670> house<00:03:10.850> is<00:03:11.120> similar<00:03:11.600> and

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
similar style of house is similar and

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.620 
similar style of house is similar and
bedrooms<00:03:13.850> are<00:03:14.090> one<00:03:14.270> point<00:03:14.920> so<00:03:16.360> compare<00:03:17.360> apples

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
bedrooms are one point so compare apples

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.800 
bedrooms are one point so compare apples
to<00:03:18.260> apples<00:03:18.500> guys<00:03:19.310> don't<00:03:19.730> compare<00:03:20.120> apples<00:03:20.360> to

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
to apples guys don't compare apples to

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.500 
to apples guys don't compare apples to
bananas<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:24.680> that's<00:03:25.430> how<00:03:25.610> you<00:03:25.670> find<00:03:26.030> out<00:03:26.180> what

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
bananas so that's how you find out what

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.750 
bananas so that's how you find out what
your<00:03:26.660> retail<00:03:27.050> value<00:03:27.440> is<00:03:27.760> comparable

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
your retail value is comparable

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.199 
your retail value is comparable
properties<00:03:29.420> in<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:31.010> then<00:03:31.520> you<00:03:31.820> got<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.090> look

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
properties in and then you got to look

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.650 
properties in and then you got to look
at<00:03:32.420> distance<00:03:33.140> so<00:03:33.890> and<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.820> is<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.030> market<00:03:35.510> to

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
at distance so and this is the market to

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.630 
at distance so and this is the market to
market<00:03:36.020> thing<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:36.500> for<00:03:36.709> example<00:03:37.130> where<00:03:37.340> I'm<00:03:37.430> at

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
market thing so for example where I'm at

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.620

I'm not comping properties no more than
no<00:03:44.720> more<00:03:44.959> than<00:03:45.200> point<00:03:45.590> three<00:03:45.890> miles<00:03:46.130> out<00:03:46.430> so

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
no more than point three miles out so

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.479 
no more than point three miles out so
that's<00:03:47.239> generally<00:03:47.660> like<00:03:48.230> three<00:03:48.800> blocks<00:03:49.100> in

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
that's generally like three blocks in

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.740 
that's generally like three blocks in
every<00:03:49.700> direction<00:03:50.350> but<00:03:51.350> for<00:03:51.410> me<00:03:51.890> I<00:03:52.250> personally

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
every direction but for me I personally

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.090 
every direction but for me I personally
actually<00:03:53.750> like<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.140> keep<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:54.500> tighter<00:03:54.800> than

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
actually like to keep it tighter than

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.570 
actually like to keep it tighter than
that

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
that

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.660

hands-down<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.480> best<00:03:59.840> comps<00:04:00.350> are<00:04:01.150> properties

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
hands-down the best comps are properties

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.010 
hands-down the best comps are properties

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:28.990 
value and you work backwards from there

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.279 
value and you work backwards from there
but<00:07:29.990> more<00:07:30.379> easily<00:07:31.009> is<00:07:31.659> just<00:07:32.659> figuring<00:07:33.139> out

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:33.289 
but more easily is just figuring out

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:35.619 
but more easily is just figuring out
what's<00:07:33.919> the<00:07:34.099> trending<00:07:34.610> cash<00:07:34.849> buyer<00:07:35.210> number
