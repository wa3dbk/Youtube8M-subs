00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:11.759
 yes hello dear youtube stranger has become 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:20.609
 an idea and I did not want to 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:23.490
 regulate and although I wanted was 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.640
 can automatically burn what did it 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.560
 but tried in another world but 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.560
 you can even show it for a short time 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.670
 you solved that way 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.450
 aladag is not quite done 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.880
 on this cobblestones too little than too 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.340
 a lot of transport routes away and 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:13.060
 the yield is not quite so 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:13.060
 great water points 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.960
 fsi 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.550
 but they do not work for me 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.400
 So that no longer give the power to 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.860
 the points back I have no idea 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:33.350
 but why do they give so I want to go back 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:37.490
 the first version of the fires of 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.030
 Brennan actually show themselves to 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.100
 separate 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.800
 to burn the fuel it became 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.070
 filled in irregularly so here to 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.840
 example 26 at once no one here 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.580
 half a stack here is a 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.100
 a little something and transport was also on 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:02.060
 harder to be more reliable and the 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:05.990
 Yield , well, I have that here 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:10.399
 prevents high thrown and out 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:21.110
 superfluous is completely easy 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:25.700
 we still here that was the plant yes it 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.170
 was not the yellow of the egg and yes then 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.990
 I thought about it 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.900
 that could actually be done with electric ovens 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:38.400
 work pretty well and guys 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:46.340
 high it can be the new ranks of the world 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:50.270
 the burned stone comes away 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:56.580
 come away and be over here 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:59.760
 point system brought to the boxes 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.720
 Yield is pretty good and that's nice 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.769
 So timing can be pretty 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.790
 set exactly 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.700
 show you back there 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.980
 have a frequency on two times 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.280
 seconds 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.850
 then we have a small building here 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.230
 that's the long signal of frequencies 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:30.810
 in a short cuts then we have 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:33.120
 here the switch operated over there 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.790
 from the nist and then this will be on 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.820
 designed so that all really accurate 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.799
 trigger simultaneously 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.890
 then engines come directly once 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:47.370
 high and pump in exactly 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.329
 a cable comes out by cable 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:58.700
 Lies down with the cable 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:04:01.470
 connected with solar cells is good 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.709
 then we have a frequency here as well 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:09.480
 than two seconds back team out 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:11.549
 switch with the cable as you go then 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.269
 here direct line everything exactly 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:18.560
 simultaneously turns on and director 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:23.340
 People score again 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:26.360
 baked steinrausch paints but and 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:34.000
 guide him to the boxes 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:34.000
 what is perhaps still important is her 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:43.569
 Electric vehicle and if you are 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:47.750
 we even introduce it here 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:54.110
 front of the opposition 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:55.699
 we what is above burnt down at 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.979
 accelerator calendar you can 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:03.529
 batteries or enter and right the 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:06.289
 Finished found now you have the at the 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:09.650
 Watch the pipes as you can afterwards 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:12.379
 So it does not work so well 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.800
 above are the things that burned 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:17.719
 become 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.849
 like here from the side you have the 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:23.659
 planned things do not pump away 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:29.810
 from below or from here everything always has to 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:38.569
 so we do not look and work that way 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:40.449
 yes it was really well developed too 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:44.319
 not bad, I would say 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.319
 that can already be seen 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:53.509
 I 'll maybe build the carlson again 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:57.319
 generator just like that with a block breaker 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.900
 the boxes the boxes automatically 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:01.460
 replenish here 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:07.550
 and maybe a light sensor 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:10.789
 that the two switches off that pressed 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.199
 it does not stop at night 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.900
 be pushed into it 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:22.039
 although there is no electricity to melt 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:25.000
 to build and that was it for me yet to fall 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:25.000
 you have to be quiet
