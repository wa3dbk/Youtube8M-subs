got and so yeah as you can see the cage
is<00:01:24.630> actually<00:01:25.080> built<00:01:25.229> for<00:01:25.619> dwarf<00:01:25.950> hamsters

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
is actually built for dwarf hamsters

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.740 
is actually built for dwarf hamsters
it's<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:26.670> built<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.090> Citians<00:01:27.450> although<00:01:27.720> I

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
it's not built for Citians although I

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.600 
it's not built for Citians although I
see<00:01:27.990> many<00:01:28.200> people<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:29.159> Syrians<00:01:29.520> I

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
see many people have it for Syrians I

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.550 
see many people have it for Syrians I
understand<00:01:30.060> why<00:01:30.780> because<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.259> got<00:01:31.409> many

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
understand why because it's got many

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.039 
understand why because it's got many
levels<00:01:31.829> but<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:33.090> only<00:01:33.270> bought<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.810> cage

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
levels but if you only bought the cage

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.960 
levels but if you only bought the cage
without<00:01:34.409> expansions<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.310> not<00:01:35.460> really<00:01:35.820> big

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
without expansions it's not really big

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.149 
without expansions it's not really big
enough<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> Cillian<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:37.710> see<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
enough for a Cillian as you can see the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.280 
enough for a Cillian as you can see the
spacing<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> bar<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.420> very<00:01:39.930> narrow

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
spacing of the bar it's very narrow

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.560 
spacing of the bar it's very narrow
that's<00:01:40.590> why<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:40.950> made<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.880> dwarf<00:01:42.119> hamsters

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
that's why it's made for dwarf hamsters

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.920 
that's why it's made for dwarf hamsters
and<00:01:42.600> again<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.920> tubes<00:01:44.220> are<00:01:44.369> quite<00:01:44.610> narrow<00:01:44.930> but

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
and again the tubes are quite narrow but

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.499 
and again the tubes are quite narrow but
they<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.680> these<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.909> see<00:01:48.090> where<00:01:48.299> they're

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
they do have these you see where they're

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.600 
they do have these you see where they're
green<00:01:49.200> big<00:01:49.500> green<00:01:49.740> thing<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> middle<00:01:50.490> is

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
green big green thing in the middle is

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.789 
green big green thing in the middle is
that's<00:01:51.270> actually<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.439> take<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.619> out

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
that's actually you can take that out

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.590 
that's actually you can take that out
make<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> hole<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.670> obviously<00:01:53.939> Citians<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.509> go

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
make a hole so obviously Citians can go

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.639 
make a hole so obviously Citians can go
down<00:01:54.750> through<00:01:54.960> there<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.229> you'd<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.590> to

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
down through there but you'd have to

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.370 
down through there but you'd have to
fashion<00:01:56.219> something<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> ladder<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.969> suppose<00:01:57.380> so

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
fashion something a ladder I suppose so

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.959 
fashion something a ladder I suppose so
that<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.770> way<00:01:58.860> yet<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.340> dwarf<00:01:59.610> hamster

so i have the bottom level I have one
more<00:02:26.850> Kate<00:02:27.330> expansion<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.200> second<00:02:29.010> cage

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
more Kate expansion a second cage

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.940 
more Kate expansion a second cage
expansion<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.060> then<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.480> top<00:02:31.230> level<00:02:31.740> is

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
expansion and then the top level is

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.710 
expansion and then the top level is
fully<00:02:32.220> enclosed<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:34.110> have<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.500> say<00:02:34.530> that

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
fully enclosed and I have to say that

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.350 
fully enclosed and I have to say that
noodle<00:02:36.720> himself<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.590> robo<00:02:37.860> hamster<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.490> down

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
noodle himself the robo hamster is down

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.490 
noodle himself the robo hamster is down
the<00:02:39.510> bottom<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.840> think<00:02:40.050> he's<00:02:40.140> definitely

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
the bottom I think he's definitely

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.680 
the bottom I think he's definitely
ventured<00:02:40.920> up<00:02:41.010> as<00:02:41.220> far<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.550> there<00:02:41.790> because<00:02:42.330> the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
ventured up as far as there because the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.690 
ventured up as far as there because the
sand<00:02:42.930> has<00:02:43.080> been<00:02:43.230> disturbed<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:44.520> was

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
sand has been disturbed but I was

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.640 
sand has been disturbed but I was
keeping<00:02:44.880> him<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.330> smaller<00:02:45.660> kicked<00:02:46.020> while<00:02:46.590> I

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
keeping him in a smaller kicked while I

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.870 
keeping him in a smaller kicked while I
tried<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.040> tame<00:02:47.250> him<00:02:47.400> because<00:02:47.610> it's<00:02:47.730> quite

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
tried to tame him because it's quite

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.220 
tried to tame him because it's quite
difficult<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.330> get<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.510> hamster<00:02:48.750> out<00:02:49.020> of<00:02:49.140> this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
difficult to get a hamster out of this

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.710 
difficult to get a hamster out of this
cage<00:02:49.530> if<00:02:49.830> they're<00:02:50.040> not<00:02:50.160> team<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:51.270> I<00:02:51.300> think<00:02:51.540> I

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
cage if they're not team so I think I

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.000 
cage if they're not team so I think I
take<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.050> into<00:02:52.230> consideration<00:02:52.260> if<00:02:52.890> you're

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
take that into consideration if you're

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.880 
take that into consideration if you're
buying<00:02:53.190> this<00:02:53.489> cage<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:54.860> apart<00:02:55.860> from

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
buying this cage that apart from

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.530 
buying this cage that apart from
probably<00:02:56.280> Citians<00:02:56.700> it'll<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.120> really<00:02:57.300> quite

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
probably Citians it'll be really quite

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.750 
probably Citians it'll be really quite
quite<00:02:57.870> difficult<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.380> tame<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:59.040> dwarf<00:02:59.280> hamster

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
quite difficult to tame a dwarf hamster

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.080 
quite difficult to tame a dwarf hamster
from<00:03:00.000> this<00:03:00.840> cage<00:03:01.170> because<00:03:01.770> basically<00:03:02.760> the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
from this cage because basically the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.300 
from this cage because basically the
doors<00:03:03.330> are<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.200> size<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.920> put<00:03:05.100> in<00:03:05.220> your

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
doors are this size and you put in your

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.340 
doors are this size and you put in your
hand<00:03:05.520> in<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.850> obviously<00:03:06.180> hamster<00:03:07.020> is<00:03:07.140> just

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
hand in and obviously hamster is just

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.000 
hand in and obviously hamster is just
going<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.560> run<00:03:07.680> away<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:09.530> I've<00:03:10.530> also<00:03:10.800> tried

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
going to run away and I've also tried

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.400 
going to run away and I've also tried
taking<00:03:11.790> off<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.940> level<00:03:12.420> but<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.080> robo<00:03:13.380> hamster

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
taking off a level but the robo hamster

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.010 
taking off a level but the robo hamster
is<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.100> sketch<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.610> he<00:03:14.700> climbs<00:03:14.940> out<00:03:15.120> so

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
is so sketch that he climbs out so

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.750 
is so sketch that he climbs out so
anyway<00:03:16.320> yesterday<00:03:16.560> he<00:03:16.950> was<00:03:17.010> in<00:03:17.130> smaller<00:03:17.430> cage

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
anyway yesterday he was in smaller cage

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.509 
anyway yesterday he was in smaller cage
I<00:03:18.030> went<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.330> put<00:03:18.480> him<00:03:18.570> in<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:18.810> one<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.519> he

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
I went to put him in this one and he

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.660 
I went to put him in this one and he
escaped<00:03:20.910> from<00:03:21.030> me<00:03:21.330> because<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:22.140> as<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.519> all

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
escaped from me because and as you all

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.550 
escaped from me because and as you all
know<00:03:23.700> he<00:03:24.090> was<00:03:24.209> abandoned<00:03:24.660> on<00:03:24.690> my<00:03:24.810> doorstep<00:03:25.049> and

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
know he was abandoned on my doorstep and

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.860 
know he was abandoned on my doorstep and
I<00:03:26.459> guess<00:03:26.760> he's<00:03:26.910> been<00:03:27.030> traumatized<00:03:27.570> in<00:03:27.720> some

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
I guess he's been traumatized in some

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.420 
I guess he's been traumatized in some
way<00:03:27.989> because<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.500> haven't<00:03:28.739> been<00:03:28.830> able<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.220> him

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
way because I haven't been able to him

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.180 
way because I haven't been able to him
at<00:03:29.640> all<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:30.060> can't<00:03:30.390> catch<00:03:30.570> him<00:03:30.600> anything<00:03:31.200> so

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
at all I can't catch him anything so

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.740 
at all I can't catch him anything so
I've<00:03:32.489> made<00:03:32.670> his<00:03:32.790> cage<00:03:33.030> as<00:03:33.209> exciting<00:03:33.660> as

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
I've made his cage as exciting as

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.699 
I've made his cage as exciting as
possible<00:03:34.370> lots<00:03:35.370> of<00:03:35.640> em<00:03:36.110> tubes<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.350> tunnels

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
possible lots of em tubes and tunnels

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.870 
possible lots of em tubes and tunnels
because<00:03:37.830> if<00:03:38.040> I'm<00:03:38.160> not<00:03:38.280> going<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.519> be<00:03:38.610> able<00:03:38.640> to

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
because if I'm not going to be able to

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.370 
because if I'm not going to be able to
tame<00:03:39.090> him<00:03:39.239> he's<00:03:39.540> not<00:03:39.690> going<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.840> be<00:03:39.900> coming<00:03:40.260> out

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
tame him he's not going to be coming out

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.750 
tame him he's not going to be coming out
of<00:03:40.410> his<00:03:40.560> cage<00:03:40.769> much<00:03:41.010> it's<00:03:41.190> just<00:03:41.370> not<00:03:41.519> possible

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
of his cage much it's just not possible

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
another water bottle and on another note

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.450 
another water bottle and on another note
my<00:05:26.000> flying<00:05:26.330> saucer<00:05:26.599> is<00:05:27.319> no<00:05:27.500> longer<00:05:27.710> silent<00:05:28.039> so

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
my flying saucer is no longer silent so

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.189 
my flying saucer is no longer silent so
i<00:05:28.490> guess<00:05:28.699> the<00:05:28.879> more<00:05:29.060> that<00:05:29.210> hamsters<00:05:29.659> run<00:05:29.870> on<00:05:30.020> it

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
i guess the more that hamsters run on it

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.749 
i guess the more that hamsters run on it
the<00:05:30.379> less<00:05:30.560> silent<00:05:30.979> it<00:05:31.069> becomes<00:05:31.340> which<00:05:31.610> is<00:05:31.729> a

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 
the less silent it becomes which is a

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.600 
the less silent it becomes which is a
bit<00:05:31.879> disappointing<00:05:32.539> and<00:05:32.770> then<00:05:33.770> up<00:05:33.949> to<00:05:34.159> the<00:05:34.310> top

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
bit disappointing and then up to the top

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.180 
bit disappointing and then up to the top
level<00:05:34.940> which<00:05:35.330> I<00:05:35.599> pretty<00:05:36.379> sure<00:05:36.620> it<00:05:36.800> hasn't<00:05:36.949> been

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
level which I pretty sure it hasn't been

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.830 
level which I pretty sure it hasn't been
in<00:05:37.370> since<00:05:37.610> i<00:05:37.789> put<00:05:37.940> mini<00:05:38.150> yesterday<00:05:38.509> we<00:05:38.719> should

what my imac fantasy looks like and i
really<00:06:04.190> really<00:06:04.310> like<00:06:04.580> the<00:06:04.729> cage<00:06:04.909> as<00:06:05.150> I've<00:06:05.300> said

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.019 
really really like the cage as I've said
taming<00:06:06.469> a<00:06:06.560> hampster<00:06:06.830> in<00:06:07.069> this<00:06:07.190> cage<00:06:07.460> is<00:06:07.490> just

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:08.029 
taming a hampster in this cage is just

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:10.809 
taming a hampster in this cage is just
quite<00:06:08.419> difficult<00:06:08.810> unless<00:06:09.589> it's<00:06:09.860> a<00:06:09.919> Syrian<00:06:10.279> the

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:10.819 
quite difficult unless it's a Syrian the

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.129 
quite difficult unless it's a Syrian the
dwarf<00:06:11.060> hamster<00:06:11.449> would<00:06:11.659> be<00:06:11.779> quite<00:06:11.960> difficult

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139 
dwarf hamster would be quite difficult

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.529 
dwarf hamster would be quite difficult
to<00:06:12.500> get<00:06:12.620> out<00:06:12.830> and<00:06:13.490> my<00:06:13.610> future<00:06:13.789> the<00:06:14.029> levels<00:06:14.360> off

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
that's just my opinion maybe other

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.740 
that's just my opinion maybe other
people<00:06:16.279> have<00:06:16.639> other<00:06:16.819> experiences<00:06:17.180> and<00:06:17.629> that's

people have other experiences and that's

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.469 
people have other experiences and that's
