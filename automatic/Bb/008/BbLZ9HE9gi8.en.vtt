00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.840
 earlier 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.269
 So 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:11.639
 So 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.539
 to 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.179
 to 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.900
 there is no equipment for photos and video 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.929
 shooting 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.929
 together with a friend geithner 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.310
 So 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.160
 we invited model havana she 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.070
 accommodate here a fault or an example we 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.629
 show you 5 portrait of opposition placement 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.060
 of light first i don't distinguish women with 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:39.080
 am in camera 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.770
 it does not decorate them you should lightly 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.990
 bring them back one way 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.510
 the internet hurt we will get a nice 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.860
 directions and this will serve us under 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.470
 equal point to start working with 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.030
 with light 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.320
 death 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.270
 and I just moved the lamp a bit 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.960
 away from the camera like this 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.249
 as seen 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:01.239
 move the shadow falling to the light to the right 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.570
 from her nose closes in 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.200
 out of the shadows and clever things who made it 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.840
 call think brandt small 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.380
 triangle formed on the right 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.080
 the side of her face is a classic light rm 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.190
 the brand is not made highlighting the shadows and not 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.610
 nothing but one applies 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.630
 light source 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.310
 dissecting the media 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.310
 early now we move from the light 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.600
 works are reduced to the light triangle and look for 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.100
 their strong dissecting light 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.460
 placing the light so he shares it 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.820
 lecture bright backlit side 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.380
 P 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.270
 and dark shadow side 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.550
 doing this we get the dissecting light 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.380
 logging nose forming the border 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.320
 but her face 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.770
 it starts to look more 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.630
 dramatic are formed with clearly 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.240
 pronounced holy shadow 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.060
 and depending on how much we 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.960
 dedicate the filling light of the shadow of which 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.050
 Litvin 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.330
 the backlight will look more comfortable 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.270
 either the opposite is more dramatic if you 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.390
 want more 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.530
 expressiveness 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.530
 the court is exactly the same dissecting beets 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.970
 wide range 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.160
 here now will start is position 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.770
 dissecting and we go to 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.590
 considering what's called a wide 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.140
 Colour 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.140
 in order for it to do it yet it 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.960
 reverse lamp is the place where 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.409
 located from pkrm grant 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.249
 but this time you need a little 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.059
 rotate model 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.709
 and she turns her face away from the light 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.499
 when for example on the street from lighting 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:27.780
 the lamp falls on the same 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.030
 the place where the ramp is wound but by the edge of the bronchi 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.010
 now located to the side and to the side of 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.350
 hosted camera 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.930
 Now we are considering the evening 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.230
 a dedicated person dedicated to happiness 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.889
 faces 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.779
 it is considered broad light 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.609
 here for this reason it is called wide 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.339
 presented is a broad devoted participant and 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:47.859
 hidden shaded part of the face is the question 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.169
 preference some like 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.459
 this light is enjoyed by me a lot 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.839
 seduces d generally if you shoot 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.459
 people can you turn around 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.009
 side is this right 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.919
 position 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.059
 alternately acute bronchitis wide and 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:02.019
 dissecting comfortable enough 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.299
 all color set to wrong 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.339
 positions then this plan is lost priority 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.749
 between these three placements here is such 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.749
 the wide light that we see on her face 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:17.639
 now we have the churches in front we 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.139
 secured it for a small rally 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.049
 not really boxing get 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.579
 This is the steep angle of color 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.969
 on objects 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:27.909
 the reason for which is called 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.009
 silenced butterfly light is placed 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.919
 right above the camera 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.499
 kiss 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:35.799
 it forms no quit and model tray in 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.409
 butterfly shaped 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.449
 this also form acquiring cheeks 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:40.859
 left and right 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.309
 and also acquired chin this 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:44.539
 considered to be the most 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.539
 village female portraits and now 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:48.339
 if we place a reflective sheet for 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:50.609
 easy softening of shadows 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.079
 really provide very 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.579
 nice backlight 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.849
 we will turn his squirrel side up 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.669
 put it on your lap 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.809
 there you can see how it filled all the hard 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:02.979
 the walls of her chin I want 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.279
 affect her coarse because you can 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.349
 separately traced it allows 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.259
 fill the area under the beard and the area under 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.149
 her nose windows 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:15.369
 very beautiful lighting looks 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.499
 very nice want to talk about it 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:19.009
 a bit more 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.629
 if we look closely at him 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:22.889
 eyes there we see a reflection of the square 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.069
 boxing software 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:26.029
 if the eyes do not reflect any 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:29.029
 light source people don't look lived 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:30.739
 so we really 

00:04:30.739 --> 00:04:33.039
 nice to see that little square 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.029
 her eyes 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:39.110
 when light falls from above 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.800
 if you are considering which 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.879
 then snapshot 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.319
 and trying to figure out which one is highlighted 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.849
 look at your eyes you will see there 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.559
 surrounding things will be visible there 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.469
 umbrellas and squares especially boxes 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:55.110
 sometimes there remarked the court boxing reflector 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.369
 of course you can draw a retoucher 

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:59.719
 how they do it on yang's wife will eliminate all this 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:02.719
 redistribution as a result of arson 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.240
 the plan is seen which moves in 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.240
 side we shun it a little to the right in 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.979
 away from the camera but we see it as 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.039
 nose shadows 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.139
 despite the shadow of her right cheek forms 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.740
 film 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.849
 m 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.150
 the light is no longer synthesized 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.639
 as we previously set off smokers alike 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.919
 now when we shifted it to the right and 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.560
 getting from all one country and more active 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.939
 another very slightly 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:37.749
 it's a kind of light variation 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:39.599
 shell you can achieve this and on 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.599
 the earth does not need to raise the light on 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:43.809
 coals of thread just light should be placed 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:45.599
 higher than it was in the case of Dombra Moscow 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.029
 place it on a light level butterfly 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:49.999
 by height 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:51.719
 most of these highlighting solutions 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:52.899
 depends on individual 

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:54.499
 features removed 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:56.159
 she is great because it is very easy 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:57.400
 highlight the street 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.020
 if you have to shoot people 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.160
 older there are a lot of their own 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.889
 features forming the shadows which 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.100
 the complexity and choice of the backlight 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.500
 it will be in each case individually 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.840
 will invite your seal 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.930
 Photo 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.110
 here it was a quick look at the light 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.979
 a loop 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.129
 I would like to give another moment 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:16.909
 makes each of these lamps now 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:17.480
 frames 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.520
 we have a key light between 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.520
 the lens and the socket are placed 22 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.160
 thanks to her softened a little 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.120
 harsh light giving shaded 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.169
 plot making them a little prettier 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.289
 we added a fill light here 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:34.490
 here 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.379
 a business 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:38.529
 there is also a center light 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:40.909
 falling over 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:42.889
 producing separation from the background 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:45.550
 also has safon light illuminating 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.719
 foundation providing backlighting plans 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:50.649
 ebb side shading right this 

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:53.429
 also contributes to separating ep background there 

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:56.069
 where it is dedicated the background is darker and where on 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.199
 their money is devoted to fom it strengthens 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.119
 separation facility dfo 

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:03.439
 Well, we saw something why you 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:06.439
 can easy place each one on top 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.849
 our key light 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:11.740
 Dasha 8 years 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.509
 our background luminaries fill light 

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:16.259
 here so we do not score as much as it all 

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:17.439
 compactly 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:19.259
 they each serve their purpose 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:22.259
 provides a good result 

00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:33.369
 the good 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.759
 got wonderful poems about 

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:44.150
 the war 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.810
 I will help to clean the site now 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.710
 after which we will show you some pictures 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.089
 with bike 

00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:51.519
 The one that will be happy Rogov translation 

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:54.039
 made specifically for the company photo 

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:58.409
 rationally
