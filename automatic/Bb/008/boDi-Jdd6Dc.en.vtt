not that long ago Volkswagen loaned us a
GTD<00:00:12.030> which<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> European<00:00:13.230> diesel<00:00:13.980> version

of<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.490> Volkswagen<00:00:14.700> GTI<00:00:15.179> we<00:00:15.990> really<00:00:16.230> liked<00:00:16.410> it

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
of the Volkswagen GTI we really liked it

of the Volkswagen GTI we really liked it
but<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:17.100> didn't<00:00:17.310> know<00:00:17.369> if<00:00:17.460> they<00:00:17.520> were<00:00:17.580> going<00:00:17.730> to

but we didn't know if they were going to

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:18.800 
but we didn't know if they were going to
bring<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.119> America

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
bring it to America

yeah<00:01:27.549> you<00:01:28.549> know<00:01:28.670> there<00:01:28.789> might<00:01:28.880> be<00:01:28.909> some

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
yeah you know there might be some

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.630 
yeah you know there might be some
pushback<00:01:29.539> to<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.020> notion<00:01:30.320> of<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.470> diesel<00:01:30.770> GTI

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
pushback to the notion of a diesel GTI

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.740 
pushback to the notion of a diesel GTI
because<00:01:32.090> you<00:01:32.149> don't<00:01:32.299> have<00:01:32.390> that<00:01:32.479> high-end

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
because you don't have that high-end

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.840 
because you don't have that high-end
rush<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:33.470> just<00:01:33.619> got<00:01:33.740> all<00:01:33.829> this<00:01:33.890> torque<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.460> very

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
rush you just got all this torque a very

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.210 
rush you just got all this torque a very
narrow<00:01:35.060> power<00:01:35.270> band<00:01:35.570> but<00:01:35.990> really<00:01:36.289> the<00:01:36.679> GTI<00:01:37.100> is

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
narrow power band but really the GTI is

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.889 
narrow power band but really the GTI is
appeal<00:01:37.610> isn't<00:01:38.000> strictly<00:01:38.210> about<00:01:38.570> power

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
appeal isn't strictly about power

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.109 
appeal isn't strictly about power
delivery<00:01:39.500> it's<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.799> lot<00:01:40.070> about<00:01:40.250> handling<00:01:40.880> and

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
delivery it's a lot about handling and

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.779 
delivery it's a lot about handling and
all<00:01:41.630> that<00:01:41.960> stuff<00:01:42.200> comes<00:01:42.649> through<00:01:42.979> in<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.159> GTV

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
all that stuff comes through in the GTV

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.580 
all that stuff comes through in the GTV
you<00:01:43.940> have<00:01:44.090> basically<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.810> same<00:01:44.959> experience

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
you have basically the same experience

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.770 
you have basically the same experience
just<00:01:46.159> with<00:01:46.369> much<00:01:46.670> better<00:01:46.909> fuel<00:01:47.179> economy<00:01:47.270> and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
just with much better fuel economy and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.109 
just with much better fuel economy and
yes<00:01:48.350> different<00:01:48.979> power<00:01:49.130> delivery<00:01:49.729> but<00:01:49.939> get

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
yes different power delivery but get

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.440 
yes different power delivery but get
over<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:51.700> alright<00:01:52.700> let's<00:01:52.909> feel<00:01:53.090> some<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.360> that

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
over it alright let's feel some of that

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.600 
over it alright let's feel some of that
sweet<00:01:53.869> diesel<00:01:54.439> acceleration

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.700 

that's<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.570> funny<00:02:00.780> thing<00:02:00.840> about<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.170> diesel<00:02:01.560> is

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
that's the funny thing about a diesel is

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.800 
that's the funny thing about a diesel is
that<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.340> kicks<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.790> hard<00:02:03.120> that<00:02:03.480> the<00:02:03.630> stability

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
that it kicks so hard that the stability

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.300 
that it kicks so hard that the stability
control<00:02:04.230> system<00:02:04.800> and<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:04.980> traction<00:02:05.280> control

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
control system and the traction control

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.310 
control system and the traction control
have<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.820> mitigate<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.660> acceleration

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
have to mitigate that acceleration

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.950 
have to mitigate that acceleration
eventually<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.310> get<00:02:08.399> moving<00:02:08.610> now<00:02:08.960> no

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
eventually you get moving now no

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.960 
eventually you get moving now no
surprises<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.220> diesel<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.790> there's

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
surprises here it's a diesel so there's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.030 
surprises here it's a diesel so there's
tons<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.240> torque<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.690> then<00:02:13.230> power<00:02:13.650> starts<00:02:13.980> to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
tons of torque and then power starts to

restart<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:10.000> only<00:03:10.390> thing<00:03:10.659> is<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:10.900> if<00:03:11.140> you

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
restart the only thing is that if you

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.080 
restart the only thing is that if you

engagement with the clutch is a little
bit<00:03:16.720> abrupt<00:03:16.989> but<00:03:17.409> if<00:03:18.099> you<00:03:18.220> have<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.459> save<00:03:18.640> gas

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
bit abrupt but if you have to save gas

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.300 
bit abrupt but if you have to save gas
that's<00:03:19.150> not<00:03:19.299> a<00:03:19.329> bad<00:03:19.510> way<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.750> do<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.159> the<00:03:21.159> power

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
really a problem though you turn and

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.250 
really a problem though you turn and
then<00:03:30.879> the<00:03:30.970> car<00:03:31.150> turns<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.900> then<00:03:32.019> you<00:03:32.079> turn

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
then the car turns and then you turn

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.170 
then the car turns and then you turn

fine it was if I had to complain about

one<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.239> things<00:03:49.389> they've<00:03:49.540> done<00:03:49.569> is

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
one of the things they've done is

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.110 
one of the things they've done is
they've<00:03:49.959> given<00:03:50.170> it<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.319> variable<00:03:50.739> ratio<00:03:51.430> so<00:03:51.970> as

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
they've given it a variable ratio so as

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.360 
they've given it a variable ratio so as
you<00:03:52.299> get<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.930> edges<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:54.040> steering

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
you get to the edges of the steering

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.430 
you get to the edges of the steering
circle<00:03:54.909> it<00:03:55.299> turns<00:03:55.599> the<00:03:55.780> wheels<00:03:55.989> even<00:03:56.139> more

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
circle it turns the wheels even more

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.259 
circle it turns the wheels even more
which<00:03:56.769> means<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.099> have<00:03:57.250> less<00:03:57.549> turns<00:03:57.879> lock<00:03:58.209> to

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
which means you have less turns lock to

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.789 
which means you have less turns lock to
lock<00:03:58.450> which<00:03:58.750> makes<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.019> really<00:03:59.049> easy<00:03:59.290> to<00:03:59.560> get

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
lock which makes it really easy to get

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.530 
lock which makes it really easy to get
parking<00:04:00.370> lots<00:04:00.519> or<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:01.000> make<00:04:01.150> really<00:04:01.359> quick

it's<00:04:09.710> actually<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.040> one<00:04:10.220> stretch<00:04:10.460> of<00:04:10.580> German

do the road thing well it's okay though

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.070
