00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.799
 now comes from martin kolbus info how 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.690
 the and today i have information about 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.640
 all four dlcs and the maps them 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.590
 are included and even about one 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.960
 eventual date for the first dlc when 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.460
 it is published and yes the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.019
 all are not official 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.460
 so confirmed are not official 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.619
 information that comes out 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.980
 strange sources so through several 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.870
 strange realities so really 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.579
 strange mistakes that infinity was 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.890
 that has come to me already 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.850
 a bit strange but this one 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.750
 Still , it can really go away 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.489
 because they also in black ops 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.930
 example many things have said and 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.430
 the forces are big and so are these 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.960
 things are actually all more 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.700
 The agreements are made 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.870
 actually already trust it then 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.879
 come now for the first time to the names of 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.920
 maps and unfortunately we only have the names 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.539
 no pictures and he comes the names 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.920
 a pretty strange source and 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.629
 Although there was a pc I am too 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.489
 pc player and I happen to have 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.050
 I even saw it myself 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.600
 sometimes quite short for the half hour 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.489
 or so , there's a playlist and in there 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.930
 this playlist is somehow too 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.920
 been publicized though the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.390
 not really public 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.400
 it should have been switched on somehow 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.630
 Infinity was somehow employee 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.220
 In any case, you could have done wrong 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.350
 in this test playlist that was also called 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.420
 something with test you could the maps 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.350
 recognize that comes in cottbus before it is 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.820
 already a little bit but I have 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.860
 at that time no video made about it because 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.360
 I found that a little bit so 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.740
 little bit of information from but on 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.030
 In any case you could name this map 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.619
 Already you could see on this one 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.780
 Do not play away the field so beautiful 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.310
 but you could name this map 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.140
 already see and that is really one 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.369
 pretty funny thing I always know 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.960
 not yet if infinity just became easy 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.750
 extremely nice particle if you like that 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.920
 somehow make extra and one like that 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.780
 to sprinkle a bit of information 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.860
 and a little bit looking forward to this 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.299
 to make dlcs 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.619
 I think that's really here now 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.540
 a mistake was because I was after that as well 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.540
 have taken out immediately and because yes 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.070
 It was really strange then 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.159
 I 'll just say take away two 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.079
 are the swamp battery rumble boni 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.009
 Exhaust or glasses because they do not like 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.100
 you should pronounce that 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.460
 comp and retriever and finally 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.509
 the dom and yes this dom is 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.729
 most likely that too 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.080
 dom be what we had so far mp3 so 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.410
 stupid will probably be in a dlc 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.300
 I hope it returns 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.800
 the dlc will be like the three 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.720
 with terminal that was also free 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.500
 but quite likely domscheit 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.270
 to return 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.620
 whether free or not we know that 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.150
 unfortunately not in any case you can 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.610
 also in ghost folder find the dom 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.540
 same aldi and i would all that 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.820
 You definitely change if you have one 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.110
 install new map and probably 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.160
 is then done a little differently 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.440
 which I definitely cool 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.580
 finds the dom march comes again 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.250
 because that is definitely my favorite 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.480
 mp3 sites and me too 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.280
 I like that now in great that 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.010
 One is a small app because of strikes 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.330
 are all maps so huge and yes that is 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.770
 Definitely beautiful and im 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.780
 year to the other things you can stop 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.100
 I do not say much, I hope 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.660
 that the website is smaller that 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.950
 at least the dlc maps are beautiful because 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.330
 I find from the maps in purchase the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.010
 biggest not at all excited about that 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.630
 are way too big and somehow much 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.320
 everything is so broken and too broken 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.240
 confused 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.160
 In any case, I do not like that at all 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.870
 So they would not have much more beautiful 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.910
 make websites much better 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.010
 can so I hope that these DLCs 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.540
 are definitely beautiful and then have 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.980
 now also very up to date so only before 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.990
 get a few hours of information 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.210
 the possibly the now the names 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.580
 should be and in the trunk for me 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.620
 from the strange mistake and that 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.090
 Some people always e-mail basket 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.730
 so also get from the official 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.920
 page and in this e-mail was for the 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.050
 season pass advertised and in the season 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.270
 One could see the four names firmly 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.560
 meanwhile this topic is changed 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.940
 so now if you have now 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.350
 always gets call of duty then it is 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.670
 you can not get the names anymore 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.260
 So, even now, recognize as if 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.180
 it's either a mistake so either 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.830
 I feel like I want to do that extra 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.200
 or any joke in the 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.989
 Infinity became employee then the case 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.920
 such strange things raus skin or me 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.780
 I do not really know either 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.820
 strange but this now this 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.470
 will probably be onslaught 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.660
 devastation in which and nemesis 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.040
 Hot and that will probably be accurate 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.800
 this order be that onslaught 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.050
 the first dlc and so on because of the 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.730
 first so in this e-mail were and 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.489
 because the first letters of these words 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.959
 So you can enter in the e-mail ground 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.820
 yes en de n 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.170
 and that was also in the emails 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.090
 bit is shown in the background 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.610
 was then a big and d and e and 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.900
 So that's what it's apparently intentionally 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.980
 should result in eating 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.330
 and that's why that too 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.430
 probably the poor legs what 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.780
 It's actually pretty great 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.310
 that we called the dc in so early 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.490
 I have my black ops will behave 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.740
 the tlc took over the fourth dlc too 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.509
 only sometime september or something like that or 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.819
 August or so in any case that we 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.289
 Already so early in cottbus all dlcs 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.389
 probably misses and knows 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.699
 even map they are contained in it 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.050
 really pretty cool and i think so 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.419
 also that this information is correct because 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.099
 several people has so many people now 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.960
 that means many people will be 1000 or 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.370
 but not all that in general 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.960
 a lot we have received this e-mail 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.490
 from call of duty so from the 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.610
 official call of duty e-mail address 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.139
 and more how should you do that field and now 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.210
 sends computer has this has it 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.130
 taken out virtually what I also more 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.680
 So many suspicious because you already thinking 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.789
 that they know that they already know 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.050
 that this is somehow wrong and that 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.210
 they actually have it public 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.009
 definitely want this one 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.360
 We have information from companies 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.860
 one person's date for the first 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.139
 map-pack rausbekommen so said 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.990
 and according to him is that the 28 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.240
 january 2014 so go back a bit 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.650
 and yes that is a healthy already in the 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.930
 black ops 2 di-d now this always good 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.729
 could predict and that apparently 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.340
 An informant has a call of duty 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.780
 so infinity wards side in any case 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.789
 He had always been in black ops 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.750
 right with this dlcs and that's why 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.210
 I also imagine that very well 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.800
 such is right again on the 28th of january 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.990
 would be so synonymous of the present as the 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.940
 when they come to come and 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.930
 That's why I think that's the way it should be 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.490
 that will probably become too 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.320
 the xbox did and his and then again 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.830
 for ps3 and pc again a month later 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.460
 whatever she is nice and 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.750
 and that's definitely the one 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.219
 I have information for you 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.389
 think that they are all right but me 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:50.190
 you are not one hundred percent 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.840
 guarantee and also tells him please times 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.979
 whether her is good for the dom returns 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.419
 Actually, I think you can only do it well 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.250
 although not really 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.750
 really fits in gosheim because the maps 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.400
 otherwise completely different 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.630
 apart from strikes and what again 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.699
 completely similar to that is also such a 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.719
 strange thing is so well with it 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.860
 it is over again I hope it has 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:05.789
 you like it if you like it 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.050
 now I want one myself but 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.590
 still around friends and what today 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.590
 These 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.420
 Cheap
