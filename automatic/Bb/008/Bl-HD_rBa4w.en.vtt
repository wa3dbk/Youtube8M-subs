00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
keyboard in fact the letters are larger

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.330 
keyboard in fact the letters are larger
I<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.769> that

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
I like that

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.900 
I like that
the<00:00:32.730> belt<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.210> still<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.660> same<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.730> icons<00:00:35.730> are

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
the belt is still the same the icons are

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.340

gonna<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.480> bit<00:00:36.600> bigger<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.020> that'll

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
gonna be a little bit bigger so that'll

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.069 
gonna be a little bit bigger so that'll
probably<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.620> easier<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> read<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> screen

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079

loyalists like me know but larger and
the<00:00:41.850> print<00:00:42.120> probably<00:00:42.570> works<00:00:42.780> quite<00:00:43.079> nicely<00:00:43.280> so

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.150

I'm<00:00:44.879> impressed<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.770> doesn't<00:00:46.829> do

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
I'm impressed I like it it doesn't do

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.010 
I'm impressed I like it it doesn't do
much<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.340> me<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:48.210> too<00:00:48.480> big

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
much for me it's too big

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.500 
much for me it's too big
I<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.829> q10<00:00:50.309> fits<00:00:50.820> snugly<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.390> your

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510

I like the q10 fits snugly in your
pocket<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.579> don't<00:00:53.579> see<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> purpose<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
pocket I don't see the purpose of the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.319 
pocket I don't see the purpose of the
belts<00:00:55.199> which<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> big<00:00:55.860> innovation<00:00:56.760> that

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
belts which is the big innovation that

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.779 
belts which is the big innovation that
the<00:00:57.510> classic<00:00:57.989> has<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.649> has<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> touchscreen<00:00:59.309> so

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the classic has it has a touchscreen so

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.880 
the classic has it has a touchscreen so
there's<00:01:00.359> not<00:01:00.510> much<00:01:00.570> need<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.260> now<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.620> just

BlackBerry users I'm not fussy about the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
frills that other phones have and the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.480 
frills that other phones have and the
whole<00:01:46.140> thing<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.710> keyboard<00:01:47.100> that's<00:01:47.310> why<00:01:47.460> I

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
whole thing is the keyboard that's why I

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.770 
whole thing is the keyboard that's why I
like<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.240> know<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.420> stuff<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.659> actually

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
like it you know the stuff I actually

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.539 
like it you know the stuff I actually
really<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.829> I'm<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.130> their

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
really do like is what I'm like on their

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.190 
really do like is what I'm like on their
previous<00:01:51.149> two<00:01:51.240> generations<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.780> phones<00:01:51.960> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
previous two generations of phones and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.499 
previous two generations of phones and
that<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.590> software<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:54.000> think<00:01:54.390> that

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
that is the software I think that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.420 
that is the software I think that
they're<00:01:54.630> at<00:01:54.750> par<00:01:55.020> with<00:01:55.229> iOS<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.829> Android<00:01:55.950> I

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
they're at par with iOS and Android I

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.410 
they're at par with iOS and Android I
think<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.700> does<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> lot<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.090> great<00:01:57.270> business

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
think it does a lot of great business

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.810 
think it does a lot of great business
stuff<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.350> messaging<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> strength<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
stuff the messaging is a strength to the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.270 
stuff the messaging is a strength to the
hub<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.450> multitasking<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:02.009> works

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
hub of the multitasking that all works

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.580 
hub of the multitasking that all works
really<00:02:02.729> really<00:02:02.909> well<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.990> doesn't<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
really really well it doesn't have the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.740 
really really well it doesn't have the
apps<00:02:04.770> iOS<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.729> Android<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:06.600> are

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
apps iOS and Android have but they are

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.059 
apps iOS and Android have but they are
getting<00:02:06.869> better<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.439> can<00:02:07.560> get<00:02:07.710> some<00:02:07.860> apps

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
getting better as you can get some apps
