00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.480
 Hello today is the product test 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.389
 by medusa headphones with 5 2 1 2 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.410
 so does the outer packaging superstructure very 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.470
 nice I have it already 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.140
 tried and tested instructions 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.480
 read through and now I explain to you 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.880
 very fast how to like that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.140
 Playstation connects the whole thing 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.649
 not without 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:40.609
 so here is the decoration of the station 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.609
 comes the long cable that there is 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:49.909
 Here is the distance to this 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.670
 Remote control style connected 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.339
 the long cable of the decoration here 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.629
 above or down 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:09.539
 plugged in and that goes to the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:11.110
 The headphones are so out with the tethering 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:18.660
 headset 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:25.140
 and then the other cable will be this one 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.140
 You can see the back of the USB cable 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.010
 here in a pot of the play station 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.910
 connected in the back just easy 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.800
 just plug it in then it's on 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:43.200
 pimple cable this is this whole 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.200
 smaller that is connected here 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.960
 I do not know if you can see 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.900
 here it is connected and behind 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.640
 Anja playstation is only one 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:00.460
 slot for the optical cable for 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.509
 the one that after that then should 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.800
 already work 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:08.800
 You should note, however, that you 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.140
 these little holes in the optical 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.650
 cable looks like this otherwise you can 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.570
 do not connect optical cable here 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.430
 still in the playstation 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.190
 I had not thought of that if that 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.130
 also forget that and then you should 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:29.019
 go and the attitude at the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:34.049
 Playstation take over for that one goes 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:36.100
 up here on settings then on 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:41.380
 sound settings 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:43.690
 one presses on it so and around the headphones 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.870
 to connect and one on audio output 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:52.120
 settings and then you do not choose 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:55.080
 hdmi but optical digital click on 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.080
 to confirm 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:13.640
 and then you can already directly music 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.640
 I can hear that, of course I heard that 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:21.260
 of course I can not do that now 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:27.120
 but still show what the headphones 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:29.700
 very nice as I said with built-in 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.990
 We have to stop that too 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.620
 in the blade that drags a lot 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:37.970
 comfortable to wear and has a new one 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:45.650
 sound and over the remote here 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.650
 you can still see the whole here 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.780
 a settings before the 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.070
 once for this front then this for 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.140
 the back boxes then for the sandbox 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.830
 and there for the subwoofer easy 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.210
 press and the volume volume 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.020
 then regulate settings for each 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.120
 single channel then it is green for it 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.660
 then when the light turns green 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.730
 that the volume is very low up 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.380
 then the colors change all the way to 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.590
 classical red and is then for one 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:25.220
 channel the highest volume specified 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:30.780
 So again, very short and tight 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:33.770
 the cable here from the speaker 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:38.610
 you connect or herewith 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.350
 at the back to the base station 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.200
 connect to it 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.860
 behind the usb to the play station 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.200
 connect and the optical cable 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.840
 behind the playstation in the only one 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.970
 optical digital out connect it 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.490
 then gives the attitudes at the 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.410
 playstation and that was it 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.530
 actually already something for me personally 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.870
 a bit disturbing as you can see 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.340
 we were without end but good me 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.190
 Just think 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.740
 you can not solve it differently but if 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.650
 one in a plus of so in the sound 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.180
 would come the headphones then 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.330
 you would probably take that into account 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.930
 of course because it was better but what 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.970
 you want to do it 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.840
 yes all in all a little bit sparkled 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.150
 the instructions were relative 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.580
 kept simple 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.550
 All in all, however, even as 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.830
 Inexperienced you can with the 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.160
 instructions for use at the playstation 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.110
 connect this earphone very easily 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.810
 I do not know if that is true now 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.669
 for the pc as well knows that that 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.430
 had not tried it because I did that 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:51.810
 part you only have for the playstation 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.919
 i want to be jack long is very nice i can 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.900
 actually only recommend 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.490
 But you really should not 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.350
 So forget if you have no idea about 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.750
 such clothes have that one 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.650
 Cover of the optical cable takes otherwise 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.840
 it does not work out 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.539
 well that's it from me, I hope I 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.860
 could help a bit yes otherwise can 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.440
 I now was not of course with the 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:14.660
 play part before but so look up 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.660
 every time from here you come jeu
