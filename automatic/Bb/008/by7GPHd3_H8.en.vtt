00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:04.859
 www.deportes.gov.ar of victory against 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.600
 the picture paisa the technician of 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.580
 millionaires fc the Spanish Juan Manuel 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.440
 Lillo talks about the behavior of 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.360
 his team against the cadre of antioquia and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.370
 He claimed that his managers had played 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.039
 better against boyacá chicó on the date 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.590
 previous seven minutes for us to have 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.570
 dropped a bit but 27 minutes got tangled 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.920
 of a high ball circulation that 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.410
 allows you to take the opponent to the 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.200
 situations to embarrassing situations 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:33.280
 but there is one thing that is very obvious 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.800
 that we have guessed right the match 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.220
 where more soccer we have continued 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.830
 got this year is that guy is the 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.710
 game of better we have played longer 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.360
 It happens to me that if you do not know that you're going 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.800
 weakening in your own game happens 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.570
 code we have found the sooner 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.680
 still that gives you 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.020
 maxwell there was no behavior 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.000
 different from him 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.100
 except the party plan that you 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.450
 you set according to each rival but 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.650
 removing what has been there is more 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.570
 precision and accuracy is that putting the 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.340
 goal gives team safety any 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.290
 team becomes weak when not 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.390
 you guess one the other day just if 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.550
 between the pole on top then we did 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.160
 the changes with that we end up having 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.510
 25 minutes in wonderful guys at 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.550
 take the ball from one side to another 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.160
 dayro auction that for me this is 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.890
 well because the 27 good minutes and 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.880
 then a good collective suffering 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.070
 when we had to have a bad time 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.509
 been all together having a bad time and that 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.090
 the circulation of protection much more 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.259
 faster and much higher but now 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.670
 you have to try to keep that more 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.850
 time today's game of more time 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.619
 we got it was in boy by the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.119
 side of the cast and antioquia the technician 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.190
 Juan Carlos Osorio congratulated the professor 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.780
 Juan Manuel Lillo for the victory he made 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.759
 a balance of the meeting to the capital of 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.640
 the republic in the behavior of its 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.670
 players on the pitch 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.360
 congratulate the prof chose his group 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.940
 for that very good result 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.200
 a well-fought match pity 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.560
 decisions 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.310
 dubious 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.710
 they altered the process of it 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.260
 I think millionaires start well 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.200
 trying to press us in high area 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.510
 we did the same the great 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.060
 difference in the first time was them 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.980
 trying to play in his defensive third 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.570
 and in his defensive middle third while 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.830
 that we tried to play in 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:37.190
 our middle third and offensive 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.770
 and they were more effective 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.010
 at minute 16 they go ahead before 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.570
 that had had a mayer finish 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.700
 there was a lot of difference in the game 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.310
 we immediately react there 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.680
 an auction of edwin that thin saves very 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.870
 well I think things are matched 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.720
 they write us again on 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.290
 the end we had a center that Santiago 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.390
 could better define was not like that 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.550
 and the ball of the stick Juan David 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.460
 that in fact the first time could 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.440
 have finished your not easily the 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.420
 second we started very well at 15 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.970
 minutes and we make the discount on 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.320
 millionaire had not arrived we had 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.750
 made a good modified 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.390
 modifications we had control of the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.040
 game there is a stopped ball not the 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.290
 defend well while the third goal 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.230
 them and from now on I think that the 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.220
 party already by other decisions it took 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.050
 another course 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.640
 Osorio also referred to the way in which 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.410
 which it was sent by the central 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.530
 I find wilson lamoroux and some 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.720
 doubts in decisive plays of the game 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.720
 analyze the 12 minute play 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.630
 not the last minutes play because 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.410
 from then on I believe that our 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.590
 players change their attitude because it is 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.540
 impossible in a duel and where there is a 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.060
 I struggle Alexis with card 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.830
 yellow henceforth conditioned 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.290
 totally then it seems to me that 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.250
 in our soccer to the extent that 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.770
 there is that easy practice to show 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.670
 yellow cards to control the 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.930
 fire 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.600
 some the two teams will be 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.760
 exposed to an inevitable second as 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.440
 our case today and it seems to me that 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.370
 It is unfair from every point of view 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.200
 now finally clarified that the judge of 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.090
 I never mistreated him, I told him 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.130
 just that very bad decisions and 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.890
 I think that's fair to say and in 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.000
 any country in the world can be said 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.890
 those are the declarations of the 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.930
 technicians after the meeting ended 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.880
 the capital of the republic we 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.530
 We will see of course in the next wheel 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.840
 press with the camera and william 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.680
