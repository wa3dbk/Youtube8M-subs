buttons like you don't know exactly what
a<00:00:39.059> click<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:39.510> once<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.320> figure<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.649> out<00:00:40.710> it's

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
a click but once you figure it out it's

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.250 
a click but once you figure it out it's
pretty<00:00:41.100> easy<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.670> that's<00:00:41.910> okay<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:43.140> the

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
one is a lot more difficult yet the

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.220 
one is a lot more difficult yet the
these<00:04:10.270> red<00:04:10.510> oh<00:04:10.690> by<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.900> way<00:04:10.989> there's

these red oh by the way there's

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.870 
these red oh by the way there's
different<00:04:11.680> colored<00:04:12.190> blobs<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.640> have

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
different colored blobs that have

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.140 
different colored blobs that have
different<00:04:13.770> abilities<00:04:14.770> the<00:04:15.520> red<00:04:15.700> one<00:04:15.880> is<00:04:16.030> like

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
different abilities the red one is like

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.449 
different abilities the red one is like
a<00:04:16.180> balloon<00:04:16.359> like<00:04:17.290> that<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.739> will<00:04:17.890> float<00:04:18.190> and

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
a balloon like that it will float and

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.159 
a balloon like that it will float and
pull<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.090> off<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.299> black<00:04:19.450> ones<00:04:19.660> are<00:04:19.750> normal

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
pull it off the black ones are normal

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.140 
pull it off the black ones are normal
you<00:04:20.739> get<00:04:20.890> white<00:04:21.070> ones<00:04:21.280> that<00:04:21.430> are<00:04:21.520> the<00:04:21.609> droplets

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
you get white ones that are the droplets

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.750 
you get white ones that are the droplets
green<00:04:22.479> ones<00:04:22.720> that<00:04:23.039> easily<00:04:24.039> detach<00:04:24.400> from<00:04:24.430> each

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
green ones that easily detach from each

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.900 
green ones that easily detach from each
other

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
other

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.370 
other
a<00:04:25.940> bunch<00:04:26.210> of<00:04:26.300> different<00:04:26.600> ones<00:04:26.720> now<00:04:27.170> what<00:04:27.290> you

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
a bunch of different ones now what you

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.570 
a bunch of different ones now what you
want<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.530> do<00:04:27.650> for<00:04:27.800> this<00:04:27.890> one<00:04:28.070> you<00:04:28.100> want<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.460> get

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
want to do for this one you want to get

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.860 
want to do for this one you want to get
her<00:04:28.880> to<00:04:29.380> roll<00:04:30.380> across<00:04:30.950> this<00:04:31.510> this<00:04:32.510> black<00:04:32.810> thing

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
her to roll across this this black thing

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.980 
her to roll across this this black thing
you<00:04:33.140> need<00:04:33.260> to<00:04:33.290> make<00:04:33.440> another<00:04:33.650> wire<00:04:34.780> roll<00:04:35.780> down

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
you need to make another wire roll down

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.320 
you need to make another wire roll down
into<00:04:36.260> this<00:04:36.410> she'll<00:04:36.740> break<00:04:36.890> up<00:04:37.100> on<00:04:37.310> this<00:04:37.580> into<00:04:38.300> a

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
into this she'll break up on this into a

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.970 
into this she'll break up on this into a
bunch<00:04:38.540> of<00:04:38.600> different<00:04:38.840> pieces<00:04:38.990> roll<00:04:39.410> down<00:04:39.650> and

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
bunch of different pieces roll down and

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.740 
bunch of different pieces roll down and
then<00:04:40.580> you<00:04:40.670> got<00:04:40.790> to<00:04:40.820> get<00:04:41.000> her<00:04:41.090> into<00:04:41.240> that<00:04:41.450> tube

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
then you got to get her into that tube

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.890 
then you got to get her into that tube
and<00:04:42.010> that's<00:04:43.010> how<00:04:43.130> you<00:04:43.190> beat<00:04:43.430> this<00:04:43.640> level<00:04:43.900> now

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
and that's how you beat this level now

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.380 
and that's how you beat this level now
see<00:04:45.830> if<00:04:45.890> they<00:04:46.010> get<00:04:46.250> much<00:04:46.610> more<00:04:46.760> complex<00:04:47.180> and

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
see if they get much more complex and

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.580 
see if they get much more complex and
I'm<00:04:47.510> sure<00:04:47.660> they<00:04:47.810> just<00:04:47.840> get<00:04:48.140> harder<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:48.530> harder

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
I'm sure they just get harder and harder

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.320 
I'm sure they just get harder and harder
as<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:48.890> go<00:04:49.040> on<00:04:49.070> which<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:49.520> fun<00:04:49.760> because<00:04:50.000> then

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
as you go on which is fun because then

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.630 
as you go on which is fun because then
you<00:04:50.480> have<00:04:50.510> more<00:04:50.750> of<00:04:50.810> a<00:04:50.870> challenge<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:51.640> there's

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
you have more of a challenge and there's

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.980 
you have more of a challenge and there's
always<00:04:52.760> a<00:04:52.850> retry<00:04:53.210> button<00:04:53.360> down<00:04:53.570> here<00:04:53.600> you<00:04:53.870> can

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
always a retry button down here you can

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.720 
always a retry button down here you can
pause<00:04:54.170> down<00:04:54.470> here<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:54.920> can<00:04:55.070> skip<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.430> level

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
pause down here you can skip the level

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.120 
pause down here you can skip the level
if<00:04:55.850> it<00:04:55.970> comes<00:04:56.150> to<00:04:56.330> hard<00:04:56.540> we<00:04:57.020> try<00:04:57.290> it<00:04:57.320> or<00:04:57.710> you<00:04:58.010> can

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
if it comes to hard we try it or you can

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.870 
if it comes to hard we try it or you can
quit<00:04:58.340> and<00:04:58.700> resume<00:04:59.660> and<00:04:59.840> is<00:04:59.930> also<00:05:00.140> an<00:05:00.320> over

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
quit and resume and is also an over

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.990 
quit and resume and is also an over
completion<00:05:01.880> disorder<00:05:02.270> and<00:05:02.630> it<00:05:02.690> gives<00:05:02.900> you

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
completion disorder and it gives you

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.970 
completion disorder and it gives you
many<00:05:05.000> objectives<00:05:05.420> I've<00:05:05.840> had<00:05:06.140> not<00:05:06.350> yet<00:05:06.500> i<00:05:06.740> have

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980
