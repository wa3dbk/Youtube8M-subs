 they will wait 5 seconds and then 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.160
 up on the right they give the button 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.160

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.520
 green button that says town load and 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.860

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.160
 last of the cis img editor program that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.830

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.110

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.800
