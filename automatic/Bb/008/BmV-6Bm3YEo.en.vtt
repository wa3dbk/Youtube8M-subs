 I have the mouse now just once 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.710
 a computer connected 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.660
 By the way, the little mouse wheel on the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.170
 top is still with an orange 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.140

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.250
 means that can always be really out 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.260
 to demonstrate that the boys 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.210

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.210
 Measure the temperature on the top 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.420
 already after the first two minutes has 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.030
 the mouse heats up significantly and after 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.369
 another two minutes to the mouse 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 Her limit came at a temperature 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.960
 from 41 degrees you can calm down with the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.729
 work mouse 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.680
 you do not burn your hands and 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.520
 the mouse stops automatically 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.429
 to heat 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.840
 as soon as the limit of 40 degrees is exceeded 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.420

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.560
 heated computer mouse 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.990
 Overall, I'm very happy with that 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.310
 Unfortunately, the heating function has me 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.590
 a bit disappointed 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.899
 only the back area of ​​the mouse becomes 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.600
 heats the two side panels and the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.090
 Unfortunately, keys can stay on the design 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.590
 and from the processing could me 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.079
 However, the mouse is very convincing 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.799
 it's fun to work with her well 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.909
 with a price of 21 euro 99 is the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.799
 also not exactly expensive 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.989
 i can gadget this all 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.429
