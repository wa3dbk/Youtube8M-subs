00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
posed in a tilted position so WSI have

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.630 
posed in a tilted position so WSI have
done<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.520> good<00:04:30.730> job<00:04:30.790> with<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:31.210> feature<00:04:32.640> moving

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
done a good job with this feature moving

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.950 
done a good job with this feature moving
onto<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.970> trailer<00:04:34.000> it's<00:04:34.480> a<00:04:34.570> highly

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
onto the trailer it's a highly

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.390 
onto the trailer it's a highly
engineered<00:04:35.230> part<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:35.920> the<00:04:36.010> third<00:04:36.190> thing<00:04:36.340> to

engineered part and the third thing to

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.580 
engineered part and the third thing to
notice<00:04:36.700> is<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.330> working<00:04:37.750> suspension<00:04:37.930> on<00:04:38.410> all

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
notice is the working suspension on all

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.090 
notice is the working suspension on all
of<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.830> axles<00:04:40.050> each<00:04:41.050> of<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.380> axle<00:04:41.710> units<00:04:41.980> has

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
of the axles each of the axle units has

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.500 
of the axles each of the axle units has
got<00:04:42.250> a<00:04:42.280> couple<00:04:42.580> of<00:04:42.700> little<00:04:42.850> Springs<00:04:43.240> built

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
got a couple of little Springs built

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.880 
got a couple of little Springs built
into<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:43.870> mechanism<00:04:44.410> so<00:04:44.590> they<00:04:44.710> all

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
into the mechanism so they all

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.790 
into the mechanism so they all
independently<00:04:45.640> sprung<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.530> WSI<00:04:47.530> have<00:04:47.650> done<00:04:47.770> a

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
independently sprung and WSI have done a

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.910 
independently sprung and WSI have done a
good<00:04:48.010> job<00:04:48.070> with<00:04:48.250> this<00:04:48.490> part<00:04:48.790> of<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:48.970> model

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
good job with this part of the model

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.920 
good job with this part of the model
also<00:04:50.920> good<00:04:51.430> is<00:04:51.640> the<00:04:51.880> steering<00:04:52.210> because<00:04:52.570> the

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
also good is the steering because the

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.110 
also good is the steering because the
rear<00:04:53.080> four<00:04:53.380> axles<00:04:53.860> have<00:04:54.100> linked<00:04:54.460> steering<00:04:54.730> and

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
rear four axles have linked steering and

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.820 
rear four axles have linked steering and
it's<00:04:55.210> proportional<00:04:55.900> so<00:04:56.080> that<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:56.380> rear<00:04:56.650> most

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
it's proportional so that the rear most

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.550 
it's proportional so that the rear most
axle<00:04:57.370> turns<00:04:58.030> more<00:04:58.300> than<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:58.660> innermost<00:04:58.990> axle

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
axle turns more than the innermost axle

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.400 
axle turns more than the innermost axle
and<00:05:00.270> when<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.390> set<00:05:01.630> the<00:05:01.750> trailer<00:05:02.080> can<00:05:02.200> then

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
and when it set the trailer can then

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.830 
and when it set the trailer can then
steer<00:05:02.740> through<00:05:03.010> a<00:05:03.100> realistic<00:05:03.790> arc<00:05:04.030> around<00:05:04.450> a

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
steer through a realistic arc around a

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.880 
steer through a realistic arc around a
type<00:05:05.050> end<00:05:06.720> axle<00:05:07.720> one<00:05:07.900> also<00:05:08.170> has<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.470> couple<00:05:08.710> of

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
type end axle one also has a couple of

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.770 
type end axle one also has a couple of
other<00:05:09.160> features<00:05:09.370> associated<00:05:10.270> with<00:05:10.420> it<00:05:10.570> it<00:05:10.750> has

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
other features associated with it it has

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.290 
other features associated with it it has
its<00:05:11.230> own<00:05:11.410> independent<00:05:11.950> steering<00:05:12.760> mechanism

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
its own independent steering mechanism

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.960 
its own independent steering mechanism
and<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:14.590> can<00:05:14.680> also<00:05:14.770> be<00:05:14.950> raised<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.580> fixed<00:05:15.880> out

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
and it can also be raised and fixed out

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.940 
and it can also be raised and fixed out
of<00:05:16.060> service<00:05:16.330> so<00:05:16.900> you<00:05:16.960> press<00:05:17.350> it<00:05:17.500> down<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:17.890> then

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
of service so you press it down and then

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.620 
of service so you press it down and then
is<00:05:18.130> a<00:05:18.160> little<00:05:18.430> switch<00:05:18.730> that<00:05:18.970> you<00:05:19.030> just<00:05:19.270> move

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
is a little switch that you just move

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.450 
is a little switch that you just move
over<00:05:19.750> to<00:05:19.990> one<00:05:20.140> side<00:05:20.170> and<00:05:20.440> that<00:05:20.740> locks<00:05:21.040> it<00:05:21.220> into

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
over to one side and that locks it into

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.580 
over to one side and that locks it into
position<00:05:21.580> and<00:05:22.110> although<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.260> range<00:05:23.440> of

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
position and although the range of

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.800 
position and although the range of
movement<00:05:23.740> isn't<00:05:24.310> much<00:05:24.520> it<00:05:24.790> is<00:05:25.000> enough<00:05:25.270> because

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
movement isn't much it is enough because

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.930 
movement isn't much it is enough because
if<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:26.230> attach<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.980> trailer<00:05:27.340> to<00:05:27.610> a<00:05:27.640> tractor

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
if you attach the trailer to a tractor

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.120 
if you attach the trailer to a tractor
and<00:05:28.390> then<00:05:29.020> move<00:05:29.290> the<00:05:29.560> whole<00:05:29.710> thing<00:05:29.740> along

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
and then move the whole thing along

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.830 
and then move the whole thing along
you'll<00:05:30.520> see<00:05:30.610> that<00:05:30.850> axle<00:05:31.210> one<00:05:31.360> doesn't<00:05:31.720> rotate

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
you'll see that axle one doesn't rotate

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.360 
you'll see that axle one doesn't rotate
because<00:05:32.470> it's<00:05:32.620> not<00:05:32.740> in<00:05:32.860> contact<00:05:33.160> with<00:05:33.310> the

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
because it's not in contact with the

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.060 
because it's not in contact with the
ground<00:05:34.200> another<00:05:35.200> feature<00:05:35.470> is<00:05:35.680> that<00:05:35.710> you<00:05:35.860> can

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
ground another feature is that you can

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.950 
ground another feature is that you can
pose<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:36.460> trailer<00:05:36.850> without<00:05:36.940> a<00:05:37.240> tractor<00:05:37.720> so

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
pose the trailer without a tractor so

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.720 
pose the trailer without a tractor so
you<00:05:38.020> can<00:05:38.320> just<00:05:38.500> lower<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:38.920> two<00:05:39.070> landing<00:05:39.490> legs

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
you can just lower the two landing legs

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.100 
you can just lower the two landing legs
these<00:05:39.940> are<00:05:40.000> metal<00:05:40.360> parts<00:05:40.750> and<00:05:40.840> they've<00:05:40.990> got
