going<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.370> look<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.640> upgrade<00:03:03.030> from<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.269> 8

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
going to look to upgrade from a 8

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.050 
going to look to upgrade from a 8
megapixel<00:03:03.530> camera<00:03:04.530> now<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> 12<00:03:05.850> megapixel

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.600 
megapixel camera now to a 12 megapixel
cameras<00:03:06.840> taking<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.230> 4-megapixel<00:03:07.620> boost<00:03:08.250> and

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
cameras taking a 4-megapixel boost and

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.280 
cameras taking a 4-megapixel boost and
we'll<00:03:08.760> likely<00:03:08.880> see<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.120> faster<00:03:09.540> f-stop<00:03:09.930> with

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
we'll likely see a faster f-stop with

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.259 
we'll likely see a faster f-stop with
their<00:03:10.410> phones<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.700> we're<00:03:11.790> gonna<00:03:11.880> have<00:03:12.030> better

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269

cameras and better pictures overall the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.800 
cameras and better pictures overall the
next<00:03:14.760> thing<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:14.970> we're<00:03:15.300> not<00:03:15.420> going<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.630> see<00:03:15.780> a

next thing is we're not going to see a

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.470 
next thing is we're not going to see a
new<00:03:15.900> design<00:03:16.620> but<00:03:17.220> more<00:03:17.400> they<00:03:17.580> reworked<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.420> a

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
everyone remembers Bend gate when Lou

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.650 
everyone remembers Bend gate when Lou

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
from unbox therapy bent the iphone 6

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.600 
from unbox therapy bent the iphone 6
plus<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.290> literally<00:03:25.590> broke<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.160> internet<00:03:26.459> as

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
plus and literally broke the internet as

of<00:03:28.950> revamp<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.760> structure<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.329> inside<00:03:30.600> of

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
of revamp the structure on the inside of

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.520 
of revamp the structure on the inside of
the<00:03:31.380> framing<00:03:31.880> possibly<00:03:32.880> a<00:03:32.910> stronger<00:03:33.690> metal<00:03:33.930> so

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
the framing possibly a stronger metal so

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.860 
the framing possibly a stronger metal so
it<00:03:34.560> doesn't<00:03:34.890> Bend<00:03:35.130> so<00:03:35.459> easily<00:03:35.760> next<00:03:36.630> up<00:03:36.750> we're

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
it doesn't Bend so easily next up we're

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.270 
it doesn't Bend so easily next up we're
going<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.049> see<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.200> boost<00:03:37.470> in<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.739> performance

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
going to see a boost in the performance

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.410 
going to see a boost in the performance
so<00:03:38.400> we're<00:03:38.519> going<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.700> performance<00:03:39.090> upgrade

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
so we're going to performance upgrade

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.020 
so we're going to performance upgrade
here<00:03:39.690> we<00:03:40.140> have<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.350> a8<00:03:40.950> chip<00:03:41.280> inside<00:03:41.820> our

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
here we have the a8 chip inside our

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.060 
here we have the a8 chip inside our
phones<00:03:42.269> now<00:03:42.600> you're<00:03:43.110> likely<00:03:43.320> going<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.709> see

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
phones now you're likely going to see

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.720 
phones now you're likely going to see
the<00:03:44.280> a9<00:03:44.910> chip<00:03:44.940> get<00:03:45.540> release<00:03:45.870> with<00:03:46.530> iOS<00:03:47.250> 9<00:03:47.489> it

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
the a9 chip get release with iOS 9 it

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.340 
the a9 chip get release with iOS 9 it
all<00:03:47.850> makes<00:03:48.150> sense<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.930> with<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.079> we're

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
all makes sense and with that we're

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.720 
all makes sense and with that we're
probably<00:03:49.500> going<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.769> get<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:49.920> bump<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.489> two

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
probably going to get a bump to two

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.250 
probably going to get a bump to two
gigabytes<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.299> RAM<00:03:51.540> which<00:03:51.720> is<00:03:51.810> again<00:03:52.049> long

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
gigabytes of RAM which is again long

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.870 
gigabytes of RAM which is again long
overdue<00:03:52.620> even<00:03:53.400> though<00:03:53.489> our<00:03:53.579> phones<00:03:53.730> are

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
overdue even though our phones are

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.130 
overdue even though our phones are
really<00:03:54.090> really<00:03:54.239> fast<00:03:54.540> now<00:03:54.780> they're<00:03:54.959> going<00:03:55.049> to

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
really really fast now they're going to

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.080 
really really fast now they're going to
be<00:03:55.200> getting<00:03:55.290> faster<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.070> whole<00:03:56.730> bump<00:03:56.970> of

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
be getting faster and the whole bump of

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.490 
be getting faster and the whole bump of
two<00:03:57.209> gigabytes<00:03:57.630> of<00:03:57.750> RAM<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.079> probably<00:03:58.320> going

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
two gigabytes of RAM is probably going

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.560 
two gigabytes of RAM is probably going
to<00:03:58.620> help<00:03:58.980> with<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.549> as<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.150> mentioned<00:04:00.480> earlier

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
to help with the as I mentioned earlier

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
new ways and we're probably going to see

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.010 
new ways and we're probably going to see
some<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.460> now

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
some of that now

information<00:04:31.160> on<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:31.759> but<00:04:32.300> we<00:04:32.389> can<00:04:32.509> probably

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
information on that but we can probably

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.689 
information on that but we can probably
see<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:33.110> coming<00:04:33.379> as<00:04:33.500> well<00:04:33.530> along<00:04:34.430> with<00:04:34.490> like

I said the force touch and whole upgrade
in<00:04:36.889> terms<00:04:37.069> of<00:04:37.159> performance<00:04:37.509> artery<00:04:38.509> but<00:04:38.629> it's

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
in terms of performance artery but it's

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.240 
in terms of performance artery but it's
going<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:38.960> do<00:04:39.169> it<00:04:39.289> for<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.650> leaked
