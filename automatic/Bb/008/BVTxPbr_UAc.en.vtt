whether the oil prices come down to

eighty dollars a barrel or whether they

eighty dollars a barrel or whether they
shoot<00:01:02.140> up<00:01:02.350> to<00:01:02.500> 200<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.189> stay<00:01:03.400> there<00:01:03.610> you<00:01:03.820> will

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
shoot up to 200 and stay there you will

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.810 
shoot up to 200 and stay there you will
find<00:01:04.479> that<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.590> most<00:01:05.830> established<00:01:06.460> airlines

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
find that the most established airlines

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.030 
find that the most established airlines
start<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.420> look<00:01:07.540> more<00:01:07.750> budget<00:01:08.170> like<00:01:08.350> they<00:01:08.890> will

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
start to look more budget like they will

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.010 
start to look more budget like they will
continue<00:01:09.430> to<00:01:09.610> trim<00:01:10.030> costs<00:01:10.510> they<00:01:10.870> will

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
continue to trim costs they will

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.930 
continue to trim costs they will
continue<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.530> deliver<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.280> basic<00:01:12.760> minimum

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
continue to deliver the basic minimum

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.480 
continue to deliver the basic minimum
that<00:01:13.300> people<00:01:13.660> require<00:01:14.050> and<00:01:14.350> then<00:01:14.920> charge<00:01:15.250> for

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
that people require and then charge for

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.390 
that people require and then charge for
add-ons<00:01:15.850> maybe<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:17.680> will<00:01:17.830> find<00:01:18.040> that<00:01:18.250> the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
add-ons maybe and you will find that the

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.490 
add-ons maybe and you will find that the
budget<00:01:18.610> airlines<00:01:19.090> at<00:01:19.330> the<00:01:19.660> same<00:01:19.900> time<00:01:20.110> having

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
budget airlines at the same time having

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.110 
budget airlines at the same time having

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
out of the market into bankruptcy will

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.630 
out of the market into bankruptcy will
gradually<00:01:25.810> drift<00:01:26.110> their<00:01:26.260> prices<00:01:26.680> are<00:01:26.800> to<00:01:27.460> meet

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
gradually drift their prices are to meet

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.400 
gradually drift their prices are to meet
somewhere<00:01:28.120> in<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.240> middle<00:01:28.360> but<00:01:29.110> there<00:01:29.290> will

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
somewhere in the middle but there will

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.570 
somewhere in the middle but there will
continue<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.860> be<00:01:30.010> a<00:01:30.100> price<00:01:30.370> difference

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
continue to be a price difference

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.030 
continue to be a price difference
between<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.570> two<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:31.990> these<00:01:32.440> offerings<00:01:32.770> will

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
between the two and these offerings will

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.460 
between the two and these offerings will
continue<00:01:33.490> to<00:01:33.640> look<00:01:33.670> quite<00:01:34.000> distinct<00:01:34.570> so

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
continue to look quite distinct so

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.830
