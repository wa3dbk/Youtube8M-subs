the way out I've got some general

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.600 
the way out I've got some general
grading<00:00:07.060> of<00:00:07.240> some<00:00:07.419> of<00:00:07.509> the<00:00:07.720> film<00:00:08.710> forms<00:00:09.370> and<00:00:09.550> I

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
grading of some of the film forms and I

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.200 
grading of some of the film forms and I
put<00:00:09.910> in<00:00:10.000> place<00:00:10.210> I've<00:00:10.509> also<00:00:10.799> put<00:00:11.799> some<00:00:12.210> supports

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
put in place I've also put some supports

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.550 
put in place I've also put some supports
and<00:00:13.599> glued<00:00:14.049> on<00:00:14.380> the<00:00:15.210> second<00:00:16.210> level<00:00:16.570> here<00:00:17.230> on

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
and glued on the second level here on

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.400 
and glued on the second level here on
the<00:00:17.830> backside<00:00:18.340> laid<00:00:18.940> out<00:00:19.090> I<00:00:19.390> can<00:00:19.960> solve<00:00:20.200> the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
the backside laid out I can solve the

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.670 
the backside laid out I can solve the
tunnel<00:00:20.710> portals<00:00:21.130> on<00:00:21.460> both<00:00:22.360> sides<00:00:22.750> now<00:00:23.530> there's

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
tunnel portals on both sides now there's

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.750 
tunnel portals on both sides now there's
still<00:00:23.740> a<00:00:23.830> little<00:00:23.890> bit<00:00:24.010> of<00:00:24.130> filling<00:00:24.310> to<00:00:24.430> do<00:00:24.550> here

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
still a little bit of filling to do here

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.180 
still a little bit of filling to do here
and<00:00:24.880> there<00:00:25.410> but<00:00:26.410> everything<00:00:26.590> is<00:00:26.830> more<00:00:27.010> or<00:00:27.100> less

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
and there but everything is more or less

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.150 
and there but everything is more or less
in<00:00:27.370> place<00:00:27.580> I<00:00:27.910> did<00:00:28.420> spray<00:00:28.720> more<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.920> great

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
in place I did spray more the great

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.150 
in place I did spray more the great
stuff<00:00:30.370> from<00:00:30.610> underneath<00:00:31.150> the<00:00:31.600> the<00:00:32.500> roadway

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
stuff from underneath the the roadway

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.520 
stuff from underneath the the roadway
here<00:00:33.400> which<00:00:34.150> is<00:00:34.390> going<00:00:34.870> up<00:00:35.020> to<00:00:35.110> the<00:00:35.200> second

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
here which is going up to the second

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.440 
here which is going up to the second
level<00:00:35.680> as<00:00:36.340> well<00:00:36.580> as<00:00:36.700> underneath<00:00:37.090> some<00:00:37.300> of<00:00:37.390> the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
level as well as underneath some of the

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.170 
level as well as underneath some of the
areas<00:00:37.810> in<00:00:37.840> here<00:00:38.230> to<00:00:38.800> again<00:00:39.370> provide<00:00:39.730> you<00:00:40.150> know

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
areas in here to again provide you know

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.630 
areas in here to again provide you know
a<00:00:40.270> real<00:00:40.480> real<00:00:40.810> firm<00:00:41.230> stable<00:00:41.560> support<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:42.520> those

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
a real real firm stable support to those

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.720 
a real real firm stable support to those
areas<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:43.360> did<00:00:44.080> kind<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.380> big<00:00:44.470> hole<00:00:44.680> here<00:00:44.730> which

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
areas I did kind of big hole here which

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.310 
areas I did kind of big hole here which
will<00:00:45.910> allow<00:00:46.030> me<00:00:46.060> access<00:00:46.360> for<00:00:46.960> putting<00:00:47.200> in<00:00:47.260> the

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
will allow me access for putting in the

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.080 
will allow me access for putting in the
track<00:00:47.590> and<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:47.950> wiring<00:00:48.220> and<00:00:48.430> so<00:00:48.550> forth<00:00:48.850> a

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
track and the wiring and so forth a

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.300 
track and the wiring and so forth a
lower<00:00:49.810> level<00:00:50.079> in<00:00:50.260> this<00:00:50.410> section<00:00:50.650> I<00:00:51.010> haven't

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
lower level in this section I haven't

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.150 
lower level in this section I haven't
decided<00:00:51.520> yet<00:00:51.730> though<00:00:52.000> if<00:00:52.570> I'm<00:00:52.870> going<00:00:53.230> to<00:00:53.440> use

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.319 

this<00:00:57.160> is<00:00:57.400> an<00:00:57.520> access<00:00:57.790> hole<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.120> basically

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
this is an access hole and basically

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.930 
this is an access hole and basically
have<00:00:58.540> like<00:00:58.750> a<00:00:58.780> removable<00:00:59.470> section<00:00:59.860> on<00:00:59.920> top<00:01:00.190> or

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
have like a removable section on top or

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.780 
have like a removable section on top or
just<00:01:01.239> put<00:01:01.480> a<00:01:01.510> a<00:01:01.989> access<00:01:02.950> hole<00:01:03.190> in<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.640> back

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
just put a a access hole in the back

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.760 
just put a a access hole in the back
fascia<00:01:04.239> here<00:01:04.570> which<00:01:05.260> is<00:01:05.379> what<00:01:05.470> I<00:01:05.530> think<00:01:05.590> I'm

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
fascia here which is what I think I'm

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.920 
fascia here which is what I think I'm
probably<00:01:05.979> gonna<00:01:06.250> do<00:01:06.460> just<00:01:06.790> to<00:01:07.000> allow<00:01:07.659> me<00:01:07.870> to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
probably gonna do just to allow me to

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.660 
probably gonna do just to allow me to
keep<00:01:08.170> everything<00:01:08.470> here<00:01:08.620> glued<00:01:09.040> down<00:01:09.190> firmly

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
keep everything here glued down firmly

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.730 
keep everything here glued down firmly
and<00:01:10.060> then<00:01:10.120> I<00:01:10.659> have<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.900> worry<00:01:11.020> about<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.560> top

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
and then I have to worry about the top

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.469 
and then I have to worry about the top
level<00:01:12.040> falling<00:01:12.340> off<00:01:12.490> I'm<00:01:12.820> transporting<00:01:13.420> the

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
level falling off I'm transporting the

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.160 
level falling off I'm transporting the
way<00:01:13.570> out<00:01:13.720> and<00:01:13.840> so<00:01:14.020> forth<00:01:14.350> but<00:01:15.270> anyway<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.510> want

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
way out and so forth but anyway I want

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.140 
way out and so forth but anyway I want
to<00:01:17.229> do<00:01:17.320> is<00:01:17.950> do<00:01:18.130> some<00:01:18.340> more<00:01:18.490> grading<00:01:18.909> on<00:01:19.120> the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
to do is do some more grading on the

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.289 
to do is do some more grading on the
scenery<00:01:20.110> in<00:01:20.470> this<00:01:20.620> area<00:01:20.979> here<00:01:21.430> and<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:22.060> do<00:01:22.150> that

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
scenery in this area here and to do that

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.350 
scenery in this area here and to do that
I'm<00:01:22.510> going<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.750> use<00:01:22.870> a<00:01:23.460> stanley<00:01:24.460> sure<00:01:25.060> foam

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
I'm going to use a stanley sure foam

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.500 
I'm going to use a stanley sure foam
tool<00:01:26.140> which<00:01:26.440> is<00:01:26.590> basically<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:28.260> screen<00:01:29.260> mesh<00:01:29.680> a

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
tool which is basically a screen mesh a

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.020 
tool which is basically a screen mesh a
plastic<00:01:31.510> handle<00:01:31.900> and<00:01:32.200> there<00:01:32.799> is<00:01:32.920> some<00:01:33.159> it's

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
plastic handle and there is some it's

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.430 
plastic handle and there is some it's
something<00:01:34.450> like<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:34.690> would<00:01:34.960> have<00:01:35.170> in<00:01:35.350> a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
something like you would have in a

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.320 
something like you would have in a
kitchen<00:01:35.619> grater<00:01:35.950> essentially<00:01:36.490> where<00:01:37.150> there

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
kitchen grater essentially where there

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.830 
kitchen grater essentially where there
is<00:01:37.450> holes<00:01:37.750> cut<00:01:38.590> out<00:01:38.619> here<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:40.240> there's<00:01:40.659> some

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
is holes cut out here and there's some

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.929 
is holes cut out here and there's some
sharp<00:01:41.080> edges<00:01:41.260> along<00:01:41.619> them<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:42.070> so<00:01:42.250> when<00:01:42.880> you

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
sharp edges along them and so when you

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.429 
sharp edges along them and so when you
slide<00:01:43.180> it<00:01:43.299> on<00:01:43.360> phone<00:01:43.659> or<00:01:43.900> wood<00:01:44.080> or<00:01:44.229> whatever

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
slide it on phone or wood or whatever

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.649 
slide it on phone or wood or whatever
else<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:45.010> does<00:01:45.310> sort<00:01:45.760> of<00:01:45.820> act<00:01:46.060> as<00:01:46.180> a<00:01:46.240> very<00:01:46.510> very

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
else it does sort of act as a very very

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.080 
else it does sort of act as a very very
coarse<00:01:47.020> sandpaper<00:01:47.439> but<00:01:48.369> being<00:01:48.610> metal<00:01:48.939> it

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
coarse sandpaper but being metal it

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.580 
coarse sandpaper but being metal it
doesn't<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:49.780> know<00:01:49.869> wear<00:01:50.140> down<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.439> get

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
doesn't you know wear down and get

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.440 
doesn't you know wear down and get
clogged<00:01:50.830> up<00:01:50.979> very<00:01:51.220> easily<00:01:51.369> so<00:01:51.729> it<00:01:51.850> lasts<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.420> a

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
clogged up very easily so it lasts a a

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.480 
clogged up very easily so it lasts a a
long<00:01:52.960> time<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.830> it<00:01:53.890> does<00:01:54.040> make<00:01:54.220> some<00:01:54.340> pretty

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
long time and it does make some pretty

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.600 
long time and it does make some pretty
good<00:01:54.610> fast<00:01:55.450> work<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:56.369> shaping<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.400> foam

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
good fast work of shaping the foam

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.880 
good fast work of shaping the foam
scenery<00:01:57.970> now<00:01:58.930> I<00:01:58.960> have<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.320> put<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.530> track<00:01:59.710> down

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
scenery now I have to put the track down

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.740 
scenery now I have to put the track down
on<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.189> upper<00:02:00.340> level<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:01.210> give<00:02:01.360> me<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.509> guide<00:02:01.720> of

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
on the upper level to give me a guide of

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.830 
on the upper level to give me a guide of
where<00:02:02.350> I<00:02:02.380> can<00:02:02.880> shave<00:02:03.880> down<00:02:04.180> things<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.720> where

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
where I can shave down things and where

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.140 
where I can shave down things and where
I<00:02:04.869> can't<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.729> since<00:02:06.729> I<00:02:06.790> don't<00:02:06.850> want<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.090> do

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
I can't and since I don't want to do

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.519 
I can't and since I don't want to do
that<00:02:07.240> while<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.479> tracks<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:07.930> place<00:02:08.200> I'm<00:02:08.499> just

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:08.529 
that while the tracks in place I'm just

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:10.499 
that while the tracks in place I'm just
going<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.799> take<00:02:08.889> a<00:02:08.919> sharpie<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:10.179> pretty<00:02:10.389> much

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
going to take a sharpie and pretty much

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.000 
going to take a sharpie and pretty much
mark<00:02:10.929> out

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
mark out

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.770 
mark out
you<00:02:13.010> know<00:02:13.099> a<00:02:13.129> reasonable<00:02:13.700> boundary<00:02:14.239> around

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
you know a reasonable boundary around

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.879 
you know a reasonable boundary around
the<00:02:15.019> track<00:02:15.519> section<00:02:16.519> here<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.200> I'll<00:02:18.200> know<00:02:18.499> not

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:18.889 
the track section here and I'll know not

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:24.879 
the track section here and I'll know not
to<00:02:19.340> do<00:02:20.239> any<00:02:20.629> type<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.909> shaping<00:02:23.620> within<00:02:24.620> the

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:24.889 
to do any type of shaping within the

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:28.479 
to do any type of shaping within the
bounds<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.459> those<00:02:26.090> two<00:02:26.359> lines<00:02:26.569> there<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.489> this

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
bounds of those two lines there and this

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.789 
bounds of those two lines there and this
way<00:02:28.670> I'll<00:02:28.849> I'll<00:02:29.090> be<00:02:29.180> sure<00:02:29.389> to<00:02:29.510> have<00:02:29.689> a<00:02:29.799> smooth

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
way I'll I'll be sure to have a smooth

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.550 
way I'll I'll be sure to have a smooth
flat<00:02:31.159> surface<00:02:31.700> for<00:02:31.959> for<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.019> track<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.379> land

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
flat surface for for the track to land

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.729 
flat surface for for the track to land
on<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.950> think<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.459> track<00:02:34.670> section<00:02:35.060> off<00:02:35.739> and

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
on I think the track section off and

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.309 
on I think the track section off and
then<00:02:36.950> get<00:02:37.069> to<00:02:37.189> work<00:02:37.370> with<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.510> sure<00:02:38.900> foam<00:02:39.109> tool

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
then get to work with the sure foam tool

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.339 
then get to work with the sure foam tool
and<00:02:39.950> again<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.370> does<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:41.780> does<00:02:41.959> take<00:02:42.139> a<00:02:42.169> little

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
and again it does it does take a little

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.020 
and again it does it does take a little
bit<00:02:42.469> of<00:02:42.620> time<00:02:42.829> and<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.459> does<00:02:43.669> go<00:02:44.000> pretty

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
bit of time and it does go pretty

00:02:44.030 --> 00:03:21.879 
bit of time and it does go pretty
quickly<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.199> current<00:03:21.530> plan<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.709> that

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
quickly and the current plan is that

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.469 
quickly and the current plan is that
what<00:03:22.069> I'm<00:03:22.159> probably<00:03:22.250> gonna<00:03:22.489> do<00:03:22.639> is<00:03:22.819> add<00:03:23.329> in

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:23.479 
what I'm probably gonna do is add in

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.479 
what I'm probably gonna do is add in
some<00:03:23.689> retaining<00:03:24.019> walls<00:03:24.319> and<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.799> lower<00:03:24.979> section

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
some retaining walls and a lower section

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.929 
some retaining walls and a lower section
of<00:03:25.729> this<00:03:25.909> hill<00:03:26.180> here<00:03:26.479> and<00:03:27.639> then<00:03:28.639> there<00:03:28.819> may<00:03:28.909> be

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
of this hill here and then there may be

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.399 
of this hill here and then there may be
this<00:03:29.659> sort<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:29.989> a<00:03:30.019> rocky<00:03:30.199> surface<00:03:30.560> above<00:03:31.340> that

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
this sort of a rocky surface above that

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.929 
this sort of a rocky surface above that
but<00:03:33.409> I<00:03:33.739> do<00:03:33.829> want<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.099> add<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.310> large<00:03:34.639> structure

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
but I do want to add a large structure

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:36.429 
but I do want to add a large structure
in<00:03:35.120> this<00:03:35.209> area<00:03:35.479> so<00:03:35.599> I<00:03:35.629> didn't<00:03:36.019> want<00:03:36.139> to<00:03:36.229> have<00:03:36.409> a

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
in this area so I didn't want to have a

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.309 
in this area so I didn't want to have a
hill<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:36.709> would<00:03:36.979> gradually<00:03:37.189> slow<00:03:37.639> down<00:03:38.319> I'm

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
hill that would gradually slow down I'm

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.449 
hill that would gradually slow down I'm
trying<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.650> create<00:03:39.829> a<00:03:40.129> fairly<00:03:40.970> steep<00:03:42.459> rocky

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
trying to create a fairly steep rocky

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.050 
trying to create a fairly steep rocky
sort<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.120> retaining<00:03:44.840> wall<00:03:45.549> cliff<00:03:46.549> face<00:03:46.759> here

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
sort of retaining wall cliff face here

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.809 
sort of retaining wall cliff face here
that<00:03:48.069> you<00:03:49.069> know<00:03:49.159> won't<00:03:49.310> take<00:03:49.489> up<00:03:49.609> too<00:03:49.790> much

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
that you know won't take up too much

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.170 
that you know won't take up too much
room<00:03:50.680> know<00:03:51.680> some<00:03:51.889> areas<00:03:52.040> in<00:03:52.310> here<00:03:52.489> I'll<00:03:53.060> have

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
room know some areas in here I'll have

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.439 
room know some areas in here I'll have
to<00:03:53.269> go<00:03:53.359> back<00:03:53.389> and<00:03:53.750> fill<00:03:54.019> in<00:03:54.229> with<00:03:54.549> some<00:03:55.549> foam<00:03:56.269> or

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
to go back and fill in with some foam or

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.209 
to go back and fill in with some foam or
I<00:03:56.479> using<00:03:57.049> some<00:03:57.169> lightweight<00:03:57.349> spackle<00:03:57.979> and

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.219 
I using some lightweight spackle and

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.259 
I using some lightweight spackle and
then<00:03:58.969> come<00:03:59.449> back<00:03:59.479> in<00:03:59.750> Sandin<00:04:00.139> later<00:04:01.269> although

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
then come back in Sandin later although

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.789 
then come back in Sandin later although
if<00:04:02.389> I<00:04:02.449> do<00:04:02.509> have<00:04:02.719> some<00:04:02.870> rock<00:04:03.019> casters<00:04:03.409> which<00:04:03.709> I

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
if I do have some rock casters which I

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.860 
if I do have some rock casters which I
probably<00:04:04.040> will<00:04:04.310> here<00:04:04.729> in<00:04:05.479> some<00:04:05.689> of<00:04:05.780> these

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
probably will here in some of these

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.850 
probably will here in some of these
sections

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
sections

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:36.730 
sections

gonna try to fill in this void over here

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:00.100 
gonna try to fill in this void over here
it's<00:04:53.600> about<00:04:53.810> second<00:04:58.750> yeah<00:04:59.750> at<00:04:59.810> this<00:04:59.870> point<00:04:59.960> if

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
it's about second yeah at this point if

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.240 
it's about second yeah at this point if
again<00:05:00.290> I'm<00:05:00.380> just<00:05:00.440> trying<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:00.740> basically<00:05:00.890> fill

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
again I'm just trying to basically fill

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.300 
again I'm just trying to basically fill
in<00:05:01.370> gaps<00:05:01.400> and<00:05:01.940> voids<00:05:02.419> and<00:05:02.750> it's<00:05:03.470> not<00:05:03.650> really<00:05:03.980> to

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
in gaps and voids and it's not really to

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.070 
in gaps and voids and it's not really to
the<00:05:04.400> point<00:05:04.430> where<00:05:04.850> I'm<00:05:04.940> trying<00:05:05.690> to<00:05:05.810> produce<00:05:05.960> a

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
the point where I'm trying to produce a

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.590 
the point where I'm trying to produce a
finished<00:05:06.320> surface<00:05:10.030> and<00:05:11.030> what's<00:05:11.419> really

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
finished surface and what's really

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.790 
finished surface and what's really
important<00:05:11.990> is<00:05:12.110> when<00:05:12.229> you're<00:05:12.320> doing<00:05:12.410> this<00:05:12.650> type

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
important is when you're doing this type

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.980 
important is when you're doing this type
of<00:05:12.860> sanding<00:05:13.310> especially<00:05:13.790> on<00:05:14.390> the<00:05:14.570> foam<00:05:14.780> layers

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
of sanding especially on the foam layers

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.290 
of sanding especially on the foam layers
is<00:05:15.380> that<00:05:15.650> they<00:05:16.160> are<00:05:16.340> completely<00:05:16.820> and<00:05:17.150> totally

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
is that they are completely and totally

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.320 
is that they are completely and totally
cured<00:05:17.919> at<00:05:18.919> least<00:05:19.070> really<00:05:19.400> close<00:05:19.700> to<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.090> before

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
cured at least really close to it before

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.870 
cured at least really close to it before
you're<00:05:20.600> trying<00:05:20.810> to<00:05:20.870> do<00:05:20.960> that<00:05:21.110> if<00:05:21.919> you<00:05:22.130> use

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
you're trying to do that if you use

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.430 
you're trying to do that if you use
adhesive<00:05:23.390> and<00:05:23.510> attach<00:05:23.570> these<00:05:24.020> boards

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
adhesive and attach these boards

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.469 
adhesive and attach these boards
together<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:25.400> then<00:05:25.580> come<00:05:25.790> back<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.150> next<00:05:26.210> day

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
together and then come back the next day

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.300 
together and then come back the next day
12<00:05:27.380> hours<00:05:27.470> later<00:05:27.710> or<00:05:27.919> something<00:05:28.190> like<00:05:28.250> that

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
12 hours later or something like that

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.550 
12 hours later or something like that
and<00:05:28.729> trying<00:05:29.300> to<00:05:29.360> sand<00:05:29.660> it<00:05:29.780> with<00:05:29.900> a<00:05:29.960> one<00:05:30.470> of

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
and trying to sand it with a one of

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.800 
and trying to sand it with a one of
these<00:05:30.680> sure<00:05:30.860> foam<00:05:31.130> tools<00:05:31.490> you're<00:05:32.419> most<00:05:32.600> likely

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
these sure foam tools you're most likely

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.060 
these sure foam tools you're most likely
gonna<00:05:32.960> end<00:05:33.169> up<00:05:33.229> separating<00:05:33.680> all<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.800> layers

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
gonna end up separating all the layers

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.130 
gonna end up separating all the layers
because<00:05:34.840> what<00:05:35.840> happens<00:05:36.200> is<00:05:36.380> is<00:05:36.790> you<00:05:37.790> get<00:05:38.140> you

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
because what happens is is you get you

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.420 
because what happens is is you get you
know<00:05:39.229> good<00:05:39.410> adhesion<00:05:39.710> and<00:05:39.919> drying<00:05:40.220> of<00:05:40.400> the

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
know good adhesion and drying of the

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.180 
know good adhesion and drying of the
adhesive<00:05:40.780> along<00:05:41.780> the<00:05:41.960> exterior<00:05:42.290> edges<00:05:42.770> but

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
adhesive along the exterior edges but

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.190 
adhesive along the exterior edges but
everything<00:05:43.520> in<00:05:43.610> the<00:05:43.669> middle<00:05:44.000> stays<00:05:44.720> wet<00:05:44.960> for<00:05:45.169> a

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
everything in the middle stays wet for a

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.080 
everything in the middle stays wet for a
very<00:05:45.410> long<00:05:45.620> time<00:05:45.650> because<00:05:46.190> these<00:05:46.550> boards<00:05:46.970> are

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
very long time because these boards are

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.390 
very long time because these boards are
pretty<00:05:47.600> airtight

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
pretty airtight

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.560 
pretty airtight
again<00:05:49.400> they<00:05:49.490> are<00:05:49.520> insulation<00:05:50.120> with<00:05:50.240> boards

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
again they are insulation with boards

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.210 
again they are insulation with boards
and<00:05:50.720> so<00:05:50.780> they<00:05:50.900> they<00:05:51.140> you<00:05:51.770> know<00:05:51.860> aren't

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
and so they they you know aren't

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.400 
and so they they you know aren't
designed<00:05:52.580> to<00:05:52.640> allow<00:05:52.970> for<00:05:53.050> for<00:05:54.050> a<00:05:54.110> good<00:05:54.200> air

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
designed to allow for for a good air

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.350 
designed to allow for for a good air
flow<00:05:54.770> through<00:05:55.160> them<00:05:55.370> since<00:05:55.700> they're<00:05:55.880> trying

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
flow through them since they're trying

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.380 
flow through them since they're trying
to<00:05:56.390> trap<00:05:56.630> air<00:05:56.810> and<00:05:57.169> so<00:05:57.860> the<00:05:58.520> glue<00:05:58.790> that<00:05:58.820> is

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
to trap air and so the glue that is

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.210 
to trap air and so the glue that is
essentially<00:06:00.169> away<00:06:00.350> from<00:06:00.560> the<00:06:00.650> edges<00:06:00.950> of<00:06:00.979> the

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
essentially away from the edges of the

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.280 
essentially away from the edges of the
boards<00:06:01.550> and<00:06:01.640> isn't<00:06:01.940> here<00:06:02.090> in<00:06:02.180> the<00:06:02.240> middle<00:06:02.510> can

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
boards and isn't here in the middle can

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.130 
boards and isn't here in the middle can
stay<00:06:03.590> you<00:06:04.550> know<00:06:04.610> uncured<00:06:05.240> for<00:06:05.570> a<00:06:05.600> very<00:06:05.930> long

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
stay you know uncured for a very long

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.430 
stay you know uncured for a very long
time

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
time

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.670 
time
you<00:06:07.070> know<00:06:07.130> many<00:06:07.370> days<00:06:07.610> even<00:06:07.940> weeks<00:06:08.380> and<00:06:09.380> so<00:06:09.620> you

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
you know many days even weeks and so you

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.020 
you know many days even weeks and so you
do<00:06:09.800> want<00:06:09.950> to<00:06:10.010> wait<00:06:10.100> as<00:06:10.190> long<00:06:10.220> as<00:06:10.430> you<00:06:10.520> can<00:06:10.700> in

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
do want to wait as long as you can in

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.370 
do want to wait as long as you can in
this<00:06:11.479> case<00:06:11.750> I've<00:06:11.960> been<00:06:12.560> waiting<00:06:12.950> about<00:06:14.380> three

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
this case I've been waiting about three

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.740 
this case I've been waiting about three
to<00:06:15.470> four<00:06:15.650> days<00:06:15.710> from<00:06:16.640> gluing<00:06:17.360> everything<00:06:17.450> in

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
to four days from gluing everything in

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.489 
to four days from gluing everything in
place<00:06:17.960> to<00:06:18.349> when<00:06:18.500> I<00:06:18.560> started<00:06:18.890> to<00:06:18.979> do

00:06:19.489 --> 00:06:19.499 
place to when I started to do

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:22.429 
place to when I started to do
all<00:06:19.860> the<00:06:20.249> the<00:06:21.090> shaping<00:06:21.509> wood<00:06:21.749> with<00:06:22.199> the<00:06:22.289> sure

00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:22.439 
all the the shaping wood with the sure

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:24.529 
all the the shaping wood with the sure
film<00:06:22.680> tool<00:06:22.830> and<00:06:23.340> and<00:06:24.060> you<00:06:24.180> know<00:06:24.240> that<00:06:24.360> and

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
film tool and and you know that and

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:25.700 
film tool and and you know that and
that's<00:06:24.599> worked<00:06:24.870> out<00:06:24.960> fine<00:06:25.199> everything<00:06:25.680> is

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
that's worked out fine everything is

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.459 
that's worked out fine everything is
very<00:06:26.280> solid<00:06:26.610> at<00:06:26.819> this<00:06:26.909> point<00:06:27.349> you<00:06:28.349> could

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:28.469 
very solid at this point you could

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:30.709 
very solid at this point you could
probably<00:06:28.620> do<00:06:28.919> it<00:06:28.949> with<00:06:29.129> less<00:06:29.490> of<00:06:29.520> a<00:06:29.729> way<00:06:29.879> and<00:06:30.539> be

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:30.719 
probably do it with less of a way and be

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.719 
probably do it with less of a way and be
okay<00:06:31.050> but<00:06:31.379> but<00:06:31.889> the<00:06:31.949> problem<00:06:32.279> is<00:06:32.340> if<00:06:32.460> it<00:06:32.550> does

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
okay but but the problem is if it does

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.399 
okay but but the problem is if it does
you<00:06:33.210> know<00:06:33.300> end<00:06:33.509> up<00:06:33.569> shearing<00:06:33.990> off<00:06:34.199> while

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:34.409 
you know end up shearing off while

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:36.379 
you know end up shearing off while
you're<00:06:34.529> sanding<00:06:34.919> it<00:06:35.069> you<00:06:35.699> know<00:06:35.789> it's<00:06:35.939> kind<00:06:36.360> of

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:36.389 
you're sanding it you know it's kind of

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:38.570 
you're sanding it you know it's kind of
a<00:06:36.479> real<00:06:36.629> pain<00:06:36.900> to<00:06:36.930> go<00:06:37.139> back<00:06:37.319> and<00:06:37.590> in<00:06:37.979> the<00:06:38.370> pine

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
a real pain to go back and in the pine

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.890
