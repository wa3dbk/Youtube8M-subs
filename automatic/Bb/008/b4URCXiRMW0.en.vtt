00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.250
 welcome to a new video today I will try 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.560
 the theme of the current ideological conflict 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.340
 between two world powers china and 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.439
 Chinese USA is currently a giant in 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.689
 full technological and technological boom 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.880
 military develops a wide variety 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.130
 of new weapons but five of them 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.160
 they really should alarm the giant 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.870
 western in its force projection 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.579
 towards the seas that surround it and for 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.230
 support their claims 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.150
 territorial China recognizes the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.910
 probability of an armed conflict with 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.559
 for which reason it invests resources in the 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.149
 development of specific weapons 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.190
 intended to attack forces 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.190
 Americans five of which 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.670
 represent in this top in the end enjoy 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.670
 of the video 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.850
 the capacity of chinÃ¡ to disembark 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.710
 his troops has been improved since 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.040
 It has three amphibious assault ships 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.170
 type 071 these are considered by 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.600
 Western naval observers like 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.250
 China's naval alligators are ships 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.050
 projected to transport and 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.290
 disembark the marines in 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.110
 hostile costs each ship displaces 20 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.100
 thousand tons and measures about 213 meters 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.100
 long 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.930
 Class 071 ships can transport 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.320
 up a battalion of marines 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.410
 from 400 to 800 soldiers and up to 18 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.970
 armored vehicles the ships have a 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.100
 flight deck capable of operating 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.380
 simultaneously two helicopters of 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.570
 troop transport and can store 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.610
 another four in a large hangar the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.259
 boats can also carry and launch 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.479
 amphibian and four vehicles 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.479
 hovercraft troop transport 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.360
 the first fifth generation fighter 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.610
 Chinese the J-20 is a heavy fighter 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.640
 multifunctional twin engine currently in the 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.740
 prototype phase the mission of the j-20 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.170
 it is still unknown but the robust design 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.780
 of the aircraft seems to support the idea of 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.000
 that the plane would act in several missions 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.800
 promises to have a great autonomy be 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.070
 fast and stealthy for the radars 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.920
 enemies the most obvious function of the j-20 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.110
 is the air superiority hunting the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.270
 great autonomy of it means that 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.670
 the aircraft could operate far from the 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.350
 China's coasts intercepting aircraft 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.590
 american combat 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.190
 f-18 fighter -bombers and b1 bombers and 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.650
 b2 as long-range fighter the j-20 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.690
 could also patrol territories in 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.459
 dispute in particular in support of the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.530
 recently declared zone of 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.050
 identification of air defense of china 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.269
 in the sea of eastern china china 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.430
 you could also use the fighters for 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.290
 attack American support aircraft 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.360
 as early warning aircraft and 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.360
 refueling aircraft in flight 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.250
 the most dangerous weapon for the forces 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.710
 Americans in the Asian region 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.380
 of the Pacific is the anti-ballistic missile 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.440
 dong feng 21 vessel that has already deserved the 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.480
 nickname aircraft carrier killer the df 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.760
 21 is a ballistic missile of medium 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.080
 scope designed specifically for 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.270
 attack the aircraft carriers 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.550
 Americans mocking the defense of 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.380
 the American Navy to attack the 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.980
 ships from above at a speed 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.140
 hypersonic the df 21d is a system 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.560
 terrestrial with an estimated range of 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.510
 up to 1500 kilometers once the 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.850
 carrier rocket releases a missile from 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.459
 multiple reentry capable of reaching a 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.709
 speed up to plus 10 the speed and 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.570
 resulting kinetic energy by not 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.120
 talk about the payload of the vehicle's 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.670
 reentry would cause serious damage even 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.709
 to the largest warships nobody 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.020
 he knows for sure but he believes 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.970
 that the direct impact of an efe 21 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.090
 could put an aircraft carrier out of 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.430
 combat or even sink it mounted on 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.040
 a wheel conveyor and launcher the 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.230
 df 21 would be a mobile SUV and for 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.659
 so it would be very difficult to locate 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.519
 before the launch the speed 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.430
 hypersonic of the re-entry vehicle 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.430
 difficult area but not impossible 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.430
 knock it down 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.030
 the popular liberation army believes 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.890
 that establish their superiority 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.750
 electronics from the beginning is 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.840
 essential to succeed in a 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.910
 future armed conflict operations 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.100
 offensive cybernetics include a 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.810
 broad spectrum of activities since 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.850
 psychological operations until the 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.880
 destruction of equipment and infrastructure 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.860
 enemies the army general 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.260
 Chinese defined the objectives of the war 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.540
 electronic I quote this kind of 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.860
 confrontation harms mainly to 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.160
 the telecommunications infrastructure 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.560
 already several computer systems and only 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.470
 then it affects the real world producing 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.150
 agitation and riots for example it 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.190
 try to disorganize the system 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.290
 financial transport and the 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.510
 energy which directly affects 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.240
 in the military potential of the country and 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.070
 influences the course of a war and by 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.660
 last one must not forget that the 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.060
 modern wars are wars of 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.520
 computer technologies of weapons 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.440
 accuracy through a cyber war it 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.100
 could decrease the accuracy of this 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.100
 type of weapon 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.830
 satellites are essential for the 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.660
 American war strategy this is 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.000
 especially true in the region 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.430
 asia-pacific where distances from 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.099
 the continental territory of the USA is 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.810
 they measure thousands of kilometers 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:44.389
 China has at least one operational weapon 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.370
 the sc missile 19 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.520
 the ballistic missile is equipped with the 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.889
 category 2 a kinetic action warhead is 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.169
 say of direct impact that once 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.780
 thrown into space is guided towards its 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.030
 objective by infrared sensors the 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.400
 missile does not have an explosive head but 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:05.240
 destroy enemy satellites with impact 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.190
 direct in 2007 a cut 2 hit and 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.130
 destroyed a Chinese satellite outside of 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.930
 service in May 2013 china put in 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.030
 march what he described as a rocket 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.300
 probe to carry large experiments 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.190
 altitude the intelligence of usa is 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.520
 sure that that was actually 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.380
 a test of kt 2 is believed to be the missile 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.960
 It is able to reach Earth orbit 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.690
 mean representing a danger for 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.470
 GPS navigation satellites 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.270
 Americans 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.540
 with the loss of intelligence 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.400
 communications and satellite navigation 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.260
 the US would have difficulties to bring 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.900
 Cape reconnaissance missions on 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.580
 China the use of anti-satellite weapons 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.550
 it could also interfere in the 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.960
 ground and maritime air navigation 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:51.470
 obstruct communication and prevent 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.750
 use of weapons guided by gps good that 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.080
 It was everything I hope you liked us 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.080
 we see
