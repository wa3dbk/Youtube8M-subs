maintenance fee of this aircraft is
super<00:01:01.739> low<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.699> uses<00:01:03.439> magnetic<00:01:04.439> motors<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.339> you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
super low it uses magnetic motors so you

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.859 
super low it uses magnetic motors so you
don't<00:01:05.850> need<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.150> change<00:01:06.450> NGSS<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:08.189> a

don't need to change NGSS as a

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.870 
don't need to change NGSS as a
conditional<00:01:09.869> aircrafts<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.549> save<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
conditional aircrafts so it can save a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.020 
conditional aircrafts so it can save a
lot<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.299> maintenance<00:01:13.229> fee<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.979> fuel<00:01:14.610> costs<00:01:14.939> of

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
battery so and we are still developing

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.260 
battery so and we are still developing
the<00:01:42.600> batteries<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.439> make<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.909> make<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the batteries to make it to make the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.960 
the batteries to make it to make the
endurance<00:01:45.630> time<00:01:45.869> further<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.829> longer<00:01:47.100> this

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
endurance time further and longer this

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.090 
endurance time further and longer this
aircraft<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.750> perfect<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.680> flight<00:01:49.890> training

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
aircraft is perfect for flight training

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.999 
aircraft is perfect for flight training
and<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:51.240> China<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.869> change<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.860> file

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
and in China this change the file

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.740 
and in China this change the file
chinese<00:01:53.340> school<00:01:53.579> already<00:01:54.090> started<00:01:54.509> using

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
chinese school already started using

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.679 
chinese school already started using
this<00:01:55.350> kind<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.799> aircraft<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.360> are<00:01:57.479> getting

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
this kind of aircraft and we are getting

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.749 
this kind of aircraft and we are getting
it<00:01:58.409> manufacturing<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.130> 30<00:01:59.280> states<00:01:59.640> and

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
it manufacturing in 30 states and

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.510 
it manufacturing in 30 states and
hopefully<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.479> will<00:02:00.719> get<00:02:01.020> with

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
hopefully we will get with

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.130 
hopefully we will get with
American<00:02:01.850> markets<00:02:02.380> so<00:02:03.380> for<00:02:04.100> now<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.609> can<00:02:05.140> do

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
American markets so for now it can do

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.240 
American markets so for now it can do
the<00:02:06.850> landings<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.149> takeoffs<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:08.720> even

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
the landings and takeoffs and even

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.750 
the landings and takeoffs and even
