00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.350
 ask the question which posts will your 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.110
 employee 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.140
 his position is actually his deputy 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.239
 head of the department 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.360
 functional as already probably said 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.239
 I emphasize again at the moment 1 this 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.990
 accumulate a huge array of data which 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.869
 will allow analyzing this data array 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.509
 make the next modification 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:18.410
 light up the sensation you spell sphere come 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:21.800

 blue or declaration of love 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.190
 this is certainly not the olympic games but 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.840
 I feel like a certain and for what love 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.380
 fairy tale ship went all enough 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.900
 not bad it seems to me even think well yes 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.400
 great could have been better but we 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.580
 we try to work on ourselves 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.580
 it means that this one is not planned 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.110
 performance with works evgeny means 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.240
 still added gray hair to the robot 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.050
 coped Alan teams appeared I think 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.050
 what is always Sasha 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.860
 is to accelerate the elementary 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.570
 particle magnetic field I saw a promo 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.870
 years in the first version is actually very 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.030
 waiting for today's presentations 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.340
 because really the presentation 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.290
 I was the first to see how worried 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.739
 worried about the team work but 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.480
 it seems everything was possible hope that today 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.190
 the right bot has entered a new great voyage 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.450

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.450
 his talents 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.030
 honestly did not expect this topic 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.730
 interested in so many people 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.829
 who have shown interest in our 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.099
 presentation to the presentation of Alan Tim 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.650
 asked a lot of interesting 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.629
 questions at a press conference after 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.879
 press conferences when discussing 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.230

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.780
 reasonable car 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.690
 recognizes and remembers about a thousand 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.940
 years and uses over a hundred thousand speech 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.099
 modules thanks to the extensive 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.950
 linguistic base around the new 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.959

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.690
 employees i want to say i was in 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.040
 shocked when I found out about and heard about 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.980
 what will be the presentation 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.680
 that the new employee regretted us that I 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.010
 already drew them from the institute come on can 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.570
 being enrolled again i like that

 it is completely domestic 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:53.140
 components are completely our development 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.720
 and accordingly, well, I think that 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.700
 Soon now we have caught up 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.320
 West in my opinion but soon 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.790
 we will overtake him in my opinion for sure 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.050
 But with such a robot, my first 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.700
