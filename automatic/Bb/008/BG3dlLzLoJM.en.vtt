00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.800 
lays down their cards first when you
play<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.370> game<00:03:33.520> you<00:03:33.580> actually<00:03:34.270> want<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.690> go

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
play the game you actually want to go

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.590 
play the game you actually want to go
second<00:03:35.320> because<00:03:35.950> they<00:03:36.459> lay<00:03:36.670> down<00:03:36.880> their<00:03:37.150> cards

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
second because they lay down their cards

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.300 
second because they lay down their cards
but<00:03:37.870> they<00:03:38.020> don't<00:03:38.200> get<00:03:38.320> to<00:03:38.470> attack<00:03:38.800> whoever

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
but they don't get to attack whoever

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.790 
but they don't get to attack whoever
goes<00:03:39.489> first<00:03:39.550> us<00:03:40.000> so<00:03:40.630> when<00:03:40.989> they<00:03:41.140> go<00:03:41.320> first<00:03:41.590> they

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
goes first us so when they go first they

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.560 
goes first us so when they go first they
lay<00:03:41.950> down<00:03:42.130> all<00:03:42.280> their<00:03:42.400> cards<00:03:42.610> so<00:03:43.030> we<00:03:43.209> get<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.450> be

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
lay down all their cards so we get to be

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.150 
lay down all their cards so we get to be
strategic<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.290> lay<00:03:44.500> down<00:03:44.650> our<00:03:44.830> cards

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
strategic and lay down our cards

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.040 
strategic and lay down our cards
wherever<00:03:45.459> we<00:03:45.640> want<00:03:45.880> to<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.330> then<00:03:46.690> we<00:03:46.870> get<00:03:46.989> to

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
wherever we want to and then we get to

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.740 
wherever we want to and then we get to
attack<00:03:47.380> them<00:03:47.620> first<00:03:47.920> so<00:03:48.640> going<00:03:48.940> first<00:03:49.300> is<00:03:49.510> bad

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
attack them first so going first is bad

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.220 
attack them first so going first is bad
you<00:03:50.140> want<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:50.380> go<00:03:50.470> second<00:03:50.890> so<00:03:52.050> basically<00:03:53.050> I'm

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
you want to go second so basically I'm

three<00:05:21.930> which<00:05:22.110> is<00:05:22.139> good<00:05:22.439> so<00:05:22.710> there<00:05:22.860> I<00:05:22.889> got<00:05:23.099> a

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:23.129 
three which is good so there I got a

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:24.709 
three which is good so there I got a
critical<00:05:23.400> so<00:05:23.699> I<00:05:23.729> did<00:05:23.969> extra<00:05:24.300> damage<00:05:24.449> I<00:05:24.689> did

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:30.659 
but yeah so this game is super super

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:33.679 
but yeah so this game is super super
super<00:06:31.139> long<00:06:31.589> every<00:06:32.339> every<00:06:32.729> level<00:06:33.150> has<00:06:33.180> three

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:33.689 
super long every every level has three

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:35.510 
super long every every level has three
stars<00:06:34.050> which<00:06:34.349> are<00:06:34.469> really<00:06:34.740> hard<00:06:34.979> to<00:06:35.099> get<00:06:35.250> and

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
stars which are really hard to get and

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.939 
stars which are really hard to get and
I'm<00:06:36.479> thinking<00:06:37.349> there's<00:06:37.500> going<00:06:37.680> to<00:06:37.740> be<00:06:37.770> at

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
I'm thinking there's going to be at

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:38.890 
I'm thinking there's going to be at
least<00:06:37.979> 100<00:06:38.399> level

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
least 100 level

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.770 
least 100 level
in<00:06:38.990> this<00:06:39.139> game<00:06:39.229> so<00:06:39.710> that's<00:06:40.370> about<00:06:40.520> 300<00:06:41.419> levels

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
in this game so that's about 300 levels

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.760 
in this game so that's about 300 levels
which<00:06:41.990> is<00:06:42.139> a<00:06:42.169> ton<00:06:42.620> so<00:06:44.229> here<00:06:45.229> I'm<00:06:45.380> just<00:06:45.560> kind<00:06:45.740> of

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
which is a ton so here I'm just kind of

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.200 
which is a ton so here I'm just kind of
