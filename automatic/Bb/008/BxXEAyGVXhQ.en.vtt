00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
in let it sit there for a second and

00:03:34.030 --> 00:05:42.490 
in let it sit there for a second and
we'll<00:03:34.360> fired<00:03:34.660> right

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.700 

okay<00:05:43.500> so<00:05:44.400> hopefully<00:05:45.120> the<00:05:45.210> GoPro<00:05:45.690> got<00:05:45.990> that<00:05:46.290> the

okay so hopefully the GoPro got that the

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.490 
okay so hopefully the GoPro got that the
Sun<00:05:46.950> might<00:05:47.160> be<00:05:47.280> in<00:05:47.370> the<00:05:47.430> way<00:05:48.290> hopefully<00:05:49.290> if

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
Sun might be in the way hopefully if

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.020
