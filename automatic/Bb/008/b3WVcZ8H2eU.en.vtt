00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.250 

okay<00:03:46.310> there<00:03:47.310> we<00:03:47.340> go<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:48.750> that's<00:03:48.900> how<00:03:49.050> quick

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260

look at these

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.080 
look at these
so<00:03:52.000> these<00:03:52.569> are<00:03:52.870> the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
so these are the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.290 
so these are the
the<00:03:54.690> coal<00:03:55.319> blocks<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.129> they<00:03:56.819> look<00:03:56.970> quite<00:03:57.120> nice

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
the coal blocks and they look quite nice

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.100 
the coal blocks and they look quite nice
certainly<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:58.050> think<00:03:58.800> it'd<00:03:59.099> look<00:03:59.129> really<00:03:59.220> nice

basically<00:04:01.110> we<00:04:01.709> didn't<00:04:01.920> really<00:04:02.040> have<00:04:02.370> anything

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
basically we didn't really have anything

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.449 
basically we didn't really have anything
like<00:04:03.500> flat<00:04:04.500> out<00:04:04.769> say<00:04:05.069> a<00:04:06.290> what<00:04:07.290> I'm<00:04:07.500> black<00:04:07.830> the

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.839 
like flat out say a what I'm black the
anything<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:08.970> think<00:04:09.330> I<00:04:09.480> really<00:04:09.840> is<00:04:09.900> wolf<00:04:10.849> well

these tools are all tests actually see
if<00:05:28.980> we<00:05:29.040> can<00:05:29.190> chant<00:05:29.520> chant<00:05:30.120> him<00:05:30.300> first<00:05:30.630> got<00:05:31.620> a

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
if we can chant chant him first got a

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.640 
if we can chant chant him first got a
bit<00:05:31.800> level<00:05:32.180> can<00:05:33.180> we<00:05:33.389> all<00:05:34.350> we<00:05:34.530> might<00:05:34.710> be<00:05:35.389> no<00:05:36.650> so

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
bit level can we all we might be no so

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.150 
bit level can we all we might be no so
you<00:05:37.710> can<00:05:38.220> t<00:05:38.400> chant<00:05:38.700> the<00:05:38.910> tools<00:05:39.470> well<00:05:40.470> maybe

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
you can t chant the tools well maybe

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.760 
you can t chant the tools well maybe
someday<00:05:41.760> you<00:05:41.970> will<00:05:42.210> be<00:05:42.389> able<00:05:42.480> to

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
someday you will be able to

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:50.439 
someday you will be able to
but<00:05:44.310> at<00:05:44.520> the<00:05:44.699> moment<00:05:44.819> you<00:05:45.720> can't<00:05:47.870> let<00:05:48.889> FM<00:05:49.889> the

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
but at the moment you can't let FM the

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.110 
but at the moment you can't let FM the
mod<00:05:51.449> maker<00:05:51.810> is<00:05:52.199> watching<00:05:52.800> this<00:05:52.949> keep<00:05:53.849> that<00:05:53.970> in

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
mod maker is watching this keep that in

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.850 
mod maker is watching this keep that in
mind<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:54.990> that<00:05:55.470> would<00:05:55.979> be<00:05:56.009> amazing<00:05:56.599> okay<00:05:57.599> so

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
mind and that would be amazing okay so

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.170 
mind and that would be amazing okay so
let's<00:05:58.860> test<00:05:59.009> out<00:05:59.220> all<00:05:59.250> good<00:05:59.610> with<00:05:59.759> tools<00:05:59.970> are

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
let's test out all good with tools are

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.969 
let's test out all good with tools are
starting<00:06:00.569> would<00:06:00.750> be<00:06:01.020> ox<00:06:01.970> okay<00:06:02.970> hey<00:06:03.870> so<00:06:03.930> to<00:06:04.800> meet

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
starting would be ox okay hey so to meet

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.420 
starting would be ox okay hey so to meet
a<00:06:05.009> bit<00:06:05.310> like<00:06:05.490> like<00:06:06.210> I<00:06:06.690> know<00:06:07.069> bit<00:06:08.069> worse<00:06:08.250> than

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
a bit like like I know bit worse than

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.089 
a bit like like I know bit worse than
dying<00:06:08.520> maybe<00:06:09.270> off<00:06:09.629> same<00:06:10.020> as<00:06:10.169> I<00:06:10.259> I<00:06:10.560> don't<00:06:10.979> really

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
dying maybe off same as I I don't really

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:17.070 
dying maybe off same as I I don't really
use<00:06:11.340> our<00:06:11.520> tools<00:06:11.729> not<00:06:11.940> much<00:06:12.830> which<00:06:13.909> okay

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.399 

so<00:06:17.770> yeah<00:06:18.129> they're<00:06:18.639> pretty<00:06:18.970> much<00:06:19.150> bit<00:06:19.900> worse<00:06:20.110> 9

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409 
so yeah they're pretty much bit worse 9

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:23.969 
so yeah they're pretty much bit worse 9
i'll<00:06:20.710> say<00:06:20.949> this<00:06:21.159> axis<00:06:22.409> mines<00:06:23.409> me<00:06:23.590> onto<00:06:23.860> for

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
i'll say this axis mines me onto for

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:30.890 
i'll say this axis mines me onto for
speed<00:06:26.550> Michael<00:06:27.550> test<00:06:27.789> stayed<00:06:28.270> now<00:06:29.610> yesterday

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
speed Michael test stayed now yesterday

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.760 
speed Michael test stayed now yesterday
again<00:06:31.900> um<00:06:32.169> I'd<00:06:33.069> say<00:06:33.490> in<00:06:33.729> between<00:06:34.770> ironstone
