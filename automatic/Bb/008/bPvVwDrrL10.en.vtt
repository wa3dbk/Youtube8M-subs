00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.590 

all<00:00:01.290> right<00:00:01.560> animation<00:00:02.220> so<00:00:03.120> we're<00:00:03.270> going<00:00:03.389> to<00:00:03.449> do

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
all right animation so we're going to do

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.019 
all right animation so we're going to do
two<00:00:03.990> kinds<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.529> animation<00:00:05.100> one<00:00:05.400> is<00:00:05.609> controlled

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
two kinds of animation one is controlled

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.379 
two kinds of animation one is controlled
by<00:00:06.120> hand<00:00:06.569> one<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.109> controlled<00:00:07.500> by<00:00:07.560> computer

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
by hand one is controlled by computer

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.570 
by hand one is controlled by computer
let's<00:00:09.389> do<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.750> control<00:00:10.290> by<00:00:10.500> computer<00:00:11.280> part

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
let's do the control by computer part

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.770 
let's do the control by computer part
first<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.719> what<00:00:13.019> happens<00:00:13.410> here<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:14.780> have

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
first so what happens here is I have

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.390 
first so what happens here is I have
hierarchy<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.369> want<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.730> take<00:00:17.940> all<00:00:18.210> my

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
hierarchy and I want to take all my

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.609 
hierarchy and I want to take all my
joints<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.750> take<00:00:21.750> those<00:00:21.900> joints<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.439> turn

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
joints and take those joints and turn

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.290 
joints and take those joints and turn
them<00:00:22.830> into<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.160> character<00:00:24.560> and<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:26.300> character

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
them into a character and that character

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.370 
them into a character and that character
is<00:00:27.390> going<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.689> called<00:00:27.840> crane<00:00:33.320> now<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
is going to be called crane now the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.530 
is going to be called crane now the
reason<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.280> because<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.270> not

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
reason I do that is because I do not

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.869 
reason I do that is because I do not
want<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:37.050> key<00:00:37.500> every<00:00:37.890> component<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.579> would

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
want to key every component that would

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.119 
want to key every component that would
be<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> pain<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:40.200> rather<00:00:40.410> than<00:00:40.620> key<00:00:40.860> every

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
be a pain so rather than key every

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.970 
be a pain so rather than key every
component<00:00:42.050> turning<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.170> into<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.410> character

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
component turning it into a character

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.540 
component turning it into a character
will<00:00:44.579> allow<00:00:44.820> me<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.350> key<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.379> character<00:00:47.280> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
will allow me to key the character and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.459 
will allow me to key the character and
then<00:00:47.789> all<00:00:48.000> everything<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.870> falls<00:00:49.079> under<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
then all everything that falls under the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.990 
then all everything that falls under the
character<00:00:49.950> which<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:50.670> these<00:00:50.850> bones<00:00:51.620> will

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
character which is all these bones will

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.869 
character which is all these bones will
basically<00:00:54.649> animate<00:00:55.649> based<00:00:56.070> upon<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.399> so

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
basically animate based upon that so

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.959 
basically animate based upon that so
you'll<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.600> how<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:58.680> got<00:00:58.829> kradin<00:00:59.340> one<00:00:59.550> here

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
you'll see how we got kradin one here

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.229 
you'll see how we got kradin one here
and<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> hundred<00:01:02.370> frame<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.850> i<00:01:02.879> typed<00:01:03.149> in

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
and I have a hundred frame so i typed in

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.320 
and I have a hundred frame so i typed in
100<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.840> i<00:01:03.870> went<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.320> 100<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.580> what<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.060> want<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
100 and i went to 100 so what I want to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.330 
100 and i went to 100 so what I want to
do<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.510> make<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> self<00:01:07.860> test<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.840> robot<00:01:09.840> arm

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
do is make a self test for the robot arm

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.130 
do is make a self test for the robot arm
thing<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.700> actually<00:01:11.880> turn<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.479> when<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.930> turns

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
thing to actually turn on when it turns

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.520 
thing to actually turn on when it turns
on<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.560> does<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.040> initialization<00:01:14.670> phase<00:01:15.530> so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
on it does this initialization phase so

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.679 
on it does this initialization phase so
it<00:01:16.770> might<00:01:16.920> do<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.549> test<00:01:18.030> at<00:01:18.210> several<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
it might do a test at several of the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.499 
it might do a test at several of the
joints<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> might<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> firing<00:01:21.000> thing<00:01:21.240> it

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
joints it might do a firing thing it

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.010 
joints it might do a firing thing it
might<00:01:21.630> rotate<00:01:21.960> around<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.340> rotate<00:01:23.759> back

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
might rotate around and then rotate back

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.780 
might rotate around and then rotate back
that's<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.350> key<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.710> want<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.040> make<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.189> into

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
that's the key I want to make this into

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.429 
that's the key I want to make this into
a<00:01:26.820> loop<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:28.670> since<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:29.820> not<00:01:30.030> using<00:01:30.439> tracks

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
a loop so since I'm not using tracks

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.289 
a loop so since I'm not using tracks
editor<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.189> all<00:01:32.460> if<00:01:32.700> you're<00:01:32.880> familiar<00:01:33.000> with

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
editor at all if you're familiar with

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.210 
editor at all if you're familiar with
tracks<00:01:33.600> editor<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.409> would<00:01:34.560> know<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.950> s

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
tracks editor you would know that the s

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.359 
tracks editor you would know that the s
key<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.820> bad<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:37.020> I'm<00:01:37.470> not<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.189> using

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
key is bad so I'm not going to be using

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.289 
key is bad so I'm not going to be using
it<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.850> track<00:01:39.210> center<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.930> S<00:01:40.049> key<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.409> okay

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
it in track center so the S key is okay

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.480 
it in track center so the S key is okay
an<00:01:42.860> esky<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:43.979> set<00:01:44.280> driven<00:01:44.520> key<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.259> right<00:01:46.259> now

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
an esky is set driven key so right now

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.100 
an esky is set driven key so right now
by<00:01:47.490> highlighting<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.390> these<00:01:48.570> bones<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
by highlighting all these bones and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.940 
by highlighting all these bones and
going<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.470> one<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.640> s<00:01:51.409> then<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.680> go<00:01:52.860> over

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
going to one I can s then I can go over

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.149 
going to one I can s then I can go over
here<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.399> hit<00:01:53.759> s<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.560> there<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:55.680> go<00:01:55.710> now<00:01:56.130> I

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
here and hit s and there we go now I

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.730 
here and hit s and there we go now I
have<00:01:57.770> basically<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:59.310> phase<00:02:00.090> at<00:02:00.990> which<00:02:01.229> this

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
have basically a phase at which this

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.280 
have basically a phase at which this
will<00:02:01.979> loop<00:02:02.509> what<00:02:03.509> happens<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.020> middle

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
will loop what happens in the middle

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.249 
will loop what happens in the middle
here<00:02:04.469> well<00:02:05.479> let's<00:02:06.479> say<00:02:06.750> at<00:02:07.700> one<00:02:08.700> point<00:02:09.259> it

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
here well let's say at one point it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.940 
here well let's say at one point it
rotates<00:02:10.800> around

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
rotates around

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:21.290 
rotates around
to<00:02:12.190> do<00:02:12.370> that

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.060 

notice<00:02:22.300> auto<00:02:22.570> key<00:02:22.870> is<00:02:23.020> on<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:23.590> this<00:02:23.770> is<00:02:23.800> what

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
notice auto key is on so this is what

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:34.260 
notice auto key is on so this is what
happens<00:02:31.020> okay<00:02:32.020> good<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.760> would<00:02:33.910> think<00:02:34.120> that

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
happens okay good and I would think that

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.110 
happens okay good and I would think that
an<00:02:34.780> initialization<00:02:35.410> phase<00:02:36.040> would<00:02:36.430> start<00:02:38.070> also

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
an initialization phase would start also

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.680 
an initialization phase would start also
by<00:02:40.120> taking<00:02:40.960> and<00:02:41.730> maybe<00:02:42.730> moving<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.300> few<00:02:43.480> of<00:02:43.600> the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
by taking and maybe moving a few of the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.350 
by taking and maybe moving a few of the
aspects<00:02:44.200> around<00:02:44.640> now<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.670> want<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.240> look

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
aspects around now I want that to look

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.180 
aspects around now I want that to look
kind<00:02:46.570> of<00:02:46.630> cool<00:02:46.840> because<00:02:47.140> what<00:02:47.620> will<00:02:47.680> happen<00:02:47.740> is

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
kind of cool because what will happen is

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.790 
kind of cool because what will happen is
if<00:02:48.400> it's<00:02:49.180> rotating<00:02:49.930> like<00:02:50.110> this<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.680> then

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
if it's rotating like this and then

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.780 
if it's rotating like this and then
rotating<00:02:51.460> back<00:02:51.760> that's<00:02:53.190> one<00:02:54.190> thing<00:02:54.280> animation

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
rotating back that's one thing animation

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.760 
rotating back that's one thing animation
now<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:54.970> would<00:02:55.330> say<00:02:55.570> add<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.900> few<00:02:56.500> more<00:02:56.560> frames

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
now I would say add a few more frames

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.230 
now I would say add a few more frames
since<00:02:59.770> this<00:02:59.920> is<00:02:59.980> just<00:03:00.340> going<00:03:00.490> to<00:03:00.580> be<00:03:00.640> one<00:03:00.970> big

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
since this is just going to be one big

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.590 
since this is just going to be one big
animation<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:02.080> initialization<00:03:03.600> anything

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
animation of initialization anything

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.630 
animation of initialization anything
after<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.080> 100<00:03:05.500> frames<00:03:05.710> should<00:03:05.890> be<00:03:06.220> stuff

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
after the 100 frames should be stuff

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:33.970 
after the 100 frames should be stuff
like<00:03:06.880> maybe<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:07.870> tips<00:03:08.230> back<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.770> forth

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:46.649 

okay<00:03:34.580> there<00:03:34.970> we<00:03:35.120> go<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.569> then<00:03:38.260> maybe<00:03:41.560> back

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:04:01.360 

down<00:03:47.659> up<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:55.360> then<00:03:56.360> back<00:03:59.739> okay<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:00.799> let's<00:04:01.129> play

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
down up and then back okay so let's play

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:22.390 
down up and then back okay so let's play
that<00:04:01.400> see<00:04:01.849> what<00:04:02.000> it<00:04:02.060> looks<00:04:02.180> like

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.340 

all<00:04:23.060> right<00:04:23.180> now<00:04:23.360> if<00:04:23.600> we<00:04:23.750> wanted<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.169> get

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
all right now if we wanted to get

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.730 
all right now if we wanted to get
everything<00:04:24.889> back<00:04:25.130> into<00:04:25.430> a<00:04:25.580> loop<00:04:26.080> what<00:04:27.080> we<00:04:27.259> we

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
everything back into a loop what we we

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.189 
everything back into a loop what we we
could<00:04:27.919> do<00:04:28.220> here<00:04:28.250> is<00:04:28.729> add<00:04:29.509> Oh<00:04:30.789> probably<00:04:31.789> about

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
could do here is add Oh probably about

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:40.540 
could do here is add Oh probably about
220<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:37.280> then<00:04:37.699> take<00:04:38.030> this<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:39.680> copy<00:04:40.039> it<00:04:40.310> and

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
220 and then take this and copy it and

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.770 
220 and then take this and copy it and
paste<00:04:41.919> it<00:04:42.919> here<00:04:45.820> okay<00:04:46.820> so<00:04:46.880> there<00:04:47.210> we<00:04:47.240> go<00:04:47.360> let's

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
paste it here okay so there we go let's

00:04:47.780 --> 00:05:00.959 
paste it here okay so there we go let's
see<00:04:47.990> what<00:04:48.139> happened

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:00.969 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:05.399 

very<00:05:01.509> nice<00:05:01.860> so<00:05:03.089> you<00:05:04.089> should<00:05:04.329> make<00:05:04.659> loops<00:05:05.019> when

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
very nice so you should make loops when

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.350 
very nice so you should make loops when
it<00:05:05.529> comes<00:05:05.709> to<00:05:05.889> animation<00:05:06.519> they<00:05:06.729> just<00:05:06.939> turn<00:05:07.209> out

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
it comes to animation they just turn out

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.229 
it comes to animation they just turn out
so<00:05:07.599> much<00:05:07.749> smoother<00:05:08.339> if<00:05:09.339> it<00:05:09.579> specially<00:05:09.999> if<00:05:10.059> it's

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:10.239 
so much smoother if it specially if it's

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:12.719 
so much smoother if it specially if it's
an<00:05:10.329> idle<00:05:10.659> position<00:05:10.749> now<00:05:11.199> I'll<00:05:11.769> loop<00:05:12.159> would<00:05:12.549> be

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
an idle position now I'll loop would be

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.639 
an idle position now I'll loop would be
considered<00:05:13.299> you<00:05:13.959> know<00:05:14.049> something<00:05:14.469> like<00:05:14.619> a

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:14.649 
considered you know something like a

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:18.089 
considered you know something like a
walk<00:05:15.009> cycle<00:05:15.489> is<00:05:15.669> a<00:05:15.699> loop<00:05:15.999> this<00:05:16.599> is<00:05:16.809> a<00:05:16.839> loop<00:05:17.139> you

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
walk cycle is a loop this is a loop you

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.519 
walk cycle is a loop this is a loop you
know<00:05:18.249> a<00:05:18.519> thing<00:05:18.879> that<00:05:18.939> goes<00:05:19.599> from<00:05:19.989> an

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:20.529 
know a thing that goes from an

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:24.839 
know a thing that goes from an
initialization<00:05:21.009> stage<00:05:21.759> of<00:05:22.169> 0<00:05:23.169> to<00:05:23.699> 220<00:05:24.699> and

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
initialization stage of 0 to 220 and

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.359 
initialization stage of 0 to 220 and
then<00:05:25.449> if<00:05:25.839> I<00:05:26.049> wanted<00:05:26.379> to<00:05:26.439> play<00:05:26.679> it<00:05:26.799> again<00:05:27.069> it

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:27.369 
then if I wanted to play it again it

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.899 
then if I wanted to play it again it
doesn't<00:05:27.999> tweak<00:05:28.419> and<00:05:28.769> if<00:05:29.769> it<00:05:29.919> doesn't<00:05:30.369> loop

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909 
doesn't tweak and if it doesn't loop

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:32.549 
doesn't tweak and if it doesn't loop
correctly<00:05:31.599> it'll<00:05:32.110> look<00:05:32.259> like<00:05:32.499> it's

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:32.559 
correctly it'll look like it's

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:35.699 
correctly it'll look like it's
flickering<00:05:33.459> at<00:05:33.789> one<00:05:34.149> point<00:05:34.449> in<00:05:34.719> the<00:05:34.839> game<00:05:34.869> so

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:35.709 
flickering at one point in the game so

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:37.679 
flickering at one point in the game so
you<00:05:35.769> don't<00:05:36.249> want<00:05:36.519> that<00:05:36.699> to<00:05:36.849> happen<00:05:36.879> that's<00:05:37.509> why

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:37.689 
you don't want that to happen that's why

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.769 
you don't want that to happen that's why
loops<00:05:37.929> are<00:05:38.110> so<00:05:38.259> important<00:05:39.569> alright<00:05:40.569> now<00:05:40.719> that

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
loops are so important alright now that

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.439 
loops are so important alright now that
we<00:05:41.049> have<00:05:41.079> the<00:05:41.379> animation<00:05:42.069> sequence<00:05:42.639> in<00:05:42.879> there

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
we have the animation sequence in there

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.539 
we have the animation sequence in there
it's<00:05:43.659> a<00:05:43.779> small<00:05:44.019> simple<00:05:44.409> sequence<00:05:44.889> but<00:05:45.189> keep<00:05:45.399> it

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:45.549 
it's a small simple sequence but keep it

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:48.929 
it's a small simple sequence but keep it
simple<00:05:46.379> what<00:05:47.379> we<00:05:47.499> want<00:05:47.709> to<00:05:47.769> do<00:05:47.919> is<00:05:48.159> export<00:05:48.729> this

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:48.939 
simple what we want to do is export this

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:51.509 
simple what we want to do is export this
selection<00:05:49.360> or<00:05:49.809> export<00:05:50.319> also<00:05:50.799> export<00:05:51.219> all<00:05:51.339> to

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:51.519 
selection or export also export all to

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:53.189 
selection or export also export all to
be<00:05:51.610> safe<00:05:51.879> since<00:05:52.299> this<00:05:52.419> is<00:05:52.479> the<00:05:52.569> only<00:05:52.659> thing<00:05:53.079> in

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
be safe since this is the only thing in

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:58.319 
be safe since this is the only thing in
the<00:05:53.289> scene<00:05:53.909> and<00:05:55.409> for<00:05:56.409> the<00:05:56.979> export<00:05:57.549> all<00:05:57.759> I<00:05:58.029> want

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:58.329 
the scene and for the export all I want

00:05:58.329 --> 00:06:01.199 
the scene and for the export all I want
to<00:05:58.389> put<00:05:58.569> this<00:05:58.719> within<00:05:59.169> the<00:05:59.739> obj<00:06:00.699> directory

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:01.209 
to put this within the obj directory

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:10.829 
to put this within the obj directory
let's<00:06:01.599> see<00:06:01.749> you<00:06:01.899> here<00:06:02.669> shared<00:06:05.069> in<00:06:06.069> d<00:06:09.569> i'm<00:06:10.569> going

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:10.839 
let's see you here shared in d i'm going

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:24.470 
let's see you here shared in d i'm going
to<00:06:10.899> add<00:06:11.050> to<00:06:11.379> my<00:06:11.409> rotate<00:06:11.949> tool

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.900 

all<00:06:25.020> right<00:06:25.200> now<00:06:25.470> there's<00:06:25.950> two<00:06:26.430> things<00:06:26.700> you

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
all right now there's two things you

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.380 
all right now there's two things you
have<00:06:27.120> to<00:06:27.270> know<00:06:27.330> FBX<00:06:28.200> fex<00:06:29.190> is<00:06:29.400> the<00:06:29.700> native

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
have to know FBX fex is the native

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.630 
have to know FBX fex is the native
format<00:06:31.020> that<00:06:31.320> handles<00:06:31.680> animation<00:06:32.250> so<00:06:32.460> if<00:06:32.550> you

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
format that handles animation so if you

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.370 
format that handles animation so if you
found<00:06:32.790> yourself<00:06:33.210> a<00:06:33.300> program<00:06:33.690> that<00:06:33.900> exports

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
found yourself a program that exports

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.940 
found yourself a program that exports
FBX<00:06:34.860> you'll<00:06:35.580> be<00:06:35.700> all<00:06:35.880> set<00:06:36.500> does<00:06:37.500> it<00:06:37.650> have<00:06:37.770> to<00:06:37.800> be

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
FBX you'll be all set does it have to be

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.190 
FBX you'll be all set does it have to be
FTX<00:06:38.430> not<00:06:38.970> sure<00:06:39.210> about<00:06:39.360> that<00:06:39.600> I've<00:06:39.780> used<00:06:39.810> Maya

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
FTX not sure about that I've used Maya

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.200 
FTX not sure about that I've used Maya
so<00:06:40.530> long<00:06:40.770> that<00:06:41.100> I<00:06:41.370> would<00:06:41.970> say<00:06:42.180> that<00:06:42.600> the<00:06:42.780> FBX<00:06:43.320> I

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
so long that I would say that the FBX I

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.910 
so long that I would say that the FBX I
think<00:06:45.210> is<00:06:45.300> also<00:06:45.570> in<00:06:45.900> 3d<00:06:46.260> studio<00:06:46.470> max<00:06:48.170> FBX<00:06:49.170> now<00:06:49.890> I

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:49.920 
think is also in 3d studio max FBX now I

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.880 
think is also in 3d studio max FBX now I
labeled<00:06:50.550> it<00:06:50.640> widget<00:06:51.240> FBX<00:06:52.130> period<00:06:53.270> FBX<00:06:54.270> I<00:06:54.890> do

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890 
labeled it widget FBX period FBX I do

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.940 
labeled it widget FBX period FBX I do
that<00:06:56.130> because<00:06:56.420> unity<00:06:57.420> will<00:06:57.570> see<00:06:57.840> the<00:06:58.110> Maya

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
that because unity will see the Maya

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.280 
that because unity will see the Maya
file<00:06:59.310> also<00:07:00.050> and<00:07:02.300> here<00:07:03.300> I<00:07:03.450> want<00:07:03.690> to<00:07:03.810> bump<00:07:04.140> this

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
file also and here I want to bump this

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.560 
file also and here I want to bump this
up<00:07:04.470> two<00:07:04.800> millimeters<00:07:05.760> because<00:07:06.210> i<00:07:06.300> want<00:07:06.450> the

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
up two millimeters because i want the

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:13.850 
up two millimeters because i want the
scale<00:07:06.810> factor<00:07:07.020> a<00:07:07.230> little<00:07:07.500> higher<00:07:12.320> and<00:07:13.320> there

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
scale factor a little higher and there

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.350 
scale factor a little higher and there
we<00:07:13.980> go<00:07:14.070> so<00:07:14.970> now<00:07:15.000> in<00:07:15.420> the<00:07:16.020> next<00:07:16.970> movie<00:07:17.970> what

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
we go so now in the next movie what

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.150 
we go so now in the next movie what
we're<00:07:18.510> going<00:07:18.660> to<00:07:18.810> do<00:07:18.960> is<00:07:19.170> bring<00:07:19.560> it<00:07:19.710> into<00:07:19.920> the

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 
we're going to do is bring it into the

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.460 
we're going to do is bring it into the
engine<00:07:20.600> and<00:07:21.600> play<00:07:21.900> around<00:07:22.170> with<00:07:22.350> the

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:22.470 
engine and play around with the

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.980
