this<00:01:23.430> would<00:01:23.580> probably<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.240> perfect

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
this would probably be the perfect

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.940 
this would probably be the perfect
tablet<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.080> those<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.530> want<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.830> do

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
tablet for those of you that want to do

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.340 
tablet for those of you that want to do
more<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.030> consume<00:01:27.420> content<00:01:27.869> with<00:01:28.259> your

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
more but just consume content with your

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.499 
more but just consume content with your
tablet<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.369> again<00:01:29.700> these<00:01:30.000> tablets<00:01:30.390> have

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
tablet so again these tablets have

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.999 
tablet so again these tablets have
existed<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.350> many<00:01:31.470> years<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.950> they

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
existed for so many years and they

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.710 
existed for so many years and they
haven't<00:01:32.280> taken<00:01:32.430> off<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.939> such<00:01:33.390> was<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> case

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
haven't taken off and such was the case

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.899 
haven't taken off and such was the case
last<00:01:33.930> year<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.590> obviously<00:01:35.250> that's<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> reason

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
last year so obviously that's the reason

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.179 
last year so obviously that's the reason
why<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.090> gets<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> third<00:01:36.570> spot<00:01:36.840> number<00:01:37.770> two<00:01:38.009> is

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
why it gets the third spot number two is

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.980 
why it gets the third spot number two is
the<00:01:38.340> google<00:01:38.610> nexus<00:01:38.820> 7<00:01:39.390> probably<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.869> the

the google nexus 7 probably one of the

for those of you that actually want to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.620 
for those of you that actually want to
take<00:01:58.770> pictures<00:01:59.009> with<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> tablets<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.030> still

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
take pictures with the tablets and still

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.300 
take pictures with the tablets and still
the<00:02:00.899> only<00:02:01.020> reason<00:02:01.439> why<00:02:01.560> it's<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:01.920> at<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> top

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the only reason why it's not at the top

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.010 
the only reason why it's not at the top
is<00:02:02.520> because<00:02:02.850> obviously<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.360> specifications

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
is because obviously the specifications

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.109 
is because obviously the specifications
of<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.140> Nexus<00:02:04.469> 7<00:02:04.740> are<00:02:05.040> not<00:02:05.250> always<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.969> best

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
of the Nexus 7 are not always the best

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.330 
of the Nexus 7 are not always the best
and<00:02:06.600> finally<00:02:07.409> for<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> top<00:02:07.829> number<00:02:08.039> one

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
and finally for the top number one

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.059 
and finally for the top number one
tablet<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.000> fall<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.539> 2013<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> ipad

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
and it is for a reason what really goes

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.310 
and it is for a reason what really goes
far<00:02:17.220> when<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.180> comes<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.510> design<00:02:18.840> aside<00:02:19.230> from

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
far when it comes to design aside from

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.960 
far when it comes to design aside from
the<00:02:19.500> fact<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.770> it's<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> best<00:02:20.250> ecosystem

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
the fact that it's the best ecosystem

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.400 
the fact that it's the best ecosystem
it's<00:02:21.330> probably<00:02:21.510> one<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.870> best<00:02:22.050> displays

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
it's probably one of the best displays

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.600 
it's probably one of the best displays
in<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.620> market<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.040> got<00:02:23.160> great<00:02:23.370> battery

life great performance overall and

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.170 
life great performance overall and
really<00:02:26.130> for<00:02:26.280> those<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.850> want<00:02:26.910> a

tablet for what most people want to
tablet<00:02:28.980> which<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.250> really<00:02:29.430> just<00:02:29.610> content

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
tablet which is really just content

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.420 
tablet which is really just content
consumption<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.990> ipad<00:02:31.350> air<00:02:31.560> can't<00:02:31.920> be<00:02:32.100> beat

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
consumption the ipad air can't be beat

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.640 
consumption the ipad air can't be beat
obviously<00:02:33.240> its<00:02:33.360> price<00:02:33.630> tag<00:02:33.930> could<00:02:34.260> be<00:02:34.380> better

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
obviously its price tag could be better

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.870 
obviously its price tag could be better
but<00:02:34.740> then<00:02:34.980> again<00:02:35.070> when<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.400> think<00:02:35.550> about<00:02:35.610> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
but then again when you think about the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.280 
but then again when you think about the
fact<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.330> probably<00:02:36.600> better<00:02:36.870> designed

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
fact that it's probably better designed

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.600 
fact that it's probably better designed
that<00:02:37.440> every<00:02:37.590> other<00:02:37.710> tablet<00:02:38.100> out<00:02:38.220> there<00:02:38.460> at

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
that every other tablet out there at

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.270 
that every other tablet out there at
just<00:02:39.060> one<00:02:39.450> pound<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:40.050> weight<00:02:40.260> everyone<00:02:40.980> really

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
just one pound of weight everyone really

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.860 
just one pound of weight everyone really
nail<00:02:41.490> is<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.790> reason<00:02:42.180> why<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.390> would<00:02:42.600> want<00:02:42.630> to

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
nail is the reason why you would want to

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.870 
nail is the reason why you would want to
have<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.290> but<00:02:43.440> still<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.370> leads<00:02:44.580> me<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.790> the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
have it but still that leads me to the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.940 
have it but still that leads me to the
question<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.240> this<00:02:45.360> top<00:02:45.600> five<00:02:45.870> which<00:02:46.710> would<00:02:46.920> be

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
question of this top five which would be

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.800 
question of this top five which would be
your<00:02:47.250> top<00:02:47.310> number<00:02:47.820> one<00:02:47.940> tablet<00:02:48.210> which<00:02:48.570> would
