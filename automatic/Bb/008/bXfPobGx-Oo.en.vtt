00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.110
 Hey 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.549
 the city and surroundings neighboring countries without water through the club pipeline 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:18.160
 the schools stay close to the hospitals postpone operations 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.269
 water hamsterers to storm supermarkets 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.109
 welcome to this extra broadcast from northern news a part of groningen 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:34.920
 early this morning the water was without water 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.120
 public life was therefore partly halted by hospitals 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.220
 ordered operations and many schools remained close to the city 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.490
 had calluses all the wolden and paterswolde 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.500
 in total around 220,000 people were affected 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.610
 the cause was found for hours 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.150
 the following points are likely when working on the industrial site 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.820
 leadership broken 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.850
 at nine o'clock most people had the water but that is not allowed for the time being 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.160
 to be drunk uncooked 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.890
 it is for many residents of the city the surrounding places are certainly no 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.720
 tour cuts Monday morning 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.460
 no fresh start to the day showering and brushing your teeth is not a problem 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.420
 annoying 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.620
 It said that then we have got together I think we ourselves 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.380
 maybe just lies 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.510
 it soon became apparent that a general problem was prior to doing 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.810
 is 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.100
 as long as its welcome 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.230
 a score below 100 percent yes there was no water I have almost nothing 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.229
 are know to compare our country 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.630
 in the morning without water 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.730
 that is yet to be overcome are serious consequences in hospitals 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.760
 the umcg alone requires 60,000 liters of clean water 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.610
 so when transferring from morgan it's only about that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.880
 soon the knot is cut no operations except the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.630
 emergencies from the beginning thousands will be certain 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.619
 buildings are closed for breathing and especially on music channel 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.619
 office workers are using the side street 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.440
 and further there are therefore very quickly that falls under the police 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.039
 keep the device center closed to save as much as possible 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.239
 such that the emergency admissions can continue as normal 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.840
 meanwhile the authorities are busy in consultation with the crisis center 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.489
 sontweg 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.359
 the water problem is a big mystery 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.999
 and that diligent search for the leak it takes a long time yes I am right on and 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.639
 stand to think thinks there was huge amount of water so you see 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.209
 but it's that simple so it's a very long route to check it out 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.289
 was dark 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:37.809
 it is also not the case that a lot of women offer top-quality storage 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.649
 the topsoil is a part with a lot can also run away it is an area 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:46.120
 where the back entrance of no one was where the pan also hits no one in the 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:47.229
 stand away bye 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:50.429
 why can we in the dark suit that something was wrong 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:53.429
 5 or 8 this morning the leak has still not been found 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:57.929
 but shortly after half past eight the redeeming notice comes out of the leak 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:58.939
 water 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.099
 something may have gone wrong during the construction of a tunnel for rkc 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.159
 water drips from the tap here and there again, but that does not mean that 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.019
 all problems are over 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.599
 what is very important is that everyone got there the curator lasted until after the 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:13.649
 Hurricane 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:18.959
 water must boil before you start we have a really tough job it goes 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.869
 prescription in this country 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:25.559
 In this way, you can take the transition from a risk-free period to a not too long time 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.749
 to close cooking before you talk about anyway especially according to explanations 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:30.969
 can slip some 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.969
 we or in whatever way so that may come 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.929
 in addition, a better so not entirely sure whether the bacteriological quality 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:40.929
 yet it is from what that what we think it should be 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.759
 the fashionable and two things some cooking advice the ford mustang 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.229
 Secondly, we have not regained a slight growth 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.189
 we deployed and indicates steam point 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.870
 that's just a little bit different 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.439
 it tastes a little different 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.939
 in the meantime, many students have an extra day off 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.919
 Many schools go close to the US beforehand which is primarily that 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.299
 the primary needs are aimed at people must still be able to go to a toilet 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.299
 suggest they have surfaced 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.420
 well then it can also not one inside not safe nor now the leak found 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.569
 is in the busy he defies the lead all charity must be linked 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.699
 so before the situation is completely acceptable again, it is good and then again 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:20.959
 just halfway through the day 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.870
 so it makes no sense to have these as guests at the table 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.180
 in the course of the morning he must arrive at the first water cars 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.340
 two tankers per hour must ensure that the reserve stock opel 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.900
 remains 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.220
 well relief so once the leak was found 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.930
 after a long search, the water company came to work on the next one 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.800
 tranche sea 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.710
 there has probably gone wrong 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.470
 the leak was discovered at the kieler bend in the industrial area 3bond along the 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.139
 eastern ring road 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.530
 under the great interest of the press especially employees of the water company 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.659
 pool height this morning 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.269
 the leak was caused by the work on the euvelgunnetrace 

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:01.749
 sea ​​it is still unclear unknown 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:03.610
 utrecht 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.069
 committee to be investigated 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.809
 the most important thing is that we can provide value again 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.679
 employees of the water company immediately closed the broken overhead line 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.969
 the euvelgunnetrace sea is intended as an access road for the future 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:18.680
 Meerstadt residential area 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.800
 water pipe may have broken because part of the trusses has sagged 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.600
 so that must have been much set up between that could 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.030
 to prevent 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.589
 that reports the results 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:31.589
 nevertheless have been what made the pipes lie 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:36.089
 Failed research must now show exactly how the leak originated 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.419
 in the supermarkets this morning soon a back on bottled water walter 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.339
 before the opening, some people thought driving like that 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:48.479
 and once the doors also appreciated, the water ran out quickly 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.150
 raspberries 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.150
 this effect 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.900
 I think federer 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.249
 lots of water birds 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:08.249
 shot has been made 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:12.689
 cholera is disturbed what a coward will get back to work 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:18.259
 the reduced addition 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.379
 hellas 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:24.379
 the last time that all goes out 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:44.519

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:47.930
