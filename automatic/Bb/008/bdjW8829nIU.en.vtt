00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:08.790
 welcome to the short comparison of the htc 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.730
 evo mini2 with the motorola moto gp engine 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.130
 of the 470 or hat 200 euros available each 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.750
 after to lte lte with or without with 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.820
 but I want to put you to her heart 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.050
 because there we have a micro sd 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.490
 cards memory solution in it means her 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.890
 could expand in internal memory 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.529
 if you have a 4.5 inch cell phones 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.960
 touchscreen display android kitkat 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.929
 installed good front and back camera 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.989
 but at htc 13 more pixels here 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.280
 only 5 and only one wg 5 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.370
 megapixel camera so whose the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.829
 main differences at htc and at 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.120
 motorola we sink that she had to 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.649
 I always upstairs is called me 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.300
 had to be able to reach with his finger 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.250
 is not easy because the cell phone 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.180
 is relatively long we can see 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.940
 if we'll just turn it on soon 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.050
 entertained and motorola here one 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.570
 a little bit more practical 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.600
 get to the button on the side 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.370
 we can both see beautiful 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.370
 Displays with the android buttons on the front 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.379
 on it on display so we have 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.909
 no space for the customer 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.619
 exploit and the same with htc 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.360
 not for that we have two speakers 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.340
 in there with ground sound we come so well 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.619
 but the processor is right in 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.619
 both exactly the same with one 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.509
 snapdragon 400 we are both real ones 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.390
 very fast, we also have each one 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.070
 actually in there and can be good here 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.119
 I was both the cameras 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.409
 and then we'll take a look here 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.939
 the quality 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.530
 Of course , a 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.110
 no longer keep up 13 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.610
 however, it does seem a bit 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.170
 run smoother at the motto corpse 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.280
 if I just sway like that 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.500
 but actually the most 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.180
 Scenarios do not make much sense because you stop 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.470
 then hand rather still and 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.090
 tries to take a picture silently 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.829
 and now , both of them were just shooting 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.810
 the camera here and already is the 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.000
 Service quality to the course, of course 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.090
 the htc is much better with full-hd 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.399
 went only a video camera or a 1.3 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.990
 megapixel camera but also here the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.030
 quality a bit faster at that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.500
 Motorola, of course, has less there 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.750
 be calculated and we have too 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.530
 many more effects and options for 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.540
 to adjust 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.220
 but that you can actually also 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.099
 certain apps like instagram or something 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.660
 at the motorola catch up with none 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.830
 Both of us can swap the battery 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.480
 Although we can back off here 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.190
 make and different back on it 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.140
 what do of course with the metal housing 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.480
 not being able to feel here 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.110
 much higher quality but otherwise 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.510
 both very nice devices with similar 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.060
 functions and only one half 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.190
 high price at the motorola and 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.069
 maybe to the htc though both really 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.060
 are very good and then 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.530
 probably a matter of taste 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.599
 which of the two is chosen for that 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.209
 HTC with the metal case bit 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.370
 cameras for still more active user 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.830
 but practical for getting started is one 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.110
 maybe motorola too 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.610
 okay what apps also concerns with the 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.560
 We also have apps here 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.530
 Actually only Google apps installed 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.599
 the at htcs in completely two folders 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.890
 have done here and they have 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.190
 myself still a lot of own apps 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.760
 Polaris Office preinstalled a flash 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.959
 lite voice recorder and so on 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.040
 actually a bit of htc here 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.530
 better prepared, so to speak, or 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.819
 different things facebook was too 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.190
 already with it but two pieces of twitter 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.159
 Here is also missing in the engine again 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.260
 completely so your sound metal case 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.659
 and more app selection 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.849
 here we have original google 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.890
 software so the unchanged 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.620
 google software, so to speak, something 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.019
 smaller device and exchanged stretcher back 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.670
 cover but worse cameras and 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.560
 maybe no christi and no 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.989
 Lte walls and the 170 euro variant 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.190
 chooses the motorola as I said 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.959
 I I really want to, we recommend 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.129
 watched the children that was one 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.819
 short comparison hope you have it 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.129
 like 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.370
 until next time htc was mini2 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.790
 Versys Motorola Moto G for the team 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.790
 have looked
