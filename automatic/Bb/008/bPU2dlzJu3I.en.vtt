yeah that's pretty funny um yeah I and I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
yeah that's pretty funny um yeah I and I
I<00:01:47.729> think<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.300> just<00:01:48.330> it<00:01:48.780> made<00:01:48.959> sense<00:01:49.289> now<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.649> know

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
I think it just it made sense now I know

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.889 
I think it just it made sense now I know
a<00:01:49.920> lot<00:01:50.160> of<00:01:50.220> people<00:01:50.340> said<00:01:50.910> that<00:01:51.209> you<00:01:51.539> know<00:01:51.660> we

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
a lot of people said that you know we

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.410 
a lot of people said that you know we
made<00:01:51.929> absolutely<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:53.399> no<00:01:53.700> sense<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.209> it<00:01:54.300> was

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
made absolutely like no sense and it was

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.870 
made absolutely like no sense and it was
confusing<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.050> stuff<00:01:55.259> um<00:01:55.709> but<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.459> think<00:01:56.759> if

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
confusing and stuff um but I think if

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.900 
confusing and stuff um but I think if
you've<00:01:57.000> seen<00:01:57.270> one<00:01:57.330> two<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.050> three<00:01:58.759> then<00:01:59.759> it

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
you've seen one two and three then it

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.440 
you've seen one two and three then it
makes<00:02:00.060> sense<00:02:00.440> um<00:02:01.440> so<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.700> depends<00:02:03.090> if<00:02:03.270> you've

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
makes sense um so it depends if you've

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.510 
makes sense um so it depends if you've
seen<00:02:03.810> one<00:02:04.200> two<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.619> three<00:02:04.890> um<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.800> special

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
seen one two and three um so the special

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.930 
seen one two and three um so the special
