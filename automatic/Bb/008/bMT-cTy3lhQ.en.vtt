00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
what's wrong with it yet I'm gonna try

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:19.690 
what's wrong with it yet I'm gonna try
to<00:03:18.769> figure<00:03:18.980> it<00:03:19.190> out

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
to figure it out

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.690 
to figure it out
there's<00:03:20.030> not<00:03:20.180> many<00:03:20.390> parts<00:03:20.780> in<00:03:20.959> there<00:03:21.519> just<00:03:22.519> got

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
there's not many parts in there just got

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.160 
there's not many parts in there just got
to<00:03:22.790> get<00:03:22.849> my<00:03:22.910> voltmeter<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:23.569> look<00:03:23.720> at<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.019> see

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
to get my voltmeter and look at it see

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.360 
to get my voltmeter and look at it see
what's<00:03:24.319> going<00:03:24.560> on<00:03:24.650> but<00:03:24.799> anyway<00:03:25.010> that's<00:03:25.160> my

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
what's going on but anyway that's my

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.619 
what's going on but anyway that's my
haul<00:03:25.579> got<00:03:26.269> Thomas<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:26.810> Friends<00:03:28.150> glare<00:03:29.150> there

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
haul got Thomas and Friends glare there

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.990 
haul got Thomas and Friends glare there
and<00:03:31.450> mater<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.829> think<00:03:34.129> that<00:03:34.400> James<00:03:34.700> looks

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
and mater so I think that James looks

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.650 
and mater so I think that James looks
really<00:03:35.239> cool

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
really cool

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.770 
really cool
