if<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:12.010> retain<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:13.360> Flex<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.770> began

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
if you retain the Flex that you began

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.210 
if you retain the Flex that you began
your<00:02:15.460> backswing<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:17.410> your<00:02:17.620> right<00:02:17.830> knee<00:02:18.070> you've

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
your backswing in your right knee you've

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.070 
your backswing in your right knee you've
got<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.670> retain<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.270> flexing<00:02:19.840> your<00:02:19.870> right

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
got to retain that flexing your right

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.220 
got to retain that flexing your right
knee<00:02:20.320> can't<00:02:20.620> have<00:02:20.860> that

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
knee can't have that

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.869 
knee can't have that
rightly<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.709> what<00:02:22.220> we<00:02:22.370> see<00:02:22.580> is<00:02:22.730> that

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
rightly so what we see is that

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.930 
rightly so what we see is that
straightening<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.629> right<00:02:23.900> leg<00:02:24.940> which

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
straightening of the right leg which

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.970 
straightening of the right leg which
then<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.450> turn<00:02:26.510> gets<00:02:26.989> you<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.230> little<00:02:27.590> bit<00:02:27.709> under

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
then in turn gets you a little bit under

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.399 
then in turn gets you a little bit under
plane<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:29.150> we<00:02:29.239> start<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.629> see<00:02:29.659> the<00:02:29.959> club<00:02:30.170> going

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
plane so we start to see the club going

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.390 
plane so we start to see the club going
a<00:02:30.500> little<00:02:30.739> bit<00:02:31.159> too<00:02:31.459> far<00:02:31.760> here<00:02:32.239> we<00:02:32.360> go<00:02:32.599> here

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
a little bit too far here we go here

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.830 
a little bit too far here we go here
inside<00:02:34.400> on<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.790> way<00:02:34.879> back<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.450> club<00:02:35.659> gets

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
inside on the way back so the club gets

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.000 
inside on the way back so the club gets
a<00:02:35.930> long<00:02:36.230> way<00:02:36.470> behind<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:37.040> on<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.340> backswing

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.880 

take<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.099> back<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.549> start<00:02:47.530> okay<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:48.590> what

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
take you back to the start okay so what

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.440 
take you back to the start okay so what
we're<00:02:49.069> noticing<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.849> back<00:02:50.030> so<00:02:50.269> you<00:02:50.329> guys

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
we're noticing on the back so you guys

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.940 
we're noticing on the back so you guys
just<00:02:50.629> bring<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.019> back<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.260> little<00:02:51.379> bit<00:02:51.650> here<00:02:51.860> we

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
just bring it back a little bit here we

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.330 
just bring it back a little bit here we
go<00:02:53.140> okay<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:54.200> we<00:02:54.410> see<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.620> club<00:02:54.799> going<00:02:54.980> much

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
go okay so we see the club going much

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.339 
go okay so we see the club going much
further<00:02:55.579> behind<00:02:55.910> you<00:02:56.269> then<00:02:56.450> we<00:02:56.599> should<00:02:56.810> do<00:02:57.049> and

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
further behind you then we should do and

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.690 
further behind you then we should do and
again<00:02:57.620> that's<00:02:57.799> coming<00:02:58.160> from<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.340> over

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
again that's coming from that over

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.150 
again that's coming from that over
rotation<00:02:59.359> in<00:02:59.690> those<00:02:59.959> hips<00:03:00.349> then<00:03:00.950> on<00:03:01.129> the

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
rotation in those hips then on the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.900 
rotation in those hips then on the
downswing<00:03:01.640> what<00:03:01.910> we<00:03:02.030> see<00:03:03.370> so<00:03:04.370> good<00:03:04.579> terms

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
downswing what we see so good terms

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.309 
downswing what we see so good terms
though<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:05.209> mean<00:03:05.420> it's<00:03:05.540> just<00:03:05.599> got<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.900> calm<00:03:06.140> the

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
though I mean it's just got to calm the

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.800 
though I mean it's just got to calm the
hip<00:03:06.440> turn<00:03:06.650> down<00:03:06.950> basically<00:03:07.609> what<00:03:08.420> we<00:03:08.540> see<00:03:08.690> on

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
hip turn down basically what we see on

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.390 
hip turn down basically what we see on
the<00:03:08.900> downswing<00:03:09.349> is<00:03:09.560> you<00:03:09.650> come<00:03:09.829> in<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.099> hit<00:03:10.280> the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
the downswing is you come in to hit the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.759 
the downswing is you come in to hit the
ball<00:03:12.010> which<00:03:13.010> is<00:03:13.250> here<00:03:13.549> it's<00:03:14.299> not<00:03:14.480> bad<00:03:14.810> recovery

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
ball which is here it's not bad recovery

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.250 
ball which is here it's not bad recovery
hips<00:03:15.980> shoulders<00:03:16.519> are<00:03:16.670> slightly<00:03:17.450> square<00:03:18.079> to

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
hips shoulders are slightly square to

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.869 
hips shoulders are slightly square to
close<00:03:18.530> well<00:03:18.799> they<00:03:18.890> should<00:03:19.099> be<00:03:19.220> a<00:03:19.250> little<00:03:19.579> bit

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
close well they should be a little bit

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.150 
close well they should be a little bit
more<00:03:20.060> open<00:03:20.420> than<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.660> at<00:03:20.810> impact<00:03:21.200> it<00:03:21.890> looked

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
more open than that at impact it looked

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160 
more open than that at impact it looked
towards<00:03:22.489> getting<00:03:22.670> your<00:03:22.910> body<00:03:23.150> opening<00:03:23.989> up

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
towards getting your body opening up

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.930 
towards getting your body opening up
towards<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:24.739> target<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.280> little<00:03:25.609> bit<00:03:25.730> more

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
towards that target a little bit more

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.909 
towards that target a little bit more
through<00:03:26.359> impact<00:03:26.810> if<00:03:27.079> again<00:03:27.349> if<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.620> look<00:03:27.769> at

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
through impact if again if you look at

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.979 
through impact if again if you look at
someone<00:03:28.099> like<00:03:28.220> added<00:03:28.609> me<00:03:28.730> much<00:03:29.299> more<00:03:29.329> rotation

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
someone like added me much more rotation

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.559 
someone like added me much more rotation
in<00:03:30.079> his<00:03:30.200> hips<00:03:30.549> also<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.700> big<00:03:31.880> difference<00:03:32.329> we

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
in his hips also the big difference we

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.409 
in his hips also the big difference we
see<00:03:32.980> is<00:03:33.980> his<00:03:34.310> shoulders<00:03:34.790> are<00:03:34.940> starting<00:03:35.239> to

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
see is his shoulders are starting to

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.589 
see is his shoulders are starting to
open<00:03:35.660> up<00:03:36.049> to<00:03:36.319> his<00:03:36.889> target<00:03:37.819> line<00:03:38.030> where<00:03:38.329> for<00:03:38.480> you

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
open up to his target line where for you

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.210 
open up to his target line where for you
your<00:03:38.810> shoulders<00:03:39.200> are<00:03:39.319> still<00:03:39.530> slightly<00:03:39.829> closed

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
your shoulders are still slightly closed

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.400 
your shoulders are still slightly closed
again<00:03:41.030> this<00:03:41.150> is<00:03:41.299> all<00:03:41.450> coming<00:03:41.660> from<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:42.019> over

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
again this is all coming from that over

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.129 
again this is all coming from that over
rotation<00:03:43.069> on<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.280> backswing<00:03:44.150> so<00:03:44.389> basically

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
rotation on the backswing so basically

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.199 
rotation on the backswing so basically
if<00:03:45.380> you<00:03:45.530> can<00:03:45.680> turn<00:03:45.889> more<00:03:46.190> into<00:03:46.220> a<00:03:46.519> flex<00:03:46.970> right

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
if you can turn more into a flex right

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.970 
if you can turn more into a flex right
knee<00:03:47.450> that<00:03:47.690> economy<00:03:48.109> hip<00:03:48.290> turn<00:03:48.500> down<00:03:48.739> it'll

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
knee that economy hip turn down it'll

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.039 
knee that economy hip turn down it'll
come<00:03:49.130> on<00:03:49.280> your<00:03:49.579> shoulder<00:03:49.940> turn<00:03:50.150> down<00:03:50.419> and<00:03:50.660> it

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
come on your shoulder turn down and it

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.440 
come on your shoulder turn down and it
allow<00:03:51.380> you<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:51.980> get<00:03:52.190> a<00:03:52.400> better<00:03:52.790> get<00:03:53.150> through

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
allow you to get a better get through

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.000 
allow you to get a better get through
the<00:03:53.599> wall<00:03:53.750> bit<00:03:53.930> better<00:03:54.139> in<00:03:54.590> fruit<00:03:54.829> of<00:03:54.950> all

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
the wall bit better in fruit of all

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.289 
the wall bit better in fruit of all
better<00:03:55.280> helps<00:03:55.579> with<00:03:55.700> direction<00:03:56.150> it's

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
better helps with direction it's

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.720 
better helps with direction it's
certainly<00:03:56.569> going<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:56.810> help<00:03:57.049> with<00:03:57.730> strike

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
certainly going to help with strike

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.550 
certainly going to help with strike
getting<00:03:59.359> the<00:03:59.419> ball<00:03:59.569> first<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.109> the<00:04:00.319> ground

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
getting the ball first and the ground

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.640 
getting the ball first and the ground
second<00:04:01.160> I<00:04:01.340> hope<00:04:01.970> that<00:04:02.120> helps<00:04:02.480> not<00:04:03.440> so<00:04:03.560> good
