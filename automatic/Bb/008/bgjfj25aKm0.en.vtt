trying<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:37.060> heal<00:03:37.269> them<00:03:37.510> oftentimes<00:03:37.930> we<00:03:38.440> learn

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
trying to heal them oftentimes we learn

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.640 
trying to heal them oftentimes we learn
to<00:03:38.920> heal<00:03:39.100> ourselves<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:40.780> makes<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.380> huge

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
to heal ourselves so that makes a huge

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.160 
to heal ourselves so that makes a huge
difference<00:03:42.420> or<00:03:43.420> we're<00:03:43.989> also<00:03:44.350> led<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.860> other<00:03:46.170> to

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
difference or we're also led to other to

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.440 
difference or we're also led to other to
other<00:03:47.650> ways<00:03:47.829> of<00:03:48.010> thinking<00:03:48.250> about<00:03:48.549> healing<00:03:49.060> and

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
other ways of thinking about healing and

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
from one little healing session look at

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.120 
from one little healing session look at
the<00:04:16.180> animal<00:04:16.479> I've<00:04:17.349> seen<00:04:17.560> that<00:04:17.680> happen<00:04:17.859> many

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
the animal I've seen that happen many

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.750 
the animal I've seen that happen many
many<00:04:18.549> times<00:04:20.250> you<00:04:21.250> know<00:04:21.370> where<00:04:21.519> you<00:04:21.609> might

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
many times you know where you might

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.159 
many times you know where you might
think<00:04:21.970> you're<00:04:22.060> going<00:04:22.300> one<00:04:22.450> way<00:04:22.479> and<00:04:22.840> it<00:04:22.990> just

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
think you're going one way and it just

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.630 
think you're going one way and it just
opens<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.530> doorway<00:04:23.800> that<00:04:24.010> leads<00:04:24.070> you<00:04:24.340> up<00:04:24.370> a

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
opens the doorway that leads you up a

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.480 
opens the doorway that leads you up a
little<00:04:24.700> different<00:04:25.180> half<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:26.470> I<00:04:26.770> think<00:04:26.890> animals

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
little different half so I think animals

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.180 
little different half so I think animals
are<00:04:27.820> incredible<00:04:28.450> teachers<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.680> healers

are incredible teachers and healers

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.710 
are incredible teachers and healers
themselves<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:31.930> when<00:04:32.200> we<00:04:32.320> listen<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:32.680> them

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
themselves and when we listen to them

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.649 
themselves and when we listen to them
their<00:04:34.720> wisdom<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.349> far<00:04:35.650> beyond<00:04:36.130> most<00:04:37.090> humans

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:37.659 
their wisdom is far beyond most humans

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:40.200 
their wisdom is far beyond most humans
ages<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.200> really<00:04:38.470> do<00:04:38.620> believe<00:04:38.800> that<00:04:39.210> there's

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
ages I really do believe that there's

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.000 
ages I really do believe that there's
something<00:04:40.570> about<00:04:40.780> animals<00:04:41.229> where<00:04:41.470> they<00:04:41.500> are

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
something about animals where they are

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.740 
something about animals where they are
just<00:04:42.310> really<00:04:42.610> really<00:04:42.760> receptive<00:04:43.360> to

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
just really really receptive to

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.350 
just really really receptive to
intervene<00:04:44.169> in<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.590> way<00:04:44.800> than<00:04:45.159> than<00:04:45.729> humans<00:04:46.210> I

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
intervene in a way than than humans I

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.130 
intervene in a way than than humans I
think<00:04:46.599> humans<00:04:46.930> have<00:04:47.169> this<00:04:47.440> natural

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
think humans have this natural

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.190 
think humans have this natural
it's<00:04:49.260> unnatural<00:04:49.860> but<00:04:50.040> have<00:04:50.640> this<00:04:50.820> way<00:04:51.090> of

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
it's unnatural but have this way of

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.290 
it's unnatural but have this way of
putting<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.710> blocks<00:04:53.130> up<00:04:53.490> psychological

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
putting the blocks up psychological

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.950 
putting the blocks up psychological
barriers<00:04:54.870> and<00:04:55.910> so<00:04:56.910> that's<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.300> whole<00:04:57.540> different

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
barriers and so that's a whole different

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.990 
barriers and so that's a whole different
level<00:04:58.110> of<00:04:58.410> working<00:04:58.950> in<00:04:59.190> a<00:04:59.370> session<00:04:59.610> let

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
level of working in a session let

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.960 
level of working in a session let
somebody<00:05:00.360> to<00:05:00.510> help<00:05:00.720> help<00:05:01.620> them<00:05:01.950> feel<00:05:02.550> safe

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
somebody to help help them feel safe

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.150 
somebody to help help them feel safe
enough<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.360> let<00:05:03.630> those<00:05:03.780> guards<00:05:04.200> down<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.860> some

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
enough to let those guards down and some

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.320 
enough to let those guards down and some

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
animals you'll come across that but most

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.630 
animals you'll come across that but most
they<00:05:09.330> are<00:05:09.810> just<00:05:10.230> kind<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.890> these<00:05:11.040> energy

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
they are just kind of these energy

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.120 
they are just kind of these energy
sponges<00:05:12.390> that<00:05:12.660> are<00:05:12.720> just<00:05:13.020> so<00:05:13.230> open<00:05:13.560> and
