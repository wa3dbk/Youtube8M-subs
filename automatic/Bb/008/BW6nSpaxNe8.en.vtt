right
a<00:00:32.489> lot<00:00:33.360> more<00:00:33.510> time<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.780> got

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.570 

they're<00:00:42.750> close<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.230> think<00:00:43.290> there<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:43.710> um<00:00:44.040> no<00:00:44.489> we

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
they're close I think there was um no we

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.729 
they're close I think there was um no we
had<00:00:44.700> glimpses<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> during<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.660> season<00:00:45.960> we

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
had glimpses of it during the season we

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.710 
had glimpses of it during the season we
had<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.160> her<00:00:47.400> meet<00:00:47.610> new<00:00:48.120> people<00:00:48.270> out<00:00:48.510> there

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
had in her meet new people out there

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.750 
had in her meet new people out there
that<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:48.960> played<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.440> well<00:00:49.470> we<00:00:49.920> were<00:00:50.010> making

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
that we played so well we were making

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.330 
that we played so well we were making
chocolate<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.390> together<00:00:51.800> we<00:00:52.800> executed

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
chocolate and together we executed

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.760 
chocolate and together we executed
exactly<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> know<00:00:54.780> what<00:00:54.989> coach<00:00:55.290> want<00:00:55.530> us<00:00:55.650> to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
exactly the know what coach want us to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.920 
exactly the know what coach want us to
do<00:00:55.890> out<00:00:56.040> there<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.400> I<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.330> that<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.570> our<00:00:57.690> net

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
do out there and I think that is our net

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.290 
do out there and I think that is our net
is<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.460> executing<00:00:59.970> which<00:01:00.090> was

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
is just you know executing which was

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.410 
is just you know executing which was
effective<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.900> being<00:01:01.170> plan<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.150> you<00:01:03.150> know<00:01:03.270> we

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
effective is being plan and you know we

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.180 
effective is being plan and you know we
took<00:01:03.720> that<00:01:03.840> out<00:01:03.989> consistently<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.010> think

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
took that out consistently and I think

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:14.320 
took that out consistently and I think
that's<00:01:05.309> something<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.580> was<00:01:05.760> worth<00:01:05.940> on<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.860 

everything<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.690> mean<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.230> says<00:01:16.730> it'll<00:01:17.730> be<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.510> lot

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
everything I mean it says it'll be a lot

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.920 
everything I mean it says it'll be a lot
less<00:01:19.110> about<00:01:19.440> knowing<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.700> know<00:01:20.790> what<00:01:21.090> it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
less about knowing you know what it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.440 
less about knowing you know what it
takes<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.230> play<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.800> league<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:24.330> know
