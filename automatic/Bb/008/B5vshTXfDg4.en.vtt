tight fit but these are really good and
here's<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.769> mr.<00:02:32.100> freeze<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.670> comes<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.060> this

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
here's the mr. freeze that comes in this

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.740 
here's the mr. freeze that comes in this
set<00:02:33.650> he's<00:02:34.760> exactly<00:02:35.760> like<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.180> other<00:02:36.359> mr.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
set he's exactly like the other mr.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.629 
set he's exactly like the other mr.
freeze<00:02:37.019> except<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.709> paint<00:02:37.950> job<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.430> this

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
freeze except for the paint job on this

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.550 
freeze except for the paint job on this
one<00:02:38.819> is<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.359> bit<00:02:39.630> different<00:02:39.840> let's<00:02:40.079> take<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.319> look

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
one is a bit different let's take a look

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.770 
one is a bit different let's take a look
so<00:02:41.220> this<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.639> other<00:02:41.850> mr.<00:02:42.209> freeze<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.660> we

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
so this is the other mr. freeze that we

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.720 
so this is the other mr. freeze that we
have<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:43.799> see<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:44.400> one<00:02:44.700> has

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
have and you can see that this one has

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.300 
have and you can see that this one has
kind<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.329> a<00:02:45.450> colder<00:02:45.989> paint<00:02:46.410> job<00:02:46.709> more<00:02:47.010> dark

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
kind of a colder paint job more dark

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.050 
kind of a colder paint job more dark
colors

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
colors

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.289 
colors
it<00:02:48.239> matches<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.690> fridge<00:02:49.139> eration<00:02:49.410> tower<00:02:49.799> set

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
it matches the fridge eration tower set

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.240 
it matches the fridge eration tower set
so<00:02:51.299> we<00:02:51.420> could<00:02:51.510> see<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.049> actually

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
so we could see that it's actually

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.039 
so we could see that it's actually
pretty<00:02:53.250> cool<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.819> matches<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:54.269> well<00:02:54.660> it

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
pretty cool that it matches so well it

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.500 
pretty cool that it matches so well it
would<00:02:55.170> kind<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.410> look<00:02:55.500> at<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> place<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.329> is

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
would kind of look at a place so this is

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.509 
would kind of look at a place so this is
a<00:02:57.690> nicer<00:02:58.170> figure<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.620> he<00:02:58.680> comes<00:02:58.920> with<00:02:59.250> his

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
a nicer figure and he comes with his

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.559 
a nicer figure and he comes with his
freeze<00:03:00.180> ray

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
freeze ray

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.839 
freeze ray
but<00:03:03.569> that's<00:03:03.840> not<00:03:04.110> all<00:03:04.349> hobby<00:03:04.620> kids<00:03:05.040> because

him talk is it just me or is it cold out
here<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:14.340> wouldn't<00:04:14.669> be<00:04:14.879> an<00:04:14.970> Imaginext<00:04:15.750> set

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
here and it wouldn't be an Imaginext set

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.650 
here and it wouldn't be an Imaginext set
without<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.530> random<00:04:17.400> disc<00:04:17.760> shooting<00:04:18.269> device

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
without a random disc shooting device

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.460 
without a random disc shooting device
and<00:04:19.590> we've<00:04:19.829> got<00:04:20.070> one<00:04:20.280> it<00:04:20.400> shoots<00:04:20.639> ice<00:04:20.940> discs<00:04:21.599> so

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
and we've got one it shoots ice discs so

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.140 
and we've got one it shoots ice discs so
that's<00:04:22.620> different<00:04:22.979> instead<00:04:23.760> of<00:04:23.849> having<00:04:24.000> just

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
that's different instead of having just

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.659 
that's different instead of having just
a<00:04:24.389> plain<00:04:24.630> ordinary<00:04:24.960> disc<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:26.310> one<00:04:26.520> actually

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
a plain ordinary disc this one actually

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.050 
a plain ordinary disc this one actually
has<00:04:26.970> some<00:04:27.210> ice<00:04:27.449> carving<00:04:28.080> on<00:04:28.229> it<00:04:28.760> pop<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:29.940> in

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
has some ice carving on it pop it in

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.170 
has some ice carving on it pop it in
there<00:04:30.270> put<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.260> reserves<00:04:31.650> on<00:04:31.949> top<00:04:33.050> as<00:04:34.050> such

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
there put the reserves on top as such
