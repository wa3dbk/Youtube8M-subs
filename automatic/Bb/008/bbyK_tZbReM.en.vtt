00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
we're going to do is copy this code it's

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.410 
we're going to do is copy this code it's
changed<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.580> bit<00:02:08.700> because<00:02:08.910> if<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.509> go<00:02:09.539> into<00:02:09.929> my

installer so what I've done is into the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.880 
installer so what I've done is into the
code<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.780> have<00:02:28.560> added<00:02:28.880> from<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.170> or<00:02:31.170> cydia

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
code I have added from the or cydia

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.670 
code I have added from the or cydia
before<00:02:32.819> so<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.030> set<00:02:33.269> it<00:02:33.360> at<00:02:33.480> half<00:02:33.660> copy<00:02:34.319> the

before so I set it at half copy the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.970 
before so I set it at half copy the
bundles<00:02:35.310> full<00:02:35.730> /<00:02:36.000> installer<00:02:36.629> tar<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.799> make

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
bundles full / installer tar and make

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.580 
bundles full / installer tar and make
sure<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.670> tar<00:02:38.879> file<00:02:39.120> basically<00:02:40.110> don't

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
sure it's the tar file basically don't

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.830 
sure it's the tar file basically don't
extract<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.280> well<00:02:42.120> if<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.299> do<00:02:42.480> because<00:02:42.720> it's

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
extract it well if you do because it's

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.990 
extract it well if you do because it's
already<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.260> TA<00:02:43.560> off<00:02:43.860> I'll<00:02:44.129> don't<00:02:44.519> extract<00:02:44.819> it

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
already a TA off I'll don't extract it

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.280 
already a TA off I'll don't extract it
till<00:02:45.239> just<00:02:45.329> leave<00:02:45.569> it<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.810> put<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:45.989> in<00:02:46.110> there

XP ok so I'm going to copy this whole

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:06.360 
XP ok so I'm going to copy this whole
code<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.920> do<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.069> one<00:03:02.190> by<00:03:02.340> one<00:03:02.600> I'm<00:03:03.600> not

and<00:03:07.370> there<00:03:07.550> goes<00:03:07.700> hash<00:03:08.030> in<00:03:08.300> which<00:03:09.400> would

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
and there goes hash in which would

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.520 
and there goes hash in which would
happen<00:03:10.670> in<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.820> other<00:03:10.940> one<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:12.020> should<00:03:12.260> be

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
happen in the other one and it should be

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.980 
happen in the other one and it should be
passionate<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.490> creating<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.600> custom

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
firmware as you can see it's doing it

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.490 
firmware as you can see it's doing it
there<00:03:16.850> so<00:03:17.120> I'm<00:03:17.300> going<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.570> come<00:03:18.050> back<00:03:18.200> in<00:03:18.380> a<00:03:18.470> few

see what i'm going to do next is to put
in<00:03:54.860> some<00:03:54.890> code<00:03:55.820> to<00:03:55.850> redirect<00:03:56.510> this<00:03:56.840> folder<00:03:57.200> as

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
in some code to redirect this folder as

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.720 
in some code to redirect this folder as
you<00:03:57.530> can<00:03:57.620> see<00:03:57.770> it's<00:03:57.890> going<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.280> exponent

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
you can see it's going to the exponent

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.700 
you can see it's going to the exponent
folder<00:03:59.090> we<00:03:59.750> don't<00:03:59.870> want<00:04:00.080> that<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.290> happen<00:04:00.320> for

is copy this which is the area just

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.050 
is copy this which is the area just
change<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:07.100> top<00:04:07.310> one<00:04:07.550> from<00:04:08.270> expound<00:04:08.890> win32<00:04:10.060> to

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
change the top one from expound win32 to

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.720 
change the top one from expound win32 to
the<00:04:11.180> directory<00:04:11.720> of<00:04:11.900> your<00:04:12.170> I<00:04:12.680> recovery<00:04:13.310> svn
