00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.670
 so does a consumer of 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.080
 microwave faucet by my care in 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.020
 big sections to have a lot 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.869
 very very strong intensity intensity 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.310
 copper electrodes cast by me 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.040
 so I had my ass fuse in me 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.370
 forged makes a wooden mold so that's it 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.870
 it's with the little zab there I'll go 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:39.179
 show right away how it works 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:41.309
 so you take two pieces of steel that 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:46.170
 position yourself on the between each 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:51.199
 electrodes and in the hold so not really 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.730
 we start again I said we are positioning 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.079
 and here we go by little snag for pasta 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.120
 to not melt them because his 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.229
 fauna here is that it starts to 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.969
 to merge that made small 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.949
 Sparks 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:09.690
 so that's so it's under judges the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.979
 cool weight fly me so I'm going 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.740
 show you that it's really solid 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.270
 we can not leave his 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.340
 inseparable it's really soldered a 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.430
 So here we can do that with full 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.619
 of things see there I 'm going to show you 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.740
 like that merge how it's 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:33.509
 hot it's going to completely melt 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.409
 how much of a power it stuck 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:42.689
 huge with only 3 volts 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.759
 this is my little scorer so here's the 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.560
 new v2 tip made from a 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.899
 system of people to cologne for 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.859
 mobile people one is all pretty the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.259
 system with the joystick 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.789
 the clas pointing system does not have too much 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.179
 changed so what changes is that 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.729
 now it goes down vertically and 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.899
 precisely the new innovation is 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.869
 that the machine went off 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.079
 simply lowering the lever see 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.310
 I have only one hand 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:14.250
 you hear more simply thanks 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.650
 to this little tale actors who is plugged 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.709
 upside down actually out and when the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.230
 bes oms unleashed the slacker the game 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.950
 fall June just drop that 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.819
 let the currents pass 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.180
 so I'm going to make you a little 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:31.860
 welding demonstration with this model 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.160
 we're going to make a small update 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.819
 point 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.459
 here we hope it does not fall 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.010
 the stop so within sections a little 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.680
 bigger spoon 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.680
 you see it is positioned 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.750
 the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.820
 much more practical much more 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.170
 practical than the old model since I 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.850
 can get that hands he turns on and 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.990
 on the other hand I have not put it in 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.270
 balance and I do not have to put it all 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.410
 in balance so that it fits I can 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:15.120
 really go faster so we go to them 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:22.070
 will say it and see it 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.070
 really about us to the point 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.650
 it's really tight here it is not so 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.129
 you see here is the new sub 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.129
 2 v 2
