00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.290

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.799
 very good to everyone here the cheer of 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.630

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.820
 teach how to play the furious castle 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.400
 in our pc in our computer it is worth 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.320
 you will ask for good what is the 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.329
 reason to do it and it's because of the simple 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.939
 reason that navigating the other day by 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.130
 the forum of iu jeje curious castle I've 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.320
 known to quite a few people who have 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.360
 problems with the connection in the network of 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.489
 their terminals and they usually leave the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.460
 diabolical message of connection failure 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.780
 although I to that failure, sincerely 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.820
 what I have put a message then 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.699
 Well that one that appears on screen and 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.860
 I would have put something like that in hi, I'm 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.629
 the connection and I failed you during a 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.790
 surge storm or canyon that I know it is 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.809
 when I fuck you what more 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.000
 appropriate 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.280
 I will tell you as a suggestion and hehe 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.080
 I change it to see if it's good that 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.380
 they fuck us, at least in the 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.299
 kingdoms not in my case I have it I have 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.100
 installed on my personal computer a 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.799
 emulator that is the one that I'm going to teach you 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.170
 next and I play the castle 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.550
 furious from there I can assure you that 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.770
 almost never 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.540
 the connection has failed me all 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.900
 events consumption from the computer 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.110
 well I make sure there are no failures 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.030
 unexpected yet it's much more comfortable 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.550
 I recommend playing one hundred percent 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.590
 for when you are at home you do not spend 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.810
 Mobile phone battery not overheated 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.850
 that in summer you know that sometimes 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.610
 the phone heats up and that can be 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.070
 be dangerous both for the duration of 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.830
 the battery as for the health of your 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.140
 phone because by heating it so 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.400
 making games and so on 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.800
 applications that need a power 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.330
 big as the phone overheats 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.840
 and that affects the components very much 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.800
 internal and shortens much life 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.230
 on the phone so I really use it 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.570
 and I'm going fancy so this is going to 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.270
 be the video tutorial of this this 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.730
 emulator vale is called bluestacks and 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.340
 Well, the only thing you have to do 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.770
 is to download the link that I leave in 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.300
 the comments of the video and I'm going to 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.300
 explain a little bit how it works 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.700
 as you can see I already have here what 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.490
 downloaded into the file is called stacks 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.710
 work hd this is the file with which 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.100
 let's do the installation what 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.350
 we execute perfect is going loading here what 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.050
 we have accept the contract of 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.480
 license we give to following these two 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.850
 checks we leave if we give the following 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.320
 start loading the bar I go a 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.540
 little bit because also speed up this 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.310
 process is a little long since 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.230
 you do not have to download any file 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.710
 I'm uploading the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.380
 bluestacks preinstalled only you have 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.760
 to finish the installation there, yes 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.040
 what downloads from the official website of 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.350
 bluestacks forces you to be downloading 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.420
 it while it's being installed and it's 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.310
 much more expensive and usually gives errors 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.800
 I have uploaded the version I use 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.020
 currently this version is going very well 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.360
 it goes very well does not need updates 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.700
 and you have access to any 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.160
 application since it has its google 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.680

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.510

 automatically we have opened the 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.370
 application and to be able to do here the 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.930
 synchronization of our google account 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.840

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.880

 dais to use account that you have already created 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.620
 your email password 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.800
 in the access tab and we would enter 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.810
 to do the synchronization asked us 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.729
 accept accept like when you put it on 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.719
 any terminal is worth here 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.900
 we would have our accounts 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:05.340
 synchronized and now is when we 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.129
 let's go to the tab is here in the 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.330
 orange magnifying glass is worth the orange that the 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:11.330

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:18.330
 let's go to the magnifying glass tab 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.310
 look for the application as if I do not 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.229

 first time you access google place 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.880
 It's going to take a little longer as I eat 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:40.520
 you can see 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.630
 already when I finish loading around here 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.460

 just like they are not going to be saved 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.840
 in the new device that would be in your 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.210
