you wanna get strapped in there I'm

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.260 
you wanna get strapped in there I'm
going<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.110> get<00:02:14.200> strapped<00:02:14.500> in<00:02:14.620> now<00:02:15.240> you'd<00:02:16.240> think

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
going to get strapped in now you'd think

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.120 
going to get strapped in now you'd think
that<00:02:16.690> my<00:02:16.780> extra<00:02:17.230> mass<00:02:17.410> in<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.680> car<00:02:17.920> would

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
that my extra mass in the car would

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.190 
that my extra mass in the car would
affect<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.490> performance<00:02:18.670> but<00:02:19.600> Andy<00:02:19.840> reckons

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
affect the performance but Andy reckons

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.600 
affect the performance but Andy reckons
it<00:02:20.320> could<00:02:20.500> actually<00:02:20.650> help<00:02:21.070> balance<00:02:21.460> the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
it could actually help balance the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.910 
it could actually help balance the
weight<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.300> make<00:02:22.450> for<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.690> faster<00:02:23.170> time
