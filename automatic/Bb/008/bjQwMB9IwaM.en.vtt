00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.890
 2 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.879
 at the stadium michel valter du neuhof 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.590
 met some forty young people 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.870
 to compete in the second phase of the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.369
 world cup neighborhoods 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.110
 England are warming up again when 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.300
 Algeria is already trying a few laps 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.460
 of the world proud to represent this 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.400
 nation germany she just had the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.869
 luck because fortunately they 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.880
 had by the way managed it 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.220
 would have burst under made a very very good 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.080
 john jerry i'd like to be so manny 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:41.460
 because he is very strong fox of 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.909
 heavens she fox surfaces mark 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.559
 goals 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:48.720
 that's what missed this young 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.170
 Algerian striker I do not know I'm 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.600
 disappointed 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:01:04.979
 after that I loved him I check them I 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:06.689
 put my choices I do not know about this 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.680
 lack of realism the match goes into 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.380
 favor of england 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.659
 helped by the racing player brian amofa 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.880
 but it is their seat loris the other 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.460
 racing player who equalizes in the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.920
 stops play it's fun game and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.210
 accept in addition I scored I showed 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.820
 that I can help this team from Algeria 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.270
 won the title so obviously it 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.979
 pleases 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.539
 about fifteen matches took place all 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.179
 afternoon sikimic shah backed 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:49.319
 italy italians crucified by the 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:50.630
 English wisp to save my 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:55.409
 team 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:02:00.350
 so here we can hope you can 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.759
 pass goals by chance 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.399
 thankfully fortunately the ground 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.429
 is too small once they are 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.430
 got out of their better two match 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.340
 to go to something else steal him well 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.350
 sure these stands to continue to your 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.390
 train in the sphere their shots 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.110
 there are targets on six brands in 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.260
 the dormers 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.330
 I give them 12 haribo candies and if 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.460
 they mark on the other three who 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.140
 are in low and simon hand they 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.530
 like that as soon as they lose yurts 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.110
 or all come out to this stage to be able to 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.540
 continue to enjoy continue to play and 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.310
 try to always want more alain 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.240
 where the president of the neuhof cs we saw 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.370
 to pass nuggets 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.280
 the cobos brothers jonathan schmitt and 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.280
 brian amofa with a common point 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.180
 listen it is especially the rappela to the aan 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.860
 now they come from neighborhoods 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.380
 that they are trying to succeed 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.210
 in the world of football seen that in fact a 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.110
 passion for some young people because 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.150
 I have to persevere for 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.480
 actually get to the highest that 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.160
 is also proposed they all want 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.180
 reach the summits the final of this 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.460
 day will begin 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.410
 she will oppose Algeria to Italy but 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.080
 between the two teams the fair play is 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.690
 authentic but if italy that calm 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.110
 very cool 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.770
 but if I do not say anything I 'm happy 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.090
 that they win because because all 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.600
 these two other teams have one is 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.600
 all friends 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.590
 from the first minutes it's the 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.930
 foxes from the surfaces of the fennecs who 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.060
 score despite numerous attempts 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.590
 italy fails to equalize and 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.670
 it is the Algerians who benefit 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.670
 to make the score worse 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.210
 so it's Algeria that wins this 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.950
 small final but it's good four 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.930
 teams that are qualified England 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.120
 italy and uruguay and algeria 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.950
 leave all with their ticket in their pocket 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.950
 direction meinau
