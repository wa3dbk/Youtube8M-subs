00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.150
 so the guard of the fangs I explain 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.440
 and their seven guards like these one 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.660
 try to have an attitude 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.750
 okay ok you do not know how that 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.360
 you m 10.8 in position with regard to these 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.800
 pioneers of soul pop imports one leash 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.689
 always a possibility that the 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.920
 situation can range and so we take 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.300
 not an aggressive position but a 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.420
 position that will still protect you 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.270
 okay already like I already exclude 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.739
 what to tell them of the tax to natural 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.940
 it's the giant hook people when 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.040
 they are pissed off after you make you 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.780
 and yours put your head all the shots of 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.820
 direct fist these departures which are 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.350
 educated who ever made to have 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.940
 under combat management did not rd but 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.990
 the direct free kick naturally the 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.210
 nature and I will come and try to 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.280
 put a big blow like that so the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.340
 do their this guard there it allows in 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.260
 more agreements to close the angle of 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.449
 direct and induce from then it's already 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.299
 a trend that we still accuse 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.579
 plus the crochet ok so his place has 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.380
 reduces the possibilities compare this 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.090
 guard there she'll just put the 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.920
 bear paw like that I'm going to come 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.790
 step diagonally six hitters 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.440
 hammer ok ok come back so what 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.479
 to be careful is the 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.030
 now call often when we want 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.610
 go hard we start to roll the earth 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.380
 a gesture all that and it's this case 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.870
 opposite difference between picture a little bit of 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.850
 walk but on the other he's fine he's going 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.390
 the budget is going fast and he will react - 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.590
 samassa will not work so I'm here 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.420
 I move my opposite leg to 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.990
 testimonials b goes down a little bit 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.400
 okay on may 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.680
 then keep the other hand up and have 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.939
 hit with the hammer chords them 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.259
 points is good but you risk 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.450
 hurting you on the hatches of 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.640
 someone in the test the teaching of 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:01.250
 you to hit matt o'connor simple 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:03.880
 so there the young Helvetians made ten 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.880
 of each collection
