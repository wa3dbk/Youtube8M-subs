00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.069
 not at all happy to find you 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.960
 today for new video so that 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.889
 will be a video recipes I will you 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.940
 show how I do my kebab talent 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.080
 revisited by car because 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.580
 normally in putting apples from 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.480
 earth but I'm going to show you with 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.270
 my chickpeas 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.640
 so if this video interests you I 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.710
 tell you right away 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.800
 then no my pressure cooker javenÃ© to 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.080
 pour half a glass of tea 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.939
 sunflower 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.349
 Then I come poured but onions 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.349
 that I would cut into small dice 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.940
 so the jav is a little bit hard because 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.770
 that I did not have enough in all that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.520
 really does a half-glass acts and 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.520
 oil so I mix well all 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.580
 so there it was in less than three 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.330
 minutes that sami added before I 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:10.540
 pour peppers and green peppers bar 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:12.550
 so give it here I just added we have and 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.030
 cut in small dice you can rap 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.360
 is also so I cut in everything 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:24.460
 small dice 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:27.250
 I mix everything is there I'm going 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.149
 add my meat to start again 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.290
 Beef 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.930
 so when you go to your house 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.899
 butcher asked for meat for 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.590
 special as kebab 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:46.630
 so we dined Burgundy and I 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.880
 mix everything then I just add 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.180
 a tablespoon of concentrated 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.149
 red chili peppers and a tablespoon 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.100
 tomato concentrate so the concentrate 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.850
 of red pepper buy it from 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.690
 our Turkish grocery store so that little blink 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.690
 eye for marine 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.440
 so here I mix everything up 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.720
 the sauce and goods scattered everywhere and 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.730
 there I come poured but tomatoes that 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.560
 I would cut in small dice and 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.860
 I add a sugar 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.239
 why a success to settle the city 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.370
 tomato 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.700
 otherwise you will have attacks 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.720
 acids or lifts the lessor 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.489
 nice so I mix everything but 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.930
 after you do not feel the taste of sugar 1 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.880
 so do not worry but good 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.459
 after if you like sweet-salty too 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.459
 one is fine so I'll add 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.269
 spices so pepper salt and 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.030
 Red pepper 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.950
 you can even add time so 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.480
 I did not add this time 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.549
 I did not put potatoes but if 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.430
 you put potatoes add 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.890
 complexion too it's super good and there I 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.030
 come poured boiling water so the 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.360
 quantity is until we see 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.390
 more meat in fact so here I am 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.079
 see more the meat goes back to the surface 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:16.530
 it's good so here I put back eat of 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.530
 everything and I'm going to cook pretty much 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.330
 normally 20 minutes with my casserole 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.490
 minute so if you're not from 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.920
 casserole-minute you let cook little by little 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.890
 almost 30 to 40 minutes in a class 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.590
 crazy soft gun name to actually 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.840
 normal late so that's twenty 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.660
 minutes it's cooked so I'm going 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.390
 vote anyway the meat of these aisles 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.900
 tweet or not so the water after 20 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.250
 minutes 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.340
 she is cooked for me with a 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.150
 pressure cooker it changes your life 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.220
 I advise you to buy a 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.140
 pressure cooker only one cheap 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.540
 now because out of price but 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.190
 So now it goes to me he added 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.720
 blame so either you add some 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.130
 chickpeas either you add some 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.360
 potatoes it's like you want 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.880
 or without you added me not the 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.070
 next strides it's like that so 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.800
 it's gone for five minutes 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.600
 so I let five minutes lean 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:15.200
 and so that's five minutes after my 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.200
 preparation is ready to be tasted 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.970
 so for the accompaniment I had done 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.010
 pilaf rice so the pilot I will you 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.520
 would of course link the video 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.260
 without info bar or next and I'm going 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.050
 of course one plays the presentations and 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.120
 I'm coming to these mountings kebab just to 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.800
 side so I hope that's kind of 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.200
 videos will have you more if you have any 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.479

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.010
