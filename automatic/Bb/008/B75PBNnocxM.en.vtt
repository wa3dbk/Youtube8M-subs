00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.380 

that's<00:04:00.620> all<00:04:00.800> I'm<00:04:00.920> just

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.780 

so<00:04:03.990> cameras<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.800> did<00:04:05.100> get<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.340> little<00:04:05.490> GoPro

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
so cameras I did get a little GoPro

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:14.240 
so cameras I did get a little GoPro
basis<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:12.060> know<00:04:12.180> I'm<00:04:12.270> just<00:04:12.450> so<00:04:12.570> used<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:13.250> the

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
basis you know I'm just so used to the

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.630 
basis you know I'm just so used to the
software<00:04:14.700> i've<00:04:14.910> been<00:04:15.090> using<00:04:16.430> it's<00:04:17.430> so

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
software i've been using it's so

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.310 
software i've been using it's so
efficient<00:04:18.329> it's<00:04:19.079> buggy<00:04:19.579> Windows<00:04:20.579> Movie<00:04:20.790> Maker

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
efficient it's buggy Windows Movie Maker

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.400 
efficient it's buggy Windows Movie Maker
it's<00:04:22.320> so<00:04:22.500> basic<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:23.900> actually<00:04:24.900> thought<00:04:25.350> it

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
it's so basic I actually thought it

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.970 
it's so basic I actually thought it
would<00:04:25.590> be<00:04:25.710> more<00:04:25.890> robust<00:04:26.400> that<00:04:27.050> but<00:04:30.680> I'm<00:04:31.680> still

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
would be more robust that but I'm still

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.060 
would be more robust that but I'm still
using<00:04:32.190> crappy<00:04:33.180> XP<00:04:33.600> laptops<00:04:34.170> you<00:04:34.470> know<00:04:34.590> it

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
using crappy XP laptops you know it

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.310 
using crappy XP laptops you know it
would<00:04:35.220> broke<00:04:35.460> to<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.640> keys<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.600> plug<00:04:36.840> in<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.140> USB

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
would broke to the keys to plug in a USB

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.450 
would broke to the keys to plug in a USB
keyboard<00:04:38.010> just<00:04:38.850> good<00:04:40.010> will<00:04:41.010> get<00:04:41.160> us<00:04:41.280> much

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
keyboard just good will get us much

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.070 
keyboard just good will get us much
mileage<00:04:41.760> out<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.120> them<00:04:42.300> as<00:04:42.480> we<00:04:42.630> can<00:04:42.840> before

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
mileage out of them as we can before

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.010 
mileage out of them as we can before
they<00:04:46.640> don't<00:04:47.640> play<00:04:47.820> by<00:04:47.880> then<00:04:48.210> windows<00:04:48.570> 9<00:04:48.840> will

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
they don't play by then windows 9 will

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.540 
they don't play by then windows 9 will
be<00:04:49.140> out<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.590> there<00:04:49.680> would<00:04:49.770> be<00:04:49.800> much<00:04:50.100> more<00:04:50.310> than

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
be out and there would be much more than

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.540 
be out and there would be much more than
Windows<00:04:50.850> 7<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:52.560> you<00:04:52.620> don't<00:04:53.010> have<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.310> reinvent

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
Windows 7 and you don't have to reinvent

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.860 
Windows 7 and you don't have to reinvent
the<00:04:53.970> wheel<00:04:54.140> which<00:04:55.140> is<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:55.620> inefficient<00:04:56.870> think

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
the wheel which is so inefficient think

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.550 
the wheel which is so inefficient think
of<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.200> billions<00:04:58.740> of<00:04:59.430> person<00:04:59.970> hours<00:05:00.590> wasted

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
of the billions of person hours wasted

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.670 
of the billions of person hours wasted
by<00:05:04.560> software<00:05:05.130> companies<00:05:05.640> being<00:05:05.910> so<00:05:06.210> arrogant

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
by software companies being so arrogant

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.830 
by software companies being so arrogant
cluding<00:05:07.680> with<00:05:07.860> you<00:05:08.210> when<00:05:09.210> they<00:05:09.360> move<00:05:09.570> stuff

it's go to this it is not revolution it

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.810 
it's go to this it is not revolution it
has<00:05:25.470> not<00:05:25.650> even<00:05:25.919> evolution<00:05:27.770> so<00:05:28.770> that's<00:05:29.280> just<00:05:29.430> my

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
has not even evolution so that's just my

I kind of hate going on here but they
had<00:05:46.760> those<00:05:46.970> little<00:05:47.090> Fuji<00:05:47.780> ax<00:05:48.350> I<00:05:48.680> had<00:05:48.890> a<00:05:49.000> 650<00:05:50.000> or

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
had those little Fuji ax I had a 650 or

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.360 
had those little Fuji ax I had a 650 or
something<00:05:50.630> it's<00:05:51.050> the<00:05:51.230> most<00:05:51.380> basic<00:05:51.890> model<00:05:52.100> this

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
something it's the most basic model this

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.470 
something it's the most basic model this
stuff<00:05:52.700> and<00:05:53.330> it<00:05:53.480> runs<00:05:54.020> on<00:05:54.230> two<00:05:54.470> AAA<00:05:54.680> batteries

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
stuff and it runs on two AAA batteries

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.770 
stuff and it runs on two AAA batteries
very<00:05:56.480> basic<00:05:56.960> stuff<00:05:57.490> decent<00:05:58.490> results<00:05:58.940> I<00:05:59.150> lost

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
very basic stuff decent results I lost

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.590 
very basic stuff decent results I lost
my<00:05:59.990> other<00:06:00.140> one<00:06:00.380> when<00:06:00.590> I<00:06:00.680> was<00:06:00.740> out<00:06:00.890> biking<00:06:01.600> bison

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
my other one when I was out biking bison

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.360 
my other one when I was out biking bison
mountain<00:06:02.840> biking<00:06:03.200> somewhere<00:06:03.530> and<00:06:03.860> probably

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.340 

so

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.440 

I<00:06:10.440> just<00:06:11.190> went<00:06:11.400> in<00:06:11.580> and<00:06:11.700> picked<00:06:11.850> up<00:06:12.060> another<00:06:12.330> one

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
I just went in and picked up another one

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.920 
I just went in and picked up another one
it's<00:06:13.440> now<00:06:13.620> an<00:06:13.800> ax<00:06:14.130> 655<00:06:15.090> when<00:06:15.390> I<00:06:15.480> can't<00:06:15.780> really

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
it's now an ax 655 when I can't really

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.370 
it's now an ax 655 when I can't really
tell<00:06:16.230> any<00:06:16.470> difference<00:06:17.660> 70<00:06:18.660> bucks

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.370 

so<00:06:21.920> the<00:06:22.250> the<00:06:22.610> economy<00:06:23.120> appeals<00:06:23.420> to<00:06:23.600> me<00:06:23.750> the

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
so the the economy appeals to me the

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.070 
so the the economy appeals to me the
functionality<00:06:25.450> absolutely<00:06:26.450> appeals<00:06:26.810> to<00:06:26.960> me

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
functionality absolutely appeals to me

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:34.150 
functionality absolutely appeals to me
and<00:06:29.410> it's<00:06:30.410> just<00:06:30.470> so<00:06:30.740> usable<00:06:32.800> okay<00:06:33.800> I<00:06:33.830> love<00:06:34.010> the

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
and it's just so usable okay I love the

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:43.400 
and it's just so usable okay I love the
80s<00:06:34.370> back
