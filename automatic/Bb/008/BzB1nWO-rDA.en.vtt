I much rather use that than fraps so if

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.900 
I much rather use that than fraps so if
you<00:02:54.230> need<00:02:54.560> an<00:02:54.709> idea<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.069> what<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.489> frames<00:02:55.760> are

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
you need an idea of what the frames are

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.030 
you need an idea of what the frames are
doing<00:02:56.269> you<00:02:56.840> know<00:02:56.959> look<00:02:57.200> up<00:02:57.350> there<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.890> then

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
doing you know look up there and then

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.740 
doing you know look up there and then
look<00:02:58.190> at<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.340> bottom<00:02:58.849> left-hand<00:02:59.150> corner<00:02:59.390> to

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
look at the bottom left-hand corner to

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.110 
look at the bottom left-hand corner to
see<00:02:59.930> what<00:03:00.080> settings<00:03:00.440> I'm<00:03:00.680> running<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.370> you

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
see what settings I'm running and you

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.240 
see what settings I'm running and you
can<00:03:02.330> judge<00:03:02.870> from<00:03:03.019> there<00:03:03.290> if<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.650> are<00:03:03.860> going<00:03:04.130> to

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
can judge from there if you are going to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.220 
can judge from there if you are going to
get<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.459> witcher<00:03:04.790> if<00:03:04.970> you<00:03:05.090> have<00:03:05.299> a<00:03:05.540> setup<00:03:06.200> that

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
get the witcher if you have a setup that

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.620 
get the witcher if you have a setup that
is<00:03:06.440> similar<00:03:06.799> to<00:03:06.980> mine<00:03:07.190> better<00:03:07.640> or<00:03:07.940> on<00:03:08.239> par<00:03:08.599> with

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
is similar to mine better or on par with

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.080 
is similar to mine better or on par with
mine<00:03:09.019> this<00:03:09.799> should<00:03:10.040> give<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.459> very<00:03:11.000> good

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
mine this should give you a very good

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.380 
mine this should give you a very good
idea<00:03:11.299> of<00:03:11.660> what<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.170> expect<00:03:12.200> from<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.980> game<00:03:13.390> my

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
idea of what to expect from the game my

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.410 
idea of what to expect from the game my
suggestion<00:03:14.840> is<00:03:15.290> high<00:03:16.280> settings<00:03:16.790> because

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
suggestion is high settings because

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.319 
suggestion is high settings because
ultra<00:03:18.290> with<00:03:18.500> hair<00:03:18.739> works<00:03:19.040> will<00:03:19.459> kill<00:03:20.000> your

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
ultra with hair works will kill your

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.289 
ultra with hair works will kill your
GPUs<00:03:21.109> like<00:03:21.410> at<00:03:21.859> times<00:03:22.160> I<00:03:22.400> was<00:03:22.700> dropping<00:03:23.030> down

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
GPUs like at times I was dropping down

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.650 
GPUs like at times I was dropping down
to<00:03:23.840> 11<00:03:24.560> frames<00:03:24.890> per<00:03:25.459> second<00:03:25.940> but<00:03:26.329> it'd<00:03:26.450> be<00:03:26.480> like

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
to 11 frames per second but it'd be like

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.210 
to 11 frames per second but it'd be like
a<00:03:26.810> split<00:03:27.049> second<00:03:27.410> drop<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.799> then<00:03:27.859> would<00:03:28.010> jump

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
a split second drop and then would jump

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.309 
a split second drop and then would jump
back<00:03:28.370> up<00:03:28.519> to<00:03:28.640> around<00:03:28.880> twenty<00:03:29.660> seven<00:03:29.959> depending

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
back up to around twenty seven depending

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.309 
back up to around twenty seven depending

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
on as a fight scene if it was a cutscene

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.160 
on as a fight scene if it was a cutscene
outside<00:03:33.319> I'd<00:03:33.680> see<00:03:33.950> around<00:03:34.930> 30<00:03:35.930> ish<00:03:36.430> 234<00:03:37.430> frames

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
outside I'd see around 30 ish 234 frames

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.050 
outside I'd see around 30 ish 234 frames

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
but with hair works off the game's

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.129 
but with hair works off the game's
frames<00:03:41.390> jumped<00:03:41.750> another<00:03:41.930> 10<00:03:42.380> to<00:03:42.590> 15<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:44.139> yeah

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
frames jumped another 10 to 15 so yeah

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.170 
frames jumped another 10 to 15 so yeah
this<00:03:45.620> thing<00:03:45.889> is<00:03:46.160> officially<00:03:46.880> going<00:03:47.060> to

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
this thing is officially going to

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.809 
this thing is officially going to
replace<00:03:47.480> crisis<00:03:48.139> as<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.680> benchmarking<00:03:49.519> game

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
replace crisis as the benchmarking game

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.780 
replace crisis as the benchmarking game
