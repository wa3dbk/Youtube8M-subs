really using I'm gonna flog in for
fifteen<00:01:19.860> million<00:01:20.159> that's<00:01:20.460> what<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> think<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
fifteen million that's what I think I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.880 
fifteen million that's what I think I
reckon<00:01:21.479> he'll<00:01:21.540> go<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.020> making<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> 10

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
reckon he'll go for that making a 10

reckon he'll go for that making a 10
million<00:01:23.100> profit<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.820> lucky<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.810> would

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
million profit so lucky that it would
