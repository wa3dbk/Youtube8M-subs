hey guys it's review time you always ask
me<00:00:07.740> if<00:00:08.010> there<00:00:08.250> are<00:00:08.490> markers<00:00:08.970> similar<00:00:09.510> to

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
me if there are markers similar to

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.440 
me if there are markers similar to
kopecks<00:00:10.200> but<00:00:10.620> cheaper<00:00:11.280> today<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:12.090> have<00:00:12.420> a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
kopecks but cheaper today I have a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.169 
kopecks but cheaper today I have a
solution<00:00:12.840> for<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.679> will<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:14.639> doing<00:00:14.910> a

markers the reason I am doing this

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.209 
markers the reason I am doing this
review<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.390> because<00:00:40.020> these<00:00:40.379> markers<00:00:40.950> are

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
review is because these markers are

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.410 
review is because these markers are
three<00:00:41.700> three<00:00:42.149> times<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.660> cheap<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.260> kopecks

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
three three times as cheap as kopecks

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.869 
three three times as cheap as kopecks
but<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.870> same<00:00:46.170> quality<00:00:46.829> let's<00:00:47.370> check<00:00:47.700> them

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879

blues oranges pinks reds yellows greens
and<00:01:31.340> violets<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:33.950> use<00:01:34.950> these<00:01:35.280> colors<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.799> I

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
and violets I use these colors and I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.060 
and violets I use these colors and I
made<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> comparison<00:01:39.930> between<00:01:40.290> them<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
made a comparison between them and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.990 
made a comparison between them and
kopecks<00:01:42.020> comparison<00:01:43.020> number<00:01:43.290> one<00:01:43.970> they<00:01:44.970> have

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
kopecks comparison number one they have

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.270 
kopecks comparison number one they have
the<00:01:45.479> exact<00:01:46.200> same<00:01:46.320> type<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.479> mechanism<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:49.280> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
the exact same type of mechanism and the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.990 
the exact same type of mechanism and the
exact<00:01:50.549> same<00:01:50.790> type<00:01:51.090> type<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:52.170> pen<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.250> there<00:01:53.700> is

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
exact same type type of pen so there is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.420 
exact same type type of pen so there is
a<00:01:54.329> chisel<00:01:54.840> tip<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.380> there<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.670> pointy<00:01:57.149> tip

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.260 

there's<00:02:00.430> a<00:02:00.520> chisel<00:02:00.940> tip<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:03.400> there<00:02:04.120> is<00:02:04.210> a

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
there's a chisel tip and there is a

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.050 
there's a chisel tip and there is a
pointy<00:02:04.630> tip<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:07.289> tested<00:02:08.289> them<00:02:08.380> out<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.679> bit<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.429> I

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
pointy tip I tested them out a bit and I

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.360 
pointy tip I tested them out a bit and I
discovered<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:11.230> chisel<00:02:11.440> tip<00:02:11.800> can<00:02:12.160> be

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
discovered that the chisel tip can be

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.910 
discovered that the chisel tip can be
removed<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.300> can<00:02:13.510> even<00:02:13.870> refill<00:02:14.590> these

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
removed and you can even refill these

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.610 
removed and you can even refill these
little<00:02:15.370> ones<00:02:15.610> with<00:02:16.180> read<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.690> Copic<00:02:17.140> refills

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
little ones with read the Copic refills

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.970 
little ones with read the Copic refills
if<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:18.220> find<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.730> similar<00:02:19.240> color<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.650> that's

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
if you find a similar color so that's

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.470 
if you find a similar color so that's
that's<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:22.090> nice<00:02:22.360> cheap<00:02:22.870> Copic<00:02:23.440> hack<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:24.480> believe

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
that's a nice cheap Copic hack I believe

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.949 
that's a nice cheap Copic hack I believe
will<00:02:25.870> work<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.800> still<00:02:27.580> haven't<00:02:28.090> used<00:02:28.180> up<00:02:28.600> any<00:02:28.840> of

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
will work I still haven't used up any of

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.860 
will work I still haven't used up any of
these<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.410> test<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.830> out<00:02:30.010> but<00:02:30.970> since<00:02:31.600> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
these to test it out but since the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.710 
these to test it out but since the
mechanism<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.730> pretty<00:02:33.730> much<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.150> same<00:02:34.420> it

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
mechanism is pretty much the same it

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.400 
mechanism is pretty much the same it
should<00:02:34.780> work<00:02:35.760> for<00:02:36.760> each<00:02:37.090> three<00:02:37.540> or<00:02:37.660> four<00:02:37.989> of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
should work for each three or four of

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.220 
should work for each three or four of
these<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:39.130> get<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:40.150> actually<00:02:40.720> save<00:02:40.930> enough

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
these you get you actually save enough

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.670 
these you get you actually save enough
money<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:42.040> buy<00:02:42.250> an<00:02:42.550> entire<00:02:42.940> refill<00:02:43.690> so<00:02:44.320> think

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
money to buy an entire refill so think

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.240 
money to buy an entire refill so think
about<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.100> math<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.900> even<00:02:46.900> tested<00:02:47.680> out<00:02:47.860> how

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
about the math I even tested out how

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.710 
about the math I even tested out how
they<00:02:48.640> fare<00:02:49.510> on<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:50.230> regular<00:02:50.739> paper<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:52.480> can

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
they fare on a regular paper and you can

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.790 
they fare on a regular paper and you can
see<00:02:53.110> all<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.500> these<00:02:53.980> shades<00:02:54.459> right<00:02:55.030> here

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
see all of these shades right here

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.600 
see all of these shades right here
compared<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:56.860> copics

the fine liner usually a sign of low
quality<00:04:49.720> bad<00:04:50.350> marker<00:04:50.889> is<00:04:51.100> when<00:04:52.000> it<00:04:52.240> bleeds<00:04:52.870> on

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.210 
other colors blacks fineliners nope
that's<00:04:59.919> not<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:01.169> case<00:05:02.169> with<00:05:02.500> these<00:05:02.740> markers

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
that's not the case with these markers

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.480 
that's not the case with these markers
so<00:05:03.520> that<00:05:03.880> means<00:05:04.180> they're<00:05:04.540> perfectly<00:05:05.490> same

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
so that means they're perfectly same

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.080 
so that means they're perfectly same
