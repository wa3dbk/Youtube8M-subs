almost<00:02:08.210> fun<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.840> got<00:02:09.470> really<00:02:09.830> into<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.540> I'm

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
almost fun I got really into it and I'm

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.860 
almost fun I got really into it and I'm
very<00:02:11.600> competitive<00:02:12.020> so<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:13.150> lost<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.450> couple

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
very competitive so I lost a couple

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.330 
very competitive so I lost a couple
times<00:02:15.170> which<00:02:15.770> sucks<00:02:16.130> but<00:02:17.350> he<00:02:18.350> was<00:02:18.590> I<00:02:18.950> think

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
times which sucks but he was I think

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.990 
times which sucks but he was I think
that<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:21.200> storyline<00:02:21.800> they<00:02:22.520> followed<00:02:22.910> it

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
that the storyline they followed it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.280 
that the storyline they followed it
great<00:02:23.360> but<00:02:23.810> they<00:02:24.140> should<00:02:24.350> not<00:02:24.380> have<00:02:24.650> done<00:02:24.860> it

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
great but they should not have done it

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.940 
great but they should not have done it
through<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.800> fights<00:02:28.070> because<00:02:29.650> even<00:02:30.650> if<00:02:30.770> you

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
through the fights because even if you

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.500 
through the fights because even if you
win<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.370> fight<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.790> that's<00:02:31.910> not<00:02:32.180> how<00:02:32.330> it<00:02:32.420> was

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
win the fight and that's not how it was

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.650 
win the fight and that's not how it was
in<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.810> storyline<00:02:33.200> then<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:34.190> still<00:02:34.430> lose

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
in the storyline then you still lose

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.970 
in the storyline then you still lose
type<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.810> place<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:37.209> I<00:02:38.230> think<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:39.350> if<00:02:39.620> they

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
type of place and I think that if they

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.620 
type of place and I think that if they
were<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.250> do<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.700> storyline<00:02:41.120> they<00:02:41.360> should<00:02:41.510> do

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
were to do the storyline they should do

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.150 
were to do the storyline they should do
it<00:02:41.750> in<00:02:41.810> between<00:02:41.959> fights<00:02:42.380> living<00:02:42.830> up<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.070> the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
it in between fights living up to the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.440 
it in between fights living up to the
next<00:02:43.370> one<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.780> just<00:02:45.020> felt<00:02:45.260> like<00:02:45.350> I<00:02:45.530> was

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
next one it just felt like I was

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.550 
next one it just felt like I was
watching<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.900> series

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
watching the series

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.670 
watching the series
kind<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:51.650> changing<00:02:52.650> enough<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.400> series<00:02:54.330> and

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
kind of changing enough the series and

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.980 
kind of changing enough the series and
they<00:02:55.680> should<00:02:55.920> do<00:02:56.220> what<00:02:56.880> if<00:02:57.000> scenarios

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
they should do what if scenarios

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.250 
they should do what if scenarios
like<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.920> know<00:02:59.300> the<00:03:00.300> story<00:03:00.540> lines<00:03:00.750> are<00:03:00.990> great

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
like you know the story lines are great

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.810 
like you know the story lines are great
and<00:03:01.500> I'm<00:03:01.740> glad<00:03:01.950> they<00:03:02.130> followed<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.640> series

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
and I'm glad they followed the series

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:10.220 
and I'm glad they followed the series
but<00:03:03.360> if<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:05.070> win<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:08.810> that's<00:03:09.810> how<00:03:09.900> it's<00:03:10.140> not

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
but if I win and that's how it's not

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.900 
but if I win and that's how it's not
really<00:03:10.290> should<00:03:10.620> happen<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.310> they<00:03:11.580> should<00:03:11.790> do

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
really should happen and they should do

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.000 
really should happen and they should do
like<00:03:12.800> what<00:03:13.800> would<00:03:13.920> happen<00:03:14.310> next<00:03:15.860> that<00:03:16.860> would

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
like what would happen next that would

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.250 
like what would happen next that would
be<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.160> best<00:03:17.250> way<00:03:17.490> to<00:03:17.610> put<00:03:17.880> it<00:03:20.960> other<00:03:21.960> than

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
be the best way to put it other than

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.520 
be the best way to put it other than
that<00:03:22.380> it's<00:03:22.770> just<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.690> just<00:03:24.690> think<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:25.260> was<00:03:25.350> just

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
that it's just I just think it was just

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.470 
that it's just I just think it was just
like<00:03:25.740> the<00:03:25.770> same<00:03:26.070> one<00:03:26.280> once<00:03:26.550> I<00:03:26.730> station<00:03:27.270> I

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
like the same one once I station I

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.500 
like the same one once I station I
enjoyed<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.740> I<00:03:29.510> love<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.660> series<00:03:31.050> so
