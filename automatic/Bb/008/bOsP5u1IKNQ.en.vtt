00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.200
 Hello dear friends, this card 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.919
 hidden village and want to show today 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.480
 one fight isu creeps on sixth levels 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:20.000
 at these levels battles usually take place 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.730
 fun and fervently average last no more 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.470
 5 minutes but there are of course exceptions like 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.689
 in this battle when the opponent has more 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.730
 hard setup we are with guys on the lungs and 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.039
 medium tanks our opponents in more 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.670
 heavy composition you see they have a couple 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.160
 kv-2 and t-150 for kv-2 any tank from ours 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.829
 the command is one hundred percent one for 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.870
 t-150 max for 2 splash that is 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.640
 can not be substituted and the very beginning 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.120
 it was clear that this fight would not be 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.280
 easy 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.410
 Moreover, the opponent becomes def on 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.539
 to our base and stupidly waiting when we 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.969
 Framed under his gun at anything 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.039
 In principle, we will deal with and not immediately 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.379
 it went wrong that they heard where to go 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.660
 someone sent the wrong way and as a result 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.179
 wrong ride and loss in composition 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.970
 in general, the beginning of the battle is absolutely uninteresting 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.920
 and skating on the map and start draining but I 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.720
 I did not want to talk about it 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.600
 virtually no team play experience 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.909
 then as I often cat and one less often 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.740
 cocked and many things for me just don't 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.900
 clear all the same game in random 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.610
 different from team play when needed 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.860
 be able to listen to the commander correctly 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.890
 define focus understand how to cover up 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.299
 shot comrades split damage 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.729
 it turned out to be quite a difficult matter and 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.380
 starting to play as a team I often see how 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.479
 guys with lower efficiency 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.610
 wins due to tactics spent 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.530
 skills apparently not easy to go in and 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.509
 drive in u crepe and a competent 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.310
 team game I think needed 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.079
 I wanted to periodically train some 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.299
 teamwork that is when you understand 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.579
 what to do and how when it means your on 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.049
 what technique plays think better of 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.130
 must first know and understand 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.229
 field commander 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.990
 I repeat I have very little experience of the game 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.520
 in the mouths and fortified ah I could be wrong but 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.649
 something tells me that in victory 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.780
 teams half success depends on 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.619
 the commander as far as he understands that 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.570
 have to do 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.670
 who should shine who 9 cause damage 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.560
 what position of studies to predict where 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.869
 the enemy will attack ie read 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.670
 depending on the color of what to expect well 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.020
 and of course the skills are understandable in short 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.970
 give orders to track 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.680
 the correctness of their performance that is 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.690
 send your team as standard 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.950
 the beginning of the battle on the map and think that everything 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.410
 will happen by itself 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.820
 incorrect machines constant control and 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.010
 predict further action 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.590
 enemy team and better to be one step 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.720
 ahead and take countermeasures it's all in 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.180
 Ideally, unfortunately, in fact, not all of this 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.230
 well and the second half of success 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.630
 your personal skill 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.970
 understandable that field literacy solves 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.680
 and yet the commander gives those orders 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.020
 about the correctness of its implementation depends 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.270
 already from you, that is, if you are told 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.520
 shine some flank this does not mean 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.320
 Light at any cost I think good 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.390
 small your team lose light 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.070
 the beginning of the battle or on ted and heroically 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.470
 go alone to the team 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.920
 the enemy and you immediately blow off from 1 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.140
 a photo 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.580
 you need to act correctly correctly 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.170
 following the instructions of the commander 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.870
 although there is one very important one too 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.370
 nuance is trust commander precisely 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.290
 trust in the person who gives 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.570
 orders that is if you trust and 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.040
 understand that his actions are literate you 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.290
 think less about tactics 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.910
 you are focused on the game and just 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.730
 follow orders I try to win 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.519
 if there is no trust , fermentation begins 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.440
 and whether to go here and whether I need 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.900
 move quickly from change position or 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.150
 I'll still shoot here and not better 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.519
 whether to go on line 1 not to go in the center 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.739
 overall you start to get distracted from the game 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.630
 trying to analyze tactics and how 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.500
 make it better not anymore 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.690
 team game 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.730
 but just randomly skating in fortifications ah and 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.860
 here you can only hope for 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.890
 yourself as now our hero thanks 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.299
 its competent game and great luck 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.760
 starting to send opponents one by one 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.470
 others in the hangar and apparently we are together 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.299
 could do it much faster 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.760
 literate despite the heavier 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.799
 setup opponent if one cromwell smog 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.480
 wrestle with the opposing team the 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.400
 us 6 literate medium and light tanks 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.280
 should have just broken the team 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.920
 adversary 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.050
 but if yes if only i had it all 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.209
 because no matter what happens and 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.430
 what opponent comes across need victory 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.380
 always believe the main thing in my opinion 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.690
 the right approach and competent team 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.940
 on and of course damn luck like u 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.950
 our hero is good to play 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.079
 In my opinion it is think that everything is already 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.090
 equal product and you have nothing to lose and 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.070
 so you relax and play on 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.169
 intuitions go so to speak woban 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.060
 do things intuitively that 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.280
 normal setting would be considered dangerous 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.530
 apparently the enemy is not even wrong 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.900
 expected such a turn relaxed and 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.550
 believed that already winning him alone 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.800
 as you will see whether so much believe in 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.020
 victory that went to eat my mother's soup either 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.240
 just tired and left the game throwing a tank 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.250
 after all the strains of our cromwell 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.530
 Has handed over a pleasant tasty as a sleeping 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.300
 ap-2 in general never give up no 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.160
 discouraged no matter what 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.229
 always believe in the commanderâ€™s skill and 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.390
 maybe someday he will appear 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.520
 roll in creams this is an opportunity not 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.479
 just make but fast pump 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.450
 technique with good luck 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.830
 circumstances and today I have everything 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.169
 thank you for coming 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.030
