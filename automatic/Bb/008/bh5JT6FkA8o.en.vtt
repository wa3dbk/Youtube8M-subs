by<00:01:04.400> doing<00:01:04.790> a<00:01:05.059> green<00:01:05.239> roof<00:01:05.540> you<00:01:05.870> can<00:01:05.900> reduce

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
by doing a green roof you can reduce

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.830 
by doing a green roof you can reduce
heat<00:01:06.620> island<00:01:06.920> effects<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:07.460> can<00:01:07.840> reduce

heat island effects you can reduce

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.200 
heat island effects you can reduce
carbon

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
carbon

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.970 
carbon
you<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.390> absorb<00:01:12.900> water<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.590> lot<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.860> that

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
you can absorb water and a lot of that

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.710 
you can absorb water and a lot of that
water<00:01:14.160> doesn't<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.790> going<00:01:15.090> into<00:01:15.240> your<00:01:15.420> sewage

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
system so there's a lot of great reasons

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.600 
system so there's a lot of great reasons
for<00:01:18.300> doing<00:01:18.540> green<00:01:18.750> roofs<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:20.250> know<00:01:20.340> for

excited
we<00:02:35.790> also<00:02:36.200> do<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> lot<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.470> planting<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:38.100> earth

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
we also do a lot of planting in earth

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.980 
we also do a lot of planting in earth
boxes<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.940> earth<00:02:39.090> boxes<00:02:39.510> are<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.690> sub

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
boxes and earth boxes are a sub

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.470 
boxes and earth boxes are a sub
irrigated<00:02:40.560> planter<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.520> basically<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.270> water

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
irrigated planter so basically you water

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.330 
irrigated planter so basically you water
it<00:02:42.660> through<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.870> small<00:02:43.110> tube<00:02:43.320> in<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.590> side<00:02:43.800> goes

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
it through a small tube in the side goes

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.610 
it through a small tube in the side goes
down<00:02:44.370> into<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.820> reservoir<00:02:45.240> it<00:02:45.780> wicks<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.320> water

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
down into a reservoir it wicks the water

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.680 
down into a reservoir it wicks the water
up<00:02:46.830> into<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.220> soil<00:02:47.460> so<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.880> uses<00:02:48.210> half<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
up into the soil so it uses half the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.210 
up into the soil so it uses half the
amount<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.080> water<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.650> normally<00:02:49.830> would

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
amount of water that you normally would

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.950 
amount of water that you normally would
use<00:02:50.400> for<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> pitcher<00:02:51.180> I'm<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.630> then<00:02:51.690> there's<00:02:51.900> a

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
use for a pitcher I'm and then there's a

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.930 
use for a pitcher I'm and then there's a
plastic<00:02:52.530> cover<00:02:52.800> that<00:02:52.890> kind<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.340> mulches<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
plastic cover that kind of mulches the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.280 
plastic cover that kind of mulches the
top<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.810> when<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.020> water<00:02:55.170> evaporates

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
top of it so when the water evaporates

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.440 
top of it so when the water evaporates
it<00:02:55.950> hits<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.820> then<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.060> goes<00:02:57.180> back<00:02:57.420> down

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
it hits that and then it goes back down

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.090 
it hits that and then it goes back down
into<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.960> soil<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.740> completely

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
into the soil and so it completely

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.590 
into the soil and so it completely
regenerates<00:02:59.730> itself<00:02:59.880> creates<00:03:00.360> its<00:03:00.510> own

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
regenerates itself creates its own

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.560 
regenerates itself creates its own
ecosystem<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:01.680> how<00:03:01.860> do<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.010> actually

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
ecosystem so how do you actually

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.330 
ecosystem so how do you actually
transport<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.720> food<00:03:03.960> from<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.530> roof<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:05.310> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
transport the food from the roof to the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.280 
transport the food from the roof to the
restaurant<00:03:06.060> do<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.210> have<00:03:06.330> like<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.510> lift<00:03:06.870> or<00:03:07.200> do

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
restaurant do you have like a lift or do

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.660 
restaurant do you have like a lift or do
people<00:03:07.320> need<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.740> be<00:03:07.860> going<00:03:08.130> up<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.370> down<00:03:08.430> the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
people need to be going up and down the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.260 
people need to be going up and down the
stairs

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
stairs

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.870 
stairs
we<00:03:09.630> actually<00:03:09.780> harvest<00:03:10.770> using<00:03:11.160> simple<00:03:11.700> bowls

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
with this farm not only

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.280 
with this farm not only
for<00:03:25.210> the<00:03:25.270> restaurant<00:03:25.690> which<00:03:25.780> is<00:03:25.810> mutually

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
for the restaurant which is mutually

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.860 
for the restaurant which is mutually
beneficial<00:03:26.320> for<00:03:26.920> us<00:03:27.090> as<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.150> business<00:03:28.390> model

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
beneficial for us as a business model

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.300 
beneficial for us as a business model
but<00:03:29.050> also<00:03:29.230> because<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.800> tastes<00:03:30.100> so<00:03:30.190> much

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
but also because it tastes so much

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.810 
but also because it tastes so much
better<00:03:30.850> but<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.990> huge<00:03:32.410> component<00:03:32.800> of<00:03:33.070> this<00:03:33.250> is

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
better but a huge component of this is

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.460 
better but a huge component of this is
that<00:03:33.850> we<00:03:34.330> can<00:03:34.570> teach<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.050> rest<00:03:35.200> of<00:03:35.380> the

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
that we can teach the rest of the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.380 
that we can teach the rest of the
community<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:36.010> do<00:03:36.130> this<00:03:36.250> too<00:03:36.580> and<00:03:36.820> if<00:03:36.940> we're

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
community to do this too and if we're

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.230 
community to do this too and if we're
one<00:03:37.630> room<00:03:37.900> we<00:03:38.500> can<00:03:38.680> get<00:03:38.830> more<00:03:39.070> rooms<00:03:39.400> then<00:03:40.090> it's

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
one room we can get more rooms then it's

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.000 
one room we can get more rooms then it's
only<00:03:40.360> going<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.660> increase<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.440> impact<00:03:41.830> that

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
only going to increase the impact that

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.590 
only going to increase the impact that
we<00:03:42.130> have<00:03:42.160> on<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.460> environment<00:03:43.030> that's<00:03:43.510> going
