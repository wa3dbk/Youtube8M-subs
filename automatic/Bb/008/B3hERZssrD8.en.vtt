00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.370
 next to all the apps we should 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.650
 Of course we also look if we are with this 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.600
 You can surf well 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.820
 start the browser on the synonymous 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.730
 globe pressed and hooks we are 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.900
 here on www handy - at the destination 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.700
 de / forum you see the blue loading bar 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.590
 and the page is loaded 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.070
 first of all the device is supported by 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:29.260
 what once gprs edge ums hsdpa hsupa 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.630
 and wlan no lte yes the exchange sees 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.449
 first off if you see scrolling 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.670
 her if her court scott is coming here 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.110
 power to enter a new url here 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.900
 do you have more features namely 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.180
 you can add bookmarks plus 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.979
 press to open a new tab and 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.909
 then we are here we go 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:51.479
 another page the world for example 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.129
 Mobile adapted look like that looks like 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:58.119
 we are loaded with google 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.430
 Of course, did not tender and 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:03.729
 Now we come to mobile births 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.700
 come as you can see that looks like 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.880
 Relatively fast to load 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.369
 I change to the other tabs 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.740
 Now we are back on the side 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.579
 double cab and the text will be posted here 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.369
 display size adjusted we can see 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:24.729
 Let's go here for a news 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.130
 again be exactly the same as without 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.200
 adapted and i would say if i did 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.240
 that can be judged so now you can 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.799
 actually read the display well 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.829
 is big enough the text is natural 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.630
 a bit small so you can go too 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:42.219
 so it's so that you can read here 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.320
 with the devices I think well yes mobile 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.630
 surfing can also be on the go and texts 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.429
 Can read blogs and news 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.929
 but what else can the browser do? 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.609
 if we press settings 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.899
 We update here home as 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:54.609
 save bookmarks 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.200
 to read offline always save 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.090
 practically if you find an article 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.280
 soon want to read later, you are can 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.780
 Of course, they have side parts on the side 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.060
 can search desktop version Show 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.270
 further attitude but we have 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.890
 here general data protection and so on 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.500
 yes that's the browser so first 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.490
 relatively simple kept the essential 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.290
 functions though 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.060
 so much that he's me when you're up 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.810
 bookmark then you have yours here 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.220
 Bookmark the history and stored 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.540
 so let's test the youtube app 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.090
 how this works how fast 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.730
 video lives that way you look first 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.990
 we do not know them tomorrow 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.230
 introduction more than that are looking for a 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.610
 video with foam her fast invites me 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.610
 start the video is loading 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:49.590
 then it's really just us 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.590
 fall 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:22.330
 window fast we can see 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.310
 do another test and 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.310
 Although I downloaded an app 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.800
 once here the speed test will look us 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.330
 the results of 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.900
 so we want to test but run 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.100
 let then you see the results here 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.350
 I stop that then in a same 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.080
 wlan of course to you always 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:49.239
 to show with different devices 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.670
 how good results i am 16 2 mbit 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.600
