 Very popular late 1950s This is a 1959 guitar 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.739
 Well, but this time I'm out in the fact that Jackson Browne Yukari guitar introduction 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.699
 Also 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:49.540

 Jackson Brown Mainly Gibson's Vintage Guitar 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.890

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.579
 On the page 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.220
 I started to play, but from the TSE 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:07.430
 I have always used Royce or cf 100 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:11.930
 Also oh well comparatively early I was using the old guitar of this j 45 in conjunction with the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.719
 Recently, it has become just a maniac skill but after all 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.540
 Great grandfather frau 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:16.650
 But 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.880
 Back then 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:26.280
 I stand using j 45, but after the good balance of the sound after all 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.320
 Sound or powerful sound a little muddy sound cool sound after all 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.370
 It was good 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.540
 I am 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:36.500
 This time the instrument is very beautiful 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.030
 I say this in quite the 50's 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.390
 new It is a difficult instrument to be able to go around 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.260
 The top is spruce in spec 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.680
 so 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.280
 Side and back-cancer products 2 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.620
 Mahogany neck 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.840
 7 4 format each 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.060
 What 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:03.210
 In 59 years there is also an option adjustment option 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.420
 Also this is a slot type bridge instrument of the type where that box sound is direct 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.420
 is 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:18.790
 I know quite a massive sound frozen in still overwhelmingly in the door Well, your party partial 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.790
 It may be difficult to understand after recording but it is really 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:27.710
 Well N high, such as coming sounded and Gahan in stomach 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:33.650
 Summer is a sense of box noise 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:36.400
 I feel completely different from the air when it is a bat day This age is j 40 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.400
 Of course that 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.760
 Two people are very good even if you play with feeling 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.600
 Another though is what a good sound musical instrument 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.580
 It is called a gur in the stroke 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.270
 Say to the 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:59.690
 I think that is very attractive 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:03.240
 Actually, not only that Jackson Brown but also musicians all over the world 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.990
 Because I play using j 45 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.310
 It is highly appreciated 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.980
 I think 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.420
 Load the sound itself 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:16.690
 The feature is really from the box sound of the example 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:23.440
 A bit muddy Kashakasha hall of corn with 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:25.310
 Is very characteristic place called Anou Although it what so say the sound balance is scrupulously 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.680
 Thought 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.819
 Yup 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.190
 In fact n stages 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.800
 If you get 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.180
 I think that is understood well the Tteyuu Kuru atmosphere to say 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.600
 It is a shop by all means 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.110
 If you pull it and see it 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:48.050
 J 40 minutes of this age is already quite 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:52.870
 Gone with a premium hand Well Kedomo price I know its own way that 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.970
 It 's a musical instrument with more sound and quality than it is 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.470
 It is recommended enough 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.560
 By the way, it is the price, but also here 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:08.099
 Consumption tax included at 594,000 yen 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.099
 Hard case is properly attached Oh rs is normal 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:19.500
 I think if recommended guitar Shi refers to really even Well 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.500
 Well depending on a little towards the top in passing of things 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.760
