bleeding<00:00:07.410> something<00:00:08.250> if<00:00:08.490> it's<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.790> hydraulic

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
bleeding something if it's a hydraulic

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.940 
bleeding something if it's a hydraulic
system<00:00:09.540> whether<00:00:09.840> it's<00:00:10.019> your<00:00:10.139> suspension<00:00:10.740> for

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
system whether it's your suspension for

system whether it's your suspension for
for<00:00:11.250> your<00:00:11.370> disc<00:00:11.580> brake<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.960> are

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
for your disc brake is that you are

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.379 
for your disc brake is that you are
getting<00:00:13.860> all<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.519> air<00:00:14.670> out<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.240> system

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
getting all of the air out of the system

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.310 
getting all of the air out of the system
so<00:00:15.780> all<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:16.049> have<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.379> fluid<00:00:17.930> most<00:00:18.930> disc

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
with is avid they have a little bit

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.160 
with is avid they have a little bit
sleeker<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.520> master<00:00:59.910> cylinder<00:01:00.300> they<00:01:00.960> like

dot 3 or dot 4.1 fluid let me show you

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.880 
dot 3 or dot 4.1 fluid let me show you
roughly<00:01:06.360> how<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.630> bleed<00:01:07.380> both<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.799> these

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
roughly how to bleed both of these

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.140 
roughly how to bleed both of these
systems<00:01:08.100> because<00:01:08.549> they're<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:08.939> bit

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
systems because they're a little bit

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.980 
systems because they're a little bit
different<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.900> will<00:01:10.650> start<00:01:10.920> off<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.990> avid

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
different I will start off with the avid

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.830 
different I will start off with the avid
or<00:01:13.200> which<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.130> me<00:01:14.280> ah<00:01:14.460> yeah<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> avid<00:01:15.630> breaks

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
or which is me ah yeah the avid breaks

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.920 
or which is me ah yeah the avid breaks
first<00:01:17.330> avid<00:01:18.330> has<00:01:18.450> their<00:01:18.600> own<00:01:18.630> proprietary

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
syringes that you fill with fluid so you

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.560 
syringes that you fill with fluid so you
push<00:01:28.110> fluid<00:01:28.530> through<00:01:28.799> one<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:30.329> start

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
push fluid through one and you start

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.480 
push fluid through one and you start
down<00:01:30.689> here<00:01:30.720> at<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.990> caliper<00:01:31.430> there's<00:01:32.430> a
