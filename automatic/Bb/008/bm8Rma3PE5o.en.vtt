simply by using some tape like I did or
you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.150> use<00:01:36.210> some<00:01:36.540> hot<00:01:36.750> glue<00:01:36.960> or<00:01:37.369> liquid<00:01:38.369> tape

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
you can use some hot glue or liquid tape

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.109 
you can use some hot glue or liquid tape
it<00:01:38.939> doesn't<00:01:39.299> matter<00:01:40.310> in<00:01:41.310> your<00:01:41.369> kit<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.090> will

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
it doesn't matter in your kit you will

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.450 
it doesn't matter in your kit you will
find<00:01:42.479> these<00:01:42.630> very<00:01:42.899> long<00:01:43.110> screws<00:01:43.530> these<00:01:44.280> are

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
find these very long screws these are

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.710 
find these very long screws these are
the<00:01:44.520> screws<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.939> are<00:01:45.000> used<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.390> fold<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the screws that are used to fold the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.050 
the screws that are used to fold the
arms<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:46.170> push<00:01:47.130> them<00:01:47.310> through<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.670> bottom<00:01:47.939> of

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
arms on push them through the bottom of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.560 
arms on push them through the bottom of
the<00:01:48.149> plate<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.750> see<00:01:48.960> here<00:01:50.119> then<00:01:51.119> using<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
the plate like you see here then using a

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.300 
the plate like you see here then using a
piece<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.750> tape<00:01:52.049> put<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.619> onto<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.920> back<00:01:53.159> to

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
piece of tape put it onto the back to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.700 
piece of tape put it onto the back to
hold<00:01:53.430> them<00:01:53.670> into<00:01:53.790> place

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.080 

this<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.950> stops<00:01:59.220> them<00:01:59.430> from<00:01:59.460> falling<00:01:59.820> out

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
this just stops them from falling out

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.670 
this just stops them from falling out
when<00:02:00.300> you<00:02:00.390> flip<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.780> board<00:02:00.960> over<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.620> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
when you flip the board over for the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:10.999 
when you flip the board over for the
next<00:02:01.950> stage<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.430> build<00:02:09.770> now<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.830> can

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
next stage of the build now you can

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.130 
next stage of the build now you can
place<00:02:11.250> those<00:02:11.460> forearms<00:02:11.850> onto<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.900> screws

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
place those forearms onto the screws

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.660 
place those forearms onto the screws
which<00:02:13.440> you've<00:02:13.620> just<00:02:13.800> bought<00:02:13.950> into<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.370> bottom

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
which you've just bought into the bottom

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.180 
which you've just bought into the bottom
plate<00:02:17.630> now<00:02:18.630> using<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.140> shorter<00:02:19.500> spaces<00:02:19.980> in

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
plate now using the shorter spaces in

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.150 
plate now using the shorter spaces in
the<00:02:20.220> kids<00:02:20.550> place<00:02:20.910> them<00:02:21.060> over<00:02:21.270> these<00:02:21.510> screws<00:02:22.160> do

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
the kids place them over these screws do

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.340 
the kids place them over these screws do
this<00:02:23.340> for<00:02:23.520> all<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.820> your<00:02:23.970> arms<00:02:30.140> now<00:02:31.140> let's

let's add these Lots these nuts will go

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.059 
let's add these Lots these nuts will go
on<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.140> screws<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.739> have<00:03:28.860> gone<00:03:29.010> through

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
on to the screws that have gone through

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:35.569 
on to the screws that have gone through
that<00:03:29.489> second<00:03:29.910> plate<00:03:33.950> all<00:03:34.950> four<00:03:35.310> corners

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
screws in place make sure that the arms

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.240 
screws in place make sure that the arms
are<00:03:50.430> now<00:03:50.549> nice<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.819> title<00:03:51.829> now<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:53.069> that's

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
are now nice and title now that that's

are now nice and title now that that's
done<00:03:53.390> use<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.569> two<00:03:54.780> millimeter<00:03:55.260> hex<00:03:55.560> screws

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
done use the two millimeter hex screws

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.309 
done use the two millimeter hex screws
to<00:03:56.730> screw<00:03:57.060> through<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.510> top<00:03:57.720> plate<00:03:57.989> into

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
to screw through the top plate into

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:19.760 
to screw through the top plate into
these<00:03:58.980> spaces

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.260 

now<00:04:20.770> we're<00:04:20.950> going<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.160> add<00:04:21.370> our<00:04:21.640> main<00:04:21.910> plate

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
now we're going to add our main plate

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.690 
now we're going to add our main plate
this<00:04:23.230> is<00:04:23.380> what's<00:04:23.560> known<00:04:23.770> as<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.040> clean<00:04:24.370> plate

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
this is what's known as a clean plate

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.610 
this is what's known as a clean plate
this<00:04:25.270> actually<00:04:25.510> sits<00:04:25.900> on<00:04:26.110> those<00:04:26.260> little<00:04:26.500> bit

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
this actually sits on those little bit

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.500 
this actually sits on those little bit
isolation<00:04:27.220> melts<00:04:27.550> away<00:04:27.910> from<00:04:28.270> all<00:04:28.390> the

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
through the holes in the plate here you

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.650 
through the holes in the plate here you
