00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.009 
stay still so don't touch that and last
and<00:02:27.730> probably<00:02:28.120> least<00:02:30.420> you've<00:02:31.420> got<00:02:31.660> your<00:02:31.780> basic

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
and probably least you've got your basic

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.970 
and probably least you've got your basic
door<00:02:32.620> shape<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:34.480> now<00:02:34.630> what<00:02:34.810> we're<00:02:34.959> gonna<00:02:35.050> do<00:02:35.319> is

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
door shape so now what we're gonna do is

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.699 
door shape so now what we're gonna do is
we're<00:02:36.250> gonna<00:02:36.310> go<00:02:36.550> again<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.390> stacker<00:02:37.709> we're

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
we're gonna go again to stacker we're

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.130 
we're gonna go again to stacker we're
gonna<00:02:38.950> keep<00:02:39.370> going<00:02:39.430> through<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.540> options

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
gonna keep going through the options

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.339 
gonna keep going through the options
until<00:02:41.319> we<00:02:41.560> find<00:02:41.799> what<00:02:41.980> we<00:02:42.099> want<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.340> find<00:02:43.349> and

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
until we find what we want to find and

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.670 
until we find what we want to find and
the<00:02:45.220> theory<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:46.150> should<00:02:46.330> be<00:02:46.569> behind<00:02:47.140> or

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
the theory it should be behind or

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.520 
the theory it should be behind or
something<00:02:48.010> like<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.760> which<00:02:49.690> might<00:02:50.230> even<00:02:50.260> be

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
something like that which might even be

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.660 
something like that which might even be
left<00:02:50.860> actually<00:02:51.190> left<00:02:51.760> alright<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:53.130> don't<00:02:54.130> keep

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
left actually left alright I don't keep

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.500 
left actually left alright I don't keep
it<00:02:54.880> my<00:02:55.299> memory<00:02:55.840> sorry<00:02:56.250> could<00:02:57.250> be<00:02:57.370> down<00:02:57.610> yep

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
it my memory sorry could be down yep

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.220 
it my memory sorry could be down yep
that's<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.400> now<00:03:00.790> if<00:03:01.120> we<00:03:01.299> go<00:03:01.480> up<00:03:01.690> we<00:03:02.079> can

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
that's it so now if we go up we can

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.569 
that's it so now if we go up we can
actually<00:03:02.440> see<00:03:02.920> for<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.209> is<00:03:05.010> like<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.190> little

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
actually see for that is like a little

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.670 
actually see for that is like a little
extender<00:03:07.090> can<00:03:07.780> also<00:03:07.900> see<00:03:08.170> this<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.530> middle

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
extender can also see this the middle

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.240 
extender can also see this the middle
piece<00:03:08.920> that's<00:03:09.130> gonna<00:03:09.190> go<00:03:09.540> bye-bye<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:12.100> now

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
piece that's gonna go bye-bye so now

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.069 
piece that's gonna go bye-bye so now
it's<00:03:12.489> gone<00:03:12.700> it's<00:03:13.299> still<00:03:13.510> frozen<00:03:13.720> in<00:03:13.959> place

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
it's gone it's still frozen in place

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.650 
it's gone it's still frozen in place
which<00:03:14.769> makes<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.130> really<00:03:15.190> good<00:03:15.459> now<00:03:16.180> just<00:03:16.480> be

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
which makes it really good now just be

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.400 
which makes it really good now just be
extra<00:03:17.140> extra<00:03:17.319> extra<00:03:18.069> careful<00:03:18.690> we<00:03:19.690> are<00:03:20.019> going

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
extra extra extra careful we are going

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.690 
extra extra extra careful we are going
to<00:03:20.790> no<00:03:21.790> collider<00:03:22.260> right<00:03:23.260> there<00:03:26.280> because<00:03:27.280> we're

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
to no collider right there because we're

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.400 
to no collider right there because we're
gonna<00:03:27.790> make<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:28.060> open<00:03:28.329> that<00:03:28.359> way<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:29.200> if<00:03:29.319> you

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
gonna make it open that way and if you

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.870 
gonna make it open that way and if you
want<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.650> make<00:03:29.739> it<00:03:29.859> open<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.340> other<00:03:30.459> way<00:03:30.609> well

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
want to make it open the other way well

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.030 
want to make it open the other way well
I<00:03:31.150> think<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:31.750> can<00:03:31.900> figure<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.139> one<00:03:32.440> that<00:03:32.920> one

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
I think you can figure that one that one

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.370 
I think you can figure that one that one
out<00:03:33.190> for<00:03:33.280> yourself<00:03:33.750> now<00:03:34.750> what<00:03:34.930> we're<00:03:35.079> gonna<00:03:35.139> do

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
out for yourself now what we're gonna do

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.379 
out for yourself now what we're gonna do
is<00:03:35.500> we're<00:03:35.620> gonna<00:03:35.739> go<00:03:35.980> out<00:03:36.130> to<00:03:36.160> slider<00:03:36.549> now<00:03:37.359> I

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
is we're gonna go out to slider now I

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.240 
is we're gonna go out to slider now I
know<00:03:37.600> heaps<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.440> heaps<00:03:38.530> of<00:03:38.799> people<00:03:38.859> say

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
know heaps and heaps of people say

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.520 
know heaps and heaps of people say
slider<00:03:39.790> sucks<00:03:40.120> but<00:03:40.480> I'm<00:03:40.750> teaching<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.440> this

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
slider sucks but I'm teaching it this

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.860 
slider sucks but I'm teaching it this
way<00:03:41.709> so<00:03:41.769> they<00:03:42.190> can<00:03:42.340> get<00:03:42.430> over<00:03:42.489> themselves<00:03:45.870> so

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
way so they can get over themselves so

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.020 
way so they can get over themselves so
just<00:03:47.350> roughly<00:03:47.739> about<00:03:47.920> there<00:03:48.280> don't<00:03:48.670> smart

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
just roughly about there don't smart

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.090 
just roughly about there don't smart
step<00:03:49.269> it<00:03:49.420> because<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:50.139> will<00:03:50.440> really<00:03:50.709> not

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
step it because that will really not

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.550 
step it because that will really not
work<00:03:51.660> next<00:03:52.660> what<00:03:52.810> we're<00:03:52.900> gonna<00:03:53.019> do<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.380> we're

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
work next what we're gonna do is we're

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.370 
work next what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:03:53.620> go<00:03:53.859> wire<00:03:54.389> if<00:03:55.389> you<00:03:55.569> don't<00:03:55.750> have<00:03:55.870> way<00:03:56.079> you

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
gonna go wire if you don't have way you

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.319 
gonna go wire if you don't have way you
can<00:03:56.530> get<00:03:56.709> it<00:03:56.829> from<00:03:57.040> practically<00:03:57.609> anywhere<00:03:57.670> and

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
can get it from practically anywhere and

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.990 
can get it from practically anywhere and
watch<00:03:58.660> other<00:03:58.870> YouTube<00:03:59.230> videos<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.799> might<00:04:00.760> even

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
watch other YouTube videos I might even

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.900 
watch other YouTube videos I might even
do<00:04:01.329> one<00:04:01.540> on<00:04:01.920> how<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:02.950> download<00:04:03.220> it<00:04:03.549> but<00:04:03.639> I<00:04:03.700> doubt

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
do one on how to download it but I doubt

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.400 
do one on how to download it but I doubt
it

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
it

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.180 
it
hydraulics<00:04:05.410> hit<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.769> whatever<00:04:05.920> you<00:04:06.160> want

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
hydraulics hit it to whatever you want

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.309 
hydraulics hit it to whatever you want
the<00:04:06.819> best<00:04:07.060> width<00:04:07.329> would<00:04:07.569> be<00:04:07.599> zero<00:04:08.049> so<00:04:08.290> you

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
the best width would be zero so you

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.069 
the best width would be zero so you
can't<00:04:08.590> even<00:04:08.799> see<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.130> but<00:04:09.670> I'm<00:04:10.420> just<00:04:10.690> doing<00:04:10.959> it

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
can't even see it but I'm just doing it

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.920 
can't even see it but I'm just doing it
so<00:04:11.109> that<00:04:11.260> you<00:04:11.470> can<00:04:11.620> see<00:04:11.799> it<00:04:12.389> you<00:04:13.389> want<00:04:13.599> to<00:04:13.780> get

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
so that you can see it you want to get

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.499 
so that you can see it you want to get
it<00:04:14.079> about<00:04:14.850> dead<00:04:15.850> center

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:16.509 
it about dead center

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.780 
it about dead center
bring<00:04:17.049> it<00:04:17.169> over

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.610 

it's<00:04:20.790> into<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.810> can<00:04:21.959> see<00:04:22.079> you<00:04:22.230> can<00:04:22.350> see<00:04:22.500> it's

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
it's into a you can see you can see it's

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.740 
it's into a you can see you can see it's
got<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.770> line<00:04:23.010> there<00:04:23.280> but<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.390> doesn't<00:04:24.630> really

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
got a line there but that doesn't really

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.660 
got a line there but that doesn't really
matter<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:26.330> places<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.480> box<00:04:28.130> now<00:04:29.130> we<00:04:29.160> can<00:04:29.490> see

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
matter and places the box now we can see

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.320 
matter and places the box now we can see
that<00:04:29.820> that<00:04:29.970> measurement<00:04:30.330> is<00:04:30.740> 97<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:33.120> is<00:04:33.300> a

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
that that measurement is 97 that is a

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.540 
that that measurement is 97 that is a
very<00:04:33.840> important<00:04:34.440> measurement<00:04:34.890> because

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
very important measurement because

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.740 
very important measurement because
that's<00:04:35.760> what's<00:04:35.970> going<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.180> come<00:04:36.390> into<00:04:36.540> your

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
that's what's going to come into your

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.280 
that's what's going to come into your
keypad<00:04:38.270> go<00:04:39.270> out<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.480> keep<00:04:39.630> air<00:04:39.810> which<00:04:39.990> might

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
keypad go out to keep air which might

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.570 
keypad go out to keep air which might
not<00:04:40.500> actually<00:04:40.680> come<00:04:40.920> with<00:04:40.950> my<00:04:41.190> mole<00:04:41.400> but<00:04:41.550> I

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
not actually come with my mole but I

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.560 
not actually come with my mole but I
think<00:04:41.790> it<00:04:41.850> does<00:04:43.100> my<00:04:44.100> past<00:04:44.310> is<00:04:44.490> just<00:04:44.550> 1<00:04:44.850> 2<00:04:44.970> 3<00:04:45.120> 4<00:04:45.360> 4

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
think it does my past is just 1 2 3 4 4

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.720 
think it does my past is just 1 2 3 4 4
now<00:04:45.690> because<00:04:45.870> it's<00:04:46.020> just<00:04:46.170> a<00:04:46.290> simple<00:04:46.590> video

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
now because it's just a simple video

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.910 
now because it's just a simple video
value<00:04:47.730> on<00:04:48.000> means<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:49.020> it's<00:04:49.140> closed<00:04:49.560> because

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
value on means that it's closed because

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.590 
value on means that it's closed because
if<00:04:50.130> you<00:04:50.220> want<00:04:50.370> this<00:04:50.490> door<00:04:51.420> to<00:04:52.370> open<00:04:53.480> thing<00:04:54.480> you

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
if you want this door to open thing you

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.570 
if you want this door to open thing you
need<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.780> sit<00:04:55.020> it's<00:04:55.140> with<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.470> hydraulic<00:04:55.890> pulls

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
need to sit it's with a hydraulic pulls

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.980 
need to sit it's with a hydraulic pulls
all<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:56.940> way<00:04:57.030> so<00:04:57.090> that<00:04:57.420> there's<00:04:57.600> none<00:04:57.780> of<00:04:57.900> it

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
all the way so that there's none of it

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.510 
all the way so that there's none of it
left

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
left

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.220 
left
but<00:04:59.520> value<00:04:59.820> off<00:05:00.030> which<00:05:00.420> means<00:05:00.660> there's<00:05:00.900> not

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
but value off which means there's not

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.750 
but value off which means there's not
when<00:05:01.410> you've<00:05:01.530> said<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:01.830> you<00:05:02.250> want<00:05:02.430> it<00:05:02.520> to<00:05:02.640> be

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
when you've said it you want it to be

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.270 
when you've said it you want it to be
whatever<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.330> measurement<00:05:03.720> was<00:05:04.070> which<00:05:05.070> was

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
whatever the measurement was which was

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.810 
whatever the measurement was which was
97<00:05:06.200> so<00:05:07.200> let's<00:05:07.380> get<00:05:07.530> rid<00:05:07.680> of<00:05:07.740> this<00:05:07.920> because<00:05:08.610> it

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
97 so let's get rid of this because it

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.240 
97 so let's get rid of this because it
was<00:05:08.910> 97<00:05:09.300> point<00:05:09.600> oh<00:05:09.720> we<00:05:09.930> can<00:05:10.050> just<00:05:10.080> write<00:05:10.380> 97<00:05:11.100> or

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
was 97 point oh we can just write 97 or

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.390 
was 97 point oh we can just write 97 or
you<00:05:11.370> can<00:05:11.490> be<00:05:11.550> precisely<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:12.060> point<00:05:12.270> oh<00:05:13.400> value

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
you can be precisely the point oh value

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.980 
you can be precisely the point oh value

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
going to make it stay on for I've just

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.610 
going to make it stay on for I've just
said<00:05:18.120> it<00:05:18.270> as<00:05:18.360> for<00:05:18.630> it's<00:05:18.930> a<00:05:19.050> good<00:05:19.200> you<00:05:19.560> know

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
said it as for it's a good you know

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.070 
said it as for it's a good you know
opening<00:05:20.280> door<00:05:20.490> sort<00:05:20.730> of<00:05:20.790> thing<00:05:20.970> that's<00:05:21.900> pretty

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
opening door sort of thing that's pretty

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.659 
opening door sort of thing that's pretty
much<00:05:22.230> all<00:05:22.470> you<00:05:22.620> need<00:05:22.650> to<00:05:22.919> do<00:05:23.040> as<00:05:23.250> long<00:05:23.430> as<00:05:23.490> it's

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
much all you need to do as long as it's

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.810 
much all you need to do as long as it's
like<00:05:23.910> that<00:05:24.180> you<00:05:24.570> should<00:05:24.780> be<00:05:24.930> good<00:05:25.700> lots<00:05:26.700> of

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
like that you should be good lots of

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.670 
like that you should be good lots of
other<00:05:26.970> cities<00:05:27.540> you<00:05:27.630> can<00:05:27.810> make<00:05:28.020> it<00:05:28.169> so<00:05:28.350> that<00:05:28.560> it

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
other cities you can make it so that it

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.850 
other cities you can make it so that it
only<00:05:28.860> goes<00:05:29.280> you<00:05:29.700> know<00:05:29.820> like<00:05:30.240> when<00:05:31.169> it<00:05:31.290> opens<00:05:31.680> it

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
only goes you know like when it opens it

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.590 
only goes you know like when it opens it
goes<00:05:32.040> like<00:05:32.250> halfway<00:05:32.520> across<00:05:32.880> and<00:05:33.330> whatever

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
goes like halfway across and whatever

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.360 
goes like halfway across and whatever
you<00:05:33.810> want<00:05:33.990> but<00:05:34.320> you<00:05:34.680> know<00:05:34.800> that's<00:05:34.919> just<00:05:35.250> the

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
you want but you know that's just the

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.820 
you want but you know that's just the
basic<00:05:35.790> principle<00:05:36.240> just<00:05:37.169> to<00:05:37.290> go<00:05:37.410> over<00:05:37.440> it<00:05:37.650> one

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
basic principle just to go over it one

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.469 
basic principle just to go over it one
more<00:05:37.890> time<00:05:38.190> for<00:05:38.400> those<00:05:38.490> who<00:05:38.550> didn't<00:05:38.880> care<00:05:39.090> here

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
more time for those who didn't care here

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.270 
more time for those who didn't care here
it<00:05:39.600> I'll<00:05:39.780> say<00:05:40.020> it<00:05:40.050> nice<00:05:40.260> and<00:05:40.290> slow<00:05:40.790> value<00:05:41.790> on<00:05:42.060> is

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
it I'll say it nice and slow value on is

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.500 
it I'll say it nice and slow value on is
when<00:05:44.280> it<00:05:44.790> goes<00:05:45.030> on<00:05:45.300> it<00:05:46.140> subtracts<00:05:46.530> the

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
when it goes on it subtracts the

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.990 
when it goes on it subtracts the
hydraulic<00:05:48.510> link<00:05:48.750> to<00:05:49.080> zero<00:05:49.380> when<00:05:50.220> value<00:05:50.610> is<00:05:50.760> off

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
hydraulic link to zero when value is off

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.760 
hydraulic link to zero when value is off
it<00:05:51.360> will<00:05:51.540> be<00:05:51.660> at<00:05:51.780> ninety<00:05:52.110> seven<00:05:52.440> point<00:05:52.710> zero

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
it will be at ninety seven point zero

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.590 
it will be at ninety seven point zero
because<00:05:53.340> that's<00:05:53.550> the<00:05:53.729> length<00:05:54.000> of<00:05:54.270> it<00:05:54.390> right

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
because that's the length of it right

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.770 
because that's the length of it right
now<00:05:54.630> and<00:05:55.290> we<00:05:55.410> want<00:05:55.560> it<00:05:55.710> like<00:05:55.860> that<00:05:56.390> the<00:05:57.390> value

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
now and we want it like that the value

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.630 
now and we want it like that the value
hold<00:05:58.110> length<00:05:58.440> is<00:05:59.120> how<00:06:00.120> long<00:06:00.510> it<00:06:00.810> will<00:06:00.990> stay

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
hold length is how long it will stay

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.690 
hold length is how long it will stay
value<00:06:02.640> on<00:06:02.880> which<00:06:03.479> basically<00:06:03.780> means<00:06:04.110> closed

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
value on which basically means closed

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.130 
value on which basically means closed
then<00:06:05.700> these<00:06:06.030> other<00:06:06.270> ones<00:06:06.540> you<00:06:06.780> don't<00:06:06.960> really

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
then these other ones you don't really

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.510 
then these other ones you don't really
need<00:06:07.350> to<00:06:07.470> know<00:06:07.530> about<00:06:07.740> but<00:06:08.040> you<00:06:08.130> kind<00:06:08.340> of<00:06:08.400> get

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
need to know about but you kind of get

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.670 
need to know about but you kind of get
them<00:06:08.700> when<00:06:08.850> you<00:06:08.940> read<00:06:09.120> them<00:06:09.800> into<00:06:10.800> queue<00:06:11.669> and

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
them when you read them into queue and

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.530 
them when you read them into queue and
wherever<00:06:13.680> you<00:06:13.830> place<00:06:14.610> it<00:06:14.820> it<00:06:15.030> doesn't<00:06:15.210> have<00:06:15.360> to

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
wherever you place it it doesn't have to

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.330 
wherever you place it it doesn't have to
be<00:06:15.630> next<00:06:15.810> third<00:06:16.050> or<00:06:16.169> anything<00:06:16.350> that<00:06:16.680> comes<00:06:17.160> in

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
be next third or anything that comes in

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.900 
be next third or anything that comes in
the<00:06:17.400> future<00:06:18.140> so<00:06:19.140> now<00:06:19.560> what<00:06:19.800> we're<00:06:19.950> gonna<00:06:20.040> do<00:06:20.280> is

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
the future so now what we're gonna do is
