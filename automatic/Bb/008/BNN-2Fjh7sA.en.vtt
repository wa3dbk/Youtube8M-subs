bit of everything on here now if I was

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.930 
bit of everything on here now if I was
at<00:03:47.720> home<00:03:47.750> again<00:03:48.680> I'm<00:03:48.860> going<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.069> be<00:03:49.160> trying<00:03:49.640> to

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
at home again I'm going to be trying to

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.940 
at home again I'm going to be trying to
do<00:03:50.120> these<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.600> night<00:03:50.780> for<00:03:51.140> and<00:03:51.319> marinating<00:03:51.830> of

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
do these the night for and marinating of

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.979 
do these the night for and marinating of
night<00:03:52.130> before<00:03:52.489> what<00:03:53.209> happens<00:03:53.630> when<00:03:53.840> you

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
night before what happens when you

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.380 
night before what happens when you
marinate<00:03:54.560> is<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.940> increase<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:57.019> flavor

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
marinate is that you increase the flavor

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.509 
marinate is that you increase the flavor
with<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.569> with<00:03:59.870> antacids<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.799> as<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.489> the

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
with the with antacids and as to the

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.890 
with the with antacids and as to the
season<00:04:01.880> acid<00:04:03.670> in<00:04:04.670> contact<00:04:05.239> with<00:04:05.360> the<00:04:05.450> protein

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
season acid in contact with the protein

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.210 
season acid in contact with the protein
causes<00:04:07.060> what's<00:04:08.060> called<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:09.010> denaturing<00:04:10.010> of

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
causes what's called the denaturing of

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.180 
causes what's called the denaturing of
the<00:04:10.310> protein<00:04:10.730> in<00:04:11.360> effect<00:04:11.720> it's<00:04:12.530> cooking<00:04:12.980> it<00:04:13.130> a

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
the protein in effect it's cooking it a

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.349 
the protein in effect it's cooking it a
little<00:04:13.340> bit<00:04:13.549> in<00:04:13.790> that

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
little bit in that

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.759 
little bit in that
that's<00:04:16.359> that<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.900> effect<00:04:17.199> you<00:04:17.259> might<00:04:17.500> see

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
that's that the effect you might see

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.800 
that's that the effect you might see
overnight<00:04:18.250> why<00:04:18.850> does<00:04:19.090> your<00:04:19.209> chicken<00:04:19.570> turn

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
overnight why does your chicken turn

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.390 
overnight why does your chicken turn
white<00:04:20.049> when<00:04:20.079> you<00:04:20.350> put<00:04:20.530> it<00:04:20.650> in<00:04:20.739> vinegar<00:04:20.919> but<00:04:21.340> I

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
white when you put it in vinegar but I

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.760 
white when you put it in vinegar but I
love<00:04:21.639> it<00:04:21.910> because<00:04:21.940> it's<00:04:22.810> it's<00:04:23.259> cooking<00:04:23.680> a

love it because it's it's cooking a

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.670 
love it because it's it's cooking a
little<00:04:23.889> bit<00:04:24.160> okay<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:25.300> proteins<00:04:25.810> are<00:04:26.229> coming

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
little bit okay the proteins are coming

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.879 
little bit okay the proteins are coming
denature<00:04:27.690> if<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:28.870> want<00:04:29.139> the<00:04:29.229> flavor<00:04:29.470> of<00:04:29.680> this

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
denature if I want the flavor of this
