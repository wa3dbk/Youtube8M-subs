you get them that and then the other
thing<00:03:48.419> that<00:03:48.659> I<00:03:48.900> wanted<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.349> do<00:03:50.870> just<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:52.019> kind

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
thing that I wanted to do just to kind

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.399 
thing that I wanted to do just to kind
of<00:03:52.379> give<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.129> little<00:03:53.159> bit<00:03:53.519> more<00:03:53.729> oomph<00:03:53.819> is

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
of give it a little bit more oomph is

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.319 
of give it a little bit more oomph is
I'm<00:03:55.409> going<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.620> use<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:55.979> color<00:03:56.250> box<00:03:56.639> another

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
that's called chestnut route I think and

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.089 
that's called chestnut route I think and
I'm<00:04:06.209> just<00:04:06.389> going<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.720> do<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.139> edges<00:04:07.680> of<00:04:07.709> the

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
I'm just going to do the edges of the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
and as you see I'm lifting the other

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.290 
and as you see I'm lifting the other
pedal<00:04:20.100> because<00:04:21.100> if<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.310> don't<00:04:21.370> what's<00:04:22.090> going<00:04:22.240> to

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
pedal because if I don't what's going to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.700 
pedal because if I don't what's going to
happen<00:04:22.690> is<00:04:22.840> I'm<00:04:22.990> going<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.350> get<00:04:23.500> ink
