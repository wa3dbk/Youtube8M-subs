00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:06.490 

so<00:00:02.300> you<00:00:02.360> want<00:00:02.630> to<00:00:02.719> learn<00:00:02.949> to<00:00:03.949> shift<00:00:04.720> the<00:00:05.720> 13

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.500 
so you want to learn to shift the 13

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.119 
so you want to learn to shift the 13
speed<00:00:06.830> eating<00:00:07.339> transmission<00:00:08.770> here's<00:00:09.770> what<00:00:10.010> we

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:10.129 
speed eating transmission here's what we

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:14.949 
speed eating transmission here's what we
do<00:00:10.280> it's<00:00:10.430> pretty<00:00:10.549> easy<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:13.360> shift<00:00:14.360> pattern<00:00:14.809> is

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:14.959 
do it's pretty easy the shift pattern is

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.190 
do it's pretty easy the shift pattern is
set<00:00:15.139> up<00:00:15.289> like<00:00:15.469> the<00:00:15.619> 9<00:00:15.799> speed<00:00:16.510> but<00:00:17.510> once<00:00:17.870> we<00:00:18.080> get

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
set up like the 9 speed but once we get

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.140 
set up like the 9 speed but once we get
into<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:18.530> high<00:00:18.680> range<00:00:19.040> you're<00:00:19.880> going<00:00:19.910> to<00:00:20.060> have

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
into the high range you're going to have

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.930 
into the high range you're going to have
a<00:00:20.210> few<00:00:20.480> additional<00:00:20.930> steps<00:00:20.990> turn<00:00:21.980> that<00:00:22.160> that's

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:22.940 
a few additional steps turn that that's

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.890 
a few additional steps turn that that's
pretty<00:00:24.400> alright<00:00:25.400> so<00:00:25.670> here<00:00:25.880> we<00:00:26.000> have<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:26.450> shift

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
pretty alright so here we have the shift

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.210 
pretty alright so here we have the shift
pattern<00:00:27.320> you<00:00:27.410> can<00:00:27.560> see<00:00:27.710> we've<00:00:27.920> got<00:00:27.950> the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
pattern you can see we've got the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.650 
pattern you can see we've got the
high-low<00:00:28.760> reverse

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
high-low reverse

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.479 
high-low reverse
you've<00:00:30.750> got<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> greeny<00:00:31.289> low<00:00:31.560> then<00:00:32.369> you've

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
you've got the greeny low then you've

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.580 
you've got the greeny low then you've
got<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.820> first<00:00:33.090> second<00:00:33.629> third<00:00:33.840> fourth<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
got the first second third fourth and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.490 
got the first second third fourth and
then<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.430> high<00:00:35.610> range<00:00:36.170> we<00:00:37.170> have

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
then in the high range we have

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.730 
then in the high range we have
five<00:00:39.130> low<00:00:39.580> five<00:00:40.710> i6<00:00:41.710> low<00:00:42.010> six<00:00:42.750> i7<00:00:43.750> low<00:00:43.900> seven<00:00:44.560> my

eight<00:00:45.250> low<00:00:45.550> eight<00:00:45.910> high<00:00:46.180> so<00:00:46.540> you've<00:00:46.750> got

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
eight low eight high so you've got

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.119 
eight low eight high so you've got
8<00:00:48.120> +<00:00:48.329> 4<00:00:48.540> is<00:00:48.600> 12<00:00:49.079> plus<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.559> low<00:00:49.890> 13<00:00:50.700> speeds<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
8 + 4 is 12 plus the low 13 speeds and

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.280 
8 + 4 is 12 plus the low 13 speeds and
here<00:00:53.129> are<00:00:53.250> we're<00:00:53.430> going<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> do<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.790> so<00:00:54.290> start

throttle

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:14.240 
throttle
I<00:02:06.570> will<00:02:07.230> go<00:02:07.410> down<00:02:08.040> to<00:02:08.310> six<00:02:09.200> below

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.350 

begin<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.670> accelerate<00:02:14.970> again

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.900 

right<00:02:19.930> now<00:02:20.080> I'm<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.320> 6lo<00:02:20.800> I'm<00:02:21.430> going<00:02:21.760> to

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
right now I'm in 6lo I'm going to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.660 
right now I'm in 6lo I'm going to
pre-select<00:02:22.750> six<00:02:23.320> high<00:02:23.560> knowing<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.550> I'm

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
pre-select six high knowing that I'm

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.610 
pre-select six high knowing that I'm
going<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.060> be<00:02:25.480> accelerating

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
going to be accelerating

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.979 
going to be accelerating
so<00:02:27.129> once<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:28.530> choose<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.890> go<00:02:30.340> into<00:02:30.519> 6i<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.390> take<00:02:31.840> my

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
so once I choose to go into 6i I take my

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.710 
so once I choose to go into 6i I take my
foot<00:02:32.200> off<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.560> throttle<00:02:33.239> put<00:02:34.239> it<00:02:34.360> back<00:02:34.510> down

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
foot off the throttle put it back down

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.890 
foot off the throttle put it back down
and<00:02:35.080> then<00:02:35.319> it<00:02:35.410> will<00:02:35.530> ship<00:02:35.739> into<00:02:36.160> six<00:02:36.550> high<00:02:36.900> now

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
and then it will ship into six high now
