00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
so when you're done you'll have a little

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.899 
so when you're done you'll have a little
bit<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.469> hole<00:01:52.710> there<00:01:53.009> with<00:01:53.340> your<00:01:53.490> flashing

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
bit of a hole there with your flashing

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.809 
bit of a hole there with your flashing
will<00:01:54.060> cover<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.770> good<00:01:55.979> practice<00:01:56.340> just

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
will cover but it's good practice just

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.370 
will cover but it's good practice just
to<00:01:56.850> shoot<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.179> little<00:01:57.479> bit<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.810> sealant<00:01:58.049> in

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
to shoot a little bit of sealant in

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.599 
to shoot a little bit of sealant in
there<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:58.740> too<00:01:58.950> much<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.310> don't<00:01:59.340> want<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
there not too much you don't want to

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.160 
there not too much you don't want to
overdo<00:01:59.999> it<00:02:00.030> then<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.389> might<00:02:00.509> blister<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
overdo it then you might blister the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.649 
overdo it then you might blister the
shingle<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:02.340> backfill<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.479> whole

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
shingle so just backfill that whole

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.020 
shingle so just backfill that whole
little<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.259> then<00:02:05.100> your<00:02:05.249> flashings<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.880> end

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
little and then your flashings can end

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:19.440 
little and then your flashings can end
up<00:02:06.119> going<00:02:06.359> over<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.719> you're<00:02:06.869> good<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.170> go

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.510 

you
