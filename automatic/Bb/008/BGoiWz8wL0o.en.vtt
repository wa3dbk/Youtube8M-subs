00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
unboxing this now here's a scissor a

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.230 
unboxing this now here's a scissor a
colossus<00:00:25.529> cut<00:00:25.830> right<00:00:26.010> through<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:27.210> I

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
colossus cut right through this so I

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.800 
colossus cut right through this so I
believe<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.900> about<00:00:28.310> 25<00:00:29.310> pounds<00:00:29.640> maybe<00:00:30.390> 30

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
believe this is about 25 pounds maybe 30

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.940 
believe this is about 25 pounds maybe 30
and<00:00:31.080> 35<00:00:31.980> pounds<00:00:32.460> or<00:00:32.640> 25<00:00:33.300> about<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.950> so

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and 35 pounds or 25 about that so

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.560 
and 35 pounds or 25 about that so
between<00:00:35.340> 25<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.210> 65<00:00:36.690> pounds<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.860> much<00:00:38.270> and<00:00:39.270> as

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
between 25 to 65 pounds that much and as

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.190 
between 25 to 65 pounds that much and as
I<00:00:39.690> said<00:00:39.930> supports<00:00:40.350> full<00:00:40.829> HD<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.809> that's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
I said supports full HD so that's

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.580 
I said supports full HD so that's
definitely<00:00:43.969> aerobic<00:00:44.969> consideration<00:00:45.690> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
definitely aerobic consideration and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.549 
definitely aerobic consideration and
this<00:00:47.160> ran<00:00:47.340> me<00:00:47.520> about<00:00:48.320> seven<00:00:49.320> hundred<00:00:49.350> dollars

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
this ran me about seven hundred dollars

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.920 
this ran me about seven hundred dollars
that's<00:00:50.340> not<00:00:50.550> bad<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:53.730> I'll<00:00:54.239> definitely<00:00:54.539> have

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
that's not bad and I'll definitely have

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.010 
that's not bad and I'll definitely have
a<00:00:54.989> review<00:00:55.379> after<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.920> really<00:00:56.640> soon<00:00:56.960> okay<00:00:57.960> so
