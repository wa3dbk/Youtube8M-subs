00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.560
 good morning and welcome this new one 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.690
 tutorials there are michael the guild e 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.870
 I'm here today to teach you how to fold 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.190
 the paper to make this snail into 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.469
 organs 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.480
 we already made another snail more 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.170
 complex of this but we lacked it 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.660
 in a good variant it is an origami 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:28.519
 just one sheet of paper is required 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.519
 square to do it well let's get started 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.680
 take a square piece of paper 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.579
 taken from a sheet a4 and as before 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.140
 what we do a bird base therefore 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.750
 we give you counting for both 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.750
 diagonals and take vite vito 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.050
 at this point we repeat on one of the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.430
 diagonal points and invert with these 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.400
 then folds open and inside 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.090
 we take this fold inside 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:35.610
 therefore it is called mount st fold 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.500
 we entrust this plant to the valley and 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.160
 this side will fit in with 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.160
 the one in check 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.520
 but the folds we repeat with this 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.520
 side 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:01.160
 at this point we take the sheet with 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:03.530
 the parts that can be opened downwards e 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.060
 let's take this side and bring it to the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.600
 center and we'll do the same thing with 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.600
 this side 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.110
 now we take this tip this 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.230
 nicolino theory below and it 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:30.260
 we click on this line we mark 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:33.020
 well we reopen everything then 12 and between 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:39.620
 uses and at this point we take 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:43.040
 this openable part we bring it towards 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.180
 up following the lines and folds of 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.050
 reference we have made 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:52.220
 then they line up on this line and now 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.990
 based on these folds of 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.620
 reference we have that they should 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:01.040
 to close on themselves on the same 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:06.340
 we push this part of leaf up to 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.340
 earth and rhombus text should form 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.840
 take the model turn it over and repeat 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.689
 with this side then as usual 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:27.239
 part openable downwards and more 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:27.239
 we bring to the center and repeat everything 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.209
 we can point out this little triangle 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.269
 on the other side to make it easier 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.810
 the peta to the fold since it is called so 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.810
 this technique 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.050
 well now taking a model with these 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.120
 flaps with no upwards so if 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:09.530
 we will reopen it we will find this triangle 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:13.519
 in the center and we take this tip and the 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.349
 we bring to the center later 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.340
 we pray again in half then 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:23.150
 we take this side and trust it more or 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.600
 less than half of this area 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:30.410
 don't take real ghellos 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.330
 do it eyes it is not important 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.780
 at this point we click on 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.820
 this central line then we do in 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.370
 so that the folds are at the bottom e 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.150
 let this triangle be in 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.310
 view 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.530
 let's take a model , turn it over and repeat 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.360
 on this side and to ensure that 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.780
 folds are perfectly equal to 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.500
 others 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.030
 to the others we can take this side 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.950
 bring it back upwards 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.750
 in this way I would have the folds of the 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.030
 same size by matching 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.030
 this folds with this behind 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:17.270
 now we can both fold down a 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:22.520
 this point we can take this 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:24.710
 side this tip invert the fold 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.110
 central then this fold from one 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.419
 fold val will become a fold upstream and 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:36.919
 pushing it with his thumb 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:39.279
 here we find bringing it upward into 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.279
 this way 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:52.940
 fold and this we will leave for now 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.180
 let's take a model even if we turn 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.950
 you are more comfortable do not turn it and 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.830
 we repeat the same thing but this time 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:08.780
 we only lift it up to this height 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:12.290
 because it will have to be the queue in other words not 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.980
 I know if you have snails but you have 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.090
 I got it 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.090
 I think I made the idea 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:22.070
 at this point there is only one thing to do 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:26.780
 take the tip of this area e 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:30.100
 cut off some of it you decide how much 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.100
 however I recommend not too much 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:40.900
 up they cut anything ok vi 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:46.390
 once we open this part 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:49.090
 let's take one of the two movable parts 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.440
 that seem to become only the movable 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.540
 we carry backwards 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.120
 so on this line we do it 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.160
 become this line but we do 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.630
 become good or bad like horizontal 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.770
 you see here is not just the front 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:05.080
 but it must be a surrender of the dpa e 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:09.160
 we will have our antennas and you so 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.290
 your dumas ended even today 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.810
 all ended but if you want to stay

 not updated on the new tutorials 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.380
 of polygamists you can subscribe to the channel 

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:34.120
 by michael david it's all for today thanks 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.420
