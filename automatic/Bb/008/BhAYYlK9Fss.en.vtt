00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
know the tag along but not whatever so I

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.610

the<00:04:08.860> sensitivity<00:04:09.580> that<00:04:09.730> existed<00:04:10.270> within<00:04:10.420> the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
the sensitivity that existed within the

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.650 
the sensitivity that existed within the
marks<00:04:10.900> they<00:04:11.020> made<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.550> I<00:04:12.550> just<00:04:13.270> wanted<00:04:13.540> I

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
and basically internalize that and move

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.670 
and basically internalize that and move
it<00:04:21.280> do<00:04:21.459> me<00:04:21.640> and<00:04:21.940> let<00:04:22.750> it<00:04:22.870> become<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.170> part<00:04:23.470> of<00:04:23.560> me

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
far-fetched to actually think about a

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.659 
far-fetched to actually think about a
cop<00:05:43.120> in<00:05:43.419> a<00:05:43.630> dog<00:05:43.870> like<00:05:44.440> within<00:05:44.710> this<00:05:44.979> weird<00:05:45.310> kind

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
why I create these type of characters is

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.820 
why I create these type of characters is
because<00:05:50.530> it<00:05:50.710> gives<00:05:50.860> me<00:05:51.100> the<00:05:52.410> elasticity<00:05:53.410> the

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
because it gives me the elasticity the

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.390 
because it gives me the elasticity the
ability<00:05:54.520> to<00:05:54.669> stretch<00:05:55.000> play<00:05:55.479> manipulate
