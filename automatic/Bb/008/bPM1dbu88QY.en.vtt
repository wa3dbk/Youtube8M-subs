00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
but you know it's just something you

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.199 
but you know it's just something you
have<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.530> work<00:02:07.740> out<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.130> have<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.399> find<00:02:09.060> out

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
have to work out you have to find out

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.690 
have to work out you have to find out
who<00:02:10.430> would<00:02:11.510> suit<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.660> best<00:02:13.500> i<00:02:13.890> would<00:02:14.550> say

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
who would suit it best i would say

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.890 
who would suit it best i would say
probably<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.150> person<00:02:15.330> who<00:02:15.510> knows<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.720> most

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
probably the person who knows the most

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.540 
probably the person who knows the most
about<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.380> game<00:02:16.530> would<00:02:16.770> make<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> great<00:02:17.250> dutch

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
about the game would make a great dutch

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.940 
about the game would make a great dutch
master<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.150> i<00:02:18.180> think<00:02:18.390> if<00:02:18.660> you're<00:02:19.290> organizing

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
master and i think if you're organizing

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.410 
master and i think if you're organizing
the<00:02:20.069> game<00:02:20.220> should<00:02:20.459> probably<00:02:20.970> know<00:02:21.120> quite<00:02:21.360> a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
the game should probably know quite a

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.930 
the game should probably know quite a
bit<00:02:21.540> about<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.470> yourself<00:02:22.860> because<00:02:23.280> if<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
bit about it yourself because if the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.670 
bit about it yourself because if the
people<00:02:24.270> you're<00:02:24.750> trying<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.050> get<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.319> play<00:02:25.470> like
