fantasy<00:00:54.480> trilogy<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.739> think<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.489> might<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
fantasy trilogy I think it might be a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.430 
fantasy trilogy I think it might be a
series<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.960> third<00:00:58.109> book<00:00:58.320> is

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
series but I think the third book is

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.220 
series but I think the third book is
coming<00:00:58.590> out<00:00:58.800> soon<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.690> think<00:01:00.899> that's<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
coming out soon and I think that's the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.529 
coming out soon and I think that's the
vial<00:01:01.440> book<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.309> am<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> big<00:01:03.270> fan<00:01:03.480> of
