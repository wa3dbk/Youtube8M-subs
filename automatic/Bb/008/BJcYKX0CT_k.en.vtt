you<00:00:29.939> can<00:00:30.060> see<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:31.019> not<00:00:31.260> picking<00:00:31.619> up

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you can see it it's not picking up

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.139 
you can see it it's not picking up
everything<00:00:32.099> I'm<00:00:32.219> saying<00:00:32.399> even<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> modern

tweaked to pick up the most noise
possible<00:00:41.730> right<00:00:42.480> now<00:00:42.559> so<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:44.239> don't<00:00:45.239> know<00:00:45.329> what

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
possible right now so I don't know what

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.619 
possible right now so I don't know what
else<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.110> besides<00:00:46.530> what<00:00:46.829> I've<00:00:46.950> done

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
else you can do besides what I've done

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.119 
else you can do besides what I've done
set<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> threshold<00:00:48.899> where<00:00:49.620> it'll<00:00:49.800> pick<00:00:49.950> up

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
set the threshold where it'll pick up

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.540 
set the threshold where it'll pick up
you<00:00:50.670> know<00:00:50.789> anything<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.600> everything<00:00:52.340> as<00:00:53.340> far

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
you know anything and everything as far

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.450 
you know anything and everything as far
as<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.480> know<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.920> way<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.129> was<00:00:56.250> designed

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
as you know the way it was designed

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.090 
as you know the way it was designed
anyway<00:00:57.170> that<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:58.440> doesn't<00:00:58.620> seem<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.980> work

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
anyway that just doesn't seem to work

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.060 
anyway that just doesn't seem to work
that<00:00:59.340> well<00:00:59.550> as<00:01:00.530> opposed<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> wired

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that well as opposed to the wired

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.119 
that well as opposed to the wired
connection<00:01:02.670> which<00:01:02.850> works<00:01:03.449> perfectly<00:01:04.040> even<00:01:05.040> on

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
connection which works perfectly even on

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.640 
connection which works perfectly even on
standard<00:01:05.610> settings<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:08.869> test<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.380> have

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
standard settings to test this I have

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.359 
standard settings to test this I have
created<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.490> video<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.900> recorded<00:01:13.369> so

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
created a video here that I recorded so

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.710 
created a video here that I recorded so
that<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.850> volume<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.600> steady<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
that the volume is steady and

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.179 
that the volume is steady and
represented<00:01:18.720> equally<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.409> all<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.159> three

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
represented equally in all the three

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.969 
represented equally in all the three
different<00:01:20.549> settings<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> first<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> call

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
different settings so first in the call

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.920 
different settings so first in the call

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.849 

watch<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:08.159> mic<00:03:08.730> icon<00:03:08.939> there<00:03:09.510> see<00:03:10.200> it's

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
watch the mic icon there see it's

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.190 
watch the mic icon there see it's
picking<00:03:11.189> me<00:03:11.280> up<00:03:11.310> or<00:03:11.579> not<00:03:11.670> as<00:03:11.909> you<00:03:12.720> can<00:03:12.810> see<00:03:13.019> it's

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
picking me up or not as you can see it's

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.720 
picking me up or not as you can see it's
having<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.799> really<00:03:13.980> hard<00:03:14.040> time<00:03:14.219> picking<00:03:14.549> me<00:03:14.700> up

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
having a really hard time picking me up

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.780 
having a really hard time picking me up
right<00:03:15.060> now<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.569> cuts<00:03:15.780> out<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.519> it<00:03:17.519> works

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
right now and it cuts out and it works

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:36.830 
right now and it cuts out and it works
but<00:03:18.299> not<00:03:18.659> all<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.810> time

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.410 

so<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.560> seems<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.890> work<00:03:38.010> pretty<00:03:38.849> similar<00:03:39.390> to

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
so it seems to work pretty similar to

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.500 
so it seems to work pretty similar to
how<00:03:39.629> it<00:03:39.750> doesn't<00:03:40.080> call<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.319> duty<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:41.390> would<00:03:42.390> say

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
how it doesn't call of duty I would say

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.880 
how it doesn't call of duty I would say
it<00:03:42.599> works<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.870> little<00:03:43.110> better<00:03:43.349> in<00:03:43.560> call<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:43.800> duty

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
it works a little better in call of duty

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.949 
it works a little better in call of duty
that<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.280> does<00:03:44.370> in<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.580> party<00:03:44.819> chat<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:45.840> if

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
that it does in a party chat so if

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.750 
that it does in a party chat so if
you've<00:03:46.080> got<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.319> maybe<00:03:46.769> if<00:03:47.519> you're<00:03:47.640> having

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
you've got it maybe if you're having

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.600 
you've got it maybe if you're having
problems<00:03:47.849> to<00:03:48.420> try<00:03:48.629> to<00:03:48.690> avoid<00:03:48.989> party<00:03:49.349> chance<00:03:49.620> or

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
problems to try to avoid party chance or

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.000 
problems to try to avoid party chance or
try<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.330> speak<00:03:51.629> loud<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:51.870> clear<00:03:52.260> because<00:03:52.739> if

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
try to speak loud and clear because if

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.800 
try to speak loud and clear because if
you<00:03:53.069> speak<00:03:53.310> loud<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.580> clear<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.360> works<00:03:54.569> pretty

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
you speak loud and clear it works pretty

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.530 
you speak loud and clear it works pretty
well<00:03:54.959> but<00:03:55.319> as<00:03:55.860> soon<00:03:55.950> as<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.160> start<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.730> talk

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
well but as soon as you start to talk

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.199 
well but as soon as you start to talk
normally<00:03:58.019> or<00:03:58.580> mumble<00:03:59.580> or<00:04:00.200> you<00:04:01.200> know<00:04:01.290> just<00:04:02.209> you
