that so I'm going to show you how to do
it<00:00:23.570> first<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.810> all<00:00:24.930> you'll<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.380> sign<00:00:25.590> up<00:00:25.619> I

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
it first of all you'll have to sign up I

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.320 
it first of all you'll have to sign up I
already<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.369> an<00:00:26.460> account<00:00:26.580> but<00:00:27.029> you'll<00:00:27.300> just

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
already have an account but you'll just

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.359 
already have an account but you'll just
have<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.660> click<00:00:27.869> they're<00:00:28.619> not<00:00:28.740> registered<00:00:28.859> yet

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369

have to click they're not registered yet
linked<00:00:29.609> yet<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.660> once<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.990> log<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:34.820> you'll<00:00:35.820> be

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
linked yet so once you log in you'll be

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.360 
linked yet so once you log in you'll be
able<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.510> make<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> deposit<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.950> left<00:00:38.160> hand

this<00:00:48.870> example<00:00:49.879> I've<00:00:50.879> already<00:00:51.180> used<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.510> little

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659
