00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.150
 there are people what they paid for are today for a revision on 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.339
 any record purchase more than during his wishes 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:15.659
 our subscriber actor she 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.669
 she offered me so on each site 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.669
 it's a woman 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.319
 so basically if the text with fellow wizards and firecrackers 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.509
 boxster attack I'm never going before 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.140
 at least 303 business I can not design his order from here but rather 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.360
 as an attack 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.360
 so that's done without a pocket to thank for seeing it 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.640
 so that as too much sin by the protector 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.640
 level of two level colleagues 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.830
 14 on these levels are they who made eight deaths on the 8th of April this 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.830
 some markets 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.450
 I wanted to spend even faster to create a little faster and then 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.830
 a little live striker 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.830
 with the troops 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.280
 because I never attacked I had to know 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.470
 what to do jean-luc start with the first part of his 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.220
 plan 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.220
 they take a lot of damage 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.230
 the wizards' menu for more ease on launches 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.570
 without taking aim of their tumor not so fast 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 he does not represent the heroes on stage 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.039
 I do not think that because the second I changed 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.449
 Patrick with his oral 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.449
 cc nogent curie paris three wizards 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.109
 so we go to the second attack 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.489
 I hope the mistakes I could make 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.589
 believing that this damage the Halluin Street boxes safe for those who can 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:50.619
 start even without problems 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:55.499
 China tends wizards because life in front of the building carries 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.409
 so it was nice it was more convenient for me to eliminate it 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.590
 before dancing from Beijing only because the ps would have turned around the base 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:03.149
 alas burial 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:06.149
 really annoying 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:12.089
 the man and the pigs both the passion remains almost ugly thousand 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:14.709
 more choice in the image of small ump 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.709
 so here I do not know if it's a big compliment 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.869
 Well, it's still nice 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.530
 so what I did more quietly and for good reason 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.530
 it is not a lack of peak that we listened to those who copied 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.209
 another big attack 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.049
 should i head to find 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.049
 pretty good 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.519
 dufour benefits for people so I found a small village 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.519
 rather nice 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.060
 the oval office 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.879
 the thing there where young people 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:22.379
 we did not feel good 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.419
 on the tv 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.509
 on both sides 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.819
 the balances the regional caisses on sion 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.259
 the crates but I hope it's going to pass she did not like me at all 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:41.569
 according to his ceo pass 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.460
 milk 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.430
 the wizards but his entourage 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.430
 but since four its sides 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:57.060
 let's point out that this will happen so people have realized that this 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.319
 with a cat with the same defense 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.900
 we can think that monty comes out of his story 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.249
 was it willow thing that the subway 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:08.249
 germany 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:12.529
 but OK 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:15.529
 I sell his weights 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:25.839
 I think the fate of my right 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.419
 the small attraction quietly towards the resources of its two stars 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.939
 over there subject not at all used to this attack 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:48.919
 we have at least I will have tried 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.050
 on a big village I still have on his penchant for a show very 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.460
 happy anyway 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.830
 at home I'm not used to villages like that 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.830
 but well here are sixty children we can say it's beautiful 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.800
 but hey it's okay 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.159
 with the troubadours and you enjoyed it 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:33.249
 for this distinction to dakhla once the sea on you 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:33.819
 and
