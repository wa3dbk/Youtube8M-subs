it's an unbalanced system and makes the

battles<00:03:40.630> can<00:03:40.780> take<00:03:40.930> an<00:03:41.050> hour<00:03:41.260> or<00:03:41.500> two<00:03:41.650> to

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
battles can take an hour or two to

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.530 
battles can take an hour or two to
complete<00:03:41.890> which<00:03:42.430> is<00:03:42.580> much<00:03:42.880> too<00:03:42.910> long<00:03:43.269> in<00:03:43.420> my

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
complete which is much too long in my

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.630 
complete which is much too long in my
opinion<00:03:43.900> luckily<00:03:44.800> there<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.070> a<00:03:45.190> save<00:03:45.430> feature

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
opinion luckily there is a save feature

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.280 
opinion luckily there is a save feature
that<00:03:45.910> allows<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.269> to<00:03:46.360> continue<00:03:46.780> from<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:47.049> midst

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
that allows you to continue from a midst

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.320 
that allows you to continue from a midst
of<00:03:47.350> battle<00:03:47.769> but<00:03:48.220> regardless<00:03:48.640> a<00:03:48.910> traditional

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
of battle but regardless a traditional

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.940 
of battle but regardless a traditional
turn-based<00:03:49.570> system<00:03:50.200> would<00:03:50.320> have<00:03:50.350> worked<00:03:50.590> much

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
turn-based system would have worked much

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.280 
turn-based system would have worked much
better<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.840> game<00:03:52.989> is<00:03:53.110> controlled

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
better the game is controlled

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.170 
better the game is controlled
predominantly<00:03:53.950> with<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.190> stylus<00:03:54.640> or<00:03:54.880> the

works<00:03:57.549> just<00:03:57.880> fine<00:03:58.000> for<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.269> most<00:03:58.480> part<00:03:58.750> but

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
works just fine for the most part but

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.170 
works just fine for the most part but
there<00:03:59.080> are<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.290> few<00:03:59.590> awkward<00:03:59.830> choices<00:04:00.430> for

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
there are a few awkward choices for

they<00:04:27.169> don't<00:04:27.350> always<00:04:27.500> make<00:04:27.710> sense<00:04:27.770> for<00:04:28.580> example

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
suddenly die but the biggest issue is

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.960 
suddenly die but the biggest issue is
that<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:32.930> can't<00:04:33.260> skip<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.830> scenes<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.550> can

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
that you can't skip the scenes you can

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.700 
that you can't skip the scenes you can
turn<00:04:35.300> from<00:04:35.450> often<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:35.900> options<00:04:36.230> menu<00:04:36.350> but

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
turn from often the options menu but

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.020 
turn from often the options menu but
then<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.950> presentation<00:04:37.520> gets<00:04:37.700> particularly

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
then the presentation gets particularly

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.820 
then the presentation gets particularly
bland<00:04:38.419> and<00:04:38.600> dull<00:04:38.810> and<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:39.290> miss<00:04:39.440> out<00:04:39.590> on<00:04:39.650> the
