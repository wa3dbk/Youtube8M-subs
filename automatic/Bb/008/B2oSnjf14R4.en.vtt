00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.150 
and of course that helps with the light
because<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.020> creates<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.380> lot<00:02:16.530> more<00:02:16.680> light<00:02:16.860> and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
because it creates a lot more light and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.920 
because it creates a lot more light and
lights<00:02:17.760> are<00:02:18.030> probably<00:02:18.569> one<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> most

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
lights are probably one of the most

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:29.729 
lights are probably one of the most
important<00:02:19.410> things<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.739> build<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.010> place

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.679 

the<00:02:30.739> insulation<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.549> is<00:02:31.849> way<00:02:32.090> above<00:02:32.360> the

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
the insulation is is way above the

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.300 
the insulation is is way above the
building<00:02:33.110> regulation<00:02:33.590> standards<00:02:33.769> it's

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
building regulation standards it's

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.740 
building regulation standards it's
something<00:02:34.700> my<00:02:34.970> husband<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:35.620> obsessed<00:02:36.620> about

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
something my husband is obsessed about

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.390 
something my husband is obsessed about
so<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.840> walls<00:02:39.049> have<00:02:39.200> got<00:02:39.349> very<00:02:40.129> highly

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
so the walls have got very highly

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.280 
so the walls have got very highly
insulated<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.180> fact<00:02:41.390> in<00:02:41.540> particular<00:02:41.780> is

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
insulated and the fact in particular is

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.530 
insulated and the fact in particular is
a<00:02:42.319> good<00:02:42.530> insulator<00:02:42.920> material<00:02:43.010> anyway

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
a good insulator material anyway

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.899 
a good insulator material anyway
but<00:02:44.870> we've<00:02:45.019> also<00:02:45.170> got<00:02:45.590> extra<00:02:46.159> insulation<00:02:46.670> up

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
but we've also got extra insulation up

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.970 
but we've also got extra insulation up
there<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.209> fire<00:02:47.390> board<00:02:47.659> which<00:02:48.109> acts<00:02:48.409> as<00:02:48.739> an

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
there and fire board which acts as an

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.789 
there and fire board which acts as an
insulated<00:02:49.519> material<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:50.959> when<00:02:51.109> we<00:02:51.379> don't<00:02:51.590> use

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
insulated material so when we don't use

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.039 
insulated material so when we don't use
much<00:02:52.099> much<00:02:52.670> fitting<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.239> mean<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.540> holds<00:02:53.989> the

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
much much fitting I mean it holds the

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:01.270 
much much fitting I mean it holds the
heat<00:02:54.170> incredibly<00:02:54.680> well<00:02:54.859> action

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.340 

I<00:03:01.390> think<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.450> put<00:03:02.600> your<00:03:02.630> own<00:03:02.750> stamp<00:03:03.110> on

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
I think you put your own stamp on

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.110 
I think you put your own stamp on
something<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:04.100> especially<00:03:04.520> if<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.850> build<00:03:05.030> it

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
something and especially if you build it

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.170 
something and especially if you build it
from<00:03:05.210> scratch<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:06.140> see<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.770> from<00:03:07.060> from<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.150> a

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
from scratch you see it from from the a

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.900 
from scratch you see it from from the a
call<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.570> go<00:03:08.690> trickling<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.440> guess<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.250> that's

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
call to go trickling I guess so that's

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:22.330 
call to go trickling I guess so that's
that's<00:03:11.450> why<00:03:11.690> it's<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:11.960> special

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.400
