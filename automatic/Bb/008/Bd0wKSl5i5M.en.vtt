00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.770 
a first taste video oh and also serving
size<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:31.890> 1<00:01:32.340> point<00:01:32.579> 4<00:01:32.729> grams<00:01:33.000> servings<00:01:33.720> per

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
size is 1 point 4 grams servings per

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.980 
size is 1 point 4 grams servings per
container<00:01:33.900> 1<00:01:34.650> 9<00:01:35.490> calories<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.600> there<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.869> go

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
container 1 9 calories so there you go

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.660 
container 1 9 calories so there you go
cricket<00:01:37.350> stove<00:01:37.590> calories<00:01:38.070> well<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.520> guess

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
cricket stove calories well I guess

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.649 
cricket stove calories well I guess
that's<00:01:38.850> because<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> sour<00:01:39.390> cream<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
that's because of the sour cream and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.240 
that's because of the sour cream and
onion<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.110> I'm<00:01:40.259> assuming<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.829> protein

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
onion but I'm assuming this is protein

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.630 
onion but I'm assuming this is protein
so<00:01:41.460> yeah<00:01:41.700> point<00:01:42.420> 5<00:01:42.659> grams<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.229> protein<00:01:43.649> total

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
so yeah point 5 grams of protein total

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.210 
so yeah point 5 grams of protein total

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
milligram total fat one gram it is more

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.450 
milligram total fat one gram it is more
