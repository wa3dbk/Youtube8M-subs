we have the condensate pumps here tip to
pull<00:01:43.100> this<00:01:43.220> off<00:01:43.429> I'll<00:01:43.670> take<00:01:48.490> one<00:01:49.490> of<00:01:49.520> these

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
pull this off I'll take one of these

pull this off I'll take one of these
caps<00:01:49.940> out<00:01:50.229> obviously<00:01:51.229> you'll<00:01:51.380> have<00:01:51.560> this

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
caps out obviously you'll have this

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.260 
caps out obviously you'll have this
above<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.250> pump<00:01:52.520> if<00:01:52.700> it's<00:01:52.850> sitting<00:01:53.119> on<00:01:53.209> the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
above the pump if it's sitting on the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.520

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
floor it's not going to work because you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.649 
floor it's not going to work because you
can't<00:01:54.799> right<00:01:54.979> uphill<00:01:55.369> so<00:01:56.179> if<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:56.360> have<00:01:56.509> this

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
can't right uphill so if you have this

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.389 
can't right uphill so if you have this
elevated<00:01:57.140> on<00:01:57.319> a<00:01:57.350> base<00:01:57.649> or<00:01:57.979> if<00:01:58.039> you<00:01:58.130> have<00:01:58.250> it

simply run your drain tube into the

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.899 
simply run your drain tube into the
condensate<00:02:03.049> pump<00:02:03.349> as<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.130> pump<00:02:04.369> fills<00:02:04.670> up

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
condensate pump as the pump fills up

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.820 
condensate pump as the pump fills up
there's<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.179> float<00:02:05.479> inside<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.170> float<00:02:06.380> raises

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
there's a float inside the float raises

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
work on the same principle water is

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.690 
work on the same principle water is
collected<00:02:37.880> on<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.359> coil<00:02:39.340> goes<00:02:40.340> into<00:02:40.609> the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
collected on the coil goes into the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.610 
collected on the coil goes into the
drain<00:02:40.910> bucket<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.480> can<00:02:41.630> either<00:02:41.780> hand<00:02:42.109> dump<00:02:42.440> it

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
drain bucket you can either hand dump it

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.099 
drain bucket you can either hand dump it
or<00:02:42.950> hook<00:02:43.100> up<00:02:43.220> your<00:02:43.400> permanent<00:02:43.670> drain<00:02:44.109> now

these<00:02:45.319> things<00:02:45.590> are<00:02:45.739> made<00:02:45.889> to<00:02:46.010> work<00:02:46.190> in<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.430> cold

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
these things are made to work in a cold

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.000 
these things are made to work in a cold
environment<00:02:47.019> so<00:02:48.019> what<00:02:48.230> you'll<00:02:48.380> find<00:02:48.530> out<00:02:48.769> is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
environment so what you'll find out is

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.650 
environment so what you'll find out is
sometimes<00:02:49.400> these<00:02:49.609> will<00:02:49.790> start<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.150> frost<00:02:50.389> up

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
sometimes these will start to frost up

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.690 
sometimes these will start to frost up
and<00:02:50.870> iced<00:02:50.959> up<00:02:51.200> on<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:51.620> these<00:02:52.190> have<00:02:52.430> what's

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
and iced up on you these have what's

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.780 
and iced up on you these have what's
called<00:02:52.880> an<00:02:53.090> automatic<00:02:53.329> hot<00:02:53.780> gas<00:02:54.019> bypass<00:02:54.790> which

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
called an automatic hot gas bypass which

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.270 
called an automatic hot gas bypass which
changes<00:02:56.239> to<00:02:56.420> flow<00:02:57.079> of<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.350> refrigerant<00:02:57.889> this

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
changes to flow of the refrigerant this

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.220 
changes to flow of the refrigerant this
coil<00:02:58.609> becomes<00:02:58.819> filled<00:02:59.480> with<00:02:59.690> hot<00:02:59.900> refrigerant

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
coil becomes filled with hot refrigerant

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.069 
coil becomes filled with hot refrigerant
gas<00:03:00.799> rather<00:03:01.160> than<00:03:01.340> cold<00:03:01.549> refrigerant<00:03:02.079> you

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
gas rather than cold refrigerant you

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.020 
gas rather than cold refrigerant you
know<00:03:03.170> defrost<00:03:03.680> this<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.579> water<00:03:04.790> will<00:03:04.940> be

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
know defrost this the water will be

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.940 
know defrost this the water will be
collected<00:03:05.359> in<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.540> drain<00:03:05.690> bucket<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.829> it

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
collected in the drain bucket and it

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.559 
collected in the drain bucket and it
