00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 and no doubt Maria is also inspired 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.480
 By the spirit of God, your heart is 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.980
 moved she is carried with joy and 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.980
 of joy 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.070
 from the perspective of what God has already done 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.140
 and that will still do for her and she says 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.410
 then my soul exalts the Lord 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.699
 and my spirit rejoiced in my God. 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.029
 savior 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.000
 maybe it would be interesting to see here 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.790
 an instructive difference 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.350
 in the previous passage we have seen in 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.739
 last message 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.710
 Isabel is possessed of the holy spirit and 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.129
 scales loudly 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.250
 Blessed art thou among women and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.850
 blessed fruit of thy womb was filled with 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.550
 spirit and proclaims in a loud voice but in 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.730
 followed by Maria also full of the spirit 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:02.250
 Saint says by showing that when 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.040
 holy spirit to ge do not need to be 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.560
 always cries as Isabel is 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.740
 the contrast isabel scales 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.580
 idea that she screams but Maria full of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.140
 Holy Spirit says I'm saying that 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.259
 isabella pentecostal and maria 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.040
 presbyterian but is only pointing 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.490
 to the fact that the holy spirit is ge 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.340
 different ways in people 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.340
 the result of the action of the holy spirit in 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.220
 people's lives are not always the same and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.829
 We make mistakes when we want to limit God. 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.200
 and say that God can only act from a 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.770
 how sometimes determined 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.950
 groups if you do not have god exclamations 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.649
 is acting marine exclaimed 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.240
 but she was so full of the holy spirit 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.070
 when isabel 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.380
 or when we sometimes want 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.509
 that believers under the action of the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.299
 holy spirit be only like Mary 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.299
 when there may be isabel goods
