I'm<00:00:00.810> going<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.230> show<00:00:01.380> you<00:00:01.410> how<00:00:01.680> one<00:00:01.890> could

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
I'm going to show you how one could

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.039 
I'm going to show you how one could
model<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.580> red<00:00:02.730> pepper<00:00:02.970> cell<00:00:03.330> using<00:00:03.959> the

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
model a red pepper cell using the

dynamic<00:00:04.259> cell<00:00:04.799> model<00:00:05.250> kit<00:00:06.020> all<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.200> need<00:00:07.379> is<00:00:07.500> a

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
dynamic cell model kit all you need is a

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.520 
dynamic cell model kit all you need is a
red<00:00:07.799> pepper<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:09.030> can<00:00:09.059> just<00:00:09.420> peel<00:00:09.929> away<00:00:09.960> a

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
red pepper you can just peel away a

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.290 
red pepper you can just peel away a
little<00:00:10.889> bit<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.370> skin<00:00:11.759> from<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> red

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
little bit of this skin from the red

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.079 
little bit of this skin from the red
pepper<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.380> just<00:00:13.740> put<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.009> skin<00:00:14.309> on<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.730> slide

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
pepper and just put the skin on a slide

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.510 
pepper and just put the skin on a slide
with<00:00:15.269> some<00:00:15.450> water<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.870> make<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> wet<00:00:16.260> now<00:00:16.520> once

with some water to make a wet now once

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.550 
with some water to make a wet now once
you've<00:00:17.699> done<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.050> you'd<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.230> something

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
you've done that you'd have something

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.380 
you've done that you'd have something
like<00:00:19.710> what<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> microscope<00:00:20.939> here

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
like what I have on the microscope here

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.609 
like what I have on the microscope here
and<00:00:22.220> on<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.880> screen<00:00:24.300> you're<00:00:24.510> looking<00:00:24.570> at<00:00:25.199> a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
and on this screen you're looking at a

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.880 
and on this screen you're looking at a
live<00:00:26.490> image<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.390> what<00:00:28.260> we're<00:00:28.410> viewing<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:28.859> the

different red pepper cells very thick
cell<00:00:32.850> wall<00:00:32.880> because<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.660> from<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> peel<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
cell wall because it's from the peel and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.910 
cell wall because it's from the peel and
this<00:00:36.030> particular<00:00:36.719> red<00:00:36.899> pepper<00:00:37.170> cell<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
this particular red pepper cell is the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.130 
this particular red pepper cell is the
one<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.640> thought<00:00:39.030> would<00:00:39.149> be<00:00:39.210> fun<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.750> model

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
one that I thought would be fun to model

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.680 
one that I thought would be fun to model
so<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:40.950> took<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> photograph<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.450> that's

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
so I took a photograph of it and that's

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.420 
so I took a photograph of it and that's
shown<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.230> other<00:00:43.410> side<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:43.980> monitor

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
shown on the other side of this monitor

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.569 
shown on the other side of this monitor
and<00:00:44.870> we're<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> use<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.620> particular

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
and we're going to use this particular

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.880 
and we're going to use this particular
red<00:00:47.730> pepper<00:00:47.940> cell<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.960> model<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
red pepper cell to model with the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.709 
red pepper cell to model with the
dynamic<00:00:50.460> cell<00:00:50.640> model<00:00:50.910> kit<00:00:52.940> now<00:00:53.940> let's<00:00:54.180> model

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
dynamic cell model kit now let's model

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.360 
dynamic cell model kit now let's model
the<00:00:55.260> red<00:00:55.440> pepper<00:00:55.649> cell<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.160> saw<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the red pepper cell that we saw the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.250 
the red pepper cell that we saw the
microscope<00:00:57.000> we're<00:00:57.449> gonna<00:00:57.539> need<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
microscope we're gonna need to have the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.029 
microscope we're gonna need to have the
cell<00:00:58.469> wall<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> cell<00:00:59.280> membrane<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:01.039> we

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
cell wall in the cell membrane and we

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.100 
cell wall in the cell membrane and we
will<00:01:02.690> then<00:01:03.690> act<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.500> cytoskeleton<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
will then act like the cytoskeleton and

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.000 
will then act like the cytoskeleton and
bend<00:01:07.880> this<00:01:08.880> cell<00:01:09.540> into<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.049> shape<00:01:10.350> that's

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
bend this cell into the shape that's

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.760 
bend this cell into the shape that's
reminiscent<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.570> red<00:01:12.750> pepper<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.200> red

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
reminiscent of the red pepper we red

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.260 
reminiscent of the red pepper we red
pepper<00:01:14.010> cell<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.790> saw<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.240> the

approximately the areas where we found

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.080 
approximately the areas where we found
them<00:01:49.009> or<00:01:50.009> where<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.310> saw<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.820> when<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:50.970> were
