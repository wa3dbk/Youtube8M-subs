 suddenly opened here now we have 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.230
 that there are beauty administrative models 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.449
 then network 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.600
 here is the package scheduler that the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.449
 sr first give a group click here 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.510
 then come here or in the penultimate limit 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.780
 the width of the reserved band spirit 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.180
 turning to 6 here at your will not 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.570
 configured beauty then heading milk here 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.970
 O 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.970
 by default the package scheduler and linx 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.650
 systems 20% the width of a connection 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.650
 but you can use this setting 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.470
 to replace the standard ie the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.320
 galera or windows 7 is using 20% 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.380
 from my internet, that is if you have 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.900
 1 mega internet then he will be the team 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.900
 no mean concept, ie 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.310
 stealing right there for broadband to 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.130
 we all know these things 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.170
 already the windows 8 he is in the uti I went 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.740
 using 80% or 60% of the windows 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.350
 7 is more so are you using here have 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.280
 that it is much greater than that of the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.759
 windows 7 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.490
 so the intention is to take that 20% to 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.829
 What your internet is, you want to see what? 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.680
 you use the internet the most is a 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.799
 time there you will enable here and here 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.960
 You 're going to have 20 beauty going to 21 or 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.429
 windows 8 will have 80 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.400
 then you put 0 and press apply ok 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.710
 beauty can close this here and then 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.380
 you start your computer 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.480
 is that of your browser where any 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.100
 thing you will see there it will stay 1 and 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.630
 It'll get better, then it 's later I 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.490
 I'll leave this program here for you. 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.720
 What do you think about the guys that are called? 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.990
 speedy fox what he does he optimizes there 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.150
 your mozilla firefox or skype the game 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.790
 as I think it's the three 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.210
 the three browsers there that most use 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.280
 to communicate and everything else then it is 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.800
 a program run do not know low 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.410
 the release of sedated video version 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.680
 click on run beauty 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.820
 This is in the face of the program neither 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.850
 simple 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.650
 so I brought a goal like that takes 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.090
 so it's just marked mozilla firefox 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.010
 it was skype 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.820
 leaves you marked it and squeezes it 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.160
 optimize beja will load this here 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.140
 It was very fast here guys because I 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.490
 I had already done this if you never did 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.580
 This is going to take a little bit but not 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:18.060
 much more a lot in gmail 13 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.100
 then it is this is the team he used then to 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.410
 ti to do this procedure you have 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.250
 that being with your browsers closed 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.770
 beauty 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.960
 there you will see that he will leave his 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.450
 faster browser or optimize 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.940
