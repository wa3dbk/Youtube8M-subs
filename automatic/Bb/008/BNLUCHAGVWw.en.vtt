00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
buying for 2.2 okay but it is still a

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.170 
buying for 2.2 okay but it is still a
marginal<00:02:04.530> profit<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.189> anything<00:02:05.939> under<00:02:06.149> that

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
marginal profit so anything under that

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.050 
marginal profit so anything under that
is<00:02:06.590> absolutely<00:02:07.590> excellent<00:02:08.340> because<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.879> is

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
is absolutely excellent because that is

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.510 
is absolutely excellent because that is
profit<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.410> always<00:02:10.800> really<00:02:11.129> really

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
profit and that is always really really

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.280

good<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:11.849> like<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.629> see<00:02:12.810> it's<00:02:12.989> difficult

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
good but like you can see it's difficult

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.880

let's say for example he's going for six
hundred<00:02:26.670> coins<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.690> lowest<00:02:27.990> by<00:02:28.110> now<00:02:28.380> now

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
hundred coins on the lowest by now now

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.470 
hundred coins on the lowest by now now
you'd<00:02:29.190> want<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.520> then<00:02:29.640> sell<00:02:29.850> him<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.360> he's

you'd want to then sell him on so he's

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.260 
you'd want to then sell him on so he's
cheaper<00:02:30.840> for<00:02:31.200> 550<00:02:32.010> coins<00:02:32.280> five<00:02:32.820> percent<00:02:33.180> of

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
cheaper for 550 coins five percent of

for around about three hundred and five
coins<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.790> believe<00:02:45.180> but<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.020> is<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.170> profit<00:02:46.500> and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
coins I believe but that is a profit and

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.800 
coins I believe but that is a profit and
if<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:47.100> do<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.640> fair<00:02:48.239> bit<00:02:48.420> like<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.780> might

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
if you do that a fair bit like it might

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.330 
if you do that a fair bit like it might
not<00:02:49.080> look<00:02:49.230> like<00:02:49.290> much<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.890> might<00:02:50.040> be<00:02:50.190> making

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
not look like much you might be making

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.160 
not look like much you might be making
say<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.120> hundred<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.750> two<00:02:51.780> hundred<00:02:51.870> coins

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
say a hundred to two hundred coins

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.130 
say a hundred to two hundred coins
profit<00:02:52.709> but<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.400> adds<00:02:53.730> up<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.269> really<00:02:54.690> does<00:02:54.930> say

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
profit but it adds up it really does say

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.170 
profit but it adds up it really does say
if<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.530> five<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:56.040> ten<00:02:56.250> times<00:02:56.519> that's

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
if you do that five to ten times that's

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.660 
if you do that five to ten times that's
two<00:02:57.600> thousand<00:02:58.230> coins<00:02:58.410> profit<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.190> lot

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
two thousand coins profit that is a lot

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.449 
two thousand coins profit that is a lot
and<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.630> big<00:03:01.290> amount<00:03:01.560> if<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.220> keep

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
and that is a big amount if you keep

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.550 
and that is a big amount if you keep
doing<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.910> but<00:03:03.030> do<00:03:03.300> pay<00:03:03.630> attention<00:03:03.660> to

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
doing it but do pay attention to

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.340 
doing it but do pay attention to
changing<00:03:05.130> prices<00:03:05.400> especially<00:03:06.110> with<00:03:07.110> cheap

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
I'd recommend to hold on to them because

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.500
