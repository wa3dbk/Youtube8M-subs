00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
Hello everyone and welcome to AcTFactory 
and yes isn't a dream it's the comeback of Drogba_13_OM.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.170
Drogba what ?!

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.170
What ?!

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.200
Aka Raeksnake

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.500
Who ?!
I don't know...

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Oh fuck !

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.400
So today I will do a review like I like to do on a TOTW (30) player :
IF André Ayew.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.100
André what ?!

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:44.500
No more wasting time, now the review, it's the team with IF Ayew, 
the idea of the team was to pair him with Müller

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.600
 because they have similars stats but I will talk about this later.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.750
IF Ayew costs around 15-20k but for me this is my cousin who
 offer me so thank you if you watch this.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.750
So now let's compare in game stats between the regular and the IF. 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:11.200
Because in fact all the regulars in UT have boosted stats 
so the IF is an IF of an "IF" is a total mindfuck.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.100
If you don't understand I will do a video about this.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.350
If you look closely at the in game stats, (don't hesitate to pause)

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.250
you will notice that the biggest improvement is about +4 and
this is not really good... but the post important is the feeling in game

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.250
So now the speed test, what is it ? It's a 100m timed

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:37.300
First thanks to Carmelo who make this test possible, 
notice that he makes this 2 times but I failed like everytime... 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.500
Yeah cause if I don't fail each day that's mean I'm In Form...
Shit joke...

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:53.100
So the performance of the regular is 13:07 seconds and for the IF 13:10 seconds... 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.000
Isn't even an improvement ...

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.000
If you want to know both Ayew have 10 chemistry and 
Basic Chemistry Style so it was the same base.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.750
I take the advantage of this situation in order to test his shot
because I've got some difficulties to shot with him 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:27.400
in 10 games he scored 3 times and mades 6 assists.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.000
Now you can leave... 
Yeah he isn't fantastic actually like his shoot.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.500
So now the analysis it's only games on division 1 and 2

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.000
Yeah I know some people who made review offline it's understanble...

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.250
and also other who ask friends let him ... 
Oh shit it's actually what I do...

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:53.000
Anyway, a good point are his defensives skills are good 
but this is a little bit unrelevant for a winger.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So now negatives sides and there are a huge list... 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.750
As you can see that his technique isn't good
especially his dribbing skills

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.200
his reactivity make him sluggish, like here
he accelerates, but he has been quickly caught

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.200
I feel him really slow compared to the regular.
You know what, you can end this after this :

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.600
The regular is better in any point !
It's a huge disappointement...

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.700
Here, I try to pass, but he can't...

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.200
Here his miss his first touch ... thanks...
he feels "strong" but his reactivity kills him.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.100
it means you can't exploit him to his optimum
humhum ...

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.500
Yeah, I don't know what I take before this video...

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.500
So yeah, I tried a lot of things with him, like this freekick
and he's awful, notice that I lose some games

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:56.600
where he scored a header, but who don't score header ?
a little off subject, I don't know if you can listen me better with this mic

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:07.200
but know I think it isn't important to know what I say here,
so blablablabla french style...

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.350
so as you can see, he got nices headers,
the only way to dribble with is to make skill moves

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:21.750
but after a skill move he could lose the ball,
dribbling with him is awful...

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.400
but there is a strong good point ! Even if may be 
this will be the same thing with the regular.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.200
It's his passing, he's very good ! short pass, long pass
forward pass, through balls, crossing

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:44.000
everyting is good here ! Like I said, 10 games, 6 assists
ok isn't terrific, but it's not bad

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:54.000
he is very good at crossing, but there isn't other thing to say...
You know what ? I will tell you a funny fact about his family

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Abedi Pele the father of Ayew, has form more players for Marseille
 now than the youngster centre... how bad is it...

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
As I said before, he assists really well, even if
Piszczek made a good run.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So yeah, he really good at passing, 
here also, even if Muller does the job

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And yeah, I want to speak about the comparaison between
Muller and IF Ayew.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:35.500
So they have some similar stats, even if Muller is taller than
Ayew, but ...

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.200
Now you can see a thing I like to do, when the game begin
I try to pass everyone with the skills moves.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:56.000
I can't do this with Ayew, but it's a success with Muller.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.040
it's pisses me off because they have really similar stats...
but you know, there isn't logic with stats...

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.000
It's EA do I have to tell you again ?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
We will finish with a goal by IF Ayew through...
but if you REALLY want to try IF Ayew

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Try him with the Engine chemistry style, who improved :
Speed, dribbing and passing.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.100
because I think it will be the best card for him

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.850
Now, the final step : the overview.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.750
For the good points, it's like the regular: 
good header, good passing and can defend

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.600
but for the bad points, there is more in the IF version :
The EA Logic...

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.000
especially his Positioning, I was like :
"Where Ayew ?!" (sorry :( )

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Anyway, for the final score, I will say this...

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.400
And now you know what that means...
That's the made in EA Sports

00:06:47.400 --> 00:07:00.000
You know when you trust EA : You pack a lot and get nothing,
you build a strong team, but you are better with Ibarbo-Muriel

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.750
So like I said, is a total disappointment
try the regular who is really better

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:32.750
So this is the end, I hope you like it...
Don't try to understand it's an another blabla french style ^^

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:38.500
don't hesitate to comment if you like it or not :)
see you later for other adventures !

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.360
Shit, What I do ?!
