00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.990
 a great story it would be necessary that 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.959
 you there tells others returning a 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.599
 marcoussis it's like there was 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:12.969
 decided to take his place but just his 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.919
 place to weave a goal that can not 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.260
 to make waves that do not believe themselves doomed 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:20.590
 a great destiny but that the strength of the 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.619
 things are going a little bit bring it to asco m I 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.179
 think the hall the quest of two young 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.789
 men who can to repeat the mistake of 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.439
 his ancestors or who that examples this 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.869
 So is power and power 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.329
 around him are associated with the 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.510
 decadence to something bad of 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.300
 for id and that's this picture of who's going 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.270
 see at the beginning so he's going to fight 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.489
 but as it goes, it's as if 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.800
 was going there we can understand the evil 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.809
 that they had put away crew the team that 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.820
 was not just a story of him 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.410
 same but who was the great evil 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.079
 academic can happen to anyone 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.489
 who's pissing and that's the accumulation of 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.519
 events that make who I think we 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.230
 we become good or bad with time 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.960
 or bitter or it's because the line is 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.280
 always gray this context there it was 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.430
 many apple did actually 1-1 species 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.260
 of heroes buried in me I got 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.730
 remembered a few full things that have who 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.090
 had rocked my childhood my 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.980
 teens had to desert to conquer 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.640
 things from the great outdoors of this 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.500
 kind of magic then hope the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.200
 much fed tso so I just 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.620
 finish making voice in the movie 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:38.320
 sarine ladakh pic who is a young 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.060

 with the report to his parents at the beginning 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.580
 that she is really a little girl 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.170
 they do not want to let her go then 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.930
 she said no I want to go I was 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.550

 she will learn to assert herself more 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.970
 take his place 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.170

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.200
 not say that for all the docks me we 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.920
 no longer engaged I have nothing 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.300
 against tradition at sea but we 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.460
 must also listen to our heart 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.100
 poutou the ex and 1 it's a hunter him 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.880
 it's the one who makes his father go to him 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.130
 lend the only rifle from the club village 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.350
 and worth it from this rifle there he goes 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.410
 actually go looking for series 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.640
 locke is the promised land os 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.890
 pose to your game passes counts in 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.010
 family there are full brand 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.740
 beautiful on the opening plan we have 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.600
 we see the ice floes we see there 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.090
 immensity snow 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.710
 my brother went to and kalou and 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.540
 lately then he also told me 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.160
 since landscapes are elected this lack 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.550
 it's me it gives me the taste to go 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.790
 to see it's a story invented by 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:35.480
 against mythology and us and 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:39.680
 intervene then it's the forces of 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.050
 a lot of trouble these are the powers of a 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.930
 shaman is also goodness and 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.150
 the humanity of a woman who is the 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.810
 character that I play called 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.230
 sayah me I felt right away 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.410
 challenged I felt like a 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.190
 child enter a story 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:05.150
 I was glad too that they offer me this 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.480
 character there is this maturity 1.2 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:18.010
 of the character who drew me all the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:22.580
 side to believe in his own power of 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:27.980
 to express all its all its power 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:30.560
 to be who have nor I think that's it 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.840
 something that can talk to us and to 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.600
 all ages 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.360
 I feel because every age 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.390
 represents these obstacles in the film 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.090
 animated rio the good guys and the bad guys 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.830
 like in the real fiction flames and 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.370
 I inherited this nasty man 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.500
 wicked that I love and that I defend 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.960
 very very good because it's a good 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.200
 naughty it's a good bad guy it's a 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:01.470
 to be as we meet everywhere 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.650
 is who and the difficulty to accept each other 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.370
 through mistakes he made 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:11.100
 and saas and it's very beautiful to play it's 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:16.320
 this suffering the beautiful play and 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.970
 asks for a fairness that does not have who 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.370
 not just the pain of 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.950
 suffering or sharing to scare 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:27.810
 but how do we go about 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:29.490
 bring the character to pass 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.130
 the emotion is that which is interesting 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.720
 that's what I like a lot and and the 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.240
 color palette jkrowling and the 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.080
 vast it obviously happens in the 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:45.380
 great north so it's vast and dense is 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:48.750
 vastitude one must be able to create ddd 10 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.180
 just on the horizon but but creates 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.860
 images that make it not just the 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.890
 loss of view but at the same time 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.830
 so well done it's so good 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.900
 to bring all this this universe there which 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.100
 equip them obviously experienced one towards 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:11.850
 the Inuit universe I think that 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:13.800
 all young people will embark where are 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.600
 past all the animals that's almost 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.680
 three moons now I hope the 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.680
 other lucky roundabout that we 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.030
 shaman indicate the spirits are angry 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:44.020
 against him it's up to him to bring back 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:51.190
 animals since he adam raga de 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:52.990
 hypertension that you know the language 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:57.039
 lemmings them 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:07:01.870
 no it's shamans not even our 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:06.909
 animals give me keep animals 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:09.250
 are made to be eaten at click to 

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:09.909
 Because looking at the bridge for barely 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.770
 make a bite 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:13.889
 it could feed a poutou dog 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:17.139
 leach pleases your future wife 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:23.680
 ok but hides the good all the 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:25.440
 world is hungry right now I quickly at 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.300
 the less we do not leave my life 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.400
 you're talking about a bunch of hunters 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.659
 instead of bringing game 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.690
 we now have one more mouth to 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:33.690
 feed
