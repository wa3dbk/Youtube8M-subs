00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
so far away we've created what is called

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.010 
so far away we've created what is called
a<00:05:14.430> virtual<00:05:14.880> cursor<00:05:15.120> which<00:05:15.510> is<00:05:15.660> an<00:05:15.750> extension

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
a virtual cursor which is an extension

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.270 
a virtual cursor which is an extension
of<00:05:16.320> my<00:05:16.530> hand<00:05:16.800> show<00:05:17.520> you<00:05:17.610> how<00:05:17.760> that<00:05:17.790> works<00:05:19.280> can

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
of my hand show you how that works can

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.970 
of my hand show you how that works can
you<00:05:20.340> go<00:05:20.460> ahead<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:20.760> activate<00:05:21.470> my<00:05:22.470> hand<00:05:22.740> again

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:29.370 
you go ahead and activate my hand again
to<00:05:23.310> be<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.700> cursor

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.880
