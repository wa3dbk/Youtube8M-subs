00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.899
 hello today we are going to learn how to do 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:09.230
 our own wrapping paper like this 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:12.469
 that you have here that will be very beautiful and 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.440
 much more original than one bought 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.530
 I hope you like it to make our 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.530
 own wrapping paper everything we 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.570
 to need is some kraft paper or 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.900
 painter's paper that is what you see 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.440
 here that is this brown color and with 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.099
 one texture one rough face on the other 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.590
 do not 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.510
 a stamp to decorate our paper as 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.620
 more we like you can do it 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.329
 themselves even and some ink from 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.449
 color that you like we have 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.920
 chosen a clarito to highlight 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.420
 on kraft paper the colors that 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.120
 better they are because they are so clear their 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.010
 well pastel or a white some tone 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.590
 usual because the role of possible 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.070
 quite dark 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.800
 let's start cutting the portion of 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.129
 paper that we will optimize for 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.780
 wrap our gift you can do it 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.530
 directly with the whole roll but it will be 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.270
 much more cumbersome I advise you 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.130
 you better go doing it according to more 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.470
 using the paper for yours 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.180
 rivals and in this way you can use a 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.180
 different site for each small 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.420
 when you already have the paper cut if it is 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.090
 a kraft paper like this that I have 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.770
 here that has a rougher part and 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.540
 another smoother that will flow more to the touch 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.670
 we have to bear in mind that the face 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.470
 rugosa will go inward thereby 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.330
 is going to be the one that is not going to look like that 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.940
 we will do our stamping for 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.320
 the other 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.120
 so that it is softer to the touch 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.120
 so we will study our paper well 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.439
 to start decorating it 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.880
 once we have our well placed 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.340
 paper the time has come to start 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.470
 decorate it for it we 're going to help 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.520
 of the seal and the ink previously 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.010
 chosen if we want it to be uniform 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.470
 we're going to have to stamp the stamp on 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.540
 the ink every time we go to draw 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.200
 because if we are not going to achieve drawings that 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.300
 are of a lower clarity than another one 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.010
 will notice how we are spending the 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.850
 make several strokes for that 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.130
 I recommend wetting and giving 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.010
 so that it is more or less uniform what 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.590
 what we are going to do is put a 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.810
 stamp above and another one below one up 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.900
 or below making a kind of zig 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:49.280
 zag and let's repeat this for all the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:53.350
 paper is worth then they are very strong and 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.660
 we mark a cover try to make you stay 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.230
 tight for this to happen to us 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:05.069
 that is a little red even so 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.049
 as is a wrapper for handmade 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.389
 it's not going to look perfect like a 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.730
 industrial but it's a little alone is it 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:15.120
 that gives you that magic of what is done by hand 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.650
 well as you see, I would start to have 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.329
 our stamp 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.980
 in shape now the next row we're going to 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.590
 do exactly the same thing we're going to 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.930
 leave a space like this more or less to 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.720
 start doing the same thing we would do a 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.000
 up and another down and so on 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.920
 complete the entire surface of the paper 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.110
 Gift 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.420
 and here that would be our package 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.220
 wrapped with our decorated paper 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.690
 I hope you liked it if it's like that 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.020
