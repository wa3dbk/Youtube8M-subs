00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello here is luck with astro again 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.109
 just like the last time 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.900
 already announced there are still today 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.320
 something to the evil adversary of john 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.700
 harrison level mesz can 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.830
 what was all said about him and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.470
 meant he wanted the prize money 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.449
 for himself he sabotaged or at least 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.970
 rigged the tester harrison clock 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.689
 He put harrison stones in the way where 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.689
 it only went 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.460
 but the allegations went on until 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.140
 a halting tactics had the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.930
 fast spread of watches in the way 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.120
 stood and would be guilty of that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.320
 death of many sailors watch the clock for lack of time 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.399
 no possibility of safe 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.100
 had navigation 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.110
 if you look further you want to please 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.879
 I think he'll find somewhere, too 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.780
 at least at full moon, small children 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.190
 Now I have eaten innumerable 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.199
 sailors had him to live 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.460
 owe 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.680
 what is certain there was no friend of the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.770
 watch at least not as the sole 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.410
 means to determine the length why 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.609
 about it can be regulated diligently 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.290
 maybe it found itself dangerous in 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.299
 the hands of a complex technical 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.340
 device to go with the means of transport 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.350
 can not be repaired and its 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.500
 correct function can hardly be verified 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.909
 can somehow be trusted or that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.270
 are the arguments nowadays 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.920
 may be attached against tps 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.900
 he was also just his internet in the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.189
 away so he does not have any mechanical 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.869
 solutions for a supposed 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.530
 accept astronomical problem 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.869
 could certainly have been a watch for the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.520
 Most sailors too expensive 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.259
 the replica of the gentleman is the james watch 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.810
 cook on his second world tour 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.790
 had been made by lag kandel 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.579
 It took two years 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.430
 mind you only the replica and the clock 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.200
 cost 500 pounds so after today 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.509
 scale half a million euros 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.579
 a complete blessing of the ship 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.700
 mean size cost less then 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.880
 For many, a watch in 2005 was a simple one 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.119
 priceless and many a sailor was 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.979
 happy about mask linz solution already end 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.840
 the 17th century had the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.570
 Astronomers have a clear idea 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.759
 Solving the problem you wanted 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.830
 position of the moon in relation to 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.410
 sun or the fixed stars as 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.349
 scale take this position changed 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.540
 per hour about half a degree 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.879
 the trick was roughly in it 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.950
 the relative position of the moon too 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.290
 measure to see what time 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.690
 the moon exactly this position to one 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.790
 reference point had from now it works 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.799
 continue as with the clock from the difference 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.540
 between the time on the ship and 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.700
 the time at reference point results in the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.040
 Longitude difference profiles minutes 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.380
 1 degree 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.810
 the problem of the method was but that is 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.010
 there were many problems 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.410
 First, there were no exact ones 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.180
 Sternenkarte one did not understand how 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.190
 the path of the moon runs and why 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.239
 that was so 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.829
 therefore, there was a precalculation 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.930
 not to think at all 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.360
 regardless of that too 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.769
 later turned out to be difficult and 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.930
 in the end there was no reasonable 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.970
 device with the distance between 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.790
 The sun and the moon would have been accurate enough 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.560
 But the Middle Ages was over 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.269
 It was the time of explorers and 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.810
 Scientist and so it went with 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.850
 Giant steps ahead , hell is planting 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.769
 yes, with the comet and later 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.410
 more astronomers just engraved the 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.480
 starry sky newton already had to be 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.519
 famous law of gravitation developed 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.819
 which makes the bards of the moon better 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.440
 In 1731, Hitler built his mind 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.200
 quadrants the precursor of the modern 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.660
 sextants for accurate angle measurements 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.549
 the German tobias meyer made it 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.319
 to calculate the moon train ahead 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.269
 thereby the served 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.970
 differential equations of the swiss 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.889
 leonard euler so the who's who of 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.280
 then science closed slowly 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.299
 Incidentally, the gaps in the system were preserved 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.329
 some of the named persons 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.160
 Prize money from the race commission with it 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.530
 it is also clear that in the rivalries 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.930
 between muscles and harrison not that 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.730
 money the main role played prize money 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.500
 Both could have got the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.889
 The long-term commission has up to her 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.069
 Resolution 828 more than 100,000 pounds 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.750
 Go back to the topic of masks 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.530
 he had everything together now 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.480
 need 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.470
 the degree of length without mechanical clock 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.829
 delivered in 1767, he brought the first 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.910
 90s out the detailed 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.980
 precalculations for the mouth position 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.380
 in relation to the sun and selected 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.950
 fixstern achieves an example of mountain here 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.240
 from april table expects the 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.730
 the calculation as easy as possible 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.610
 Do it all at a ridiculous price 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.200
 really with a clock 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.360
 The method had some weaknesses 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.220
 but you just go against one 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.660
 was much better than a clock you 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.030
 not owned because you can not 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.500
 could afford and so spread 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.660
 Merkel into the moon method like a 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.880
 surface fire a decade later 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.060
 already use a majority of the ships 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.070
 worldwide its publication as 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.930
 place of receipt for the precalculated 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.419
 it just takes his time 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.250
 seat of office for him as royal 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.890
 astronomer at the observatory 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.080
 reached south of London and therewith 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.090
 The sailors started in their handlebars 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.010
 relative to the observatory of Greenwich to 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:15.660
 order pragmatically without 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:18.270
 ulterior motives as 884 in washington the 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.790
 international media conference the whole 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.760
 officially made her bless only 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.560
 the status quo to the thing under the 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.180
 politicians of course only eternal 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.900
 debates but in the end they had 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.970
 no choice 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.450
 The sailors worldwide would hardly have 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.160
 another judgment accepted that max 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.720
 Kunz method finally there 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.479
 probably just a victim 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.190
 He has not experienced any more 1908 customers 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.410
 the moon distances from the article al 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.090
 barag taken out the place has one 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.950
 But there is still a lot of work to this day 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.460
 that was enough excursion into the 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.650
 history 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:57.110
 next time it's about the astro again 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.110
 navigation itself until then bye
