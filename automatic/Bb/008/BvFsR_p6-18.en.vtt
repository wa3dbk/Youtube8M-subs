00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.600
 Here Defender. I have a problem. 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.900
 Someone is trying to kill me. 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.100

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.100
 - Jack. Is the job OK? - Yeah, yeah. 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.760
 You sold it to me as an office job. 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.500
 Why are not you sitting? 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.200
 Now tell me your most scary scenario. 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.400
 Keep in mind that I do not have your doctorate. 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.400
 Tokyo, London, USA, will disappear from the map. 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.400
 We never see it coming. 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.200
 You are no longer a simple analyst. You are fighting now. 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.000
 - Jack? - I have to go to Moscow. 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.500
 - Why do not you want me to come with you? - Because I'll work all the time. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.400
 They play hard over there, Jack. Viktor Chervenin is unpredictable. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.900
 You Americans think you are right. You may just be rude. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.900
 Perhaps you are infallible. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.800
 - Jack, you still have a problem. - What are you doing here? 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.300
 - You're lying to me for three years. You tell me you're in the CIA. - Of course not.. 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.000
 - Can I have 1 minute, please? - No. 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.500
 Here is geopolitical not couples treatment. 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.700
 Partnerships are sensitive, Mr. Ryan. 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.200
 They sometimes end violently. 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.400
 What good is going on here? 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.100
 Sometimes we have to trust less our closest people. 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.300
 We all have our secrets. 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.200
 Do you think this is a game, Jack? 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 They will kneel us without even pulling the trigger. 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.000
 We have a real script here and we will not get out of it. 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.000
 We've been exposed. 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.000
 If you find the truth, will you believe it? 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:19.000
