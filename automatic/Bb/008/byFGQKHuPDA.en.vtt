00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.800
 and so far what worries us a lot about the caregiver 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.500
 is how you have for example to move the patient how he has to move his 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.659
 father to his mother 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:13.449
 when they are in bed because the caregivers usually have another 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.050
 witness column problems apart from anxiety and stress that also 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.820
 It will include what we call 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.620
 the one that grew the caregiver i usually work in the care of the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.539
 Unemployment caregiver does not take care he will not be able to take care of but sorry 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.500
 power word but really 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.609
 it really is that way we have to work the physical aspect 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.060
 and we have to work the psychological aspect and put together the physical aspect 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.890
 you could never see it one thing 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.160
 we say that women are usually taken care of and escape the woman 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.230
 and caring for a woman alone and many times the woman wants to encourage the person 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.110
 is taking care and surely 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.320
 good part of the sufferings of the person who cares with what we have 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.479
 have a special care for this person 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.559
 because they really are the ones that sustain the whole system of care there is that 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.709
 person in situation of dependency because I think that as a button shows 

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:03.139
 we have brought a bed precisely articulated around 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:04.659
 patios are doing well we have already 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.500
 a ramÃ³n prepared as we advance and we will see how we can 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.260
 I knew how to move the angels to attack her and we are going to see how they only care 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.570
 general of the bed 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.980
 logically we recommend for absolute comfort to be used for your 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.310
 patient safety 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.420
 on the patera that may involve the caregiver 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.690
 they say he approached dedicates like like this guy 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.590
 yes but approved where there is a slight inclination elevation 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.090
 forgive the feet and then do a little bit more of the head if there is no 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.130
 no cause that does not tell the doctor that contraindicated 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.720
 there is a very interesting thing people in the inclination that should have the headboard 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.110
 of the bed we usually arrive to the intimate how ill the lion removes it the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.570
 residence with almost vertical headings of the patient in the low point 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.040
 of the bed has become pink displaced and one of the points that most 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.870
 suffers when the person is mobilized which are the heels 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.200
 the poet not pressing against him the edge of the bed 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.500
 well to avoid that the salons suffer pressure for talca already austere by 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.049
 price 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.020
 we use this type of contraption that as you can see is a shooter is a fleece 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.950
 as we say in andalusia 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.439
 we are going to apply the spill 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.129
 on the heel 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.469
 and simply 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:13.709
 We are going to use 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.809
 the adhesive that it takes to avoid 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.379
 that the heel his farah pressure when this 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.149
 against the bed 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:23.189
 to avoid that pressure to decrease the pressure loads we use 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.499
 elements like this 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.929
 mattresses antiescaras of a mattress of the most basic a pneumatic mattress 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:33.010
 he simply carries a lot of air pump like that he talked about what we put 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.279
 To prevent things from breaking, well, the organism when it takes a long time 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:38.260
 time for almazara gif and sadness 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.180
 this pomp gehry tank because when we support the air charge the cell 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.859
 moved towards the other and avoids that there is a continued pressure on the fao 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.930
 the inclination of the bed no more than 35 degrees millimeters a tilt 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.279
 Really good 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.569
 this person can breathe and simply when the time comes 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.729
 eat when it's time to drink 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.349
 let's raise the headboard of the bed 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.520
 If the person has mobility problems in the neck in the back 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.070
 I'm going to raise a straw to give them to drink because we're going to see with him 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.800
 the glass the probity that chokes is very 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.469
 is very good 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.479
 and then when it comes time to mobilize we want to mobilize as 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:19.589
 maximum maximum every two hours if a person is in bed immobilized 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:22.940
 ndola we move every two hours to people who can not move on their own 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.009
 the probity of sincere 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:26.439
 the heels 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:31.979
 the hips elsa actor the elbows even the ear is very high 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.239
 For that 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.700
 It is convenient to use as an intermediate sheet between 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.439
 mockus author of God because 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.819
 because pulling haiti is much easier to push and especially because 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.829
 when he pushed I love the probity that we turn to the very tall person of the 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.449
 mona bomu and the edge of the can 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.139
 we throw away the disease 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.609
 branches in the measured prater 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.980
 and once cherry position we started turning a little bit the legs we started 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.689
 Looking a little at men, you never have to do a rough turn with 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:01.859
 the shoulder with them has but very little by little 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.959
 we are not delivering we release 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.139
 always the front arm by a meter position 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.209
 honest but you have to release it and get it out 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.599
 we press lightly the legs we are going to be very careful not to rub 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.840
 foot with knee to knee dress 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.469
 if that is what happens 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:20.769
 the ether image a pillow or put a cushion you have to get this material 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.670
 Antiescaras cushions taken to prevent the person 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.070
 your phrase rubbing 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.680
 skin with skin the earth we will always have very hydrated always after 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.850
 of the bathroom we are going to give him of the daily bath 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.080
 We are going to give you a little bath of moisturizer at night another year of 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.830
 moisturizer so that you sleep with the sensation 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.850
 more pleasant p and I tell you every two hours at the most 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:43.139
 in this position 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.340
 we turned to the center we would turn it over to the other and turn it over instead of doing it 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.520
 A) Yes 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.039
 ego do girona yes that will suffer much the back we will do with the 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.100
 back straight and always playing flex 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.879
 knee 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.900
 and even people who are subjected 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.690
 a lot of movement of even professionals uses a preventive fajita 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.789
 to prevent the person's sword from suffering

 many for montilla
