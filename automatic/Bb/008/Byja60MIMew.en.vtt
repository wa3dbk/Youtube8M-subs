00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:14.169
 is pac 1 an airplane 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:22.060
 in fact the super petrel a bit of both he could land on the land and in the 

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:24.929
 water on this plane to fipe the 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.929
 changed the history of aeronautics 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.649
 he asks 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.649
 190 kilometers from são paulo 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.190
 began 13 years as representative and assemblers of airplanes and helicopters 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.190
 foreigners in brazil 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.030
 until these two engineers decided to resume a French project 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.629
 that was abandoned 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.769
 I think this was the secret stones this is the cat's leap 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.650
 by the target public power itself to 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.730
 even with pain 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.680
 the event begins with the chapter 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.360
 the third was perfect 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.740
 improved production techniques 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.890
 and to manufacturing began to use what is most modern in construction 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.510
 aeronautics as an athlete and to carbon fiber imported materials 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.010
 that are light 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.370
 not super tough 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.180
 this type of obstacle that works with a bulletproof vest and traipú 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.040
 protect yourself 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.170
 of an object wanting to enter while going through the case 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.240
 more than 10 years ago that rodrigo began to develop the project of the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.290
 super petrel 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.400
 this plane was 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.780
 the fifth generation is faster but more and more Brazilians mother 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.440
 single 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.600
 exactly the part of the airplane to use imported equipment 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.490
 He is totally made in Brazil. 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.350
 through 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.430
 Brazilian 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.460
 the executive's aviation pilot moves almost 1 billion reais per 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.250
 year in Brazil the super petrel associate him in this market since he is the only one 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.519
 amphibious airplane made in the country 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.459
 which explains 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.180
 part of the success of the yacht 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.900
 which this year will produce 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.950
 15% more homemade manufacturing increased business risks 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.009
 but also increased revenue 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.009
 the board of the company that has 2 80 employees 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:32.329
 each plane takes six weeks to assemble and costs 175 thousand reais 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.589
 I want to stay 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:38.619
 but not for those who have just realized a dream of a child as an entrepreneur dante 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:41.549
 bridge if the wave is going to make some evidence 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.739
 will realize that keeping 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.689
 the paraná come may not please much poorer 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.699
 what do you keep an automobile in category i exporter and since the 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.829
 the subject of aviation, we should not miss an opportunity to prove 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.629
 genuinely Brazilian product 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.629
 next to a businessman like to fly high 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:07.729
 but no no and no 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.729
 on a note 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.479
 at the time already plans the next flight 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:28.609
 produce a 100% national plane bigger 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.809
 the biofuel to keep the business in the air 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:35.129
 the heart that it is necessary to know what the nasa days 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.690
 Look a lot of work before anything else. 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.690
 lots of technology many science studies 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.709
 and I think the fundamental to fines
