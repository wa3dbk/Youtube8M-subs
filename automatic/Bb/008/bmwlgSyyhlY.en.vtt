this<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.049> G<00:00:13.230> 7th<00:00:13.590> Newport<00:00:14.370> capo<00:00:15.210> it's

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
this is the G 7th Newport capo it's

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.470 
this is the G 7th Newport capo it's
based<00:00:16.350> on<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.590> tried<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:16.949> tested<00:00:17.480> flipped

based on a tried and tested flipped

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.390 
based on a tried and tested flipped
lever<00:00:18.779> style<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:20.010> capo<00:00:21.000> which<00:00:21.980> we<00:00:22.980> felt<00:00:23.220> had

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
lever style of capo which we felt had

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.000 
lever style of capo which we felt had
some<00:00:23.640> drawbacks<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.869> metal<00:00:25.410> could<00:00:25.710> come<00:00:25.920> in

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
some drawbacks the metal could come in

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.310 
some drawbacks the metal could come in
contact<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.420> neck<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.779> guitar<00:00:27.869> when

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
contact with the neck of the guitar when

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.349 
contact with the neck of the guitar when
you<00:00:28.410> put<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:28.830> when<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.789> dropped<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.210> in

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
you put it on when you dropped it on in

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.089 
you put it on when you dropped it on in
place<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.720> rubber<00:00:30.900> tended<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.380> move<00:00:31.560> past<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
place the rubber tended to move past the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.770 
place the rubber tended to move past the
bass<00:00:32.250> string<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.059> had<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.329> adjust

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
bass string so that you had to adjust

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.299 
bass string so that you had to adjust
the<00:00:33.930> position<00:00:34.320> before<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.710> tightened<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.190> up

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the position before you tightened it up

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.040 
the position before you tightened it up
and<00:00:35.940> when<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.149> tightened<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.930> was

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and when you tightened it up it was

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.830 
and when you tightened it up it was
actually<00:00:37.350> quite<00:00:37.500> hard<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.010> adjust<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.840> you

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
actually quite hard to adjust and you

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.299 
actually quite hard to adjust and you
certainly<00:00:40.079> couldn't<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.620> operated<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.190> with

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
certainly couldn't have operated it with

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.150 
certainly couldn't have operated it with
one<00:00:41.489> hand<00:00:42.140> so<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> Newport<00:00:43.770> capo<00:00:43.950> we've

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
one hand so with a Newport capo we've

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.459 
one hand so with a Newport capo we've
tried<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.430> overcome<00:00:45.000> all<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.420> those<00:00:45.960> problems

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
tried to overcome all of those problems

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.850 
tried to overcome all of those problems
we<00:00:47.250> use<00:00:47.520> silicon<00:00:48.180> rubber<00:00:48.329> all<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.440> way<00:00:49.530> around

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
we use silicon rubber all the way around

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.580 
we use silicon rubber all the way around
here<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.789> protect<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.629> neck<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.170> silicone

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
here is to protect the neck and silicone

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.330 
here is to protect the neck and silicone
rubber<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:53.010> virtually<00:00:53.820> inert<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.829> it<00:00:55.829> isn't

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
rubber is virtually inert so it isn't

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.549 
rubber is virtually inert so it isn't
going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.640> damage<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.960> finish<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.530> your

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
going to damage the finish on your

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.459 
going to damage the finish on your
guitar<00:00:59.010> as<00:00:59.850> well<00:00:59.910> as<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.690> operates<00:01:01.140> with

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
guitar as well as that it operates with

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.830 
guitar as well as that it operates with
the<00:01:01.500> simple<00:01:01.949> same<00:01:02.340> flip<00:01:02.760> lever<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.719> be

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the simple same flip lever but it can be

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.530 
the simple same flip lever but it can be
adjusted<00:01:04.260> quite<00:01:04.500> easily<00:01:04.710> there<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.360> neck

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
adjusted quite easily there on the neck

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.820 
adjusted quite easily there on the neck
with<00:01:07.049> no<00:01:07.080> problem<00:01:08.600> in<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.110> Newport<00:01:10.500> range<00:01:10.680> of

finger boards and flat finger boards and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.949 
finger boards and flat finger boards and
it's<00:02:16.140> really<00:02:16.470> light<00:02:16.680> if<00:02:17.220> your<00:02:18.180> nylon<00:02:18.720> string

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
it's really light if your nylon string

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.589 
it's really light if your nylon string

guitar has a curved fingerboard you
might<00:02:21.810> be<00:02:21.930> better<00:02:22.050> with<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.790> 12<00:02:23.790> string<00:02:24.030> capo

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
might be better with the 12 string capo

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.380 
might be better with the 12 string capo
which<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.340> same<00:02:26.519> length<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.180> with<00:02:27.360> a

which is the same length but with a
radius<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.620> really<00:02:28.890> good<00:02:29.069> for<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> 12

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519
