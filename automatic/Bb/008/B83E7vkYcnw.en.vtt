for<00:01:11.370> a<00:01:11.400> transcriber<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> teacher<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.990> that

for a transcriber for a teacher is that

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.590 
for a transcriber for a teacher is that
the<00:01:13.830> drums<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.280> been<00:01:14.460> muted<00:01:14.820> by<00:01:14.970> towels<00:01:15.300> and

the drums have been muted by towels and

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.660 
the drums have been muted by towels and
so<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.020> very<00:01:16.470> difficult<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.369> determine

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
so it's very very difficult to determine

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.240 
so it's very very difficult to determine
whether<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.509> striking<00:01:19.050> a<00:01:19.140> high<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.680> medium<00:01:20.070> or<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
to each other the rhythm is correct but

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.760 
to each other the rhythm is correct but
I<00:01:24.390> can't<00:01:25.050> be<00:01:25.170> hundred<00:01:25.380> percent<00:01:25.590> sure<00:01:25.650> what

hand<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.350> floor<00:01:46.440> Tom<00:01:46.740> multiple<00:01:47.250> notes

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
hand on the floor Tom multiple notes

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.610 
hand on the floor Tom multiple notes
with<00:01:47.580> his<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:47.880> hands<00:01:48.330> so<00:01:48.510> that<00:01:49.200> kind<00:01:49.560> of

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
with his right hands so that kind of

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.080 
with his right hands so that kind of
made<00:01:49.770> sense<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.070> me<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.190> he<00:01:50.490> played<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.850> way

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
made sense to me that he played this way

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.789 
made sense to me that he played this way
for<00:01:51.330> this<00:01:51.420> part<00:01:51.659> as<00:01:51.780> well<00:01:51.960> because<00:01:52.350> he's

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
for this part as well because he's

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.649 
for this part as well because he's
playing<00:01:53.400> multiple<00:01:53.670> hand<00:01:53.970> notes<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.540> his

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
playing multiple hand notes with his

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.390 
playing multiple hand notes with his
right<00:01:54.840> hand<00:01:54.990> anyway<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.830> jump<00:01:56.100> will<00:01:56.190> kind

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
right hand anyway so this jump will kind

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.920 
right hand anyway so this jump will kind
of<00:01:56.490> make<00:01:57.090> sense<00:01:57.270> when<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:57.720> that

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
of make sense when you do that

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.030 
of make sense when you do that
especially<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:58.440> you've<00:01:58.530> got<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.710> come<00:01:58.920> at

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
especially when you've got to come at

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.500 
especially when you've got to come at
that<00:01:59.159> snare<00:01:59.430> John<00:01:59.640> there<00:01:59.760> on<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.970> end<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.270> four

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
that snare John there on the end of four

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.820 
that snare John there on the end of four
so<00:02:01.409> again<00:02:01.799> it's<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.850> four<00:02:03.570> E<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.840> B<00:02:06.840> if

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
so again it's and four E and a and B if

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.139 
so again it's and four E and a and B if
you<00:02:07.950> cannot<00:02:08.130> move<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.340> difference<00:02:08.640> sticking<00:02:09.000> of

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
you cannot move a difference sticking of

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.930 
you cannot move a difference sticking of
course<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.570> can<00:02:09.690> use<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.019> instead<00:02:10.940> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
course you can use that instead the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.670 
course you can use that instead the
other<00:02:12.090> thing<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.330> could<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:13.200> other<00:02:13.320> thing<00:02:13.500> he

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
other thing you could the other thing he

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.770 
other thing you could the other thing he
probably<00:02:14.130> does<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.820> don't<00:02:15.090> think<00:02:15.299> he<00:02:15.390> does<00:02:15.540> but

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
probably does I don't think he does but

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.990 
probably does I don't think he does but
it's<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.320> possibility<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.430> last<00:02:17.640> thought

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
it's a possibility is that last thought

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.580 
it's a possibility is that last thought
on<00:02:18.030> though<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.570> played<00:02:18.870> on<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.230> bass<00:02:19.560> drum

on though is played on the bass drum

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.770 
on though is played on the bass drum
what<00:02:20.489> every<00:02:20.730> time<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.030> place<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.450> signature

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
what every time you place is signature

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.570 
what every time you place is signature
fill<00:02:22.049> definitely<00:02:22.769> sometimes<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.280> sniffing

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
fill definitely sometimes it sniffing

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.229

reminds<00:03:08.150> me<00:03:08.299> of<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.569> way<00:03:08.720> Roger<00:03:09.680> Taylor<00:03:10.010> from

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
reminds me of the way Roger Taylor from

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.830 
reminds me of the way Roger Taylor from
Queen<00:03:10.489> plays<00:03:10.819> where<00:03:11.090> he<00:03:11.150> does<00:03:11.330> that<00:03:11.480> signature

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
Queen plays where he does that signature

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.069 
Queen plays where he does that signature
thing<00:03:12.110> as<00:03:12.230> well<00:03:12.440> he's<00:03:12.680> like<00:03:12.830> an<00:03:17.079> opening

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
thing as well he's like an opening

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.270 
thing as well he's like an opening
closing<00:03:18.319> that<00:03:18.470> hi-hat<00:03:18.860> on<00:03:18.950> beats<00:03:19.129> two<00:03:19.250> and

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
closing that hi-hat on beats two and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.500 
closing that hi-hat on beats two and
four<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.610> I<00:03:19.670> wonder<00:03:19.970> whether<00:03:20.120> he<00:03:20.269> got<00:03:20.390> that

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
four and I wonder whether he got that

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.059 
four and I wonder whether he got that
from<00:03:20.659> Ringo<00:03:21.049> from<00:03:21.260> this<00:03:21.379> song<00:03:21.560> in<00:03:21.799> particular

from Ringo from this song in particular

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.100 
from Ringo from this song in particular
because<00:03:22.549> obviously<00:03:22.760> this<00:03:22.970> came<00:03:23.150> before<00:03:23.299> Roger

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
because obviously this came before Roger

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
of beat one or buzz very very hard to

hear<00:03:48.379> you<00:03:48.980> can<00:03:49.099> of<00:03:49.220> course<00:03:49.250> use<00:03:49.670> your

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
hear you can of course use your

imaginations and have fun with it you

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.400

can ghost it double it and drag it buzz
it's<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.700> then<00:03:55.849> we<00:03:56.000> want<00:03:56.180> to<00:03:56.209> verse<00:03:56.450> four<00:03:56.840> and

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
it's so then we want to verse four and

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.309 
it's so then we want to verse four and
we<00:03:57.290> get<00:03:57.500> this<00:03:58.310> overdub<00:03:58.910> TomTom<00:03:59.510> part<00:03:59.840> the<00:04:00.109> song

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319

we get this overdub TomTom part the song
I<00:04:00.349> guess<00:04:00.560> you<00:04:00.680> kind<00:04:00.980> of<00:04:01.099> call<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:01.370> like<00:04:01.489> Ringo's

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
I guess you kind of call it like Ringo's

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.420 
I guess you kind of call it like Ringo's
little<00:04:02.150> drum<00:04:02.419> solo<00:04:02.840> it's<00:04:03.380> certainly<00:04:03.919> rather

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
little drum solo it's certainly rather

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.250 
little drum solo it's certainly rather
than<00:04:04.669> improvised<00:04:05.269> enough<00:04:05.599> to<00:04:05.780> make<00:04:05.930> it<00:04:06.049> sound

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
than improvised enough to make it sound

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.870 
than improvised enough to make it sound
like<00:04:06.410> a<00:04:06.500> drug<00:04:06.769> so<00:04:06.919> it's<00:04:07.069> not<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.220> fixed<00:04:07.549> pattern

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
like a drug so it's not a fixed pattern

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.270 
like a drug so it's not a fixed pattern
he's<00:04:08.000> playing<00:04:08.299> every<00:04:08.540> time<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:09.280> quite

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
he's playing every time so quite

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.400 
he's playing every time so quite
interesting<00:04:10.639> quite<00:04:10.669> tricky<00:04:11.060> but<00:04:11.419> what<00:04:12.230> he<00:04:12.290> did

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
interesting quite tricky but what he did

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.319 
interesting quite tricky but what he did
in<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.560> studio<00:04:12.980> is<00:04:13.130> he<00:04:13.370> lay<00:04:13.639> down<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.940> basic

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
in the studio is he lay down the basic

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:24.310 
in the studio is he lay down the basic
drum<00:04:14.540> beat<00:04:14.810> this<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.820> then<00:04:23.450> in<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.720> later<00:04:23.960> take

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
drum beat this and then in a later take

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.100 
drum beat this and then in a later take
over<00:04:24.860> dub<00:04:25.070> over<00:04:25.430> recorded<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.090> TomTom<00:04:26.630> parts

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
over dub over recorded the TomTom parts

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.400 
over dub over recorded the TomTom parts
and<00:04:27.349> to<00:04:28.250> create<00:04:28.430> like<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.550> layered<00:04:28.849> effect<00:04:29.410> what

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
and to create like a layered effect what

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.460 
and to create like a layered effect what
we<00:04:30.500> got<00:04:30.740> is<00:04:31.639> we've<00:04:31.880> got<00:04:31.910> eight<00:04:32.180> bars<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:32.810> each

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
we got is we've got eight bars and each

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.129 
we got is we've got eight bars and each
part<00:04:33.830> is<00:04:34.160> a<00:04:34.520> very<00:04:35.300> very<00:04:35.690> different<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:35.990> each

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
part is a very very different to each

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.990 
part is a very very different to each
other<00:04:36.320> great<00:04:36.800> last<00:04:37.220> one<00:04:37.370> Ringo<00:04:37.669> nice<00:04:37.820> and

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
other great last one Ringo nice and

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.580 
other great last one Ringo nice and
random<00:04:38.330> for<00:04:38.539> us<00:04:38.599> too<00:04:38.750> though<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:39.650> be<00:04:40.039> and<00:04:40.660> 3/8

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
random for us too though to be and 3/8

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.620 
random for us too though to be and 3/8
and<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:44.220> like<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.790> sort<00:04:44.940> catches<00:04:45.570> you

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
and I like that it sort catches you

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.700 
and I like that it sort catches you
off-guard<00:04:45.780> when<00:04:46.200> you've<00:04:46.350> been<00:04:46.470> hearing

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
off-guard when you've been hearing

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.990 
off-guard when you've been hearing
they're<00:04:47.190> dead<00:04:47.400> they<00:04:47.550> do<00:04:47.760> they<00:04:48.720> do<00:04:49.550> did<00:04:50.550> they<00:04:50.580> do

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
they're dead they do they do did they do

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.330 
they're dead they do they do did they do
and<00:04:51.360> therefore<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:52.230> comes<00:04:52.650> in<00:04:52.770> one<00:04:52.980> sixteenth

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
and therefore it comes in one sixteenth

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.570 
and therefore it comes in one sixteenth
note<00:04:53.490> earlier<00:04:54.000> in<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:54.330> previous<00:04:54.750> parts<00:04:55.530> so<00:04:56.490> it

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
note earlier in the previous parts so it

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.830 
note earlier in the previous parts so it
kind<00:04:56.730> of<00:04:56.820> grabs<00:04:57.030> your<00:04:57.210> attention<00:04:57.300> a<00:04:57.690> little

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
kind of grabs your attention a little

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.740 
kind of grabs your attention a little
bit<00:04:58.080> nice<00:04:58.620> little<00:04:58.860> idea<00:04:59.270> it's<00:05:00.270> very<00:05:00.360> hard<00:05:00.690> to

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
bit nice little idea it's very hard to

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.159 
bit nice little idea it's very hard to
replicate<00:05:00.930> ringo's<00:05:01.560> feel<00:05:01.860> so<00:05:02.840> I'm<00:05:03.840> not<00:05:03.960> doing

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
replicate ringo's feel so I'm not doing

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.080 
replicate ringo's feel so I'm not doing
a<00:05:04.230> very<00:05:04.410> good<00:05:04.440> job<00:05:04.530> I'm<00:05:04.770> sure<00:05:04.950> but<00:05:05.130> you<00:05:05.580> might

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
a very good job I'm sure but you might

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.250 
a very good job I'm sure but you might
do<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.240> better<00:05:06.389> job<00:05:06.540> where<00:05:06.840> you<00:05:06.900> can<00:05:06.930> sort<00:05:07.230> of

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
do a better job where you can sort of

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.830 
do a better job where you can sort of
just<00:05:07.410> hear<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:07.770> song<00:05:07.980> a<00:05:08.010> lot<00:05:08.130> of<00:05:08.190> times<00:05:08.280> and

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
just hear the song a lot of times and

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.940 
just hear the song a lot of times and
replicate<00:05:09.840> that<00:05:09.990> feel<00:05:10.200> that<00:05:10.350> he<00:05:10.410> puts<00:05:10.620> into<00:05:10.800> it

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
replicate that feel that he puts into it

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.830 
replicate that feel that he puts into it
you<00:05:13.950> want<00:05:14.100> to<00:05:14.220> play<00:05:14.340> more<00:05:14.550> but<00:05:14.790> Ringo<00:05:15.450> doesn't

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
you want to play more but Ringo doesn't

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.409 
you want to play more but Ringo doesn't
so<00:05:16.380> that's<00:05:16.860> a<00:05:16.979> sign<00:05:17.370> of<00:05:17.520> a<00:05:17.610> real<00:05:17.760> master<00:05:18.270> being

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
so that's a sign of a real master being

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.629 
so that's a sign of a real master being
and<00:05:18.540> knowing<00:05:19.080> when<00:05:19.260> to<00:05:19.290> hold<00:05:19.680> back<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.160> to<00:05:20.520> not

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
and knowing when to hold back and to not

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.010 
and knowing when to hold back and to not
overplay<00:05:21.120> because<00:05:21.389> he<00:05:21.479> could<00:05:21.690> have<00:05:21.810> he<00:05:21.990> could

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
overplay because he could have he could

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.979 
overplay because he could have he could
have<00:05:22.260> played<00:05:22.410> more<00:05:22.620> than<00:05:22.650> that
