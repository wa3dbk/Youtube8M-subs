to the table but he's not being allowed
to<00:05:36.270> do<00:05:36.540> so<00:05:36.810> and<00:05:37.110> from<00:05:37.710> that<00:05:37.920> position<00:05:38.160> it's

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
to do so and from that position it's

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.060 
to do so and from that position it's
very<00:05:39.000> difficult<00:05:39.510> to<00:05:39.630> control<00:05:39.810> and<00:05:40.320> certainly

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
very difficult to control and certainly

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.090 
very difficult to control and certainly
to<00:05:41.400> put<00:05:41.940> pressure<00:05:42.270> on<00:05:42.450> an<00:05:42.600> opponent<00:05:45.860> and<00:05:46.860> that

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
to put pressure on an opponent and that

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.900 
to put pressure on an opponent and that
was<00:05:47.580> a<00:05:47.610> devastating<00:05:48.920> forehand<00:05:49.920> play<00:05:52.910> that

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
was a devastating forehand play that

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.040 
was a devastating forehand play that
looked<00:05:54.120> a<00:05:54.210> little<00:05:54.330> long<00:05:54.600> and<00:05:56.600> at<00:05:57.600> one<00:05:57.810> point

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
looked a little long and at one point

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.520 
looked a little long and at one point
then<00:05:58.380> away<00:05:58.650> it's<00:05:59.100> 14<00:05:59.670> 21<00:06:00.510> point<00:06:00.840> then<00:06:01.140> away
