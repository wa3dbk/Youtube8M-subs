basically<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.110> run<00:00:34.260> around<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.590> map<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.510> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
basically you run around the map and the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.959 
basically you run around the map and the
the<00:00:37.020> idea<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.250> far<00:00:38.430> ahead<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
the idea is to be so far ahead that the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.150 
the idea is to be so far ahead that the
last<00:00:39.239> guy<00:00:39.420> falls<00:00:39.750> off<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.079> screen<00:00:40.350> once<00:00:40.980> that

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
last guy falls off the screen once that

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.190 
last guy falls off the screen once that
happened<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.640> screen<00:00:41.940> starts<00:00:42.510> shrinking<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
happened the screen starts shrinking and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.479 
happened the screen starts shrinking and
shrinking<00:00:43.260> shrinking<00:00:43.649> feels<00:00:44.070> very<00:00:44.309> very

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
shrinking shrinking feels very very

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.490 
shrinking shrinking feels very very
small<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.850> see<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.750> very<00:00:45.899> difficult<00:00:46.110> for

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
small to see and it's very difficult for

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.650 
small to see and it's very difficult for
you<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.649> keep<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.160> one<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.629> of

unic actually the best eunuch eunuch is
our<00:01:15.570> unicorn<00:01:16.040> ask<00:01:17.040> guy<00:01:17.720> that's<00:01:18.720> not<00:01:19.049> my

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
our unicorn ask guy that's not my

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.510 
our unicorn ask guy that's not my
understanding<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.100> world<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> word

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
understanding of the world the word

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.600 
understanding of the world the word
eunuch<00:01:20.909> means<00:01:21.150> hey<00:01:21.930> everyone<00:01:22.920> came<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.369> come

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
eunuch means hey everyone came to come

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.580 
eunuch means hey everyone came to come
up<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:23.790> their<00:01:23.939> own<00:01:23.970> understanding<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:25.470> we

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
up with their own understanding and we

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.539 
up with their own understanding and we
actually<00:01:25.890> leave<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.159> out<00:01:26.340> there

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
actually leave it out there

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:34.480 
actually leave it out there
intentionally<00:01:27.390> okay

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.760 

so<00:01:35.490> never<00:01:35.670> alone<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.330> based<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:37.020> Alaska<00:01:37.530> native

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
so never alone is based on Alaska native

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.980 
so never alone is based on Alaska native
culture<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.280> essentially<00:01:38.850> you're<00:01:39.210> playing<00:01:39.600> a

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
culture and essentially you're playing a

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.289 
culture and essentially you're playing a
story<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.100> we've<00:01:41.220> told<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:41.640> generations

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
story that we've told for generations

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.590 
story that we've told for generations
and<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.649> protagonist<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.490> nuna<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.119> she's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
and so the protagonist is nuna and she's

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.630 
and so the protagonist is nuna and she's
a<00:01:45.630> new<00:01:45.960> peoc<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> game<00:01:47.159> takes<00:01:47.369> place

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
a new peoc and so the game takes place

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880 
a new peoc and so the game takes place
on<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> North<00:01:48.090> Slope<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.540> Alaska<00:01:48.710> she<00:01:49.710> has<00:01:49.860> a

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
on the North Slope of Alaska she has a

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.960 
on the North Slope of Alaska she has a
fox<00:01:50.190> companion<00:01:50.940> and<00:01:51.619> essentially<00:01:52.970> something

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
fox companion and essentially something

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.370 
fox companion and essentially something
happened<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> their<00:01:54.570> village<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.020> they're

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
happened to their village and they're

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.870 
happened to their village and they're
trying<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.770> track<00:01:56.070> down<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.460> endless

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
trying to track down this endless

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.279 
trying to track down this endless
Blizzard<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.720> they're<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:58.020> through<00:01:58.200> this

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
Blizzard and they're going through this

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.100 
Blizzard and they're going through this
journey<00:01:58.649> together<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.250> there's<00:01:59.759> a<00:02:00.119> lot<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
journey together and there's a lot of

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.570 
journey together and there's a lot of
different<00:02:01.409> elements<00:02:01.500> associated<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.460> it's

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
different elements associated but it's

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.180 
different elements associated but it's
based<00:02:02.789> on<00:02:03.000> Alaska<00:02:03.479> folklore<00:02:04.350> or<00:02:04.649> storytelling

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
based on Alaska folklore or storytelling

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.649 
based on Alaska folklore or storytelling
right<00:02:05.789> so<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.179> a<00:02:06.210> different<00:02:06.539> way<00:02:06.630> of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
right so this is a different way of

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.359 
right so this is a different way of
telling<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.319> story<00:02:07.350> that's<00:02:07.830> been<00:02:07.979> passed<00:02:08.190> down

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
telling a story that's been passed down

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.609 
telling a story that's been passed down
for<00:02:08.700> centuries<00:02:09.080> it's<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.229> way<00:02:10.380> of<00:02:10.500> actually

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
for centuries it's a way of actually

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.470 
for centuries it's a way of actually
playing<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.039> story<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.519> that's<00:02:11.880> been<00:02:12.090> told<00:02:12.269> for

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
playing a story and that's been told for

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.100 
playing a story and that's been told for
generations

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
generations

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.870 
generations
so<00:02:13.650> what<00:02:14.010> form<00:02:14.220> does<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.459> actual<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
so what form does the actual the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.420 
so what form does the actual the
gameplay<00:02:15.480> take<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.680> puzzle<00:02:17.040> platformer

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
gameplay take it's a puzzle platformer

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.370 
gameplay take it's a puzzle platformer
game<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.880> lot<00:02:18.390> similar<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.810> stuff<00:02:19.110> you've<00:02:19.260> seen

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
game a lot similar to stuff you've seen

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.080 
game a lot similar to stuff you've seen
in<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.560> past<00:02:19.800> brothers<00:02:20.489> is<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> good<00:02:20.819> example

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
in the past brothers is a good example

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.610 
in the past brothers is a good example
of<00:02:21.269> limbo<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.690> another<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.049> lot<00:02:22.319> of<00:02:22.410> inspiration

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
of limbo is another a lot of inspiration

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.110 
of limbo is another a lot of inspiration
to<00:02:23.010> take<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.280> from<00:02:23.370> there

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
to take it from there

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.970 
to take it from there
but<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:24.569> I<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:25.260> Eric<00:02:25.500> said<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:25.860> was<00:02:25.950> a

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
but this I like Eric said it was a

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.070 
but this I like Eric said it was a
really<00:02:26.160> inclusive<00:02:26.640> process<00:02:27.420> which<00:02:27.900> i<00:02:28.019> think

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
really inclusive process which i think

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.690 
really inclusive process which i think
is<00:02:28.290> really<00:02:28.500> unique<00:02:28.769> not<00:02:29.220> only<00:02:29.400> do<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.580> get

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
is really unique not only do you get

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.220 
is really unique not only do you get
that<00:02:29.790> really<00:02:29.970> great<00:02:30.150> story<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.780> Eric<00:02:30.989> talked

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
that really great story that Eric talked

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.259 
that really great story that Eric talked
about<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.430> get<00:02:32.549> to<00:02:32.640> play<00:02:32.819> through<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.209> in

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
about but you get to play through it in

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.670 
about but you get to play through it in
a<00:02:33.360> way<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.690> really<00:02:34.260> hasn't<00:02:34.470> been<00:02:34.590> done

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
a way that really hasn't been done

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.810 
a way that really hasn't been done
before<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.190> really<00:02:35.459> cool

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
before it's really cool

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.370 
before it's really cool
we<00:02:36.000> actually<00:02:36.180> have<00:02:36.510> an<00:02:36.600> art<00:02:36.750> director<00:02:36.870> whose

we actually have an art director whose

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.940

history is in Native design and it was
just<00:02:41.100> really<00:02:41.310> fortuitous<00:02:41.910> time<00:02:42.090> for<00:02:42.269> him<00:02:42.360> to

a game where the rules are made to be

a game where the rules are made to be

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.120 
from Team 7 teams working on overruled
which<00:03:02.790> is<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.239> game<00:03:03.780> coming<00:03:04.049> on<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.230> idea<00:03:04.590> Xbox

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
which is a game coming on the idea Xbox

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.240 
which is a game coming on the idea Xbox
scheme<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.670> Xbox<00:03:05.970> one<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.959> Sam<00:03:07.530> what's

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
scheme to Xbox one so Sam what's

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.140 
scheme to Xbox one so Sam what's
overruled<00:03:08.519> all<00:03:08.700> about

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
overruled all about

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.960 
overruled all about
so<00:03:09.630> essentially<00:03:10.170> overall<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.250> multiplayer

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
so essentially overall is a multiplayer

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.420 
so essentially overall is a multiplayer
brawler<00:03:12.359> where<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.870> rules<00:03:13.079> keep<00:03:13.290> changing<00:03:13.430> so

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
brawler where the rules keep changing so

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.650 
brawler where the rules keep changing so
you<00:03:14.489> run<00:03:14.730> around<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.239> punch<00:03:15.420> each<00:03:15.540> other

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
you run around and you punch each other

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.420 
you run around and you punch each other
in<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.959> head<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.290> can<00:03:16.709> change<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.190> rules

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
in the head and you can change the rules

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.490 
in the head and you can change the rules
as<00:03:17.790> you're<00:03:18.150> playing<00:03:18.420> by<00:03:18.660> picking<00:03:18.989> up<00:03:19.109> cards
