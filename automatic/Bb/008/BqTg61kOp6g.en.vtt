00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.280
 People will agree that this new video on we must mind 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.520
 for there you go easting with your re-education 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.970
 within ten blemish even a moment 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.390
 come true that is the real copperfield pan 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.730
 I saw in a response that someone is already defenseless animal that they don't know 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.759
 who thought it best on one 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.579
 I would like to reach with you about what is new and they are less 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:30.249
 students 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.550
 see the battle for the Spanish cycle of goodwill in a few days 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.300
 them in a virtual environment 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.020
 but now i just go with you have it open what it is winners 10 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.040
 precise debate is again 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.920
 the biggest differences 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.870
 it actually with windows 8 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.230
 the return want 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.070
 to step 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.250
 was now no longer behind the many grumpy steps 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.330
 but now has requested me with winners 10 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.490
 it has become like i have the start menu 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.260
 deployed indoors and also with a little bit on a placement of the metro 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.590
 start menu as we know it from windows 8 with now 88 the one 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.970
 I just had the station 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.590
 as usual from windows 7 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.400
 also a bit of a spoiled sting 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.270
 but right next to atta lamp city good thailand 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.680
 from windows 8 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.150
 this is just 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.650
 two steps now 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.170
 What else is new? They also thought it might be a virtual one 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.230
 desktops 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.540
 stefan leko productive 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.490
 lips can be given from young nva to file length 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.159
 set up a new virtual desktop on a normal bicycle 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.830
 the two or so 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.820
 and then I visit his mother and I am already doing your homework 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.110
 there you are very quickly back to one where you have the documents on peugeot 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.970
 saw a small growth in progress he must have noted a nice room 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.980
 so it's only 2 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.200
 and all would throw open as it was before 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.530
 This is a bit stolen from the left but I am glad his eyes have 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.100
 lined 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.770
 I miss it anyway 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.310
 the following they may perform that you have been warned 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 on your desktop environment 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.270
 The involved in that is of course no longer full screen but just that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.520
 interventions 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.970
 that is that he can move it is all coincidence that this has become 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.969
 ground it looks good as a normal meteor 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:12.270
 and actually one of the biggest more change han to come 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.730
 I noticed when I want the board to also be a towing cable talpa icon 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.909
 adjusted 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.219
 such as the knee 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.219
 it is a cookie but adapted 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.819
 on the cinema explorer 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.209
 that jump changed 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.199
 it's very good all it's blatter 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:32.979
 bosman guests of wind steps on sea squares or rather as the 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.679
 fiesta and coaches 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.679
 guest is called floors your message for 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:41.439
 and then they have a big family 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.080
 anyway and that is unloading 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.640
 The player as I do realize that she is wondering and you are buying 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.170
 and then they have unchanged so a good overview of what is on it 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.359
 the beach 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.979
 the resurrected one was in trouble 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:57.659
 I think follow on bag 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.909
 It is exactly one hundred fans on the town 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:02.949
 much better 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:06.349
 we remain seated in the building are also very tight 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.569
 and also very nice 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.450
 she wants improved in a snack bar 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.979
 less quickly the stadjer 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.069
 the two windows or so 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.679
 51 nothing seemed to worse the left side of the screen and if that he was full on the 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:21.089
 left half of the votes they have now improved even if they are on their own 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:22.769
 creator of screen is off 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.890
 bad luck on the other side of the screen you get a chance to see windows 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.469
 was questioned by you only two on the right 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:29.620
 then you can handle that 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.840
 but that I actually had and will have later 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.129
 anp beside of 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.180
 it is just another special for the children there is nothing new yet 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.379
 announced and that is once x on the pole 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.840
 modern against each other 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.779
 can actually handle it already 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.889
 just take a look at google once you are also suitable for 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.949
 when this extra head that how i have a better menthol shares 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:52.249
 that speaks to the coals 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:54.219
 the hardware what those courts get 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:56.999
 that's how she wants to go 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:01.259
 and in that the number of strokes also seems something very nice queen if you know that 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.079
 a 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:03.900
 he has 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.909
 Syria 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.339
 come to the college 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:10.409
 but my health also came 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.329
 comes in two in the same way 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.959
 it's just driving windows 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.559
 goldstein 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:20.249
 it was originally less clean but nothing too high 6 standard 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:21.389
 windows itself 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.139
 with that function 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.419
 very curious how that will work because I have experienced enough with shortness of breath 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.139
 achieved 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.139
 I have a sonic phone there 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.699
 he has no shortage of affection 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.650
 it is a dutch phone and then they have finished finishing 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.650
 I am very curious what this looks like in the inner city 10 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.330
 if you want to know how you 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.289
 can install within our team 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.590
 white roofs 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.590
 then you explain the group winners team we can install 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.129
 It may be that the final on small taste in this day comes online 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:54.509
 and then 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:55.960
 if it's actually sombeke 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.139
 if you have any questions then fifteen rounds in the comments 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.830
 you can answer by for hours later left afterwards 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.669
 what a subsidy and cat decision that that is not such a case 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.249
 look more already if you have multiple providers world 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:11.680
 by this time remembering pvv junk favorites 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.110
 follow us on twitter 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.509
 with bad luck 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:15.539
 and then we see now 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:17.360
 next time 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.819
 trappers
