their ability because as I said

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.110 
their ability because as I said
previously<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.890> think<00:00:44.460> these<00:00:44.610> two<00:00:44.879> guys<00:00:45.059> are

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
previously I think these two guys are

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.240 
previously I think these two guys are
evenly<00:00:45.629> matched<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:46.739> when<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.950> get<00:00:47.100> two

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
evenly matched and when you get two

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.830 
evenly matched and when you get two
evenly<00:00:47.640> matched<00:00:47.670> guys<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.360> start<00:00:48.420> looking

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
evenly matched guys you start looking

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.520 
evenly matched guys you start looking
for<00:00:50.329> something<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.360> separate<00:00:51.899> them<00:00:52.140> if<00:00:52.350> you

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
for something to separate them if you

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.959 
for something to separate them if you
are<00:00:52.620> trying<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.890> predict<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.309> fight<00:00:53.550> you're

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
are trying to predict a fight you're

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.459 
are trying to predict a fight you're
thinking<00:00:54.270> okay<00:00:54.510> these<00:00:54.660> two<00:00:54.840> guys<00:00:55.020> are<00:00:55.079> evenly

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
thinking okay these two guys are evenly

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.029 
thinking okay these two guys are evenly
matched<00:00:55.559> how<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.730> separate<00:00:57.149> them<00:00:57.329> dead<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
matched how can I separate them dead and

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.580 
matched how can I separate them dead and
then<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.129> start<00:00:59.370> looking<00:00:59.489> for<00:00:59.879> psychological

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
then you start looking for psychological

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.119 
then you start looking for psychological
weaknesses<00:01:01.590> if<00:01:01.770> there<00:01:01.920> are<00:01:02.010> any

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
weaknesses if there are any

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.100 
weaknesses if there are any
psychological<00:01:02.579> weaknesses<00:01:03.239> with<00:01:03.390> Viva<00:01:03.840> guy

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
