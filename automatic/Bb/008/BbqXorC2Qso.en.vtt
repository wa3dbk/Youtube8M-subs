them and hopefully good for the game in

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.649

the<00:01:31.979> future<00:01:32.250> as<00:01:32.640> interpose<00:01:33.090> go<00:01:33.390> they're

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
the future as interpose go they're

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.270 
the future as interpose go they're
always<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.140> be<00:01:34.170> tight<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.770> there<00:01:35.070> and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
always going to be tight and there and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.280 
always going to be tight and there and
very<00:01:35.490> physical<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.180> mean<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.229> be

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
very physical so I mean it's going to be

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.469 
very physical so I mean it's going to be
a<00:01:37.320> huge<00:01:37.560> challenge<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.220> squad<00:01:38.490> am<00:01:38.759> you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
a huge challenge for the squad am you

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.270 
a huge challenge for the squad am you
know<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> think<00:01:39.780> gains<00:01:40.590> between<00:01:40.890> ourselves<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
know I think gains between ourselves and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.310 
know I think gains between ourselves and
also<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.700> been<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.119> know<00:01:42.320> historically

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
also have been you know historically

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440 
also have been you know historically
very<00:01:43.740> tight<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.070> there<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.970> always<00:01:45.119> very

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
very tight and there and always very

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.120 
very tight and there and always very
tough<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.750> win<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.110> there<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.500> think<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> squad

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
tough to win but there I think the squad

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.319 
tough to win but there I think the squad
is<00:01:47.159> there's<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.549> good<00:01:47.670> confidence<00:01:48.060> amongst<00:01:48.240> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
is there's a good confidence amongst a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.910 
is there's a good confidence amongst a
squadron<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.780> could<00:01:48.930> see<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.799> know

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
squadron you could see that a you know

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.670 
squadron you could see that a you know
with<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.490> two<00:01:50.610> wins<00:01:50.850> over<00:01:51.259> Jeanette<00:01:52.259> Lee<00:01:52.439> and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
with the two wins over Jeanette Lee and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.590 
with the two wins over Jeanette Lee and
the<00:01:53.220> Ospreys<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:54.210> bring<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.509> we're

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the Ospreys so we bring it we're

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.819 
the Ospreys so we bring it we're
bringing<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.930> bit<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.140> good<00:01:55.259> form<00:01:55.500> into<00:01:55.740> it

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
bringing in a bit of good form into it

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.800 
bringing in a bit of good form into it
as<00:01:55.920> well<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.100> hopefully<00:01:56.880> goes<00:01:57.329> our<00:01:57.479> way<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:57.659> it

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
as well so hopefully goes our way but it

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.560 
as well so hopefully goes our way but it
will<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.049> really<00:01:58.259> tough<00:01:58.290> encounter
