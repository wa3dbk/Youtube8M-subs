00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.749 
thought overall when Melvin went out
collectively<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> guys<00:01:29.009> came<00:01:29.250> together<00:01:29.400> and

collectively the guys came together and

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.210 
collectively the guys came together and
did<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.060> great<00:01:30.240> job<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:31.560> only<00:01:31.680> keeping<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.319 
did a great job of not only keeping the
lead<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.490> extending<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.939> lead<00:01:33.090> yeah<00:01:33.299> I

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
lead but extending the lead yeah I

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.730 
lead but extending the lead yeah I

tempo<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> shot<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.290> got<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> pretty<00:01:49.590> good

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
tempo on a shot it's got a pretty good

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.710 
tempo on a shot it's got a pretty good
chance<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.689> thought

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
chance of going in and I and I thought

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.440

tonight<00:01:52.409> he<00:01:52.710> had<00:01:52.979> great<00:01:53.159> rhythm<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.700> stepped

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
tonight he had great rhythm and stepped

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.810 
tonight he had great rhythm and stepped
up<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:54.810> us<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.110> hit<00:01:55.229> threes<00:01:55.530> which<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.640> huge

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
up for us and hit threes which is huge

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.219 
up for us and hit threes which is huge
because<00:01:57.030> last<00:01:57.299> game<00:01:57.509> obviously<00:01:57.840> we<00:01:58.020> didn't

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
because last game obviously we didn't

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.069 
because last game obviously we didn't
make<00:01:58.560> many<00:01:58.740> were<00:01:58.979> 14<00:01:59.340> 10<00:01:59.520> against<00:02:00.420> tcu<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.020> we

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079
