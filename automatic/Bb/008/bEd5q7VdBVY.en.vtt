00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:04.340
 with today's transformation we are going to talk a little bit about the area of 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.240
 immunodeficiency syndrome, we wanted to 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.300
 you are seeing that this disease caused by the virus hiv 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.959
 which has a particularity to be a retrovirus 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.189
 that is, it contradicts the dogma of cell biology that would be part of a 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:20.030
 ribbon 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.570
 determine to produce an injunction that an audience's thoughts 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.069
 he gets along 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:30.619
 of the rna biral tape produced well or worse this will be possible 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.970
 due to the presence of three secretaries rivers 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.110
 how does a person become infected with AIDS in general the contagion is incredible 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.680
 that may be present in the presence of liquids that are contaminated 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.230
 the invitation 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.250
 dream 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.370
 100 min 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.210
 vaginal secretion 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.240
 fluid to the seminal fluid that comes out before ejaculation, which is 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.300
 produced by the guilt gland 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.850
 breast milk 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.250
 even giving the stepdaughter the lists are it even during the birth 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.790
 but we know what the competitions put together 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.190
 of sex 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.380
 oral sex in the journal and the sites 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.490
 it is believed that 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.870
 this disease has originated in the earth 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.460
 in the late 19th century at the beginning of the 20th century 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.650
 she was he is known by the cdc of the united states 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.630
 via 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.460
 it's 1981 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.360
 You had identification on this bias. 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.390
 which would be 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.010
 the symptoms 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.770
 that we will be able to observe hard people and development in a box in a first 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.680
 moment would be initial manifestation 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.450
 blessed she presents as if they were tendinitis 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.930
 from 50 to 70% of charges 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.830
 even a mononucleosis 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.359
 usually with a treatment or without treatment 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:11.359
 is 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.870
 this stage it becomes dangerous because at first the porpoise 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.469
 is on the rise 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:24.749
 and the person does not have those classic symptoms of another disease can be 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:28.640
 certainly a grid then in the lapa potentially 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.729
 comparing with other people 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:32.590
 the internship 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.119
 in the second phase 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.819
 you already noticed the aunt this line should fall 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.289
 but she falls over here 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.219
 because today viruses are hidden 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.349
 within five years the tie 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.240
 so slowly 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.240
 they come back to attack the cattle tax movie 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:56.139
 to wrap up with them I hope to do more or less around 10 to 11 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.609
 basically pass the tomato 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:00.969
 until the third 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.959
 in the third stage 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.139
 where the number of lymphocytes t is low 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.959
 and the person shop is subject to opportunistic diseases as always special 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:18.709
 as it is known is that the tax esther they are responsible for triggering 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.709
 every process of immune response 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:27.059
 So let's call it the hormonal response so you can 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:30.389
 production of specific antibodies against the invasive agent 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:33.599
 the moment if you are 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.289
 or that this type of critical cell 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:39.289
 you can no longer produce the specific antibody 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.219
 every stop these pathogenic people 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.099
 it's a lot of people 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.160
 whether you notice that the person begins to have for example a weight loss 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.799
 extremely fast 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.799
 or widespread malaise 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:59.939
 tremors in the pubis 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:05.800
 sharma general weakness efe businesses other than treatment 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.800
 There can be no deaths 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.189
 the school murderer 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.000
 see you next time
