00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
cabinet so that the door doesn't bind as

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.340 
cabinet so that the door doesn't bind as
you're<00:00:32.579> opening<00:00:33.180> or<00:00:33.329> closing<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.719> door<00:00:33.930> so

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
hinges let's take a quick zoom we zoom

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.029 
hinges let's take a quick zoom we zoom
here<00:00:48.469> okay<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.210> by<00:00:51.210> simply<00:00:51.860> loosening<00:00:52.860> these

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
here okay so by simply loosening these

here okay so by simply loosening these
screws<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.550> top<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.780> bottom<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.620> inside

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
screws here top and bottom on the inside

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.830 
screws here top and bottom on the inside
mount<00:00:56.399> these<00:00:56.579> are<00:00:56.730> two<00:00:56.940> parts<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> hinge

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
mount these are two parts of the hinge

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
mount these are two parts of the hinge
one<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> door<00:00:58.469> side<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> cabinet

if you want to move the door left or
right<00:01:19.970> this<00:01:20.970> way<00:01:21.180> or<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.360> way<00:01:21.509> maybe<00:01:22.380> your

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
right this way or this way maybe your

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.550 
right this way or this way maybe your
doors<00:01:22.830> are<00:01:23.009> hitting<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> middle<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:25.350> use

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
doors are hitting in the middle you use

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560 
doors are hitting in the middle you use
this<00:01:25.770> little<00:01:25.979> screw<00:01:26.430> right<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.390> one

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
this little screw right here the one

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.280 
this little screw right here the one
that's<00:01:27.750> closest<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:29.759> door

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that's closest to the door

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.700 
that's closest to the door
and<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:32.040> can<00:01:32.630> by<00:01:33.630> turning<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.110> clockwise<00:01:34.290> it

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
and you can by turning it clockwise it

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.370 
and you can by turning it clockwise it
moves<00:01:35.190> it<00:01:35.370> closer<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> middle<00:01:36.240> by<00:01:36.990> turning

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
moves it closer to the middle by turning

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.350 
moves it closer to the middle by turning
it<00:01:37.470> counterclockwise<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:38.580> moves<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.970> farther

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
it counterclockwise it moves it farther

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.270 
it counterclockwise it moves it farther
away<00:01:39.540> from<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.930> middle<00:01:40.080> so<00:01:40.680> by<00:01:40.920> doing<00:01:40.980> that

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
away from the middle so by doing that

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.940 
away from the middle so by doing that
you<00:01:41.430> will<00:01:41.730> adjust<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.270> gap<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.840> between<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
you will adjust the gap in between the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.030 
you will adjust the gap in between the
door<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:45.570> want<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.870> have<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.230> uniform

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
door and you want to have the uniform

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.570 
door and you want to have the uniform
gap<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.550> between<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.660> between<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.950> doors<00:01:50.220> as

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
gap in between in between the doors as

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.960 
gap in between in between the doors as
they<00:01:50.790> open<00:01:51.090> or<00:01:51.210> close<00:01:52.550> I'm<00:01:53.550> going<00:01:53.730> to<00:01:53.790> move

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
they open or close I'm going to move

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.000 
they open or close I'm going to move
this<00:01:54.090> one<00:01:54.300> just<00:01:54.510> a<00:01:54.660> little<00:01:54.690> bit<00:01:54.930> closer<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
this one just a little bit closer to the

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.930 
this one just a little bit closer to the
other<00:01:56.130> door<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:57.090> close<00:01:57.360> up<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.780> gap<00:01:58.020> so

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
other door to close up that gap so

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.600 
other door to close up that gap so
