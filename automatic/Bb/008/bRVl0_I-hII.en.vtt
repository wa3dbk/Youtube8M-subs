00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.610
 the golf gti is the first plug in 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.309
 hybrid of volkswagen like that 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.470
 he is sporting gti and gtd models 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.720
 fast and athletic he is with 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.950
 wide chest and up to 18 inch rims 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.890
 tired in the street 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.050
 but why is de quite simply the 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.300
 connects two birches to each other 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.920
 classic gasoline engine with 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.620
 an electric motor therefore that d 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.079
 whether gti or gti in such a case 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.839
 car one expects his sportiness 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.449
 also what the chassis is concerned but no 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:46.059
 worry the thing works just as well here 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:49.690
 the corners like his brother with the am 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.149
 the end of the e motor supports the tsi 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.430
 Gasoline what the most efficient gt 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.039
 makes his sporty side can be 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.769
 activate by pressing a button tsi and e 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.809
 motor now work hand in hand immediately 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.740
 the gte develops the full drive 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.940
 performance with a whopping 150 kilowatts and 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.039
 350 newton meters of torque 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.659
 you accelerate it in 7 6 seconds 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.210
 from zero to 100 km h 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.590
 the consumption gives vw with optimistic 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.590
 15 liters 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.310
 There is another advantage 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.680
 why you drive such a golf gti 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.900
 he should be very cheap 50 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.350
 kilometer electric driven costs so 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.040
 around the 1 euro 80 50 kilometer with one 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.970
 gasoline 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.950
 yes, that is more than double and 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.920
 if the driver is out of gas or active 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.490
 the e motor works in the gt mode 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 as a generator of the gte recuperated so the 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.060
 technical term uses the energy gained 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.670
 he later to drive 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.840
 this saves a lot of gasoline 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.790
 not sportiness 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.250
 but why has the plug-in hybrid only 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.369
 maximum 50 kilometers pure electric 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.369
 reach 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.369
 We have deliberately set this range 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.910
 the urban environment limits that is 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.080
 50 kilometer reach cover one 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.269
 certain day color may be below the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.180
 hood beat the two hearts of the gti 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.970
 Electric and petrol engine of the e motor 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.569
 sits between dsi and 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.790
 Double-clutch transmission in the engine compartment 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.280
 There he combines all hybrid components 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.769
 the high-voltage battery stores the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.660
 electrical energy as hybrid becomes the 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.299
 gti in city traffic predominantly 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.930
 electrically by the push of a button he becomes the 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.340
 pure electric car 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.799
 reaches the gte outside the city 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.230
 emission-free even tempo 130 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.420
 in the center console, the gte 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.060
 among other things about energy flow performance 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.390
 and reach the motor and a e 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.970
 efficient 1.4 liters tsi should he with 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.019
 A tank filling can stretch up to 940 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.019
 kilometers to master 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.610
 vw offers yes for his models 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.250
 various drive concepts 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.030
 there is the diesel and otto engine there 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.760
 Is there any natural gas or ethanol 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.409
 purely electrically powered cars 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.170
 interesting for the future but is in 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.220
 moment this plug in hybrid interesting 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.260
 is also at vw 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.700
 that you're on a band for example 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.220
 builds this golf and depending on 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.819
 customer request then the what is built 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.200
 the customer has presented as a drive 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.840
 here in wolfs blood because of the grip 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.940
 bumper to bumper produces the 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.409
 Cover always stays the same only what 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.579
 can take place under the hood 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.220
 be different 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:47.359
 you can recognize the gt e drive 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.250
 its orange cords vw can do so 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.540
 flexible to the needs and wishes 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.609
 to enter the customer 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.010
 where other manufacturers for whole works 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.510
 to develop your electromobility 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.579
 you go to wolfsburg the 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.099
 conventional way of doing things 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.549
 how so elaborate if it is easy 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.620
 going 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.290
 and so it does not work for the workers 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.280
 difference whether the e-golf gas 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.120
 golf gasoline diesel ethanol gti gtd 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.120
 or just recently, the gti 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.120
 produced 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.300
 We start now here in 

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.250
 europe with the vehicle 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.250
 but of course that's a concept 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.920
 i also just offering for the 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.860
 world markets where just the infrastructure 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.820
 after the charging infrastructure indeed a 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.650
 battery powered vehicle needs 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.690
 not yet so widely available 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.910
 Of course there is one 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.160
 vehicle because of that because it too 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.410
 can refuel normal gasoline that yes 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.450
 is available everywhere offers just 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.450
 the security of mobility 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.680
 Of course , the gti also loads as a plug-in 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.659
 about his standardized charging can 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.460
 AC power from the house network at one 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:04.039
 usual outlet takes less 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.129
 as four and on a so-called wall 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:10.090
 box so a strong current only something 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:10.090
 more than two hours 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.680
 otherwise the gti is nothing different 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:21.409
 from his brothers except the name 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.939
 and the blue applications too 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.400
 behind it is the usual view of 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:26.449
 a vw golf alone the 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.479
 Type designation at the rear reveals the 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:34.340
 Saubermann emission-free drive 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.229
 sporty remaining efficient tsg 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.870
 all characteristics with which the 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:42.789
 gti driver in the future may decorate 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.789
 what does our tester say? 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.630
 My conclusion shortly and close this golf 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.650
 gti is for me a real athlete and 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.650
 a clean man 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.820
 In addition, he is right 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:00.050
 can be moved inexpensively 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:02.000
 Well, it costs at least 36 1900 euro 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.220
 but already very well equipped 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.020
 but for this price you get too 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.020
 a really great car
