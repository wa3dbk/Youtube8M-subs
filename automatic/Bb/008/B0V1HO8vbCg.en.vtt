00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
are a little bit nicer because that are

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.250

soft<00:03:38.310> rubber<00:03:38.640> they<00:03:38.880> really<00:03:39.150> grip<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.870> tippet

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
soft rubber they really grip the tippet

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.290 
soft rubber they really grip the tippet

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
and really hold these eggs in place and

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.090 
and really hold these eggs in place and
all<00:03:42.420> you're<00:03:42.600> gonna<00:03:42.720> do<00:03:42.990> is<00:03:43.260> you're<00:03:44.010> gonna

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
all you're gonna do is you're gonna

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:51.230 
all you're gonna do is you're gonna
slide<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:45.680> into<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.830> egg<00:03:49.670> again<00:03:50.670> with<00:03:50.970> the

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
slide that into the egg again with the

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.910 
slide that into the egg again with the
your<00:03:51.690> tippet<00:03:52.080> running<00:03:52.320> through<00:03:52.530> there<00:03:52.740> and

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
your tippet running through there and

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.890 
your tippet running through there and
then<00:03:53.490> you're<00:03:53.610> gonna<00:03:53.730> pull<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.209> until<00:03:54.330> it's

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
then you're gonna pull it until it's

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.410 
then you're gonna pull it until it's
snug

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.890 

so<00:04:00.350> that's<00:04:00.560> what<00:04:00.710> its<00:04:00.830> gonna<00:04:00.920> look<00:04:01.040> like

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
so that's what its gonna look like

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.870 
so that's what its gonna look like
before<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:03.020> trim<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:03.830> you'll<00:04:04.520> be<00:04:04.670> able<00:04:04.730> to

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
before you trim it and you'll be able to

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.430 
before you trim it and you'll be able to
slide<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.300> beat<00:04:05.480> up<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:05.840> down<00:04:05.959> and<00:04:06.170> stuff<00:04:06.350> a

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
slide the beat up and down and stuff a

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.780 
slide the beat up and down and stuff a
little<00:04:06.560> bit<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.950> get<00:04:07.069> it<00:04:07.130> right<00:04:07.430> into<00:04:07.640> place

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
little bit to get it right into place

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.790 
little bit to get it right into place
where<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:08.360> want<00:04:08.600> it<00:04:08.750> then<00:04:09.350> you're<00:04:09.470> gonna<00:04:09.530> take

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
a nippers or a scissors and you're just

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.610 
a nippers or a scissors and you're just
gonna<00:04:12.380> come<00:04:12.650> through<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:12.980> you're<00:04:13.280> gonna<00:04:13.400> trim

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
either side of that little rubber peg

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.350 
either side of that little rubber peg
just<00:04:20.380> like<00:04:21.380> so<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:22.460> you're<00:04:22.880> gonna<00:04:23.000> want<00:04:23.270> to

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
just like so and you're gonna want to

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.750 
just like so and you're gonna want to
save<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:24.320> the<00:04:24.860> end<00:04:25.040> that<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:25.370> trimmed

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
save the the end that you trimmed

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.300 
save the the end that you trimmed
because<00:04:26.750> these<00:04:27.080> pegs<00:04:27.350> are<00:04:27.530> actually<00:04:27.860> tapered

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
because these pegs are actually tapered

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.850 
because these pegs are actually tapered
on<00:04:28.490> either<00:04:28.820> end<00:04:29.210> so<00:04:29.510> you'll<00:04:30.230> be<00:04:30.380> able<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.590> flip

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
on either end so you'll be able to flip

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.190 
on either end so you'll be able to flip
this<00:04:31.040> this<00:04:31.430> around<00:04:31.760> and<00:04:32.060> get<00:04:32.180> two<00:04:32.450> uses<00:04:32.930> out<00:04:33.080> of

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
this this around and get two uses out of

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.690 
this this around and get two uses out of
one<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.530> these<00:04:33.620> pegs<00:04:33.919> which<00:04:34.160> doesn't<00:04:34.400> really
