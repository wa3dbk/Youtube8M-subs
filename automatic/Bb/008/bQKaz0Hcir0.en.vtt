taking there's a myth that you could

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.350 
taking there's a myth that you could
only<00:02:35.880> get<00:02:36.180> around<00:02:36.600> 35<00:02:37.320> 30<00:02:38.280> 35<00:02:38.790> somewhere

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
only get around 35 30 35 somewhere

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.050 
only get around 35 30 35 somewhere
around<00:02:39.450> there<00:02:39.750> grams<00:02:40.140> per<00:02:40.650> sitting<00:02:41.130> per<00:02:41.760> meal

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
around there grams per sitting per meal

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.270 
around there grams per sitting per meal
sitting<00:02:42.330> that's<00:02:43.260> admit<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.709> your<00:02:43.920> body<00:02:44.100> can

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
sitting that's admit that your body can

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.250 
sitting that's admit that your body can
only<00:02:44.340> take<00:02:44.520> in<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.910> much<00:02:45.150> it's<00:02:45.690> not<00:02:45.900> proven

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
only take in that much it's not proven

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.410 
only take in that much it's not proven
but<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> lot<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.520> people<00:02:47.700> do<00:02:47.910> like<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.090> believe

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
but a lot of people do like to believe

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.900 
but a lot of people do like to believe
that<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.320> if<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:50.070> make<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.580> you're<00:02:50.760> getting

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
that so if you make it so you're getting

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.449 
that so if you make it so you're getting
around<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.480> many<00:02:51.780> grams<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:52.380> that's<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:53.010> 40

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
around that many grams so that's a 40

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.470 
around that many grams so that's a 40
most<00:02:53.730> per<00:02:54.720> meal<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.530> should<00:02:55.769> be<00:02:55.920> ok<00:02:56.220> because

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
most per meal you should be ok because

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.240 
most per meal you should be ok because
extra<00:02:57.480> protein<00:02:57.870> will<00:02:58.140> can<00:02:58.650> be<00:02:58.830> stored<00:02:59.040> as<00:02:59.220> fat

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
extra protein will can be stored as fat

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.759 
extra protein will can be stored as fat
things<00:02:59.820> like<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.780> protein<00:03:01.260> with<00:03:01.470> every

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
things like that so protein with every

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.330 
things like that so protein with every
single<00:03:02.100> meal<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.660> then<00:03:03.660> fat<00:03:04.170> fat<00:03:05.100> is

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
single meal and then fat fat is

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.530 
single meal and then fat fat is
something<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.820> you're<00:03:06.000> gonna<00:03:06.209> get<00:03:06.420> with

so i got i got meal 12 meal too i'm

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.710 
so i got i got meal 12 meal too i'm
going<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.669> be<00:04:20.729> working<00:04:20.760> out<00:04:21.150> in<00:04:21.269> between<00:04:21.539> there

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
going to be working out in between there

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.750 
going to be working out in between there
so<00:04:21.750> my<00:04:22.019> calories<00:04:22.410> will<00:04:22.530> be

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
so my calories will be

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.090 
so my calories will be
little<00:04:22.910> higher<00:04:23.090> so<00:04:23.900> between<00:04:24.230> meal<00:04:24.590> to<00:04:24.830> meal

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
little higher so between meal to meal

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.830 
little higher so between meal to meal

up<00:04:54.590> follow<00:04:55.340> this<00:04:55.550> same<00:04:55.820> theory<00:04:56.270> carbs<00:04:56.810> in<00:04:56.900> the

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
up follow this same theory carbs in the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.110 
up follow this same theory carbs in the
morning<00:04:57.260> cars<00:04:57.470> before<00:04:57.680> a<00:04:57.860> workout<00:04:58.040> but<00:04:58.970> you

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
morning cars before a workout but you

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.570 
morning cars before a workout but you
can<00:04:59.240> also<00:04:59.710> you<00:05:00.710> can<00:05:00.890> you<00:05:01.040> don't<00:05:01.190> have<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.400> watch

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
can also you can you don't have to watch

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.730 
can also you can you don't have to watch
it<00:05:01.610> as<00:05:01.940> much<00:05:02.300> you<00:05:02.510> can<00:05:02.690> have<00:05:02.870> carbs<00:05:03.230> with<00:05:03.440> every

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
it as much you can have carbs with every

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.640 
it as much you can have carbs with every
meal<00:05:04.480> so<00:05:05.480> of<00:05:05.840> course<00:05:06.170> you<00:05:06.320> don't<00:05:06.410> have<00:05:06.560> to

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
meal so of course you don't have to

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.050 
meal so of course you don't have to
watch<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:06.830> as<00:05:07.100> much<00:05:07.340> you<00:05:07.640> don't<00:05:07.700> have<00:05:07.850> to<00:05:07.910> watch

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
watch it as much you don't have to watch

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.330 
watch it as much you don't have to watch
that<00:05:08.090> as<00:05:08.510> much<00:05:08.750> I<00:05:08.990> up<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.470> protein<00:05:10.040> a<00:05:10.070> little

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
that as much I up the protein a little

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.740 
that as much I up the protein a little
bit<00:05:10.460> if<00:05:10.640> you're<00:05:10.790> bulking<00:05:10.970> up<00:05:11.240> but<00:05:11.420> it's<00:05:11.570> really

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
bit if you're bulking up but it's really

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.420 
bit if you're bulking up but it's really
the<00:05:11.870> same<00:05:12.050> theory<00:05:12.290> for<00:05:12.530> both<00:05:12.680> things<00:05:12.890> guys<00:05:13.130> so

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
the same theory for both things guys so

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.060 
the same theory for both things guys so
it's<00:05:13.940> really<00:05:14.150> simple<00:05:14.420> as<00:05:14.630> that<00:05:14.660> so<00:05:15.200> hope<00:05:15.890> this

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
it's really simple as that so hope this

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.590 
it's really simple as that so hope this
