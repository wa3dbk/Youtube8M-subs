time<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.399> wasn't<00:01:53.579> ready<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.970> do<00:01:54.210> something

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
time I just wasn't ready to do something

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.810 
time I just wasn't ready to do something
that<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.869> considered<00:01:55.350> invasive<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:56.040> are<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
that I considered invasive there are the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.999 
that I considered invasive there are the
only<00:01:56.939> options<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.810> time<00:01:58.079> with<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> band<00:01:58.770> or

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
only options at that time with a band or

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.349 
only options at that time with a band or
the<00:01:59.250> full<00:01:59.490> ruined<00:01:59.850> why<00:01:59.969> so

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
the full ruined why so

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:02.639 
the full ruined why so
so<00:02:01.359> I<00:02:01.390> didn't<00:02:01.810> want<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.049> rewrite<00:02:02.439> my

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
so I didn't want to rewrite my

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.319 
so I didn't want to rewrite my
intestines<00:02:03.280> i'm<00:02:03.520> with<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:03.820> band<00:02:03.880> and

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
intestines i'm with the band and

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:05.849 
intestines i'm with the band and
unfortunately<00:02:04.840> for<00:02:05.109> me<00:02:05.229> even<00:02:05.469> though<00:02:05.619> there's

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
unfortunately for me even though there's

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.679 
unfortunately for me even though there's
a<00:02:05.920> very<00:02:06.130> small<00:02:06.250> percentage<00:02:06.880> of<00:02:07.000> complication

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
a very small percentage of complication

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.240 
a very small percentage of complication
rates<00:02:07.840> i<00:02:07.990> seem<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.259> have<00:02:08.410> gotten<00:02:08.649> all<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:08.920> them

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
rates i seem to have gotten all of them

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.690 
rates i seem to have gotten all of them
so<00:02:10.080> i'm<00:02:11.080> sure<00:02:11.379> i<00:02:11.410> had<00:02:11.680> some<00:02:11.920> contribution<00:02:12.580> that

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
so i'm sure i had some contribution that

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.339 
so i'm sure i had some contribution that
my<00:02:12.819> sergeant<00:02:13.239> had<00:02:13.360> some<00:02:13.569> contribution<00:02:14.200> as

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
my sergeant had some contribution as

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.039 
my sergeant had some contribution as
well<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.879> just<00:02:16.090> wasn't<00:02:16.450> place<00:02:16.750> properly

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
well and it just wasn't place properly

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.770 
well and it just wasn't place properly
its<00:02:17.530> left<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.099> we<00:02:18.190> lost<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.640> port<00:02:18.940> hanging

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
its left and we lost the port hanging

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.630 
its left and we lost the port hanging
down<00:02:20.019> into<00:02:20.379> my<00:02:20.500> pelvis<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.190> they<00:02:21.280> had<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.549> go

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
down into my pelvis and they had to go

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.940 
down into my pelvis and they had to go
in<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:21.879> repair<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.299> so<00:02:22.540> after<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.410> total<00:02:23.799> of

thought that I was gonna be going with
room<00:02:55.599> Y<00:02:55.780> didn't<00:02:56.110> even<00:02:56.260> know<00:02:56.379> this<00:02:56.530> league<00:02:56.799> was

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
room Y didn't even know this league was

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.729 
room Y didn't even know this league was
out<00:02:57.129> there<00:02:57.340> um<00:02:57.940> did<00:02:58.720> my<00:02:58.870> research<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.470> found

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
out there um did my research and found

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.569 
out there um did my research and found
that<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.959> it's<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:02.019> lot<00:03:02.200> less<00:03:02.319> invasive<00:03:02.890> lot

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
that and it's a lot less invasive lot

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.879 
that and it's a lot less invasive lot
less<00:03:03.760> complication<00:03:04.389> rate<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:05.200> death<00:03:05.620> rate

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
less complication rate the death rate

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.710 
less complication rate the death rate
you<00:03:06.160> know<00:03:06.280> obviously<00:03:06.489> very<00:03:07.180> low<00:03:07.450> in

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
you know obviously very low in

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.740 
you know obviously very low in
