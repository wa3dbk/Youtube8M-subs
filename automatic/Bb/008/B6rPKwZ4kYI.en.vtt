00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.840
 hello friends good today I'll talk to you 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.870
 of the strawberry I will try to explain 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.150
 how they reproduce and to see a 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.000
 little my daughter from my strawberry garden 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.090
 they have the size the fleet is 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.130
 and there go the strawberries 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.130
 for girls how are you going big 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.290
 all this expresses 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.570
 is my little strawberries 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.120
 good 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.980
 the reason for this video is to explain 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.050
 a little how it reproduces can be 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.020
 reproduce by seed 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.940
 although the seed is sometimes a bit 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.300
 complicated because you have to have good 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.610
 temperature the optimal conditions what 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.590
 easier to buy a plant 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.579
 and when the plants are already casting 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.780
 fruits them salts 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.610
 these ramifications 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.640
 that are being like the cord 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.520
 umbilical of the woman 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.520
 if you cut 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.640
 this cord 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.030
 and they try to plant this new plant the 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.820
 plant dies what needs to be done is 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.440
 directly grab it 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.420
 in a container cited with earth 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.470
 second 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.470
 I'm doing right now 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.260
 I will throw a little water 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:53.320
 and there must be left more or less a 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:57.159
 34 weeks for her to start throwing 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.380
 roots and when it is strong with a 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.860
 little root and so you can cut the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.860
 umbilical cord 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.479
 is in account that already a plant and 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:14.340
 another one comes out that this other plant 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.600
 of strawberry this the most practical for 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.130
 play 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.640
 a strawberry plant 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.250
 good to dare to plant 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.200
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.520
 will be until next time I say goodbye with my 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:35.920
 recipes with my big strawberry totally 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.920
 organic good see you soon
