00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.050
 forget your childhood I will take you to the 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.050
 madness 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.850
 let the nightmare begin hello people I am 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.680
 to be left with a new part 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.690
 of the pendulum clock I know I've 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.239
 distracted quite trying to do 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.130
 some login 2 but I had saved this 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.350
 creepy for plans that had to by 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.239
 misfortune they stopped again but 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.489
 well no more for the moment I leave 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.620
 with the story I woke up again in 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.540
 my bed as if nothing had happened already 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.970
 I did not know what to do I had tried 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.830
 all without any result when another 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.290
 once I heard the clock stop and 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.720
 listen to the voice you said you have a 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.520
 I did not want to do anything for 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.770
 I did not get up from the bed I closed my eyes 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.020
 to try to sleep no matter what 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.820
 it will happen but when you just open your eyes 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.130
 a moment I found myself in the room 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.080
 sitting in one of the armchairs I saw my 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.390
 around there was the clock with the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.280
 red marks up to number seven and 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.320
 more on the coffee table was 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.180
 tied my arms and feet my uncle which 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.280
 did not touch the ground looking at the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.200
 I resigned myself and I did not want to do 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.600
 nothing until I heard my uncle's voice 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.520
 asking for help I reacted at once and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.740
 how he was shaking to want to free himself 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.420
 I grabbed the ropes to release him but 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.520
 the ropes burned which made 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.530
 She releases her ran to the kitchen for 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.600
 knife but the door did not open for more 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.759
 to push and strike turns to see 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.649
 my uncle struggling with the ropes asking 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.600
 help when suddenly the ropes 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.759
 they began to pull the arms and legs 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.100
 trying to separate them I ran back 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.110
 with my uncle to try to release him with 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.450
 my hands that contact with the rope 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.490
 they burned but I tried to ignore that 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.500
 pain and undo the strings but my 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.479
 effort will be in vain no matter what 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.700
 that made the ropes were still pulling 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.890
 and I could not do anything to them until the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.810
 rope that I was holding fell I felt 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.850
 a little relieved to have been able to 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.130
 of the strings but what was my surprise 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.769
 seeing that the rope had fallen off with 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.360
 whole arm completely ripped out and 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.220
 I jump back when I see the arm 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.769
 bleeding and I looked up to see that my 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.840
 uncle was moving asking for help splashing 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.730
 of blood all the room I was in shock 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.980
 to see the image while the strings 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.110
 still they are pulling more and more until 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.120
 He returned to pass one leg went flying 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.920
 of my uncle's body with address to 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.140
 where I was until I fell in my arms 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.000
 staining me with blood I did not know what 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.530
 to make me stay frozen I could only 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.840
 throw the leg and try to 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.490
 I could of my uncle but I barely touch 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.860
 the rope and both members came out 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.720
 flying in the room I just hit the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.640
 ground with tears in anger 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.860
 eyes of being frustrated for not having 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.780
 could do absolutely nothing when 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.430
 I looked up to see my uncle a 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.739
 intense horror I enter to see that image 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.930
 see my erect uncle without arms and 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.450
 bleeding legs looking at me directly 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.340
 in the eyes I stayed frozen and just 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.470
 When I was going to scream I heard the gift of 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.230
 clock that marked the time and I woke up 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.150
 new in my bed bathed in sweat I 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.370
 I rested again resigned so 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.470
 it was going to happen when once 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.810
 more I heard the silence of the clock followed 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.120
 of that damn voice that you mentioned you have 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.459
 one hour I saw the clock again to see 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.650
 what I expected the number 8 of the clock and 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.930
 replaced by a red spot I followed 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.209
 lying quietly looking at the ceiling 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.069
 waiting for the blow when I just closed the 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.930
 eyes just to rest your eyesight and 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.090
 try to go back to sleep at no 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.069
 to get it, I opened them again and when 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.080
 I did I realized to find my cousin 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.510
 practically nailed to the ceiling above 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.610
 from me dripped blood on my body but to 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.830
 difference from the other events I did not 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.570
 movement nor any expression 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.730
 to notice that my cousin's body 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.920
 he was staring at me as if 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.380
 he would expect me to do something but not what 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.120
 I did until something happened I realized that 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.150
 the roof was descending slowly 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.220
 I got up for mere instinct when 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.840
 I tried to put one foot on the ground I felt 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.580
 a cold that by the movement that 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.440
 I had him cut my plant 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.090
 of the foot when you turn to see note that 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.799
 the whole floor was full of spikes 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.000
 sharp pointing up 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.950
 Seeing this, I tried to get there 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.380
 carefully at the door of my room 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.180
 and leave that place quickly but 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.220
 I was barely halfway to the 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.620
 door closed abruptly leaving me 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.180
 surrounded by those peaks when I hit 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.040
 the return to return to my bed the 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.050
 spikes began to spin in circles 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.090
 besides moving from place to place every 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.070
 they touched my skin they made me serious cuts 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.320
 that almost made it fall but 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.330
 they followed and she that if she fell those peaks 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.340
 slicing ian in pieces I continued with my 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.290
 attempt to reach my bed or my table 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.570
 but at each step that gave the peaks me 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.910
 they cut more and more until I felt a 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.010
 slight blow to the head when looking 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.290
 above I saw that it was the roof that was already 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.970
 to almost half of the room which he did 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.440
 that I had to bend down to the point of 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.220
 have to see the few peaks 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.590
 centimeters 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.510
 until he manages to get to my bed I 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.460
 I slept alone to see face to face 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.500
 cousin who was getting closer and closer until 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.330
 the point of being chest to chest but of 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.040
 moment after moment the bed was overcome and 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.140
 I fell completely to some peaks that 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.240
 buried in my stomach in one arm and 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.890
 leg felt like it was sliced ​​and 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.900
 crushed while my cousin was still 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.760
 descending until you reach the peaks and 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.770
 it was cut making all the blood 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.690
 fell on my whole body but in that 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.790
 moment he began to let out a cry of 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.710
 pain as strong as unbearable in 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.720
 in front of my face as they approached 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.150
 so more being sliced ​​in front of my 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.520
 eyes his blood splashes goes by all 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.320
 sides including my face so much blood 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.970
 in my face that they did not open 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.070
 the eyes until I heard where the 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.170
 clock that marked the time I got up from 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.210
 my bed slammed and scrub my hands on my 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.660
 face trying to remove the blood that already 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.660
 I did not have
