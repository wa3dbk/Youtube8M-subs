00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
that in a little bit but so we've

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.990 
that in a little bit but so we've
created<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.530> bit<00:00:47.510> already<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.899> larger

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.130 
created a little bit already of a larger
appearance<00:00:51.000> because<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.480> lighter<00:00:51.719> colors

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
appearance because the lighter colors

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.110 
appearance because the lighter colors
make<00:00:52.379> things<00:00:52.649> look<00:00:52.829> larger<00:00:53.340> darker<00:00:53.820> colors

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
make things look larger darker colors

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.689 
make things look larger darker colors
make<00:00:54.329> things<00:00:54.629> look<00:00:54.899> smaller<00:00:56.840> that<00:00:57.840> looks<00:00:58.050> good

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
make things look smaller that looks good

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.279 
make things look smaller that looks good
the<00:00:59.699> next<00:00:59.969> step<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.390> we're<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> use<00:01:01.260> a
