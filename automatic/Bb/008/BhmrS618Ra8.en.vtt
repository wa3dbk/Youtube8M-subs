00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.680
 here is your knitting with the second 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.310
 part of the useful tutorial today 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.469
 we stop the stitch 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.070
 you are certainly interested in the 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.730
 Measure the cap the cap has one 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.190
 circumference of 40 centimeters 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.440
 I write you here the number of 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.380
 mesh on I have 100 stitches 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.259
 she struck for this cap 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.579
 a scope in their finished state 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:34.790
 of 50 cm for this raging color the cap 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:39.770
 I struck 128 stitches 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:44.330
 she measures 44 cm and is for one 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:47.210
 head circumference of about 53 cm it is not so 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.460
 that was like the alpaca cap for the 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.140
 I have 144 gray mesh hat 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.440
 struck and she is for one 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.300
 head circumference of 60 centimeters so now 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.260
 Let's start I put the caps 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.870
 to the side 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.740
 I'll show you the stitch stop 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.790
 on the yellow cap here I have 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:10.130
 now my and knitting needle of strength 3 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.829
 is a round knitting needle from adi the 40th 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.600
 cm I think the needles are too 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.439
 smoothest and I can best with 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.710
 to stretch them 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.409
 Here I take my yellow wool and 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.289
 Now I'm doing a long enough 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.689
 girl and lay my foundations me 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.969
 I will immediately show the link 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.939
 how this works in detail I already have 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:35.450
 I'll show you in another video 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.639
 the link for the cross stroke equal 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.939
 Show and I have it already 

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:43.249
 already said i work here for 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.750
 the stitch stop a simple 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:49.000
 cross stop 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.090
 I now have a total of 100 meshes 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.530
 and now I will be with mine 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:00.310
 First row for that I conclude 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.780
 not yet 100 workers back 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.060
 row with simple right stitches 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.489
 I make the following reason her 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.560
 see the gap here because the mesh of the 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.799
 stitches are something stuck 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.420
 Do not submit to the needle yet 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:19.180
 That's why I knit a row first 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.130
 normally from then the row is looser 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.680
 and I can easily into the round 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.200
 connect 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.110
 So now I knitted the series 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.860
 and now you see the stitches go now 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.690
 through the dogs and now look 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.390
 I did not know the stitches 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.000
 twisting, I take up my knitting 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.470
 and close the round in which I do the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.799
 first mesh with the last together 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.010
 From now on, I simply knit 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:54.780
 Right stitches until I accept the decrease 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.750
 start for the rounding of my head 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.840
 the work of rounding upside down 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.480
 I will show you the shapes in the next video 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.350
 in the third part of my cap 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.350
