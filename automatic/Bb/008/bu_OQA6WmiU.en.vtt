okay<00:00:03.689> guys<00:00:03.899> now<00:00:04.290> let<00:00:04.529> us<00:00:04.589> talk<00:00:04.799> about<00:00:04.859> the

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
okay guys now let us talk about the

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.760 
okay guys now let us talk about the
homeobox<00:00:05.790> genes<00:00:06.480> or<00:00:06.720> homeotic<00:00:07.109> genes<00:00:07.560> and

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
homeobox genes or homeotic genes and

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.560 
homeobox genes or homeotic genes and
what<00:00:07.980> does<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:08.550> homeobox<00:00:08.940> or<00:00:09.269> homeotic

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
what does this homeobox or homeotic

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.669 
what does this homeobox or homeotic
genes<00:00:09.900> actually<00:00:10.110> mean

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
genes actually mean

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.490 
genes actually mean
now<00:00:11.309> these<00:00:12.030> are<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.360> simple<00:00:12.719> term<00:00:12.870> these<00:00:13.290> are

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
now these are the simple term these are

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.910 
now these are the simple term these are
the<00:00:14.190> genes<00:00:14.490> which<00:00:14.880> are<00:00:15.089> helping<00:00:15.630> in

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
the genes which are helping in

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.730 
the genes which are helping in
morphogenesis<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.250> as<00:00:17.670> well<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.380> the<00:00:19.380> organ

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
morphogenesis and as well in the organ

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.670 
morphogenesis and as well in the organ
development<00:00:20.090> okay<00:00:21.090> during<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> development

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
development okay during the development

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.040 
development okay during the development
of<00:00:22.859> arthropods<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:24.060> can<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.539> not<00:00:24.720> only<00:00:24.930> art

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
of arthropods we can have not only art

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.480 
of arthropods we can have not only art
supports<00:00:25.439> but<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.680> case<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.859> mammals<00:00:26.279> or<00:00:26.400> in

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
supports but in case of mammals or in

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.310 
supports but in case of mammals or in
different<00:00:26.849> amphibians<00:00:27.689> reptiles<00:00:27.840> and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
different amphibians reptiles and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.339 
different amphibians reptiles and
different<00:00:28.619> species<00:00:29.580> well<00:00:30.449> what<00:00:30.929> happens

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
different species well what happens

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.860 
different species well what happens
there<00:00:32.219> are<00:00:32.369> some<00:00:32.579> genes<00:00:32.969> are<00:00:33.270> important

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
there are some genes are important

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.020 
there are some genes are important
really<00:00:34.170> important<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:35.160> generating<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
really important for generating the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.299 
really important for generating the
different<00:00:36.420> body<00:00:36.719> segments<00:00:37.380> or<00:00:37.530> body<00:00:37.770> parts

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
different body segments or body parts

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.910 
different body segments or body parts
okay<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.000> these<00:00:39.390> genes<00:00:39.690> control<00:00:40.350> those

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
okay and these genes control those

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.250 
okay and these genes control those
formation<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.700> those<00:00:42.180> different<00:00:42.540> body<00:00:42.780> parts

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
formation of those different body parts

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.130 
formation of those different body parts
and<00:00:43.739> finally<00:00:44.100> more<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.210> those<00:00:45.360> body<00:00:45.660> parts<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
and finally more of those body parts to

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.900 
and finally more of those body parts to
finally<00:00:46.469> make<00:00:46.649> an<00:00:46.800> organ<00:00:47.219> system

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
finally make an organ system

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.360 
finally make an organ system
those<00:00:48.480> are<00:00:48.629> got<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> homeobox<00:00:49.289> genes<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:50.250> in

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
those are got the homeobox genes now in

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.979 
those are got the homeobox genes now in
this<00:00:50.520> case<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.300> see<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.780> case<00:00:51.930> of

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
this case as you can see in case of

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.529 
this case as you can see in case of
Drosophila<00:00:52.770> melanogaster<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.699> have<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.420> are

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
Drosophila melanogaster we have we are

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.330 
Drosophila melanogaster we have we are
having<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.899> homeobox<00:00:55.230> genes<00:00:55.649> called<00:00:55.920> hooks

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
having this homeobox genes called hooks

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.010 
having this homeobox genes called hooks
as<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.300> here<00:00:57.510> there<00:00:57.690> are<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> lot<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
as you can see here there are a lot of

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.900 
as you can see here there are a lot of
different<00:00:58.530> types<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.829> hooks<00:00:59.010> genes<00:00:59.370> out<00:00:59.579> there

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
different types of hooks genes out there

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.510 
different types of hooks genes out there
hooks<00:01:00.390> a1<00:01:00.899> hooks<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.440> hooks<00:01:01.680> for<00:01:01.920> hooks<00:01:02.129> 5<00:01:02.340> hook

6 and that several different types of
host<00:01:04.739> genes<00:01:04.979> are<00:01:05.159> there<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:05.939> see

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
host genes are there and you can see

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.859 
host genes are there and you can see
different<00:01:06.689> host<00:01:07.110> genes<00:01:07.320> are<00:01:07.500> situated<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.869> in

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
different host genes are situated in in

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.550 
different host genes are situated in in
a<00:01:10.049> DNA<00:01:10.380> strand<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.729> DNA<00:01:12.530> punctuated<00:01:13.530> by

several nucleotide sequences in interval

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.410 
several nucleotide sequences in interval
okay<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:17.640> are<00:01:17.670> doing<00:01:18.090> they<00:01:18.360> are

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
okay and what they are doing they are

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.149 
okay and what they are doing they are
actually<00:01:18.750> producing<00:01:19.290> different<00:01:19.470> parts<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
actually producing different parts and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.590 
actually producing different parts and
not<00:01:20.310> only<00:01:20.490> they're<00:01:20.700> producing<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> parts

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
not only they're producing the parts

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.480 
not only they're producing the parts
they<00:01:21.750> are<00:01:21.780> actually<00:01:22.080> governing<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.979> convert

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
they are actually governing to convert

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.460 
they are actually governing to convert
this<00:01:23.700> body<00:01:24.119> parts<00:01:24.750> throughout<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
this body parts throughout the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.350 
this body parts throughout the
morphogenesis<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.369> finally<00:01:26.820> make<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> fully

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
morphogenesis to finally make a fully

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.020 
morphogenesis to finally make a fully
functional<00:01:27.930> organ<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.860> they<00:01:29.159> are<00:01:29.280> detecting

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
functional organ so they are detecting

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.170 
functional organ so they are detecting
this<00:01:30.420> different<00:01:31.259> body<00:01:31.470> part<00:01:31.880> initials<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
this different body part initials to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.999 
this different body part initials to
finally<00:01:33.540> make<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.990> fully<00:01:34.200> functional<00:01:34.650> organs

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
finally make the fully functional organs

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.069 
finally make the fully functional organs
that<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:36.000> really<00:01:36.180> important<00:01:36.689> they<00:01:36.990> are

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
that is really really important they are

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.060 
that is really really important they are
really<00:01:37.320> important<00:01:37.680> during<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
really important during the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.289 
really important during the
morphogenetic<00:01:38.549> steering<00:01:38.880> actually<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
morphogenetic steering actually the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.960 
morphogenetic steering actually the
organogenesis<00:01:39.840> okay<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.220> as<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.549> see<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
organogenesis okay so as you can see the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.920 
organogenesis okay so as you can see the
hooks<00:01:42.150> one<00:01:42.479> try<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> maintain<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:44.159> make<00:01:44.340> this

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
hooks one try to maintain and make this

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.520 
hooks one try to maintain and make this
body<00:01:45.930> part<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.220> food<00:01:47.520> fly<00:01:48.530> body

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
body part of this this food fly body

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.130 
body part of this this food fly body
part<00:01:49.829> which<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.250> which<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:51.149> hook<00:01:51.450> in

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
part which is which is this hook in

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.499 
part which is which is this hook in
front<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.560> their<00:01:52.799> mouth<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.880> hooks<00:01:54.180> to

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
front of their mouth and this hooks to

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.260 
front of their mouth and this hooks to
is<00:01:55.350> actually<00:01:55.860> sorry<00:01:56.310> hooks<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.880> actually

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
is actually sorry hooks to is actually

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.389 
is actually sorry hooks to is actually
making<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.990> hook<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.829> front<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> mouth

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
making this hook in front of the mouth

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.520 
making this hook in front of the mouth
and<00:01:59.670> as<00:01:59.820> well<00:02:00.030> as<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.869> see<00:02:00.930> here<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and as well as you can see here the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.850 
and as well as you can see here the
hooks<00:02:01.740> 9<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.430> helping<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.000> make<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:04.049> fruit

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
hooks 9 is helping to make this fruit

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.730 
hooks 9 is helping to make this fruit
fly<00:02:05.130> body<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.719> body<00:02:07.140> parts<00:02:07.350> which<00:02:07.619> is

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
fly body in in body parts which is

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.430 
fly body in in body parts which is
really<00:02:07.979> which<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.660> different<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.750> character

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
really which is different in character

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.270 
really which is different in character
and<00:02:10.530> also<00:02:11.100> this<00:02:11.760> Hawk<00:02:12.590> seven-part<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.800> helping

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
and also this Hawk seven-part is helping

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.070 
and also this Hawk seven-part is helping
them<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.640> produce<00:02:14.820> this<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.480> wings<00:02:15.810> this

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
them to produce this this wings this

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.690 
them to produce this this wings this
beautiful<00:02:16.500> wings<00:02:16.740> so<00:02:16.920> there<00:02:17.130> are<00:02:17.310> different

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
beautiful wings so there are different

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.830 
beautiful wings so there are different
host<00:02:17.910> genes<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.360> there<00:02:18.480> are<00:02:18.540> different

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
host genes and there are different

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.930 
host genes and there are different
functions<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.740> if<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.220> change<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.760> can

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
functions so if you change so you can

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.010 
functions so if you change so you can
see<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.270> difference<00:02:21.660> between<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
see the difference between the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.470 
see the difference between the
functionality<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:22.740> Hox<00:02:23.040> genes<00:02:23.310> hoax<00:02:24.090> one<00:02:24.360> is

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
functionality of Hox genes hoax one is

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.660 
functionality of Hox genes hoax one is
producing<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.020> hook<00:02:25.200> where<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:25.980> work<00:02:26.220> 7<00:02:26.580> is

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
producing the hook where is work 7 is

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.630 
producing the hook where is work 7 is
producing<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.240> wings<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:28.500> if<00:02:28.740> we<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.130> we<00:02:29.490> can

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
producing the wings so if we if we can

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.310 
producing the wings so if we if we can
change<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:30.060> little<00:02:30.240> bit<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.750> nucleotide

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
change a little bit in nucleotide

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.960 
change a little bit in nucleotide

happens<00:03:06.180> no<00:03:07.110> longer<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:08.670> antenna<00:03:09.120> is

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
happens no longer that antenna is

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.020 
happens no longer that antenna is
growing<00:03:09.990> from<00:03:10.470> from<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.160> forehead<00:03:11.370> instead

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
growing from from the forehead instead

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.080 
growing from from the forehead instead
of<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.270> antenna<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.840> leg<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.680> growing<00:03:14.220> onto<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
of the antenna a leg is growing onto the

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.820 
of the antenna a leg is growing onto the
forehead<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.990> that<00:03:16.320> could<00:03:16.500> be<00:03:16.530> really

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
forehead so that that could be really

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.970 
forehead so that that could be really
really<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:18.020> fascinating<00:03:19.020> picture<00:03:19.470> or<00:03:19.680> to

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
really this fascinating picture or to

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.410 
really this fascinating picture or to
look<00:03:20.130> but<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.580> real<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.209> real

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
look but that is real that is real

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.750 
look but that is real that is real
because<00:03:21.920> scientists<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.130> researchers<00:03:23.430> are

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
because scientists and researchers are

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.550 
because scientists and researchers are
inducing<00:03:24.360> this<00:03:24.480> kind<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.720> mutations<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.290> see

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
inducing this kind of mutations to see

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.440 
inducing this kind of mutations to see
what<00:03:26.040> kind<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.370> role<00:03:26.670> this<00:03:26.850> host<00:03:27.090> genes<00:03:27.300> are

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
what kind of role this host genes are

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.480 
what kind of role this host genes are
actually<00:03:27.570> playing<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:28.860> is<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:29.070> really

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
actually playing so this is a really

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.310 
actually playing so this is a really
kind<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.790> ruthless<00:03:29.940> thing<00:03:30.330> but<00:03:30.510> still<00:03:30.780> it

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
kind of ruthless thing but still it

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.770 
kind of ruthless thing but still it
helped<00:03:31.800> us<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.040> understand<00:03:32.640> how<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.450> what<00:03:33.660> are

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
helped us to understand how and what are

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.480 
helped us to understand how and what are
the<00:03:33.900> functionalities<00:03:34.380> which<00:03:34.920> are<00:03:35.070> played<00:03:35.280> by

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
the functionalities which are played by

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.190 
the functionalities which are played by
this<00:03:35.550> hooks<00:03:35.910> genes<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.360> these<00:03:36.870> are<00:03:37.050> the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
this hooks genes and these are the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.720 
this hooks genes and these are the
