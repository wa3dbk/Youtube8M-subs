00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.060
 tar 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.900
 cand 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.900
 Ha 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.939
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.740
 Great 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.200
 Yup 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:48.260
 Now this is everyone just before the release but I actually watch this yaiba 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.910
 The development period of ninja gaiden z was about 2 years 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.780
 After all it was year for a walk 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:01.200
 Oh yeah , I was not anxious well though 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.370
 Is there in the exchange with overseas for it 's such or Hayashi we're not you was a great anxiety 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.720
 Toka 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.960
 I think it's a production crown by rug 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.280
 Toka or it was outside of human beings and exchanges 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:20.799
 I at all the second half something I'm that sort of was the early days of not coming transmitted wow 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.760
 So I Na has changed there I Toka that after all this approach between the two years 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.570
 I'm thinking that 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.170
 After all that 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:34.300
 After all it does not become the shape of a bunch to the last minute 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.970
 I'm really seems I had been said to be closed to play from the front Well 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.230
 Been completed also done successfully this way in 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.210
 that 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:46.190
 Good reputation is good, isn't it? 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:52.640
 I have a schedule for development with alpha beta, but on the way 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:59.780
 Tteyuu that whether you are trying to co-star that I quite different I that lifted now 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:01.200
 Comfortable touch or the actual Moro we're together there was a meaning pretty Nde or in completely different of 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.799
 I think that's great 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:10.490
 As long as the coast How to make is that I still and there is no there Yeah but I was Yappa know if do is 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.540
 Almost like that 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.280
 It looks like that big or small 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.780
 Nde place of the still Developer's often 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.030
 This time in the same way spark 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.590
 So that 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.400
 Though I was not anxious than Mr. Tamai 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.410
 Speaking of 0, it wasn't 0 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.100
 Hmm 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:39.069
 It has become firmly concept street with respect to what was finished to the fact it is love from 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.540
 Because it is a funny action game until the end 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.840
 Ko-neko 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.290
 Soon after that customer 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:51.830
 I think the experience we also now have the self-confidence 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.010
 It can be said that the technology has become solid enough to meet today 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.410
 Yeah it's game that I want to leave Auto 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:02.550
 It seems that it is not a game that will change over more than the person you get touched with 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.940
 This yaiba ninja gaiden z hassle stood 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.470
 Well as an action game from the perspective of our people 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.310
 that 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:15.870
 As for that I'm finished with the attack I did that after all 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:20.310
 The concept of our message game was created by Mr. Nana 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.700
 I formed the game towards there, but as the meaning we entered was solid 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.030
 Has become a thing interesting as an action game thus become some of the challenging 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.590
 As for where it is 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.590
 I think it means that we are here, so I think that this game has been firmly in place 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.140
 In the mass 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:40.459
 Using a history of very high even in school Well ninja gaiden 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:43.220
 Its challenging because even have prepared because I'm your play rather than N Challenge mode 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.860
 The mode is so difficult with that girl now 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.430
 By all means 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.430
 I think I want action gamers with confidence in the arms to touch by all means 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:04:00.780
 Well yourself really 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:07.230
 Well , I thought that I wanted to make a ninja over Ryu Hayabusa and started planning for me 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:08.370
 There is a part and it is a great innocence to say in the world like Ryu Hayabusa 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.990
 Speaking of 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.890
 Challenge the secret thing of 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:21.050
 Say blade 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:23.440
 I was able to create an attractive character for me and complete it 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:26.160
 The power to say 8 sect spark 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:32.960
 I could borrow it 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:37.240
 Nde The Tteyuu want to create a character to make high this kind of game was also a dream 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.820
 It will be completely satisfied and will be satisfied next time 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.620
 I think it was finished until this time 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:47.650
 It is good enough to say that the dual outside confrontation 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:54.190
 The place is drawn properly 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:56.520
 The camera is fun there and it is possible that the user is waiting 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:01.880
 I thought hey the 侑隼 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:04.090
 How long can I fight myself when fighting against the enemy 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.590
 You always are using the user House 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.440
 There is such an interesting part and by all means 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.250
 Action game fur 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:18.230
 In the I want to challenge luck well Shogei part 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:23.930
 A long time ago I've done it, too A person who says I don't do it 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.800
 10 It is also nostalgia doing and lost through the still say I interesting in action again 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.560
 Can recognize 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.160
 I think it is a reason 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.969
 That challenge by all means 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.139
