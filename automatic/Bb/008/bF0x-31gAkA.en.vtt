from<00:04:34.420> Amazon<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.290> think<00:04:35.920> comes<00:04:36.190> in<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.490> box<00:04:36.670> of

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
from Amazon I think comes in the box of

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.960 
from Amazon I think comes in the box of
like<00:04:37.000> four<00:04:37.240> or<00:04:37.360> five<00:04:37.390> and<00:04:38.130> it's<00:04:39.130> reusable<00:04:39.490> you

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
like four or five and it's reusable you

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.820 
like four or five and it's reusable you
just<00:04:40.150> wash<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.390> and<00:04:40.630> turn<00:04:40.960> sticky<00:04:41.230> again<00:04:41.440> so

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
just wash it and turn sticky again so

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.560 
just wash it and turn sticky again so
that's<00:04:42.310> good<00:04:42.670> I<00:04:42.880> forgot<00:04:43.150> what<00:04:43.300> it's<00:04:43.450> called

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
that's good I forgot what it's called

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.450 
that's good I forgot what it's called
because<00:04:44.170> there's<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:44.470> lot<00:04:44.680> of<00:04:44.830> different<00:04:45.250> bands

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
because there's a lot of different bands

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.780 
because there's a lot of different bands
but<00:04:46.180> as<00:04:46.480> soon<00:04:46.660> as<00:04:46.780> I<00:04:46.870> find<00:04:47.050> out<00:04:47.260> I<00:04:47.500> will<00:04:47.830> place<00:04:48.760> a

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
but as soon as I find out I will place a

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.210 
but as soon as I find out I will place a
link<00:04:49.060> down<00:04:49.210> in<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.450> video<00:04:49.600> info<00:04:50.020> box<00:04:50.230> so<00:04:51.190> I

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
link down in the video info box so I

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.220 
link down in the video info box so I
think<00:04:51.340> this<00:04:51.640> has<00:04:51.820> helped<00:04:52.270> a<00:04:52.360> lot<00:04:52.390> with<00:04:52.630> my

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
think this has helped a lot with my

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.830 
think this has helped a lot with my
pillow<00:04:53.830> is<00:04:54.010> not<00:04:54.220> forming<00:04:54.640> again<00:04:54.910> you<00:04:55.570> can<00:04:55.720> also

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
pillow is not forming again you can also

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.920 
pillow is not forming again you can also
use<00:04:56.200> this<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.950> minimize<00:04:57.580> scars<00:04:57.970> for<00:04:58.540> other

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
use this to minimize scars for other

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.220 
use this to minimize scars for other
things<00:04:59.350> not<00:04:59.710> just<00:04:59.820> c-sections<00:05:00.820> when<00:05:01.780> I<00:05:01.810> got

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230
