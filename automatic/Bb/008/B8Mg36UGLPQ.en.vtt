 harder and more absurd at the same time that 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.760

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.610
 accepted the problem is that upon receiving the 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.120
 merchandise instead of the console received 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.620

 I decided to decide it said photo and I 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.680
 He said something confusing but it was marked in 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.470
 the description in the category 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.320
 and in the correct category so I thought 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.640
 that was true until they wrote me 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.860
 thanking me for the normal normal purchase 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.430

 money to the boy before next monday 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.489

 claver will recover the amount of 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.860
 exact you paid for the console and this 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.230
