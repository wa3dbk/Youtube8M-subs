going<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.590> create<00:02:35.799> and<00:02:36.220> clients<00:02:36.819> are<00:02:36.910> going<00:02:37.060> to

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
going to create and clients are going to

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.450 
going to create and clients are going to
pick<00:02:37.299> up<00:02:37.959> pick<00:02:38.379> axe

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.980 

let's<00:02:44.030> shuffle

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.180 

so<00:02:51.990> it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.810 

and<00:02:55.400> an<00:02:56.240> axe<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.920> whole<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.340> can<00:02:58.490> leave<00:02:58.640> out

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
and an axe the whole you can leave out

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.860 
and an axe the whole you can leave out
for<00:02:58.850> later<00:02:59.120> because<00:02:59.330> you're<00:02:59.480> not<00:02:59.630> going<00:02:59.810> to
