00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
the last ice age when cold temperatures

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.920 
the last ice age when cold temperatures

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
increased the local nutrient supply

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.839 
increased the local nutrient supply
turning<00:03:37.439> that<00:03:37.590> sea<00:03:37.889> into<00:03:38.189> a<00:03:38.340> feeding<00:03:38.699> ground

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
turning that sea into a feeding ground

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.270 
turning that sea into a feeding ground
and<00:03:39.389> apparently<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.019> whales<00:03:40.199> just<00:03:40.829> kept

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
and apparently the whales just kept

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.369 
and apparently the whales just kept
themselves<00:03:41.720> researchers<00:03:42.720> point<00:03:42.989> out<00:03:43.139> that

themselves researchers point out that

themselves researchers point out that
despite<00:03:43.560> their<00:03:43.949> isolation<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.699> Arabian

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
despite their isolation the Arabian

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.939 
despite their isolation the Arabian
whales<00:03:45.389> aren't<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:46.049> new<00:03:46.290> species<00:03:46.620> or

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
whales aren't a new species or

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:48.849 
whales aren't a new species or
subspecies<00:03:47.489> instead<00:03:48.239> they're<00:03:48.720> just

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
subspecies instead they're just

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.890 
subspecies instead they're just
fascinating<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:49.979> weird<00:03:50.639> just<00:03:51.180> like<00:03:51.389> Bridgman

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
fascinating and weird just like Bridgman

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.149 
fascinating and weird just like Bridgman
right<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.290> also<00:03:52.409> just<00:03:52.650> like<00:03:52.799> most<00:03:53.009> of<00:03:53.099> the
