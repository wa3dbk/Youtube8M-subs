just a plain Jane white box
nothing<00:00:23.640> nothing<00:00:24.510> fancy<00:00:24.900> about<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.640> but<00:00:26.640> this

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
nothing nothing fancy about it but this

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.850 
nothing nothing fancy about it but this
is<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:28.099> model<00:00:29.099> number<00:00:29.130> 0<00:00:29.820> 1<00:00:30.679> GL<00:00:31.700> 0<00:00:32.700> 6<00:00:33.270> 2<00:00:33.600> 3<00:00:33.989> they

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
is the model number 0 1 GL 0 6 2 3 they

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.819 
is the model number 0 1 GL 0 6 2 3 they
call<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:36.469> snowflake<00:00:37.610> Damascus<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
call this the snowflake Damascus the the

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.410 
call this the snowflake Damascus the the
reason<00:00:41.160> they<00:00:41.280> call<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> snowflake<00:00:42.210> is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
reason they call it the snowflake is

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.410 
reason they call it the snowflake is
because<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.489> design<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> blade<00:00:45.090> I

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
because of the design on the blade I

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.510 
because of the design on the blade I
don't<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.230> how<00:00:46.410> well<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> camera<00:00:47.039> picked

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
don't know how well the camera picked

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.860 
don't know how well the camera picked
that<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.329> has<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:50.210> cool<00:00:51.210> pattern<00:00:51.719> on

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
that up but it has a cool pattern on

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.029

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
or something but to me it kind of looks

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.620 
or something but to me it kind of looks
like<00:01:01.309> maybe<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.520> water<00:01:02.850> drops<00:01:03.270> or<00:01:03.510> something

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630
