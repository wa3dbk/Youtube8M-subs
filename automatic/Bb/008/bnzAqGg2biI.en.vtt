correlation for pickup truck sales is

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.289 
correlation for pickup truck sales is
what<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.680> housing<00:03:09.070> market<00:03:09.370> is<00:03:09.489> doing<00:03:09.670> so

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
what the housing market is doing so

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.270 
what the housing market is doing so
between<00:03:10.600> that<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:11.410> then<00:03:11.620> also<00:03:11.799> looking<00:03:12.250> at

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
between that and then also looking at

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.750 
between that and then also looking at
the<00:03:12.370> replacement<00:03:13.060> demand

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
the replacement demand

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.500 
the replacement demand
pickup<00:03:14.060> trucks<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:15.019> think<00:03:16.090> fifty<00:03:17.090> percent<00:03:17.390> of

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
pickup trucks I think fifty percent of

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.390 
pickup trucks I think fifty percent of
the<00:03:17.569> pickup<00:03:17.810> trucks<00:03:18.140> in<00:03:18.349> the<00:03:18.650> marketplace<00:03:19.189> now

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
the pickup trucks in the marketplace now

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.089 
the pickup trucks in the marketplace now
are<00:03:19.670> ten<00:03:19.939> years<00:03:20.180> or<00:03:20.360> older<00:03:20.510> so<00:03:21.470> we<00:03:21.860> think<00:03:21.980> that

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
are ten years or older so we think that

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.220 
are ten years or older so we think that
replacement<00:03:22.549> demand<00:03:22.909> will<00:03:23.269> be<00:03:23.390> there<00:03:23.629> and<00:03:23.840> on

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
replacement demand will be there and on

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.420 
replacement demand will be there and on
top<00:03:24.470> of<00:03:24.500> it<00:03:24.709> coming<00:03:24.980> in<00:03:25.220> with<00:03:25.400> a

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
top of it coming in with a

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.179 
top of it coming in with a
groundbreaking<00:03:26.030> new<00:03:26.209> f-series<00:03:26.780> truck<00:03:27.200> we're

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
very optimistic about how we'll be able

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.860 
very optimistic about how we'll be able

industry hit about 15.6 million units

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.440 
industry hit about 15.6 million units
and<00:03:51.889> when<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.099> add<00:03:52.250> in<00:03:52.430> medium<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:53.299> heavy

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
and when you add in medium and heavy

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.149 
and when you add in medium and heavy
trucks<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:53.930> was<00:03:54.019> about<00:03:54.230> 15<00:03:54.650> point<00:03:54.950> nine

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 
trucks it was about 15 point nine

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.720 
trucks it was about 15 point nine
million<00:03:55.430> so<00:03:56.269> you<00:03:57.139> know<00:03:57.230> we<00:03:57.680> we<00:03:58.069> see<00:03:58.370> the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
million so you know we we see the

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.530 
million so you know we we see the
industry<00:03:59.209> next<00:03:59.780> year<00:04:00.019> between<00:04:00.260> 16<00:04:01.069> and<00:04:01.280> 17

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.180 
industry next year between 16 and 17
million<00:04:02.540> units<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.049> again<00:04:03.650> we<00:04:03.829> think<00:04:04.129> that

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
million units and again we think that

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.140 
million units and again we think that
will<00:04:04.519> be<00:04:05.170> driven<00:04:06.170> by<00:04:06.560> again<00:04:07.459> there's<00:04:07.700> pent-up

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
will be driven by again there's pent-up

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.910 
will be driven by again there's pent-up
demand<00:04:08.450> still<00:04:08.959> some<00:04:09.230> degree<00:04:09.530> of<00:04:09.560> pent<00:04:09.799> up

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
demand still some degree of pent up

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.800 
demand still some degree of pent up
demand<00:04:09.980> out<00:04:10.459> there<00:04:10.489> but<00:04:11.329> there's<00:04:11.480> a<00:04:11.540> large

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
demand out there but there's a large

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.690 
demand out there but there's a large
degree<00:04:12.019> of<00:04:12.319> replacement<00:04:13.010> demand<00:04:13.129> giving<00:04:13.579> the

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
degree of replacement demand giving the

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.180 
degree of replacement demand giving the
aging<00:04:14.120> of<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.359> fleet<00:04:14.780> interest<00:04:15.739> rates<00:04:15.980> are

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
aging of the fleet interest rates are

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.610 
aging of the fleet interest rates are
still<00:04:16.329> relatively<00:04:17.329> low<00:04:17.690> so<00:04:18.049> it's<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.229> good<00:04:18.380> time

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
still relatively low so it's a good time

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.360 
still relatively low so it's a good time
to<00:04:18.650> buy<00:04:18.919> a<00:04:18.949> vehicle<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.720> consumer<00:04:20.720> confidence

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
to buy a vehicle and consumer confidence

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.100 
to buy a vehicle and consumer confidence
continues<00:04:22.370> to<00:04:22.520> inch<00:04:22.699> its<00:04:22.910> way<00:04:23.090> up<00:04:23.300> so<00:04:23.599> we<00:04:23.990> think

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
continues to inch its way up so we think

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.600 
continues to inch its way up so we think
all<00:04:24.349> those<00:04:24.560> things<00:04:24.889> are<00:04:25.039> supporting

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
all those things are supporting

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.920 
all those things are supporting
