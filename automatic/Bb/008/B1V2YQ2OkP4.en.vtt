00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.609

 All square because of this channel 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.940

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.680
 people that accompany me from the beginning 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.570

 sure you'll fucking enjoy it 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.500
 I always took that dilemma to my 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.390
 seriously do the best with what you have 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.000
 then, even though they do not have the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.310
 at any given moment the channel I 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.799
 I always did the best I had and 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.210
 This is fun for the videos, this gives 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.310
 thanks to my channel 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.409
 Well I think that's right is sometimes the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.259
 dude that I'm sure but that's ok 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.360
 Guys, what are we going to do? 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.000
 celebrate personal first 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.250
 disconnect you about something soon 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.979
 soon block in very brief 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.100
 I'm going to draw a lottery and partner with 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.040
 game fan of any game that you 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.360
 want and have seen there in the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.549
 shop game fan 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.200
 for those who do not know atm was a store 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.659
 who sponsors that channel is the store 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.680
 virtual she comes she comes from games 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.840
 virtual 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.670
 the predicted second liquid description 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.350
 This is personal, check it out, I guess. 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.450
 which is a store you already know you 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.360
 also has a discount coupon blamed the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.500
 smart the 5% discount and anything 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.120
 already take a look there because I have 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.900
 sure you will face 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.939
 old 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.250
 the people there already had to have mind 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.260
 smoking crack will sell game on good not 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.750
 Okay, I think it's very cheap. 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.840
 very much consider the prices there but finally 3 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.269
 the staff is the first video and 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.939
 If this video will leave soon 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.519
 wait for something else too, everyone 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:35.040
 playing minecraft once I had 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.109
 said that minecraft had lost grace 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.319
 once I had said that if youtube 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.609
 spoiled minecraft and mainly 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.010
 people who watched and 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.260
 craft and I've been noticing that this thing 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.260
 kind of changed I think minecraft 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.659
 took some other proportions 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.389
 I think those channels on youtube are 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:57.750
 these channels here on youtube still do 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:59.730
 a job a little as much as what little 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.260
 Is it that I can say so I think 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.049
 other people should do some kind of 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.540
 some kind of other videos from 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.819
 minecraft there are some mini games that 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.689
 I really like it so I go 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.239
 try 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.159
 I'm actually going to reactivate the channel all 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.439
 square when they will turn out very well 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.930
 said on my beloved's radio because 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:21.090
 there in your partnership with network none 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.090
 I do not make any money, I'll do it 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.250
 videos without a penny actually 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.500
 when you produce a video you lose 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.970
 Time you lose money I could 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.409
 be caring for a patient in this 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.340
 time that I'm recording by performing 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:37.379
 video submission is half of the video 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.930
 and you know how much time is worked from 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.790
 a physiotherapist give me a researched 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.459
 I always worked from home care downtown 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.750
 researched home care care 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.449
 physical therapist home care in what I say 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.419
 is the care at home is the care in 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:53.549
 At last, I was one. 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.260
 in time to record some 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.069
 videos and post there on the square bottom 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.859
 I also hope to return there with grants 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.769
 taco with the series in truth and new 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.870
 series by smart allende is something that 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.849
 will return after coming back in a way 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.069
 different will be the challenges of 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.560
 minecraft and this is to much stop 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.109
 interesting because I get one 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.150
 very cool interaction with the public 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.879
 short personal else also another 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.639
 thing also I created my boss 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:26.159
 People, I already complained to you. 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.400
 sometimes that the bosses who were 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:31.830
 seeing it was something unilateral that you 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.590
 contribute to the content creator 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.680
 they simply picked up the farofa to 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.199
 So I ended up creating my role and 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.509
 You will see that with very little money. 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.689
 you will have differences and diverse 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:48.330
 advantages of the boss he is not 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:50.490
 the cheapest you've seen but it's something 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.460
 completely plausible for any 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.960
 public to anyone 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.330
 then paper and accept card 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.250
 international and also accepts paypal 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.919
 You only have national account , beauty face. 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.750
 created the paypal and help with pate or 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.330
 in the boss because as I said to 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.889
 you are you will be contributing in 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.689
 monthly for the mangrove channel and 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.580
 you will have contributed to the 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:13.439
 Our work here continue if you like 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.080
 of the video guy I think the dollar does not 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:18.120
 will mess up anything or do not know 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.370
 How is your financial situation? 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.830
 because I do not really know if you guys 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.990
 they noticed but in the last days I posted it 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.930
 conquest in the videos when I posted 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.430
 video yet then I would very much like 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.379
 to continue work 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.270
 when to do it on youtube and for that I 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.589
 I need time for this I need 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.659
 a support from you 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:38.250
 so the paper will be here the first 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:42.089
 description link as of today 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.830
 always and his ipês to the staff but 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:45.779
 I think that's it then the guys I 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.830
 I have several other things that I want 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.770
 show you 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.259
 for example some time ago I 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.289
 predisposed to make a top 10 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:57.599
 the opening of animals I will make a top 10 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.479
 still in commemoration of the thousand subscribers 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.919
 top-10 opening second hand they sea is 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.139
 my opinion if you want to give your 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.710
 opinion you comment or create your top 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:06.180
 10 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.810
 when he called him retarded because 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.360
 every taste is the same cool i have my e 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.060
 You finally got it, man. 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.740
 She's sorry, it's going to work, or maybe 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.470
 I also want to make a pop games 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.720
 playstation 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.340
 milk because it was the old 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.930
 generation that I played the most 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.570
 unfortunately the platform that is 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.010
 dying now so I think this one 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.180
 kind of video in celebration will be 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.950
 very cool 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.740
 another thing I'm going to try as a 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:35.680
 studying nothing much more viable than the 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.250
 that I show my day to day for you 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.530
 then on a day which I will want're 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.990
 Taking this day I'll show you 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.120
 you how the day-to-day Elismar manu 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.390
 It's a normal day of human study . 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.150
 Landmarks did go to see that the stop is bisou 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.190
 and it is expensive because the agreement type yes that 40 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.880
 in the morning and I arrive at home eight 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:59.020
 night 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.770
 so it's expensive the bang is the crazy bangu 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.450
 same 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.850
 the staff but there will be several 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.650
 videos speaks blank the first nobody 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.870
 here below my only role 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.570
 second lippi will be a flop game fan gives 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.910
 a glance there in both cases because 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:15.460
 that way you help me and you do not even know 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.180
 I feel very grateful and sunny. 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.520
 again 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.740
 many thanks to whoever accompanied 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.400
 Thank you so much you're new to the 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.410
 channel 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.050
 This strengthens the channel a lot and I hope 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.950
 to please you in the course of our 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.169
 journey
