00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
what you can do to reduce glare on the

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:11.540 
what you can do to reduce glare on the
glasses<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.689> your<00:00:03.810> talent<00:00:10.370> when<00:00:11.370> you're

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
glasses of your talent when you're

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.740 
glasses of your talent when you're
shooting<00:00:11.700> talent<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.210> are<00:00:12.330> wearing<00:00:12.570> glasses

you often run into issues where you get

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.730 
you often run into issues where you get
glare<00:00:15.389> on<00:00:15.630> their<00:00:15.900> glasses<00:00:16.109> here<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.500> can<00:00:16.619> see

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
glare on their glasses here you can see

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.370 
glare on their glasses here you can see
she's<00:00:16.920> got<00:00:16.949> quite<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> bit<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.699> her<00:00:18.660> right<00:00:19.080> lens

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
she's got quite a bit on her right lens

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.170 
she's got quite a bit on her right lens
and<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.740> tiny<00:00:20.010> bit<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.220> her<00:00:20.430> left<00:00:20.730> lens<00:00:20.939> as<00:00:21.150> well

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
and a tiny bit on her left lens as well

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.230 
and a tiny bit on her left lens as well
so<00:00:21.990> what<00:00:22.289> we<00:00:22.320> are<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.949> do<00:00:23.100> here<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.880> talk

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
so what we are going to do here is talk

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.550 
so what we are going to do here is talk
about<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> couple<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.779> techniques<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.350> try

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
about a couple of techniques you can try

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.080 
about a couple of techniques you can try
or<00:00:25.619> at<00:00:25.740> least<00:00:25.859> things<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.130> I've<00:00:26.220> tried<00:00:26.490> that

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
or at least things that I've tried that

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.570 
or at least things that I've tried that
sort<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.930> work<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.380> I'm<00:00:28.890> still<00:00:29.189> not<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.369> don't

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
sort of work and I'm still not I don't

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.890 
sort of work and I'm still not I don't
have<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.760> down<00:00:29.970> perfectly<00:00:30.390> yet<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:30.779> we're

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
have this down perfectly yet but we're

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.420 
have this down perfectly yet but we're
still<00:00:31.109> working<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.710> think<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> main

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
still working on it I think the main

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.130 
still working on it I think the main
thing<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.329> take<00:00:33.540> your<00:00:33.719> bit<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
thing to do is to take your bit and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.630 
thing to do is to take your bit and
we're<00:00:34.230> using<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.530> soft<00:00:34.770> key<00:00:35.010> light<00:00:35.219> here

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
we're using a soft key light here

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.110 
we're using a soft key light here
softbox<00:00:36.570> just<00:00:37.200> move<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.680> from<00:00:38.280> 45<00:00:38.700> degrees

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
softbox just move that from 45 degrees

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.410 
softbox just move that from 45 degrees
closer<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.290> 90<00:00:40.710> degrees<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:41.969> talents

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
closer to 90 degrees to your talents

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.350 
closer to 90 degrees to your talents
side<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.620> not<00:00:44.160> not<00:00:44.520> all<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> way<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> 90<00:00:45.120> but

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
side and not not all the way to 90 but

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.569 
side and not not all the way to 90 but
just<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.629> little<00:00:46.289> bit<00:00:46.440> closer<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.219> you

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
just a little bit closer to that and you

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.069 
just a little bit closer to that and you
can<00:00:47.610> see<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.149> does<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.539> causes<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
can see what that does is it causes the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.479 
can see what that does is it causes the
light<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.289> bounce<00:00:49.559> off<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> different<00:00:50.399> angle

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
light to bounce off at a different angle

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.340 
light to bounce off at a different angle
so<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.820> don't<00:00:51.120> get<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.329> horrible<00:00:52.110> glare

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
so you don't get that horrible glare

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.650 
so you don't get that horrible glare
that's<00:00:52.820> actually<00:00:53.820> looking<00:00:54.149> pretty<00:00:54.180> good

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
that's actually looking pretty good

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.180 
that's actually looking pretty good
right<00:00:55.050> there<00:00:55.079> now<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.590> are<00:00:55.739> getting<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.039> little

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
right there now we are getting a little

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.490 
right there now we are getting a little
reflection<00:00:56.489> from<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> reflector<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> on

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
reflection from the reflector on the on

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.219 
reflection from the reflector on the on
her<00:00:58.829> left<00:00:59.250> camera<00:00:59.640> right<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.379> her<00:01:01.379> left<00:01:01.829> lens

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
her left camera right in her left lens

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.780 
her left camera right in her left lens
just<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.350> little<00:01:04.589> tiny<00:01:04.769> bit<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.400> not

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
just a little tiny bit so it's not

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.510 
just a little tiny bit so it's not
perfect<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:07.140> that's<00:01:07.320> gives<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.710> just

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
perfect here but that's gives you just

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.940 
perfect here but that's gives you just
sort<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.850> first<00:01:09.210> step<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.619> just

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
sort of a first step you can do now just

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.350 
sort of a first step you can do now just
to<00:01:11.040> review<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.400> really<00:01:11.580> quickly<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.119> if<00:01:12.240> we

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
to review that really quickly so if we

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.030 
to review that really quickly so if we
have<00:01:12.479> our<00:01:12.570> soft<00:01:12.840> key<00:01:13.049> light<00:01:13.290> here<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:13.680> 45

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
have our soft key light here at 45

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.760 
have our soft key light here at 45
degrees<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:15.030> our<00:01:15.060> talent<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:15.990> will<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.619> want

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
degrees to our talent we will just want

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.490 
degrees to our talent we will just want
to<00:01:16.860> move<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.220> little<00:01:17.549> bit<00:01:17.700> more<00:01:17.939> closer<00:01:18.500> to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
to move that a little bit more closer to

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.350 
to move that a little bit more closer to
90<00:01:19.890> degrees<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.520> gives<00:01:20.790> us<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.090> really

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
90 degrees and that gives us a really

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.840 
90 degrees and that gives us a really
nice<00:01:21.799> way<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.830> getting<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.310> light<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.670> bounce

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
nice way of getting that light to bounce

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.219 
nice way of getting that light to bounce
off<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> other<00:01:24.570> direction<00:01:24.750> now<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
off in the other direction now the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.600 
off in the other direction now the
reflection<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:25.920> I'm<00:01:26.009> still<00:01:26.250> working<00:01:26.549> on

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
reflection here I'm still working on

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.819 
reflection here I'm still working on
that<00:01:26.670> haven't<00:01:27.119> perfected<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.770> you

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
that haven't perfected that I think you

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.080 
that haven't perfected that I think you
need<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.009> tweak<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:29.549> well<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:29.970> don't

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
need to tweak that as well so you don't

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.060 
need to tweak that as well so you don't
get<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.420> reflection<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.740> see<00:01:31.920> in

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
get that reflection and you can see in

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.609 
get that reflection and you can see in
here<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.430> her<00:01:32.579> lens<00:01:32.939> here<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> her<00:01:34.020> left

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
here in her lens here on the her left

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.740 
here in her lens here on the her left
lens<00:01:34.890> our<00:01:35.280> camera<00:01:35.790> right<00:01:35.939> lens<00:01:36.270> there's<00:01:36.479> still

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
lens our camera right lens there's still

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.969 
lens our camera right lens there's still
a<00:01:36.780> little<00:01:36.900> bit<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> reflector<00:01:37.530> showing<00:01:37.799> there

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
a little bit of reflector showing there

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.289 
a little bit of reflector showing there
but<00:01:38.159> another<00:01:38.460> thing<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.030> raise

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
but another thing you can do is raise

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.780 
but another thing you can do is raise
the<00:01:39.329> light<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.049> also<00:01:40.829> helps<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.579> some

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the light and that also helps to some

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.920 
the light and that also helps to some
extent<00:01:42.180> as<00:01:42.299> well<00:01:42.479> now<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.840> be

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
extent as well now you have to be

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.510 
extent as well now you have to be
careful<00:01:43.320> once<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.369> don't<00:01:44.430> want

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
careful once you do that you don't want

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.100 
careful once you do that you don't want
to<00:01:44.640> raise<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.909> too<00:01:45.030> high<00:01:45.210> or<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.689> start<00:01:46.020> to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
to raise it too high or you can start to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.980 
to raise it too high or you can start to
get<00:01:46.880> deeper<00:01:47.880> set<00:01:48.119> looking<00:01:48.420> eyes<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.869> you've

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
get deeper set looking eyes so you've

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.090 
get deeper set looking eyes so you've
got<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.229> kind<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.409> careful<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.920> but

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
got to be kind of careful with that but

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.230 
got to be kind of careful with that but
that<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.310> another<00:01:50.490> technique<00:01:50.909> one<00:01:51.119> other

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that is another technique one other

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.310 
that is another technique one other
technique<00:01:51.420> I've<00:01:51.720> heard<00:01:51.869> people<00:01:51.960> talk<00:01:52.110> about

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
technique I've heard people talk about

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.590 
technique I've heard people talk about
is<00:01:52.500> using<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.860> circular<00:01:53.430> polarizing<00:01:54.210> filter

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
is using a circular polarizing filter

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.450 
is using a circular polarizing filter
and<00:01:54.840> that's<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.829> something<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.159> fits<00:01:56.369> on

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and that's just something that fits on

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.840 
and that's just something that fits on
the<00:01:56.520> front<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.759> your<00:01:56.850> lens<00:01:57.140> I<00:01:58.670> didn't<00:01:59.670> find

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the front of your lens I didn't find

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.399 
the front of your lens I didn't find
this<00:02:00.000> works<00:02:00.210> very<00:02:00.390> well<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.750> fact<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.200> made

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
this works very well in fact it made

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.830 
this works very well in fact it made
some<00:02:01.860> funny<00:02:02.040> colors<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.790> didn't<00:02:03.420> do<00:02:03.600> anything

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
some funny colors and didn't do anything

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.350 
some funny colors and didn't do anything
for<00:02:03.990> our<00:02:04.170> glare<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:05.850> also<00:02:06.000> kind<00:02:06.270> of

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
for our glare and it also kind of

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.320 
for our glare and it also kind of
affected<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> autofocus<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.710> my<00:02:07.860> camera<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.330> I

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
affected the autofocus on my camera so I

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.790 
affected the autofocus on my camera so I
may<00:02:09.599> be<00:02:09.660> doing<00:02:09.810> something<00:02:10.110> wrong<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.470> is

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
may be doing something wrong but that is

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.470 
may be doing something wrong but that is
something<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.610> some<00:02:11.760> people<00:02:11.790> suggested

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
something that some people suggested

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.290 
something that some people suggested
didn't<00:02:12.750> work<00:02:12.870> out<00:02:13.020> well

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
didn't work out well

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.910 
didn't work out well
for<00:02:13.420> me<00:02:13.540> one<00:02:14.050> other<00:02:14.170> trick<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:14.770> do<00:02:14.890> is

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
for me one other trick you can do is

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.500 
for me one other trick you can do is
have<00:02:15.280> your<00:02:15.460> talent<00:02:15.760> actually<00:02:15.880> lean<00:02:16.300> their

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
have your talent actually lean their

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.360 
have your talent actually lean their
glasses<00:02:16.750> forward<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.470> bring<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.860> top<00:02:18.100> of

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
glasses forward so to bring the top of

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.550 
glasses forward so to bring the top of
the<00:02:18.880> lenses<00:02:19.240> forward<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:19.930> they're<00:02:20.170> angled

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
the lenses forward so they're angled

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.590 
the lenses forward so they're angled
down<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.830> little<00:02:21.070> bit<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:21.790> works<00:02:22.090> for<00:02:22.450> some

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
down a little bit this works for some

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.760 
down a little bit this works for some
people<00:02:22.630> doesn't<00:02:23.080> work<00:02:23.170> for<00:02:23.290> others<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.710> not

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
people doesn't work for others and not

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.990 
people doesn't work for others and not
everyone's<00:02:24.340> going<00:02:24.460> to<00:02:24.490> be<00:02:24.580> able<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.790> get<00:02:24.910> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
everyone's going to be able to get the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.490 
everyone's going to be able to get the
glasses<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.510> stay<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.780> can<00:02:25.870> see<00:02:26.170> here<00:02:26.350> we're

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
glasses to stay you can see here we're

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.100 
glasses to stay you can see here we're
struggling<00:02:26.770> with<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.450> with<00:02:28.450> our<00:02:28.630> talent<00:02:28.990> in

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
struggling with that with our talent in

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.410 
struggling with that with our talent in
this<00:02:29.260> case<00:02:29.500> didn't<00:02:30.490> end<00:02:30.610> up<00:02:30.700> working<00:02:30.880> out<00:02:31.210> but

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
this case didn't end up working out but

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.820 
this case didn't end up working out but
that<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.690> another<00:02:31.900> trick<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.320> kind<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.530> keep<00:02:32.650> in

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
that is another trick to kind of keep in

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.530 
that is another trick to kind of keep in
your<00:02:32.950> back<00:02:33.070> pocket<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.730> speak<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.030> could

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
your back pocket so to speak that could

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.230 
your back pocket so to speak that could
help<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.080> he<00:02:35.470> actually<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.340> works<00:02:36.550> if<00:02:36.760> we<00:02:37.000> get

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
help and he actually it works if we get

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.880 
help and he actually it works if we get
it<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.450> stay<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:38.050> worked<00:02:38.290> pretty<00:02:38.410> well<00:02:38.620> didn't

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
it to stay it worked pretty well didn't

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.370 
it to stay it worked pretty well didn't
have<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.070> reflector<00:02:39.960> glaring<00:02:40.960> off<00:02:41.080> that

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
have the reflector glaring off that

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.490 
have the reflector glaring off that
camera<00:02:42.070> right<00:02:42.400> lens<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.150> case<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.660> that's

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
camera right lens in this case so that's

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.950 
camera right lens in this case so that's
another<00:02:44.830> technique<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.460> keep<00:02:45.610> in<00:02:45.790> mind<00:02:46.060> that

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
another technique to keep in mind that

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.570 
another technique to keep in mind that
can<00:02:47.380> be<00:02:47.590> helpful<00:02:47.860> at<00:02:48.040> least<00:02:48.070> in<00:02:48.370> some

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
can be helpful at least in some

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.190 
can be helpful at least in some
circumstances<00:02:49.300> here<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.510> tried<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:49.930> on<00:02:49.990> my<00:02:50.170> own

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
circumstances here I tried it on my own

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.350 
circumstances here I tried it on my own
glasses<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:50.980> see<00:02:51.160> I'm<00:02:51.340> still<00:02:51.670> had<00:02:52.120> some

glasses and you see I'm still had some
issues<00:02:52.750> with<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.110> reflector<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:54.250> takes

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
issues with the reflector and that takes

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.490 
issues with the reflector and that takes
care<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:55.000> reflector<00:02:55.960> glare<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:56.200> you're

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
care of the reflector glare that you're

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.320 
care of the reflector glare that you're
seeing<00:02:56.740> in<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.070> camera<00:02:57.460> right<00:02:57.700> lens<00:02:58.000> here
