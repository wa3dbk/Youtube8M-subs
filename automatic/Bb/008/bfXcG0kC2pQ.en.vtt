crabapple<00:02:47.239> would<00:02:47.720> be<00:02:47.840> right<00:02:48.049> at<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.260> very<00:02:48.290> tip

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
crabapple would be right at the very tip

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.220 
crabapple would be right at the very tip
of<00:02:48.799> a<00:02:49.010> branch<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.640> what<00:02:50.209> she<00:02:50.390> has<00:02:50.569> is<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.780> sword

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
of a branch and what she has is a sword

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.530 
of a branch and what she has is a sword
like<00:02:51.319> ovipositor<00:02:52.310> shall<00:02:52.519> dig<00:02:52.849> down<00:02:53.090> into<00:02:53.360> that

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
like ovipositor shall dig down into that

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.199 
like ovipositor shall dig down into that
branch<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.230> shall<00:02:54.890> lay<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.190> clutch<00:02:55.790> of<00:02:55.819> about

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
branch and shall lay a clutch of about

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.100 
branch and shall lay a clutch of about
25<00:02:56.780> tiny<00:02:57.230> little<00:02:57.530> eggs<00:02:57.910> right<00:02:58.910> in<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.750> branch

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
25 tiny little eggs right in that branch

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.600 
25 tiny little eggs right in that branch
and<00:03:00.470> that's<00:03:01.069> where<00:03:01.310> they're<00:03:01.430> going<00:03:01.549> to

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
and that's where they're going to

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.819 
and that's where they're going to
incubate<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:02.900> what<00:03:03.049> will<00:03:03.140> happen<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.650> this

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
incubate so what will happen is this

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.710 
incubate so what will happen is this
whole<00:03:04.069> tip<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.819> branch<00:03:05.090> will<00:03:05.360> just<00:03:05.510> die

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
whole tip of the branch will just die

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.160 
whole tip of the branch will just die
off<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.260> hang<00:03:06.860> down<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.910> it'll<00:03:08.690> turn<00:03:08.840> brown

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
off and hang down and it'll turn brown

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.600 
off and hang down and it'll turn brown
and<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.560> course<00:03:09.739> it's<00:03:09.890> no<00:03:10.040> it's<00:03:10.310> no<00:03:10.400> longer

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
and of course it's no it's no longer

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.550 
and of course it's no it's no longer
available<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.360> tree<00:03:11.630> so<00:03:12.140> that'll<00:03:12.380> have<00:03:12.500> to

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
available to the tree so that'll have to

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.589 
available to the tree so that'll have to
be<00:03:12.650> pruned<00:03:13.040> off<00:03:13.220> that's<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:13.940> only<00:03:14.329> damage

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
be pruned off that's the only damage

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.539 
be pruned off that's the only damage
that<00:03:14.900> they'll<00:03:15.049> be<00:03:15.170> doing<00:03:15.530> but<00:03:16.190> if<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:16.400> can

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
that they'll be doing but if you can

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.100 
that they'll be doing but if you can
imagine<00:03:16.670> on<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.180> tree<00:03:17.360> this<00:03:17.510> size<00:03:17.569> if<00:03:18.019> you

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
imagine on the tree this size if you

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.280 
imagine on the tree this size if you

have 200 females each laying 25 eggs

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.289 
have 200 females each laying 25 eggs
it's<00:03:21.920> going<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.190> turn<00:03:22.430> this<00:03:22.549> entire<00:03:22.760> thing

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
it's going to turn this entire thing

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.509 
it's going to turn this entire thing
brown<00:03:23.690> so<00:03:24.200> if<00:03:24.319> you've<00:03:24.440> just<00:03:24.470> put<00:03:24.769> in<00:03:24.920> new<00:03:25.130> trees

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
brown so if you've just put in new trees

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.970 
brown so if you've just put in new trees
in<00:03:25.819> your<00:03:25.910> yard<00:03:25.970> or<00:03:26.480> wherever<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.620> might<00:03:27.769> want
