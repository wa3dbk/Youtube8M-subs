00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.700
 exactly started things nicoletta is municipal councilor via monsignor 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.469
 spoken language in the world but you want to dance Napoleon for me 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.009
 paid 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.949
 card over a decade 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.800
 that the electric vehicle competitions took place in Italy 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.450
 under the xaiz acronym which stands for automotive sports commission 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.190
 Italian 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.510
 and consequently 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.860
 official fiat races or the international federation 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.570
 car 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.570
 2007 seems to set the strength 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.140
 in fact, in the Monza race scheduled for next weekend on June 24th 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.710
 only two motorcycles of the small category up to 150 kilos have been registered I think 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.940
 4 bikes 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.860
 of the largest category up to 300 kilos in weight only two cars 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.860
 electric - webcam 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.960
 confirming the tendency that water is that they have electric pits are those 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.870
 that save the show not only for the amount of sky 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.180
 but because they are really all very close in terms of performance and consequently 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.480
 a winner cannot be predicted before the race 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.820
 paradoxically 2007 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.750
 the year that is going to remain in history as the thistle of Marco Faraci is endowed 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.760
 of lithium polymer battery 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.580
 shot down in a race in the karting track of rioveggio in the province of bologna his 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.170
 125 cubic centimeter cousins 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.930
 escorted by the noisiest and polluting text engines 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.750
 cost a race that took place 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.570
 on the normal length of the thermal car 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.960
 and even where the tax documents had to leave for a moment 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.540
 according to the request of the race director 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.540
 just to avoid disturbing the more loud cousins 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.760
 if this episode leaves canalis very important if it is an electric motor 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.209
 news 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.749
 and its director marselo padding 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:19.499
 always based on the real data of that on which you work at very high 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:20.579
 levels 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.479
 the first analysis is the slowness of the csai to adopt the regulations to that 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:30.019
 that probably the technique allows to do with vehicles and colors 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:34.249
 because incredibly second and regulations and cards he won 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:35.509
 brilliantly 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:39.629
 and that marked a milestone in the history of motor racing worldwide by 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.249
 competition cannot compete for the Italian championship 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.629
 camper letters to sofia 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.119
 because it is also the regulation 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:49.149
 and with him 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:53.879
 of course all his fellows because obviously in the last few months 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.319
 there have been many competitors who have updated their kart with the 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.319
 latest generation batteries currently have 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:06.399
 the other analysis and what the development of electric vehicles was 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:09.399
 promoted in Italy in the last 10 years 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.439
 sprint races lasting a few minutes 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.540
 but where the practical application is not the right one, check it 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.479
 development of electric and solar vehicle registration that took place in other countries 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.409
 of the world as we see in the images 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.759
 where it merges with circulation is the most domestic way in quotation marks 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:34.019
 but where surely electric vehicles can have a lot to say 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:36.799
 analysis that we are 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.789
 many intelligent people who govern institutions 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:42.539
 they can contain account 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:44.679
 this is what we hope for
