problems<00:01:37.640> on<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.970> farm<00:01:38.440> obviously<00:01:39.440> we

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
problems on the farm obviously we

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.080 
problems on the farm obviously we
started<00:01:39.950> here<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.130> gating<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.760> mid-80s

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
started here a gating and the mid-80s

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.790 
started here a gating and the mid-80s
and<00:01:41.450> we<00:01:41.570> were<00:01:41.720> on<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.810> system<00:01:42.260> a<00:01:42.380> run<00:01:42.620> of<00:01:42.740> the

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
and we were on a system a run of the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.500 
and we were on a system a run of the
river<00:01:43.010> so<00:01:43.400> we<00:01:43.430> could<00:01:43.729> draw<00:01:43.909> water<00:01:44.090> from<00:01:44.390> the

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
river so we could draw water from the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.270 
river so we could draw water from the
river<00:01:44.750> when<00:01:44.960> it<00:01:45.080> was<00:01:45.200> above<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.650> minimum<00:01:46.040> flow

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
river when it was above the minimum flow

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.420 
river when it was above the minimum flow
so<00:01:47.000> for<00:01:47.150> periods<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.659> each<00:01:47.840> summer<00:01:48.190> six<00:01:49.190> weeks

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
so for periods of each summer six weeks

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.820 
so for periods of each summer six weeks
to<00:01:49.640> a<00:01:49.670> month<00:01:49.729> or<00:01:50.240> a<00:01:50.270> month<00:01:50.450> or<00:01:50.600> six<00:01:50.840> weeks<00:01:50.930> we'd

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
to a month or a month or six weeks we'd

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.060 
to a month or a month or six weeks we'd
be<00:01:52.299> seduced<00:01:53.299> to<00:01:53.540> some<00:01:54.350> sort<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:54.620> restriction

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
be seduced to some sort of restriction

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.250 
be seduced to some sort of restriction
so<00:01:55.909> I<00:01:55.940> one<00:01:56.180> day<00:01:56.210> year<00:01:56.540> ago<00:01:56.720> in<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:56.930> next<00:01:57.140> day

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
so I one day year ago in the next day

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.480 
so I one day year ago in the next day
you're<00:01:57.440> shut<00:01:57.680> off<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.010> it's<00:01:58.130> quite<00:01:58.280> difficult

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
you're shut off and it's quite difficult

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.399 
you're shut off and it's quite difficult
to<00:01:58.729> manage<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.510> farming<00:01:59.840> operation<00:01:59.930> around

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
to manage the farming operation around

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.130 
to manage the farming operation around
there<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:01.610> solution<00:02:02.180> was<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.450> construct<00:02:02.810> a

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
there the solution was to construct a

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.910 
there the solution was to construct a
1.4<00:02:04.010> million<00:02:04.460> dollar<00:02:04.909> storage<00:02:05.450> pond

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
1.4 million dollar storage pond

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.729 
1.4 million dollar storage pond
gravity-fed<00:02:06.979> from<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.460> river<00:02:08.470> yeah<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.560> gives

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
gravity-fed from the river yeah it gives

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.759

because<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:33.130> volume<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.930> alternative

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
because of the volume so the alternative

because of the volume so the alternative
to<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:35.980> was<00:02:36.190> building<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.580> large<00:02:36.820> flat<00:02:37.150> pawn

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
to this was building a large flat pawn

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.150 
to this was building a large flat pawn
approximately<00:02:38.200> three<00:02:38.410> meters<00:02:38.560> deep<00:02:38.920> which

was going to absorb a footprint of about

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.640 
was going to absorb a footprint of about

large flat surface your evaporation off

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.350 
large flat surface your evaporation off
the<00:02:46.720> surface<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.350> also<00:02:47.470> significant<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
the surface is also significant to the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.880 
the surface is also significant to the
system<00:02:49.780> here<00:02:49.960> we<00:02:50.050> have<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.290> probes<00:02:50.590> which

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
system here we have the probes which

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.740 
system here we have the probes which
controls<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.580> automation<00:02:52.150> or<00:02:52.240> a<00:02:52.330> gate<00:02:52.540> into

controls the automation or a gate into
the<00:02:52.870> pond<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:53.710> we<00:02:53.860> type<00:02:54.130> only<00:02:54.400> 103<00:02:54.940> litres<00:02:55.360> of

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
the pond so we type only 103 litres of

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.380 
the pond so we type only 103 litres of
second<00:02:55.810> ear<00:02:55.990> and<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.850> maintains<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:58.030> flow<00:02:58.240> and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
second ear and it maintains it flow and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.540 
second ear and it maintains it flow and
won't<00:02:58.540> exceed<00:02:58.870> there<00:02:59.140> on<00:02:59.500> the<00:03:00.070> top<00:03:00.280> you'll

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
won't exceed there on the top you'll

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.790 
won't exceed there on the top you'll
have<00:03:00.730> an<00:03:00.850> aerial<00:03:01.270> that's<00:03:01.540> radioed<00:03:02.140> through<00:03:02.500> to

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
have an aerial that's radioed through to

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.120 
have an aerial that's radioed through to

drawing<00:03:12.520> from<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.790> river<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:13.990> that<00:03:14.020> enables

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
drawing from the river so that enables

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.740 
drawing from the river so that enables
us<00:03:14.740> never<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.220> exceed<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:15.790> can<00:03:15.970> see<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.240> 103

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
us never to exceed you can see the 103

precision irrigation yeah we have

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.680 
precision irrigation yeah we have

foreseen a poet's on the farm because
you<00:03:28.990> can<00:03:29.440> easily<00:03:30.070> manipulate<00:03:30.340> here<00:03:30.970> much

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
you can easily manipulate here much

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.810 
you can easily manipulate here much
you're<00:03:31.450> applying<00:03:31.720> in<00:03:31.930> any<00:03:32.050> one<00:03:32.230> pass<00:03:32.760> as<00:03:33.760> you

know if you apply too much to saw that

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.250 
know if you apply too much to saw that
becomes<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.820> know<00:03:36.940> become<00:03:37.240> saturated<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:37.990> and
