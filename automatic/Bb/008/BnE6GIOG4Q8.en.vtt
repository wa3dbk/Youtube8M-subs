00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.170 
on here and wipe it up cuz you don't
need<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> lot<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.770> want<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.399> goopy<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
need a lot I want to be goopy just a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.569 
need a lot I want to be goopy just a
little<00:00:42.390> bit<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.780> makes<00:00:46.309> getting<00:00:47.309> that

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
little bit and it makes getting that

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.049 
little bit and it makes getting that
into<00:00:47.789> these<00:00:47.879> t-connector<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.750> much<00:00:49.079> easier

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
into these t-connector so much easier

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.100 
into these t-connector so much easier
still<00:00:51.059> not<00:00:51.210> easy<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.930> lot<00:00:52.050> easier

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
still not easy but it's a lot easier

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.580 
still not easy but it's a lot easier
anyway<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.930> hopefully<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.320> helps<00:00:57.050> also<00:00:58.050> use

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
anyway so hopefully that helps also use

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.250 
anyway so hopefully that helps also use
a<00:00:58.620> mallet<00:00:59.329> once<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.510> these<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.809> place<00:01:00.989> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
a mallet once you get these in place you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260 
a mallet once you get these in place you
can<00:01:01.289> use<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> mallet<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.070> tap<00:01:02.129> don't<00:01:02.579> don't<00:01:03.090> tap

not<00:02:03.319> that<00:02:04.319> will<00:02:04.380> need<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.619> too<00:02:04.799> far<00:02:05.009> up<00:02:05.159> so

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
not that will need it too far up so

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.380 
not that will need it too far up so
that's<00:02:06.990> been<00:02:07.229> doing<00:02:07.380> anyway<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.239> have

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
that's been doing anyway so you have

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.729 
that's been doing anyway so you have
that<00:02:09.479> extended<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:09.989> both<00:02:10.110> sides<00:02:10.349> already<00:02:10.590> how

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
that extended on both sides already how

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.229 
that extended on both sides already how
that<00:02:10.890> extended<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.519> have<00:02:11.640> your<00:02:11.760> locking<00:02:12.060> pins

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
that extended you have your locking pins

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.440 
that extended you have your locking pins
in<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:13.080> keep<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:13.440> loose<00:02:13.970> go<00:02:14.970> tighten<00:02:15.330> this

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
in you keep this loose go tighten this

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.759 
in you keep this loose go tighten this
up<00:02:15.599> because<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:16.019> will<00:02:16.170> need<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.470> move<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.739> a

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
up because this will need to move in a

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.890 
up because this will need to move in a
minute<00:02:16.980> you'll<00:02:17.130> see<00:02:17.340> why<00:02:17.519> next<00:02:18.510> thing<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.750> do

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
minute you'll see why next thing you do

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.330 
minute you'll see why next thing you do
is<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:20.670> extend<00:02:21.410> these<00:02:22.410> legs<00:02:22.709> just<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.310> little

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
is you extend these legs just a little

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.949 
is you extend these legs just a little
bit<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.850> way<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.060> make<00:02:24.299> sure<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.780> have

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
bit that way you make sure that you have

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.990 
bit that way you make sure that you have
these<00:02:25.829> two<00:02:26.070> legs<00:02:26.250> sitting<00:02:26.430> on<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.670> floor<00:02:26.820> like

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
these two legs sitting on the floor like

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.140 
these two legs sitting on the floor like
this<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.540> this<00:02:27.750> one<00:02:27.989> image<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.620> air<00:02:28.910> not<00:02:29.910> one

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
this and this one image the air not one

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.360 
this and this one image the air not one
sticking<00:02:30.660> down<00:02:30.870> two<00:02:31.140> up<00:02:31.319> in<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.190> way

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
sticking down two up in to have this way

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.430 
sticking down two up in to have this way
because<00:02:32.489> it'll<00:02:32.700> make<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.940> stable<00:02:33.440> tighten

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
because it'll make it stable tighten

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.860 
because it'll make it stable tighten
this<00:02:34.530> one<00:02:34.590> leave<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.370> one<00:02:35.670> loose<00:02:36.200> again<00:02:37.200> and

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
this one leave that one loose again and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.199 
this one leave that one loose again and
do<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.989> same<00:02:40.170> thing<00:02:40.380> on<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.590> one<00:02:41.209> still

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
do the same thing on this one still

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.559 
do the same thing on this one still
haven't<00:02:42.510> fixed<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:44.209> actually<00:02:45.209> I<00:02:45.269> did<00:02:45.389> have<00:02:45.420> a

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
haven't fixed this actually I did have a

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.870 
haven't fixed this actually I did have a
fix<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.049> broken<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:48.079> but

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
fix that broken in but

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
fix that broken in but
so<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:50.420> extend<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:50.900> on<00:02:51.020> this<00:02:51.110> one<00:02:51.170> OOP<00:02:52.750> so<00:02:53.750> this

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
so I extend it on this one OOP so this

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.540 
so I extend it on this one OOP so this
one's<00:02:54.140> guys<00:02:54.350> let's<00:02:54.830> just<00:02:54.890> extend<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.460> little

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
one's guys let's just extend a little

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.300 
one's guys let's just extend a little
bit<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:56.000> same<00:02:56.410> can<00:02:57.410> set<00:02:57.710> this<00:02:57.800> up<00:02:57.950> until<00:02:58.160> they

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
bit the same can set this up until they

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.100 
bit the same can set this up until they
get<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.430> good<00:02:58.580> view<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.050> standing<00:03:00.050> the

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
get a good view of the standing the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.150 
get a good view of the standing the
whole<00:03:00.140> thing<00:03:00.500> up<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.710> you'll<00:03:00.890> see<00:03:01.040> it's

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
whole thing up and you'll see it's

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.430 
whole thing up and you'll see it's
actually<00:03:01.430> really<00:03:01.580> quite<00:03:01.850> easy<00:03:02.170> as<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.230> one

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
actually really quite easy as a one

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.170 
actually really quite easy as a one
person<00:03:03.680> job<00:03:03.800> in<00:03:04.130> fact<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.610> really<00:03:04.850> don't<00:03:05.000> save

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
person job in fact you really don't save

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.860 
person job in fact you really don't save
a<00:03:05.210> whole<00:03:05.450> lot<00:03:05.600> of<00:03:05.690> time<00:03:05.870> by<00:03:06.650> having<00:03:06.770> two<00:03:07.070> people

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
a whole lot of time by having two people

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.230 
a whole lot of time by having two people
so<00:03:08.870> here's<00:03:09.110> go<00:03:09.260> here<00:03:09.560> goes<00:03:09.790> okay<00:03:10.790> no<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.030> can't

so here's go here goes okay no you can't

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.580 
so here's go here goes okay no you can't
see<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.420> whole<00:03:11.570> trust<00:03:11.840> this<00:03:11.990> way<00:03:12.200> it's<00:03:12.440> as

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
see the whole trust this way it's as

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.790 
see the whole trust this way it's as
good<00:03:12.740> as<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:12.950> could<00:03:13.010> do<00:03:13.220> with<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:13.460> stage<00:03:13.730> and

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
good as I could do with this stage and

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.220 
good as I could do with this stage and
the<00:03:15.800> stress<00:03:16.160> isn't<00:03:16.310> set<00:03:16.520> up<00:03:16.550> very<00:03:16.820> high<00:03:16.910> but

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
the stress isn't set up very high but

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.750 
the stress isn't set up very high but
bear<00:03:18.230> in<00:03:18.260> mind<00:03:18.350> when<00:03:18.860> it's<00:03:18.980> it<00:03:19.130> up<00:03:19.250> all<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:19.580> way

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
bear in mind when it's it up all the way

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.550 
bear in mind when it's it up all the way
I<00:03:19.850> can<00:03:20.030> get<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.240> up<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.660> can<00:03:21.140> still<00:03:21.350> reach<00:03:21.530> the

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
I can get it up I can still reach the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.640 
I can get it up I can still reach the
bottom<00:03:21.830> rung<00:03:22.160> with<00:03:22.910> my<00:03:23.120> hands<00:03:23.510> it's<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.470> little

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
bottom rung with my hands it's a little

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.080 
bottom rung with my hands it's a little
bit<00:03:24.740> more<00:03:24.890> of<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.070> lift<00:03:25.280> but<00:03:25.490> it's<00:03:25.610> not<00:03:25.760> too<00:03:25.970> bad

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
bit more of a lift but it's not too bad

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.270 
bit more of a lift but it's not too bad
it's<00:03:26.510> really<00:03:26.690> light<00:03:26.930> trust<00:03:27.290> it's<00:03:28.010> just<00:03:28.160> you

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
it's really light trust it's just you

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.770 
it's really light trust it's just you
know<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.700> have<00:03:28.820> to<00:03:28.910> have<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.240> extend<00:03:29.420> my<00:03:29.570> arms

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
know you have to have to extend my arms

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.500 
know you have to have to extend my arms
out<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:29.960> little<00:03:30.050> bit<00:03:30.170> more<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:30.380> get<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.620> up<00:03:30.770> there

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
out a little bit more to get it up there

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:45.300

extended a little bit so just make sure
that<00:03:51.380> when<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:51.740> start<00:03:52.010> extending<00:03:52.280> late's<00:03:52.610> the

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
that when you start extending late's the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.070 
rest away you just do this one a little
bit<00:03:54.800> more<00:03:55.010> and<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:56.450> one<00:03:56.600> a<00:03:56.630> little<00:03:56.690> bit<00:03:56.900> more

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
bit more and that one a little bit more

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.140 
bit more and that one a little bit more
this<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.070> little<00:03:58.280> bit<00:03:58.430> more<00:03:58.610> and<00:03:58.880> that<00:03:59.030> were<00:03:59.120> a

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
this a little bit more and that were a

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.180 
this a little bit more and that were a
little<00:03:59.270> bit<00:03:59.420> more<00:03:59.570> until<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.500> full<00:04:00.680> extent<00:04:01.070> but

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
little bit more until I full extent but

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.580 
little bit more until I full extent but
don't<00:04:01.370> try<00:04:01.490> to<00:04:01.550> extend<00:04:01.790> this<00:04:01.910> one<00:04:02.090> all<00:04:02.240> the<00:04:02.270> way

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
don't try to extend this one all the way

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.380 
don't try to extend this one all the way
while<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:03.770> one's<00:04:03.950> you<00:04:04.430> know<00:04:04.520> not<00:04:04.880> extended

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
while that one's you know not extended

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.150 
while that one's you know not extended
because<00:04:05.720> he<00:04:06.140> might<00:04:06.290> come<00:04:06.470> down<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.680> trust<00:04:07.040> that

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
because he might come down to trust that

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.250 
because he might come down to trust that
way<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.880> that's<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.630> one<00:04:08.810> thing<00:04:08.960> that<00:04:09.020> what

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
way and that's the one thing that what

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.960 
way and that's the one thing that what
teach<00:04:09.410> people<00:04:09.560> would<00:04:09.800> be<00:04:09.920> faster<00:04:10.340> obviously

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
teach people would be faster obviously

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.820 
teach people would be faster obviously
because<00:04:11.270> if<00:04:11.390> you<00:04:11.480> have<00:04:11.600> two<00:04:11.750> guys<00:04:11.930> extending

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
because if you have two guys extending

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.060 
because if you have two guys extending
at<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:12.950> same<00:04:13.130> time<00:04:14.020> their<00:04:15.020> trust<00:04:15.320> ends<00:04:15.590> so<00:04:15.950> I'd

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
at the same time their trust ends so I'd

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.030 
at the same time their trust ends so I'd
be<00:04:16.190> easier<00:04:16.870> but<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:18.530> one<00:04:18.650> thing<00:04:18.769> I<00:04:18.859> didn't

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
be easier but the one thing I didn't

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.710 
be easier but the one thing I didn't
have<00:04:19.160> to<00:04:19.250> debate<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:19.670> show<00:04:19.850> is<00:04:20.090> bring<00:04:20.600> this

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
have to debate and show is bring this

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.170 
have to debate and show is bring this
piece<00:04:20.780> together<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:22.370> don't<00:04:22.880> have<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.060> do<00:04:23.120> that

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
piece together I don't have to do that

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.150 
piece together I don't have to do that

at<00:05:36.090> this<00:05:36.240> angle<00:05:36.419> I'd<00:05:36.630> rather<00:05:36.780> have<00:05:37.020> one<00:05:37.370> direct

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
at this angle I'd rather have one direct

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.920 
at this angle I'd rather have one direct
that<00:05:38.520> way<00:05:38.729> you<00:05:39.090> can<00:05:39.240> do<00:05:39.330> differently<00:05:39.720> but

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
that way you can do differently but

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.210 
that way you can do differently but
that's<00:05:40.080> how<00:05:40.229> you<00:05:40.289> prefer<00:05:40.650> that's<00:05:40.860> how<00:05:40.949> I<00:05:40.979> feel

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
that's how you prefer that's how I feel

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.980 
that's how you prefer that's how I feel
more<00:05:41.400> comfortable<00:05:41.639> it<00:05:42.449> seems<00:05:42.630> like<00:05:42.750> it<00:05:42.900> has

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
more comfortable it seems like it has

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.230 
more comfortable it seems like it has
better<00:05:43.470> leverage<00:05:43.699> that<00:05:44.699> way<00:05:44.880> and<00:05:45.030> this<00:05:45.090> is

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
better leverage that way and this is

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.749 
better leverage that way and this is
also<00:05:45.419> the<00:05:45.539> reason<00:05:45.630> why<00:05:45.900> I<00:05:46.460> initially<00:05:47.460> leave

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
also the reason why I initially leave

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.279 
also the reason why I initially leave
these<00:05:47.940> loose<00:05:48.180> when<00:05:48.479> I'm<00:05:48.599> staying<00:05:48.870> it<00:05:49.020> up<00:05:49.110> is

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
these loose when I'm staying it up is

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:50.809 
these loose when I'm staying it up is
because<00:05:49.319> when<00:05:49.710> they<00:05:49.800> get<00:05:49.949> the<00:05:50.069> thing<00:05:50.220> put<00:05:50.460> up<00:05:50.580> I

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:50.819 
because when they get the thing put up I

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:54.020 
because when they get the thing put up I
want<00:05:51.630> to<00:05:51.690> twist<00:05:51.900> this<00:05:52.130> and<00:05:53.130> also<00:05:53.490> as<00:05:53.639> it<00:05:53.880> goes

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
want to twist this and also as it goes

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.180 
want to twist this and also as it goes
up<00:05:54.240> it<00:05:55.050> will<00:05:55.199> naturally<00:05:55.289> probably<00:05:55.860> twist<00:05:56.069> a

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
up it will naturally probably twist a

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.469 
up it will naturally probably twist a
little<00:05:56.220> bit<00:05:56.550> and<00:05:56.759> it's<00:05:56.970> better<00:05:57.150> not<00:05:57.300> to<00:05:57.360> have

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
little bit and it's better not to have

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.480 
little bit and it's better not to have
opposition<00:05:57.930> by<00:05:58.289> having<00:05:58.590> that<00:05:58.710> type<00:05:58.949> tightened

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
opposition by having that type tightened

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.760 
opposition by having that type tightened
already<00:05:59.960> but<00:06:00.960> once<00:06:01.139> it's<00:06:01.289> up<00:06:01.409> you<00:06:01.530> can<00:06:01.680> go

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
already but once it's up you can go

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.200 
already but once it's up you can go
ahead<00:06:01.830> and<00:06:01.949> tighten<00:06:02.069> it<00:06:02.430> and<00:06:02.550> you<00:06:02.940> will<00:06:03.120> be

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
ahead and tighten it and you will be

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.810 
ahead and tighten it and you will be
done<00:06:04.400> all<00:06:05.400> this<00:06:05.610> helps<00:06:07.159> as<00:06:08.159> you<00:06:08.280> can<00:06:08.400> see<00:06:08.580> i

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
done all this helps as you can see i

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.930 
done all this helps as you can see i
partially<00:06:09.270> collapse<00:06:09.870> the<00:06:10.800> legs<00:06:11.039> on<00:06:11.400> the<00:06:11.669> truss

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
partially collapse the legs on the truss

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.689 
partially collapse the legs on the truss
already<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:13.259> i'll<00:06:13.349> show<00:06:13.409> you<00:06:13.590> how<00:06:13.710> i<00:06:13.889> went

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 
already and i'll show you how i went

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:27.500 
already and i'll show you how i went
into<00:06:14.789> on<00:06:15.000> my<00:06:15.150> own

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.140 

of<00:06:27.960> course<00:06:28.200> is<00:06:28.380> pretty<00:06:28.830> short<00:06:29.070> right<00:06:29.280> now<00:06:29.310> but

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
of course is pretty short right now but

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.750 
of course is pretty short right now but
if<00:06:30.240> I<00:06:30.330> had<00:06:30.450> to<00:06:30.680> if<00:06:31.680> I<00:06:31.740> had<00:06:31.890> the<00:06:31.980> stands<00:06:32.220> extended

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
if I had to if I had the stands extended

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.610 
if I had to if I had the stands extended
tire<00:06:33.000> I<00:06:33.330> would<00:06:33.540> just<00:06:33.570> have<00:06:34.110> to<00:06:34.230> reach<00:06:34.380> up<00:06:34.590> and

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
tire I would just have to reach up and

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.310 
tire I would just have to reach up and
grab<00:06:34.830> it<00:06:35.010> and<00:06:35.220> be<00:06:36.030> the<00:06:36.120> same<00:06:36.360> processes<00:06:37.020> it's

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
grab it and be the same processes it's

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.660 
grab it and be the same processes it's
really<00:06:37.590> easy<00:06:37.830> and<00:06:38.120> quick<00:06:39.120> to<00:06:39.150> do<00:06:39.330> it<00:06:39.390> that<00:06:39.510> way
