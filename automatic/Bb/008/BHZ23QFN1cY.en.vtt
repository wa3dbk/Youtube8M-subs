that won't come to the UK until next
year<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:51.800> I<00:00:51.890> think<00:00:52.039> the<00:00:52.190> order<00:00:52.399> book<00:00:52.489> opens<00:00:52.910> in

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
year and I think the order book opens in

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.599 
year and I think the order book opens in
November<00:00:53.620> ok<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:54.680> that's<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:54.949> range<00:00:55.190> covered

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
November ok so that's the range covered

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.580 
November ok so that's the range covered
so<00:00:56.030> what's<00:00:56.210> our<00:00:56.329> first<00:00:56.390> impression<00:00:57.109> well<00:00:57.350> this

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
so what's our first impression well this

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.500 
so what's our first impression well this
is<00:00:57.739> an<00:00:57.829> s-line<00:00:58.100> model<00:00:58.609> so<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:59.210> exterior

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
is an s-line model so the exterior

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.139 
is an s-line model so the exterior
styling<00:00:59.899> is<00:01:00.109> a<00:01:00.140> little<00:01:00.410> bit<00:01:00.500> more<00:01:00.649> racy<00:01:01.149> and

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
styling is a little bit more racy and

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.670 
styling is a little bit more racy and
when<00:01:02.570> it<00:01:02.690> comes<00:01:02.840> to<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.109> styling<00:01:03.469> it's<00:01:03.620> the

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
when it comes to the styling it's the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.380 
when it comes to the styling it's the
unquestioning<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.460> obviously<00:01:04.880> this<00:01:05.060> car<00:01:05.270> is

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
unquestioning and obviously this car is

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.510 
unquestioning and obviously this car is
a<00:01:05.420> TT<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.080> it's<00:01:06.230> very<00:01:06.350> much<00:01:06.650> an<00:01:06.800> evolutionary

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
a TT so it's very much an evolutionary

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.310 
a TT so it's very much an evolutionary
step<00:01:08.060> in<00:01:08.270> terms<00:01:08.480> of<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.660> exterior<00:01:09.080> styling

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
step in terms of the exterior styling

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.320 
step in terms of the exterior styling
much<00:01:09.950> like<00:01:10.160> the<00:01:10.310> mini<00:01:10.520> or<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:10.880> Porsche<00:01:11.150> 911

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
much like the mini or the Porsche 911

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.930 
much like the mini or the Porsche 911
the<00:01:12.050> TT<00:01:12.950> now<00:01:13.160> seems<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:13.460> be<00:01:13.520> a<00:01:13.580> car<00:01:13.760> that<00:01:13.910> just

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
the TT now seems to be a car that just

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.400 
the TT now seems to be a car that just
gently<00:01:14.360> evolves<00:01:14.810> leaving<00:01:15.140> that<00:01:15.230> very

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
gently evolves leaving that very

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.040 
gently evolves leaving that very
familiar<00:01:15.830> TT<00:01:16.190> look<00:01:16.430> but<00:01:17.180> if<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:17.420> are<00:01:17.570> slightly

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730

crystal<00:01:41.150> clear<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:41.750> can<00:01:41.900> change<00:01:42.260> there<00:01:42.800> the

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
crystal clear you can change there the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.220 
crystal clear you can change there the
type<00:01:44.000> of<00:01:44.180> view<00:01:44.330> you<00:01:44.510> have<00:01:44.690> you<00:01:44.870> can<00:01:44.990> have<00:01:45.110> the

with the Sat Nav or the trip information

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.470 
with the Sat Nav or the trip information
the<00:01:48.440> middle<00:01:48.680> quite<00:01:48.860> small<00:01:49.160> or<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:50.030> can<00:01:50.180> go<00:01:50.330> and

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
the middle quite small or you can go and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.600 
the middle quite small or you can go and
have<00:01:50.570> a<00:01:50.600> much<00:01:50.900> much<00:01:51.110> bigger<00:01:51.290> mapping<00:01:51.830> and<00:01:52.280> if

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
have a much much bigger mapping and if

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.250 
have a much much bigger mapping and if
you<00:01:52.730> switch<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.270> audio<00:01:53.690> or<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.140> the

you switch to the audio or to the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.140 
you switch to the audio or to the
telephone<00:01:54.710> only<00:01:54.950> those<00:01:55.100> functions<00:01:55.340> may

screens around the car and
really<00:01:59.630> clever<00:01:59.810> is<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.080> can<00:02:00.200> control<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.620> by

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
really clever is you can control it by

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.950 
really clever is you can control it by
the<00:02:00.799> latest<00:02:01.159> MMI<00:02:01.520> controller<00:02:01.909> down<00:02:02.090> here<00:02:02.390> but

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
the latest MMI controller down here but

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.330 
the latest MMI controller down here but
everything<00:02:03.350> can<00:02:03.500> also<00:02:03.650> be<00:02:03.920> controlled<00:02:04.190> by

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
everything can also be controlled by

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.920 
everything can also be controlled by
this<00:02:04.400> fantastic<00:02:05.150> Stu<00:02:05.299> multifunction

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
this fantastic Stu multifunction

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.290 
this fantastic Stu multifunction
steering<00:02:06.020> wheel<00:02:06.409> so<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.070> cockpit<00:02:07.550> is<00:02:07.729> really

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
steering wheel so the cockpit is really

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.760 
steering wheel so the cockpit is really
really<00:02:08.539> spectacular<00:02:08.810> as<00:02:09.200> you'd<00:02:09.319> expect<00:02:09.649> all

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
really spectacular as you'd expect all

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.710 
really spectacular as you'd expect all
the<00:02:09.890> materials<00:02:10.429> are<00:02:10.520> fantastic<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.360> there's

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
the materials are fantastic and there's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.780 
the materials are fantastic and there's
lots<00:02:11.959> of<00:02:12.110> really<00:02:12.350> nice<00:02:12.680> touches<00:02:12.950> like<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.400> air

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
lots of really nice touches like the air

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.850 
lots of really nice touches like the air
the<00:02:14.180> air<00:02:14.480> vents<00:02:14.840> I've<00:02:14.959> got<00:02:15.080> like<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.230> jet<00:02:15.680> engine

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
the air vents I've got like a jet engine

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.100 
the air vents I've got like a jet engine
turbine<00:02:16.459> affecting<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.060> in<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.569> vents<00:02:17.930> and

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
turbine affecting the in the vents and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.870 
turbine affecting the in the vents and
then<00:02:18.620> actual<00:02:19.160> controller<00:02:19.580> for<00:02:19.819> the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
then actual controller for the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.190 
then actual controller for the
temperature<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.510> vents<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.989> little

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
temperature and the vents and the little

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.690 
temperature and the vents and the little
digital<00:02:21.319> displays<00:02:21.950> in<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.250> middle<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.610> the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
digital displays in the middle of the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.670 
digital displays in the middle of the
vent<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.540> it's<00:02:23.690> really<00:02:23.959> nice<00:02:24.200> everything<00:02:24.590> you

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
vent so it's really nice everything you

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.620 
vent so it's really nice everything you
touch<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:25.310> top<00:02:25.790> quality<00:02:25.940> there's<00:02:26.330> lots<00:02:26.510> of

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
touch is top quality there's lots of

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.199 
touch is top quality there's lots of
nice<00:02:26.780> inlays<00:02:27.350> really<00:02:28.130> nice<00:02:28.310> feel<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.850> all<00:02:29.060> the

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
nice inlays really nice feel to all the

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.850 
nice inlays really nice feel to all the
switchgear<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.230> steering<00:02:30.650> wheel<00:02:30.770> and

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
switchgear and the steering wheel and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.040 
switchgear and the steering wheel and
the<00:02:30.950> gear<00:02:31.100> leaver<00:02:31.310> are<00:02:31.670> really<00:02:32.480> really<00:02:32.900> nice

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
the gear leaver are really really nice

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.360 
the gear leaver are really really nice
so<00:02:35.290> what's<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.380> like<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.709> drive<00:02:36.739> that's<00:02:37.250> the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
so what's it like to drive that's the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.920 
so what's it like to drive that's the
first<00:02:37.580> question<00:02:37.760> well<00:02:38.209> if<00:02:38.360> we<00:02:38.480> start<00:02:38.750> from<00:02:38.810> the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
first question well if we start from the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.380 
first question well if we start from the
ground<00:02:39.050> up<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.800> new<00:02:39.920> TT<00:02:40.280> is<00:02:40.340> based<00:02:40.640> on<00:02:40.880> three<00:02:41.090> W

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
ground up the new TT is based on three W

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.150 
ground up the new TT is based on three W
groups<00:02:41.600> MQB<00:02:42.170> platform<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:42.890> that's<00:02:43.070> the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
groups MQB platform so that's the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.770 
groups MQB platform so that's the
platform<00:02:43.340> used<00:02:43.700> by<00:02:43.850> cars<00:02:44.120> like<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.450> Audi<00:02:44.480> a3

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
platform used by cars like the Audi a3

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.860 
platform used by cars like the Audi a3
the<00:02:45.560> VW<00:02:46.010> Golf<00:02:46.160> so<00:02:46.790> it's<00:02:46.880> also<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.120> pretty<00:02:47.330> good

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
the VW Golf so it's also a pretty good

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.900 
the VW Golf so it's also a pretty good
starting<00:02:48.350> point<00:02:48.620> but<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:49.220> still<00:02:49.400> retains<00:02:49.760> that

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
starting point but it still retains that

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.449 
starting point but it still retains that
unique<00:02:50.269> TT<00:02:50.900> LD<00:02:51.350> space<00:02:51.620> frame<00:02:51.860> technology<00:02:52.340> so

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
unique TT LD space frame technology so

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.340 
unique TT LD space frame technology so
you've<00:02:52.580> got<00:02:52.670> steel<00:02:53.090> use<00:02:53.390> low<00:02:53.690> down<00:02:53.900> in<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.140> car

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
you've got steel use low down in the car

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.620 
you've got steel use low down in the car
but<00:02:54.890> higher<00:02:55.100> up<00:02:55.310> in<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.519> car<00:02:55.700> most<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.570> the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
but higher up in the car most of the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.270 
but higher up in the car most of the
material<00:02:56.989> is<00:02:57.080> aluminium<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:57.800> it<00:02:57.920> has<00:02:58.069> quite

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
material is aluminium so it has quite

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.190 
material is aluminium so it has quite
light<00:02:58.640> it's<00:02:58.880> 50<00:02:59.269> kilograms<00:02:59.660> lighter<00:02:59.840> than<00:03:00.110> the

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
light it's 50 kilograms lighter than the

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.259 
light it's 50 kilograms lighter than the
outgoing<00:03:00.319> car<00:03:00.790> 25<00:03:01.790> percent<00:03:02.060> stiffer

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
outgoing car 25 percent stiffer

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.120 
outgoing car 25 percent stiffer
torsional<00:03:02.810> rigidity<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.769> centre<00:03:04.070> of

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
torsional rigidity and the centre of

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.400 
torsional rigidity and the centre of
gravity<00:03:04.190> is<00:03:04.519> are<00:03:04.670> centimeter<00:03:05.180> lower<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:06.260> as

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
gravity is are centimeter lower so as

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.110 
gravity is are centimeter lower so as
you<00:03:06.530> can<00:03:06.650> expect<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:07.130> means<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.610> car<00:03:07.820> is

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
you can expect that means the car is

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.940 
you can expect that means the car is
quite<00:03:08.690> impressive<00:03:09.110> when<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.500> get<00:03:09.709> into<00:03:09.920> a

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
quite impressive when you get into a

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.890 
quite impressive when you get into a
corner<00:03:10.269> I'll<00:03:11.269> see<00:03:11.420> this<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.630> a<00:03:11.690> front<00:03:11.870> wheel

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
corner I'll see this is a front wheel

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.190 
corner I'll see this is a front wheel
drive<00:03:12.019> version<00:03:12.380> so<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:14.209> does<00:03:14.420> feel<00:03:14.690> very<00:03:15.079> much

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
drive version so it does feel very much

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.560 
drive version so it does feel very much
like<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.500> hot<00:03:16.190> hatch<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.700> not<00:03:16.820> in<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:17.000> bad<00:03:17.180> way<00:03:17.390> it

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
like a hot hatch and not in a bad way it

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.710 
like a hot hatch and not in a bad way it
has<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:17.810> sort<00:03:18.019> of<00:03:18.110> sharp<00:03:18.440> pointy<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:20.299> sort<00:03:20.690> of

has that sort of sharp pointy it sort of

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.509 
has that sort of sharp pointy it sort of
engaging<00:03:21.049> nature<00:03:21.709> that<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:21.980> find<00:03:22.220> in<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.370> good

how<00:03:26.090> do<00:03:26.150> you've<00:03:26.360> got<00:03:26.510> progressive<00:03:27.140> steering

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
how do you've got progressive steering

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.259 
how do you've got progressive steering
system<00:03:27.829> on<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.010> TT<00:03:28.340> which<00:03:28.489> means<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.880> ratio

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
system on the TT which means the ratio

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.110 
system on the TT which means the ratio
changes<00:03:29.870> as<00:03:30.079> you<00:03:31.010> apply<00:03:31.250> more<00:03:31.519> or<00:03:31.700> less<00:03:31.850> lock

changes as you apply more or less lock
it<00:03:32.660> does<00:03:32.870> give<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.230> car<00:03:33.410> very<00:03:33.739> very<00:03:34.130> sharp

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
it does give the car very very sharp

very pointed quite accurate steering
it's<00:03:38.150> quite<00:03:38.329> light<00:03:38.540> but<00:03:38.570> it's<00:03:38.959> nicely

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
it's quite light but it's nicely

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.080 
it's quite light but it's nicely
weighted<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:40.130> really<00:03:40.459> does<00:03:40.610> give<00:03:40.790> you<00:03:40.820> plenty

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
quite low grip so with the front-wheel

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.479 
quite low grip so with the front-wheel
drive<00:03:46.820> you've<00:03:47.299> got<00:03:47.980> row<00:03:48.980> emphasis<00:03:49.370> on

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489

drive you've got row emphasis on
traction<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.000> actually<00:03:50.239> it's<00:03:50.329> not<00:03:50.359> that<00:03:50.480> bad

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
traction and actually it's not that bad

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.509

given<00:03:51.200> how<00:03:51.260> low<00:03:51.410> bit<00:03:51.590> these<00:03:51.709> surfaces<00:03:52.100> are<00:03:52.280> so

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
given how low bit these surfaces are so

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.160 
given how low bit these surfaces are so
the<00:03:52.910> tragic<00:03:53.209> control<00:03:53.480> works<00:03:53.720> very<00:03:53.930> very

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
the tragic control works very very

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.990 
the tragic control works very very
smoothly<00:03:54.500> there<00:03:55.190> is<00:03:55.340> an<00:03:55.489> electronic

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
smoothly there is an electronic

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.699 
smoothly there is an electronic
differential<00:03:56.390> as<00:03:56.600> well<00:03:56.810> so<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.650> car<00:03:58.540> overall

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
differential as well so the car overall

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.229 
differential as well so the car overall
really<00:04:00.709> nice<00:04:01.070> the<00:04:01.400> drivers<00:04:01.820> of<00:04:01.970> these<00:04:02.090> are

really nice the drivers of these are

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:02.780 
really nice the drivers of these are
pretty

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
pretty

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.789

big<00:04:03.420> step<00:04:03.689> forward<00:04:04.019> from<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.260> old<00:04:04.379> cards<00:04:04.709> it

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
big step forward from the old cards it

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.149 
big step forward from the old cards it
feels<00:04:05.360> more<00:04:06.360> agile<00:04:06.810> lighter<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.950> rear

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
feels more agile lighter and the rear

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.860 
feels more agile lighter and the rear
end<00:04:08.340> feels<00:04:08.610> livelier<00:04:09.120> as<00:04:09.239> well<00:04:09.420> just<00:04:09.569> it<00:04:09.689> just

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
end feels livelier as well just it just

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.449 
end feels livelier as well just it just
feels<00:04:10.110> a<00:04:10.260> bit<00:04:10.349> more<00:04:10.409> alive<00:04:10.769> than<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:11.040> old<00:04:11.250> car

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
feels a bit more alive than the old car

which<00:04:12.030> is<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.209> good<00:04:12.390> thing<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.780> six-speed

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
which is a good thing the six-speed

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
manual gearbox is really nice exhaust

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.969 
manual gearbox is really nice exhaust
now<00:04:15.030> as<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.209> said<00:04:15.360> it's<00:04:15.510> good<00:04:15.689> and<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.680> engine

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
now as I said it's good and the engine

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.680 
now as I said it's good and the engine
it<00:04:17.220> was<00:04:17.310> really<00:04:17.609> good<00:04:17.760> punchy<00:04:18.180> performance

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
it was really good punchy performance

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.659 
it was really good punchy performance
same<00:04:18.870> as<00:04:18.959> it<00:04:19.079> does<00:04:19.169> in<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:20.070> other<00:04:20.100> places<00:04:20.430> that

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
same as it does in the other places that

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.279 
same as it does in the other places that
is<00:04:20.789> used<00:04:21.000> like<00:04:21.239> in<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.449> Golf<00:04:21.630> GTI<00:04:21.959> too

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289

experience<00:04:26.310> but<00:04:26.490> like<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:26.760> TT<00:04:27.060> has<00:04:27.150> always

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330

than<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.870> outgoing<00:04:49.020> car<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:54.270> what's<00:04:54.449> our

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
than the outgoing car so what's our

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.689 
than the outgoing car so what's our
first<00:04:54.780> impression<00:04:55.289> of<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.410> new<00:04:55.590> TT<00:04:55.979> well<00:04:56.400> I've

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
first impression of the new TT well I've

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.400 
first impression of the new TT well I've
only<00:04:56.850> driven<00:04:57.000> it<00:04:57.210> briefly<00:04:57.539> but<00:04:57.990> I'm<00:04:58.080> itching

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
only driven it briefly but I'm itching

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.600 
only driven it briefly but I'm itching
to<00:04:58.440> drive<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:58.800> some<00:04:58.979> more<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.430> that's

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
to drive it some more and that's

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.370 
to drive it some more and that's
certainly<00:04:59.850> a<00:05:00.030> good<00:05:00.090> sign<00:05:00.479> this<00:05:00.960> car<00:05:01.229> does

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
certainly a good sign this car does

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.110 
certainly a good sign this car does
everything<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.800> old<00:05:01.979> car<00:05:02.280> did<00:05:02.490> just<00:05:03.030> that

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
everything the old car did just that

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.790 
everything the old car did just that

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
little bit better the boots are

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.370 
little bit better the boots are
fracturing<00:05:05.130> bigger<00:05:05.419> but<00:05:06.419> it<00:05:06.539> handles<00:05:06.750> sharper

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
fracturing bigger but it handles sharper

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.290 
fracturing bigger but it handles sharper
it's<00:05:07.919> got<00:05:08.070> more<00:05:08.190> performance<00:05:08.760> it's<00:05:09.000> cleaner

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
it's got more performance it's cleaner

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.330 
it's got more performance it's cleaner

than ever before and it rides better

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.980 
than ever before and it rides better
than<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.669> old<00:05:11.820> car<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.240> thanks<00:05:12.780> for<00:05:12.870> that
