even need to look at the instructions to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.490 
even need to look at the instructions to
figure<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.150> out<00:01:26.869> and<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.080> dump<00:01:28.320> those

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500

we<00:01:32.729> got<00:01:32.850> ourselves<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.299> crate<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.549> got<00:01:35.700> some

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
we got ourselves a crate and we got some

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.760 
we got ourselves a crate and we got some
flames<00:01:37.520> going<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.579> peg<00:01:38.729> those<00:01:38.909> into<00:01:39.090> place<00:01:39.770> if

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
flames going to peg those into place if

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.410 
flames going to peg those into place if
you<00:01:40.979> had<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.549> really<00:01:42.030> cool<00:01:42.710> lego<00:01:43.710> reindeer<00:01:44.700> you

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
you had a really cool lego reindeer you

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.670 
you had a really cool lego reindeer you
could<00:01:45.600> give<00:01:45.750> him<00:01:45.899> fire<00:01:46.500> antlers<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:48.680> think

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
could give him fire antlers I think

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.950 
could give him fire antlers I think
that'd<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.890> kind<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.100> neat<00:01:50.750> they<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:51.899> look

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that'd be kind of neat they don't look

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.560 
that'd be kind of neat they don't look
like<00:01:52.020> they<00:01:52.320> hague<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.490> they<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.850> kind<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.119> sit

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
like they hague in they just kind of sit

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.690 
like they hague in they just kind of sit
inside<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.170> crate<00:01:55.619> do<00:01:55.950> they<00:01:56.070> even<00:01:56.159> sit<00:01:56.460> inside

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
inside the crate do they even sit inside

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.880 
inside the crate do they even sit inside
the<00:01:56.850> crate<00:01:57.090> where's<00:01:57.420> no<00:01:58.409> they<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.590> kind<00:01:58.829> of

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the crate where's no they just kind of

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.429 
the crate where's no they just kind of
sit<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.250> their<00:01:59.430> own<00:01:59.579> you<00:02:00.540> got<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> crate<00:02:01.110> and

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
sit on their own you got a crate and

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.280 
sit on their own you got a crate and
then<00:02:02.430> you've<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.820> got<00:02:03.000> flames<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.960> that

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
then you've just got flames like that

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.959 
then you've just got flames like that
that's<00:02:04.860> pretty<00:02:05.189> much<00:02:05.310> what<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> picture<00:02:05.820> is

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
that's pretty much what the picture is

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.690 
that's pretty much what the picture is
showing<00:02:07.160> maybe<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.340> one<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.550> those<00:02:08.640> things

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
showing maybe it's one of those things

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.369 
showing maybe it's one of those things
that<00:02:08.970> won't<00:02:09.119> make<00:02:09.300> sense<00:02:09.360> now<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:09.840> it'll<00:02:10.259> make

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
that won't make sense now but it'll make

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.850 
that won't make sense now but it'll make
sense<00:02:10.410> later<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:11.360> if<00:02:12.360> i<00:02:12.450> only<00:02:12.750> get<00:02:13.080> into<00:02:13.349> my

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
sense later on if i only get into my
