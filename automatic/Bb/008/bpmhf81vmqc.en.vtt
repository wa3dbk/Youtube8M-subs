00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:08.820
 hello everyone if you decide to buy 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.010
 dual shock 4 pda or have already bought something for you 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.190
 two things need to be taken care of 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.820
 this is his first opportunity 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.020
 connect computer and the second is it 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.520
 possibility to charge 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.330
 connect it using 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.460
 bluetooth and are you using a cable and 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.580
 usb-microusb 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.279
 Of course more convenient via bluetooth and second 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.670
 it is an opportunity to charge it 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.320
 it can be using the same usb cable 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:44.610
 microusb either using normal 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:48.090
 AC charger which 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.879
 has a micro usb connector in principle thousands 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.670
 milliamp will be enough 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.829
 it is recommended below that is worth learning 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.500
 that when buying better of course not 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.399
 connect it immediately to charge to give 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.550
 completely his 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.339
 he is discharged by this gempad here and 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.020
 only then put on charge and 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.600
 charge it fully to 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.850
 your battery served more light 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.560
 indicator when charging should at the same time 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.750
 to burn 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.650
 in orange so connect 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.799
 gamepad because you must first connect 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.460
 bluetooth device so click add 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.100
 device 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:34.049
 then on the gamepad, press the combination 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.049
 keys neck and home and start the search 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.190
 our controller is defined as in airless 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.940
 the controller is good click next 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.940
 turn on 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.259
 so close 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.659
 now go to this address 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.980
 and download programs from here 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.730
 install it here we can choose what 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.030
 we don't have and if you do n't have anything 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.489
 can click download dota download well 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.030
 I have it so I will leave only 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.319
 x-box 360 drivers 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.230
 it should be noted that it is not necessary separately 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.970
 download and download everything at once 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.250
 so put a tick you will be here 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.950
 it is written yes well and I just have 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:51.940
 downloaded it remains only to install 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.940
 click next install 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.590
 how to install the driver now we will 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.590
 install the program 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.640
 click agree to install 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.650
 Finch now we have here now 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.650
 shortcut run the program 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.520
 so we see what we have connected 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:41.480
 our gamepad to disconnect 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:45.610
 need to press a combination of home buttons 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:53.690
 communities and to re-connect it 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:56.209
 press the floor that is, it makes sense to keep 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.250
 gamepad is turned on only when it 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.459
 when you don't need the best 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.360
 connect clear business because it will 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.670
 spend money in the rain 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.430
 let's see what we have is worth 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.560
 pay attention to the pan 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.670
 he we will be about prisoner here I created and 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.810
 you can do it here too 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.680
 settings on 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:26.139
 You can customize the gamepad as you want 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:28.980
 In principle, the most important thing is 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.380
 first it is an opportunity to numb 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.110
 indicator light that gets 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.430
 most but if you don't want 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.920
 connect then you can in different ways 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.260
 tune 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.560
 use different colors see all 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.740
 what it will look like i am not 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.600
 use to just save batteries 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:56.110
 there is also a track from 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:57.510
 which can be done as a replacement for the touchpad 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.400
 on a laptop 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.350
 and it should be noted that the left 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.530
 the mouse button is just a touch on 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.770
 him right click this click on 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.770
 him 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.330
 look further 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:19.400
 the most important thing I recommend to you 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.930
 disable shell shiva loader because 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.270
 what's when the system boots 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.050
 she starts to load his systems 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.870
 much longer it loads in 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.969
 principle not necessary if you want 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.669
 use 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:37.990
 help turn on the projective you don't need 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:41.270
 it just bothers more 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.960
 look further and you can see for yourself 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.169
 what you 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.260
 Settings is the star system 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.030
 and the most important thing is this 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.250
 use exclusive could 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.330
 also worth noting that since our 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.490
 gamepad and melted 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.840
 box 360 who is most igor 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.540
 the vast majority of games 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.830
 supported but still there are not three 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.780
 games for example when sos who can 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.960
 with which problems may arise and 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:14.190
 that just will not work just 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:18.650
 because our system is defined 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.650
 as two gamepads now I'll show you 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.550
 this first cooked controller this 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.430
 just a bluetooth device and the second is 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.670
 the driver we downloaded from 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.130
 the same xbox 360 emulator and here 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:39.960
 let's say so as a dark souls player she 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:42.000
 defines the first controller and it just 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.980
 stupidly does not work because everything 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.520
 control passes to the second stage 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.560
 understanding that's why you should put 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.050
 here is a tick to 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.020
 applications only x-box 360 was detected 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:58.590
 1 pitch of control didnâ€™t determine it 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:02.270
 very useful thing and save you a bunch 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:06.840
 time finding a solution to this problem and 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.550
 everything basically told you 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.320
 everything else you can see for yourself 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.400
 set up all sides and not so 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.300
 categorically 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.300
 good luck to everyone and all good bye
