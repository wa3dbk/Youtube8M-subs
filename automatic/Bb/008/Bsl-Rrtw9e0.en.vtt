right here is a cat 365 seal this is a
six-yard<00:00:04.410> excavator<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.279> do<00:00:05.339> have<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.640> walk

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
six-yard excavator and I do have a walk

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
because it didn't have to stick and lock

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
to drive them that's because they're all

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.290 
to drive them that's because they're all
encased<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.469> here<00:02:07.770> because<00:02:08.399> as<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.149> could

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
and they're right under here it's hard

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.259 
and they're right under here it's hard
to<00:03:22.709> see<00:03:22.890> how<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.070> dirt<00:03:23.430> all<00:03:23.580> over<00:03:23.610> them<00:03:23.910> but

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
to see how the dirt all over them but

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.729 
to see how the dirt all over them but
that's<00:03:24.390> just<00:03:24.690> what<00:03:24.870> holds<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.230> tracks<00:03:25.530> on

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
that's just what holds the tracks on

that's just what holds the tracks on
very<00:03:26.310> rarely<00:03:26.670> will<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.030> see<00:03:27.180> companies<00:03:27.600> take

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
very rarely will you see companies take

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.900 
very rarely will you see companies take
the<00:03:28.350> tracks<00:03:28.650> off<00:03:28.860> on<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.070> machine<00:03:29.400> of<00:03:29.550> this<00:03:29.670> size

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
the tracks off on a machine of this size

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.750 
the tracks off on a machine of this size
but<00:03:30.720> in<00:03:30.840> some<00:03:31.019> states<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.650> companies<00:03:32.370> they<00:03:32.700> do

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
but in some states and companies they do

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.990 
but in some states and companies they do
it<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.709> then<00:03:34.709> your<00:03:35.010> air<00:03:35.160> filter<00:03:35.640> is<00:03:35.820> right

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
it and then your air filter is right

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.640 
it and then your air filter is right
there<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.860> your<00:03:37.860> radiator<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.519> right<00:03:38.760> here

now here's the grapple for the 365

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.060 
now here's the grapple for the 365
I'll<00:03:44.640> get<00:03:44.790> another<00:03:44.880> size<00:03:45.239> comparison<00:03:45.810> for<00:03:45.989> you

right there it's on a six foot grapple
here's<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.800> counterweight<00:03:56.220> for<00:03:56.250> this

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
here's the counterweight for this

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.800 
here's the counterweight for this
machine<00:03:56.700> I<00:03:56.970> really<00:03:57.330> don't<00:03:57.480> know<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.600> weight

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
machine I really don't know the weight

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.830 
machine I really don't know the weight
on<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.019> counterweight<00:03:59.330> to<00:04:00.330> be<00:04:00.420> honest<00:04:00.720> with

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
on the counterweight to be honest with

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.009 
on the counterweight to be honest with
you<00:04:00.959> but<00:04:01.200> those<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.680> counterweight<00:04:02.130> for<00:04:02.160> it

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
you but those the counterweight for it

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.290 
you but those the counterweight for it
and<00:04:04.019> then<00:04:04.950> here's<00:04:05.220> underneath<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.970> machine

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
and then here's underneath the machine

large<00:04:33.040> machine<00:04:33.960> when<00:04:34.960> I<00:04:34.990> first<00:04:35.290> see<00:04:35.470> one<00:04:35.650> I<00:04:35.680> was

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
large machine when I first see one I was

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.320 
large machine when I first see one I was
amazed<00:04:36.130> by<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.340> size<00:04:36.610> of<00:04:36.730> it<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:36.940> be<00:04:37.030> honest

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.890 
with you but like I said as I see these
larger<00:04:39.850> machines<00:04:40.180> I'm<00:04:40.360> really<00:04:40.630> not<00:04:40.780> impressed

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
larger machines I'm really not impressed

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.640 
larger machines I'm really not impressed
by<00:04:41.320> any<00:04:41.500> machine<00:04:41.830> I<00:04:41.950> see<00:04:42.930> but<00:04:43.930> this<00:04:44.200> one<00:04:44.380> I<00:04:44.410> was

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
by any machine I see but this one I was

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.070 
by any machine I see but this one I was
actually<00:04:45.010> very<00:04:45.220> impressed<00:04:45.520> by<00:04:45.910> a<00:04:46.600> lot<00:04:47.050> of

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080

times you'll see these on sewer jobs but

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.670 
times you'll see these on sewer jobs but
the<00:04:49.030> piping<00:04:49.690> that<00:04:49.870> requires<00:04:50.380> it<00:04:50.560> is

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
the piping that requires it is

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.910 
the piping that requires it is
absolutely<00:04:51.070> huge<00:04:51.150> but<00:04:52.150> there<00:04:52.330> you<00:04:52.420> have<00:04:52.600> it
