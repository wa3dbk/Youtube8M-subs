00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.350

 nuclear missile you will see is that this morning 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.760
 I calculated the coordinates of a concert 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.120
 reggaeton and needless to say anything 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.059
 plus 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.010
 I know you'll give it a good launch 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.010
 in 321 and area 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.690

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.240
 calm down shit luckily 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.240
 I know 5 ways to stop the moon 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.940
 What is very easy just 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.070
 leave it to me hey moon , I know what he wants 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.110
 is to destroy this city but before 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.000
 could you destroy a concert of 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.220
 reggaeton that is celebrated in a place not 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.590
 very far but that no what to sell 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.820
 or could have gone to destroy it since it was 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.820
 the eardrums would melt 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.020

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.999
 block the way to the moon 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.270

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.130

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.960
