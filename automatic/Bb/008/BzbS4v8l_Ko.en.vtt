00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 The crumbs of today I am going to talk to you 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.589
 of a new council that they have in 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.660
 youtube or in many tutorials that about 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.190
 that alarte the cart with lemon them 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.889
 I want to warn that this is something very 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.440
 risky that you do not do it unless 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.300
 before doing a test on a lock or 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.430
 an experiment like the one that I did that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.740
 can pull hair out of my brush 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.750
 hair and until the first the experiment 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.849
 before submitting it because sometimes 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.460
 we think that because it's something natural between 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.250
 quotes will not have repercussions of 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.960
 our hair and in the end we give ourselves 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.440
 mind that it would have been better 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.780
 dye that subject it to lemon for example 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.670
 now there are even tutorials that say 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.649
 what shapes of lemon with salt and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.440
 sun methods for an hour other 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.840
 they even put the lemon with oxy people or 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.090
 it is a super dangerous 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.300
 because I'm telling you, maybe it's your 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.830
 hair will do fatal damage then 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.900
 always do the experiment first and 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.460
 the test and also if you are 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.150
 one of the girls who likes to have 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.769
 many visits that is in their tutorials 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.750
 you always have to try to prove yourself 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.420
 same things that I recommend to be the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.369
 people because it's irresponsible 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.770
 give advice just for having visitors or 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.180
 it does not seem to me 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.010
 then there are girls who can be 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.510
 have hair that is too strong and 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.460
 that's why nothing happened to them and 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.770
 that's why they recommend it then it's 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.470
 probably good if that is the case it 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.140
 justifies but in what I tell you that 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.940
 was from agreement to my experiment is not 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.040
 recommended to rinse the hair with 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.460
 lemon because it is very strong then 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.320
 I can clarify a little bit because 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.750
 Nor it is that blonde let leaves you no 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.940
 if it does not clarify a little bit and it's not 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.490
 justifies for the abuse I think 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.820
 that less abuse has the ocs and people 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.250
 in the hair or in the discoloration 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.130
 discoloration then always in the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.870
 experiment as I did, imagine 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.660
 despite my hair my hair is 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.270
 tiny and short despite that I do not 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.310
 I would submit to such strong products worse 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.640
 imagine having hair at 20 Â° 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.950
 damage it like that oceans if you want 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.200
 be blonde and have a blond very very very 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.319
 be strong or 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.560
 and clarify it a lot to your hair there yes it is 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.750
 much better to go where a professional to 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.879
 I want you to color it and I'll paint it for you 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.430
 is spectacular and then have 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.560
 a good diet with vitamins and 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.900
 also use periodically 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.580
 treatments at home like for example 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.980
 what I just put myself that is the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.090
 almond oil with a little bit of 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.700
 mayonnaise is economical is good and you 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.060
 it helps a lot then it can be that one 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.290
 option or also as I tell them to do the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.500
 discoloration 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.599
 always but not abuse or is not 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.159
 paint your hair every 15 do not paint 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.409
 the hair every time not to use 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.780
 products that have not been before 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.840
 tested for example that are very cheap 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.280
 or they are bad so be careful with the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.130
 brands of all 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.319
 and I can also tell you that if you 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.780
 you want to rinse your hair naturally 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.209
 that is with natural products is not going to 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.220
 to be a blond blonde not just him 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.440
 is going to give a golden sparkle and that is 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.500
 that is your purpose an option can be 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.690
 honey and chamomile water 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.630
 or honey with water from 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.300
 camomile in a little boat which has been 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.040
 all your everything in all your hair and what 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.220
 you leave the sun for a quarter of an hour 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.930
 the more often you do it, the better and 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.420
 you are going to have very soft hair very 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.420
 nice because honey is very good for 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.430
 the hair then let's see follows these 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.590
 steps these tips do not believe everything 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.170
 they tell you and you always have experiments 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.290
 do the test before putting in all your 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.420
 because it can be damaged I hope that 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.710
 please, please do not clarify your 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.050
 hair with lemon I ask you please 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.490
 because it's going to hurt you and I know what 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.520
 important that is the hair for a 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.410
