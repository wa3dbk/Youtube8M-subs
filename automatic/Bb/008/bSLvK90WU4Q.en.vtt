00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.840
 hello welcome to our sweet paradise 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.090
 today I'm going to teach you how to make a cake 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.220
 of chocolate and oreo without oven and 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.169
 you will see that he is super happy and this 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.119
 superliga and the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.250
 need for the recipe are the 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.710
 following the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.809
 need for the base are 300 grams of 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.029
 chocolate cookies I'm the rag 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:32.710
 They are the same I like the hot 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.870
 we grab to shred if you have a 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.570
 mincer but if you do not have a 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.910
 You can give her a bag with a glass and 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.920
 they will be equally valuable and we will need 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.899
 I also get our butter 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.109
 melted the big one that I'm going to use 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.899
 for this recipe is a mold of 27 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.429
 centimeters in diameter 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.409
 well after we already have the 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.350
 reality and crushed and the knob 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.840
 melted now in a bowl let's put 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.330
 the cookie 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.330
 and we add the butter 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.290
 Well now with a tongue 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.299
 pastelera will be integrating well 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.520
 the butter with the cookie if not 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.350
 you have a tongue, nothing happens with the 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.180
 help from the hands or with the help of a 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.039
 you can integrate it well 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.530
 let's try to make it with a 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.770
 gauze and then that's when we have 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.899
 to die 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.299
 good loves you think you have seen that 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.950
 to be like a compact mass is time to 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.079
 milk in the mold if you have the mold 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.579
 removable you have to pass it with a 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.530
 little oil or with a little 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.509
 butter is very important because if 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.030
 you do not do it then you can not unmold 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.380
 how well mine is not the case the fear 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.200
 this moldable so I found it 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.649
 then I will directly take the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.649
 cookie 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.790
 when we made the cookie we have to go 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.720
 accommodating the entire mold so that 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.720
 stay the same 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.880
 well now that we have the cookie for 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.500
 all the mold is once put the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.450
 refrigerator you're going to put it in 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.550
 refrigerator while we're going to do 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.290
 the next step the imminent you're going 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.600
 to need they are stuffed with the pie 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.400
 are the next 400 milliliters of 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.490
 cream to ride has to have at 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.950
 less 35% fat 100 grams 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.930
 of condensed milk 100 grams of 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.690
 butter and 400 grams of chocolate 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:26.320
 black 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.320
 in a pot we are going to put the cream 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.650
 we add the butter 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.280
 condensed milk 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.960
 and the chocolate chocolate has to be 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.960
 well chopped 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.569
 nickname asked high let's go integrating 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.670
 all the ingredients you will see that when 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.590
 let's go integrating what will thicken 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.390
 little by little we do not have to stop 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.340
 beat because then the puncher 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.220
 chocolate at the bottom of the pot when 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.410
 you see that everything is well integrated is the 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.420
 time to remove it from the fire and leave it 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.880
 cool down a bit 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.400
 good as you see my mix has already trembled 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.400
 a little is washed out of the mold 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.690

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.000

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.610

 I'm going to put all the cake 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.960
 but if we want it this is 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.790
 optional this is like decoration to me 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.070
 I really like how it looks, so the 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.040

 if you do not have chocolate contrast 16 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.490
