00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
with some very problematic like

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.310

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
did not like that Cinderella ended on a

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.560 
did not like that Cinderella ended on a
big<00:03:21.220> cliffhanger<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:22.030> then<00:03:22.120> her<00:03:22.300> story

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
big cliffhanger and then her story

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.449 
big cliffhanger and then her story
carried<00:03:22.989> on<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:23.530> red<00:03:23.709> riding<00:03:24.070> hood<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:24.430> that

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
carried on in red riding hood so that

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.280 
carried on in red riding hood so that
you<00:03:24.640> only<00:03:24.760> got<00:03:24.940> like<00:03:25.060> half<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.750> book<00:03:25.989> was

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
you only got like half the book was

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.140 
you only got like half the book was
based<00:03:26.470> on<00:03:26.680> Red<00:03:26.890> Riding<00:03:27.100> Hood<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.610> more<00:03:27.970> of

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
based on Red Riding Hood and the more of

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.699 
based on Red Riding Hood and the more of
Cinderella's<00:03:28.630> story<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.170> they<00:03:29.350> did<00:03:29.530> come

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
Cinderella's story and they did come

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.560 
Cinderella's story and they did come
together<00:03:30.010> but<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.340> was<00:03:30.459> very<00:03:30.670> unsatisfying

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
together but it was very unsatisfying

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.880 
together but it was very unsatisfying
but<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:31.900> have<00:03:32.050> heard<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.380> Scott<00:03:32.530> was<00:03:32.739> the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
but I have heard that Scott was the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.290 
but I have heard that Scott was the
weakest<00:03:33.220> of<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.370> series<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:33.850> crest<00:03:34.150> is

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
weakest of the series and that crest is

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.820 
weakest of the series and that crest is
a<00:03:34.330> big<00:03:34.540> improvement<00:03:34.660> which<00:03:35.230> would<00:03:35.440> be<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.590> good

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
a big improvement which would be a good

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.590 
a big improvement which would be a good
thing<00:03:36.010> because<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.730> know<00:03:36.850> what<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.180> is<00:03:37.300> fun

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600
