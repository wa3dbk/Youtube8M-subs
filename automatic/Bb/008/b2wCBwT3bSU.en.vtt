 Silicone talking eventually was 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.790
 It is the conclusion of why we are 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.010
 picked up 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.420
 say but it was held what was possible 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.640
 so because reasonable isil 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.350
 dragged the boulevard that was still cold 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.850
 was nothing of course it means 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.260
 suffering has already been sought with a corpse there it 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.880
 were dragging along and wanted to go 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.060
 hiding in the sand and therefore 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.890
 we eventually arrested 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.600
 fuck bit and were busy eventually 

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.400
 we were allowed to laugh about it that day 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.990
 afterwards of course you know blue 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.810
 Abroad already light what the fuck 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.390
 well had so much bullshit in the end and 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.740
 so I was allowed to leave you and peel you 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.240
 Of course in the hospital once again 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.910
 in comparison to every hospital where he 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.350
 was really what happened to him 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.010
 fuck you to ultimately arrived 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.530
 with you 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.840
 hospital and the two oldest went to 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.040
 toe novel and silver forms and creasing 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.330
 and the entry two oldest of the group 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.730
 and here they finally spoke 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.320
 with thea the daughter of cinna who is lying 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.910
 the say of themselves in a coma 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.800
 boozed that there is just so much love 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.840
 just dripped at once without and 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.280
 without eating anything on that just really 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.120
 was still cold and just no more response 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.040
 art in the body 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.600
 so that is why he was still going cold 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.310
 him yes eventually they started again 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.760
 the third day is the same 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.640

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.670

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.020
 day and days we went we go again 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.370
