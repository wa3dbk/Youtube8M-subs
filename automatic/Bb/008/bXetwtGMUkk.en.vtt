HD version is released now since I've

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.040 
HD version is released now since I've
already<00:00:29.369> tested<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.179> international<00:00:31.019> version

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
already tested the international version

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.729 
already tested the international version

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
and supposedly the HD version won't have

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.250 
and supposedly the HD version won't have
any<00:00:34.890> new<00:00:35.040> content<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.850> see<00:00:36.630> no<00:00:36.780> reason<00:00:36.960> why<00:00:37.140> I

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
any new content I see no reason why I

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.139 
any new content I see no reason why I
couldn't<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:37.770> start<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.340> LP<00:00:38.610> immediately

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
couldn't just start the LP immediately

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.240 
couldn't just start the LP immediately
upon<00:00:39.390> release<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.079> that's<00:00:40.559> what<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.739> plan<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.010> do

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
upon release so that's what I plan to do

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.389 
upon release so that's what I plan to do
one<00:00:42.149> thing<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.600> will<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.230> doing<00:00:43.350> unique<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
one thing that I will be doing unique to

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.569 
one thing that I will be doing unique to
this<00:00:44.489> LP<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.180> doing<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.930> test<00:00:46.289> run<00:00:46.579> concurrent

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
this LP is doing a test run concurrent

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.439 
this LP is doing a test run concurrent
to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.390> LP<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.620> reason<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.399> because<00:00:50.449> even

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
to the LP the reason is because even

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.029 
to the LP the reason is because even
though<00:00:51.600> they<00:00:52.050> say<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:52.860> virtually

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
though they say that it's virtually

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.600 
though they say that it's virtually
identical<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.149> international<00:00:54.870> version<00:00:54.899> I

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
identical to the international version I

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.770 
identical to the international version I
think<00:00:56.610> there's<00:00:56.820> probably<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.449> some

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
think there's probably going to be some

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.260 
think there's probably going to be some
tweaks<00:00:58.140> or<00:00:58.440> bug<00:00:58.680> fixes<00:00:59.280> or<00:00:59.670> maybe<00:01:00.180> even

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
tweaks or bug fixes or maybe even

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.760 
tweaks or bug fixes or maybe even
something<00:01:00.660> new<00:01:00.899> thrown<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.350> there<00:01:01.500> who<00:01:01.620> know

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
something new thrown in there who know

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.609 
something new thrown in there who know
sayin<00:01:02.280> they<00:01:02.579> could<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:03.480> anything<00:01:03.780> maybe<00:01:04.229> try

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
sayin they could do anything maybe try

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.050 
sayin they could do anything maybe try
to<00:01:04.650> surprise<00:01:04.979> us<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.400> something<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.850> don't<00:01:05.909> know

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
to surprise us or something I don't know

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.140 
to surprise us or something I don't know
I<00:01:06.900> figured<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> could<00:01:07.950> probably<00:01:08.729> play

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
I figured that I could probably play

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.480 
I figured that I could probably play
through<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> game<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:10.049> less<00:01:10.650> than<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.950> week<00:01:10.979> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
through the game in less than a week and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.120 
through the game in less than a week and
if<00:01:12.479> there's<00:01:12.689> any<00:01:12.810> significant<00:01:13.409> changes<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> my

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
if there's any significant changes to my

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.580 
if there's any significant changes to my
approach<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.820> game<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.630> probably<00:01:16.259> won't

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
approach to the game it probably won't

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.249 
approach to the game it probably won't
be<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.950> first<00:01:17.159> seven<00:01:17.460> episodes<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.479> I'm

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
be in the first seven episodes so I'm

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.800 
be in the first seven episodes so I'm
not<00:01:19.740> really<00:01:19.950> worried<00:01:20.400> about<00:01:20.490> starting<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> LP

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
not really worried about starting the LP

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.620 
not really worried about starting the LP

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
episodes or whatever by them so I think

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.780 
episodes or whatever by them so I think
that<00:02:25.000> would<00:02:25.180> make<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.390> good<00:02:25.780> transition<00:02:26.350> there

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
that would make a good transition there

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.260

take<00:04:06.490> me<00:04:06.640> that<00:04:06.970> long<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.360> get<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.170> end

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
take me that long to get to the end

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.300 
take me that long to get to the end
until<00:04:08.770> e3<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:10.450> I<00:04:10.930> thought<00:04:11.500> about<00:04:11.800> making<00:04:12.040> a

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
until e3 so I thought about making a

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.300 
until e3 so I thought about making a
fairly<00:04:12.760> small<00:04:12.930> LP<00:04:13.930> that<00:04:14.200> could<00:04:14.410> take<00:04:14.830> me<00:04:15.040> there

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
fairly small LP that could take me there

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.640 
fairly small LP that could take me there
and<00:04:15.580> then<00:04:16.120> figure<00:04:16.870> out<00:04:16.930> what<00:04:17.230> to<00:04:17.350> do<00:04:17.470> from

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
and then figure out what to do from

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.960 
and then figure out what to do from
there<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:19.030> I'd<00:04:19.390> like<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.750> announce<00:04:19.840> my<00:04:20.380> next<00:04:20.680> LP

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
there so I'd like to announce my next LP

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.460 
there so I'd like to announce my next LP
to<00:04:21.970> fallow<00:04:22.240> lunar<00:04:22.720> will<00:04:23.140> be

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
to fallow lunar will be

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.000 
to fallow lunar will be
The<00:04:25.650> Legend<00:04:26.040> of<00:04:26.160> Zelda<00:04:26.430> for<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.060> nes<00:04:27.450> i<00:04:28.010> figure

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
The Legend of Zelda for the nes i figure

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.370 
The Legend of Zelda for the nes i figure
that<00:04:29.040> something<00:04:29.640> i<00:04:29.730> can<00:04:29.880> do<00:04:30.000> with<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.380> minimal

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
that something i can do with a minimal

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.040 
that something i can do with a minimal
amount<00:04:31.440> of<00:04:31.920> preparation<00:04:32.280> i<00:04:32.970> played<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.900> game

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
amount of preparation i played the game

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.500 
amount of preparation i played the game
probably<00:04:34.350> 40<00:04:35.220> times<00:04:35.460> as<00:04:35.670> a<00:04:35.760> kid<00:04:35.790> maybe<00:04:36.300> more

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
probably 40 times as a kid maybe more

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.890 
probably 40 times as a kid maybe more
probably<00:04:37.380> more<00:04:37.850> plus<00:04:38.850> i<00:04:39.030> think<00:04:39.270> it<00:04:39.360> would<00:04:39.450> last

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
probably more plus i think it would last

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.470 
probably more plus i think it would last
me<00:04:40.230> until<00:04:40.350> e3<00:04:40.740> i<00:04:40.980> mean<00:04:41.220> it's<00:04:41.520> a<00:04:41.580> short<00:04:41.850> game<00:04:42.120> but

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
me until e3 i mean it's a short game but

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.330 
me until e3 i mean it's a short game but
well<00:04:42.870> it's<00:04:43.080> not<00:04:43.200> that<00:04:43.260> short<00:04:43.740> especially<00:04:43.860> if<00:04:44.250> i

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
well it's not that short especially if i

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.690 
well it's not that short especially if i
keep<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.670> episodes<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:46.070> 10-12<00:04:47.070> minutes<00:04:47.370> and

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
keep the episodes to 10-12 minutes and

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.870 
keep the episodes to 10-12 minutes and
such<00:04:47.940> so<00:04:48.270> i<00:04:48.480> think<00:04:48.630> that<00:04:48.780> could<00:04:48.990> work<00:04:49.340> now<00:04:50.340> just

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
such so i think that could work now just

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.120 
such so i think that could work now just
so<00:04:50.940> you<00:04:51.000> know<00:04:51.210> as<00:04:51.750> many<00:04:51.990> times<00:04:52.470> I've<00:04:52.770> played

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
so you know as many times I've played

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.170 
so you know as many times I've played
