00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
in this situation it actually worked out

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:53.980 
in this situation it actually worked out
better<00:04:52.280> because<00:04:52.819> now<00:04:53.180> that<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.419> melodic<00:04:53.810> has

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
better because now that the melodic has

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.589 
better because now that the melodic has
a<00:04:54.280> attacking<00:04:55.280> it<00:04:55.580> doesn't<00:04:56.000> have<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.120> tacky<00:04:56.449> move

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:04.909 
move anyone for a thunder wave but he

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:06.730 
move anyone for a thunder wave but he
went<00:06:05.089> for<00:06:05.210> the<00:06:05.240> iron<00:06:05.750> head<00:06:05.990> again<00:06:06.259> I<00:06:06.379> suppose

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
went for the iron head again I suppose

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.589 
went for the iron head again I suppose
so<00:06:07.669> well<00:06:07.819> he<00:06:07.909> probably<00:06:08.150> thought<00:06:08.330> I<00:06:08.389> was<00:06:08.509> gonna

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
so well he probably thought I was gonna

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.089 
so well he probably thought I was gonna
go<00:06:08.719> for<00:06:08.810> the<00:06:08.900> substitute<00:06:09.349> so<00:06:09.650> that's<00:06:09.860> probably

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099 
go for the substitute so that's probably

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:11.700 
go for the substitute so that's probably
why<00:06:10.190> you<00:06:10.250> went<00:06:10.400> for<00:06:10.550> the<00:06:10.639> iron<00:06:10.909> head<00:06:11.060> again<00:06:11.330> but

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
why you went for the iron head again but

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.110 
why you went for the iron head again but
