have other settings too and you know

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.790 
have other settings too and you know
this<00:02:11.090> will<00:02:11.270> make<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.660> higher<00:02:12.050> quality<00:02:12.530> high

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
this will make it higher quality high

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.160 
this will make it higher quality high
quality<00:02:13.220> good<00:02:13.550> quality<00:02:13.780> then<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.870> can<00:02:15.020> have

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
quality good quality then you can have

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.340 
quality good quality then you can have
custom<00:02:15.500> which<00:02:16.070> you<00:02:16.850> know<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.900> can<00:02:18.050> make<00:02:18.170> it

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
custom which you know you can make it

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.490 
custom which you know you can make it
even<00:02:18.500> lower<00:02:18.890> up<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.520> 16<00:02:20.200> now<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.230> wouldn't

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
even lower up to 16 now I wouldn't

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.260 
even lower up to 16 now I wouldn't
really<00:02:21.709> recommend<00:02:21.800> doing<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.550> because<00:02:22.820> you

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
really recommend doing that because you

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.870 
really recommend doing that because you
can<00:02:23.480> lose<00:02:23.840> some<00:02:24.260> quality<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.040> way<00:02:25.220> like

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
can lose some quality that way like

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.960 
can lose some quality that way like
doesn't<00:02:26.510> sounds<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:28.400> know<00:02:28.489> just<00:02:28.670> keep<00:02:28.820> it

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
doesn't sounds so you know just keep it

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:38.979 
doesn't sounds so you know just keep it
on<00:02:29.470> 128<00:02:31.090> now<00:02:32.090> then<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.480> click<00:02:32.690> OK<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:34.540> ok<00:02:37.989> now
