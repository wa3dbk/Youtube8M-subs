00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 the evolution of ferrari f 138 from 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.820
 debut in maranello at the first race 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.160
 here we see the old aileron with i 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.740
 flaps that have been modified with 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.350
 fins near the bulkheads also spoken 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.570
 if here we see the old solution that 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.270
 has been profoundly modified with 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.789
 the introduction of a small slot and it 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.130
 we see now in detail in the part 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.550
 external solution that was not so far 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.740
 no other new single-seater too 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.590
 this little running nolder 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.800
 longitudinally on the snout but the big one 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.890
 novelty is below we see the mouth like 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.410
 that of a shark of a shark that 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.500
 brings air into the area inside the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.300
 frame and then to improve the flow 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.600
 in the lower part of the car 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.059
 let's see now taking the nose off 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.600
 which is formed in the part 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.160
 bottom of the frame and goes to cool 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.910
 inside the control units 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.910
 electronic 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.799
 the discharge area has also been modified 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.930
 greatly lowered we see it now 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.880
 in the passage compared to the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.030
 presentation to improve the effect 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.659
 blowing towards the canal area 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.450
 side of the blowing diffuser that is 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.330
 also improved by the very shape 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.939
 sophisticated brake vents 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.460
 and then the novelty of the faired axle shaft 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.890
 look at that long wing profile that 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.619
 hull is the triangles of the suspension 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.720
 that also taught unpublished 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.780
 solution of the rear wing with 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.689
 these two blow across the full height 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.259
 side diffuser the diffuser 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.390
 has two flaps on the trailing edge but 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.220
 there are other news we see these 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:56.579
 school fins red bull va f 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:01.170
 138 the ferrari has kept the command 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:03.000
 of the drs to the pilot pedal operates it with the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.409
 left foot we see the position 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.899
 inside the fernando single-seater 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.200
 alonso as on all the cars of 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.200
 formula 1 there are only two pedals nothing 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.470
 more for 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.030
 the clutch the left foot is 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.870
 concentrated and locked on the pedal 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.360
 left of the brake and the right foot up 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.670
 next to the accelerator 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.250
 left foot is the position of 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.410
 rest for the foot here was put on 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.450
 command of the drs 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.130
 so the pilot when he comes in full 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.680
 straight and sinks on the pedal 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.230
 accelerator can move the foot 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.269
 left on the drs 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.400
 then when he needs at the bottom of the 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.760
 straight back on the pedal 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.709
 brake lever first the foot from the drs e 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.860
 therefore it can brake with the maximum 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.180
 downforce 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.209
 let's see the effect of the two 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.130
 drs positions here with the flap is 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.650
 closed therefore with maximum downforce 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.810
 then when the flap is activated it rises 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.950
 there is less resistance and more 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.950
 straight line speed
