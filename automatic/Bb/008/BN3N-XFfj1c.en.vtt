00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.240
 a few moments more exciting than good 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.460
 my job is when a person enter 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.680
 through the door of the store with intention 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.699
 to start in the world of cycling but 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.730
 it's exciting but it's a 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.250
 responsibility 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.259
 because hands of mine is that I 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.180
 advise and the bicycle that you carry 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.189
 really against the expectations of 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.470
 the experience that is dear to the most 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.150
 important is to find really what 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.789
 is the style and what is the motivation of 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.470
 that person for that we have in particular 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.510
 is a number of families of 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.059
 bicycles that are focused on 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.860
 different riding styles but when 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.480
 let's buy the first bike is 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.680
 very complicated because the person still 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.750
 it is not even clear what it is that 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.670
 and we want to start 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.770
 investigate and skillful or political what is the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.899
 style the time the terrain for 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.879
 find the right bike he's going to 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.010
 talk about some key points so that 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.510
 we all learn to really value one 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.270
 different so it will benefit us 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.699
 that is something important normally 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.649
 in bicycle stores the 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.560
 strongest or most powerful argument for 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.240
 the sale is the weight the material of the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.190
 frame or the components with which it is 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.420
 armed the bicycle but really that 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.700
 it's how easy for brands of 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.380
 bikes make it stand out hard 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.120
 is what matters between what is not seen 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.700
 all right 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.770
 especially we will be clear that 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.479
 depends on the style of the bicycle 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.180
 geometry of the bicycle has to 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.130
 meet certain characteristics but in 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.799
 key points on the bike that I 'm going 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.610
 to try to show the first the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.160
 contact points 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.200
 what is the saddle what are the fists 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.210
 are those that give us satisfaction 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.470
 comfort in the first shot or we 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.720
 you can get off the bike 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.940
 immediately above all it happens a lot with 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.290
 women there are two arguments because 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.610
 women say do not ride again 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.380
 bicycle safety and comfort all 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.360
 our bicycles have points of 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.970
 technology contact by geo metri 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.700
 that are really evolved so that 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.750
 Provide comfort avoid injuries and give more 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.220
 performance to the cyclist fists and if 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.200
 then other points come that in a 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.270
 entry level of bicycles is not 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.950
 they stand out a lot but they are the ones that 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.550
 impact the cyclist's benefit 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.390
 first the wheels a good wheels 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.239
 we will control efficiency and trust 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.420
 how do we get good wheels first 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.280
 the quality of the rim shell 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.170
 it must be the best we can to that 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.880
 price level everything in our 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.099
 bikes from the price level 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.840
 entrance bring the tires with what 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.209
 we call ourselves a pp and the number of 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.130
 euros per inch of a high level and 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.870
 that the final is what it says if the tire 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.150
 It is of good quality or it is of low quality 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.950
 the engraving of the tires of our 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.750
 Entry- level bicycles have 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.060
 exactly the same engraving that 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.830
 our top bikes online xbox or 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.350
 with which Christ competes evictions 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.390
 or kulhavy world championships of 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.060
 the tires we know it's clear that 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.280
 have good good performance according to 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.590
 experience but like the complete wheel 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.140
 strong wheels with wheels on 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.370
 him to go resistant 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.830
 the relationships of changes 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.140
 superimportant we also can not 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.000
 pretend that a bicycle appears to be 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.160
 a mountain offer when the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.780
 feel the changes where the merger is 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.790
 a discreet slow because it's not 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.740
 efficient is also for a lot of 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.020
 emphasis on the quality of relationships 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.000
 of the changes one of the details 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.280
 interesting that we rarely present 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.170
 is that on a bicycle level of 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.540
 entrance people are not the most 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.880
 judgments in periodic maintenance and 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.020
 we also take into account that 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.140
 our entry level bicycles 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.910
 They want the person not to be very 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.800
 judgments in the maintenance process 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.110
 of the bicycle stay working 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.000
 as large as possible in good conditions 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.500
 one of the interesting details is that 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.850
 for example on this bicycle which is a 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.040
 pitcher 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.110
 the bicycle mind entrance to the world 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.020
 of the mountain come with the covers of 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.820
 full changes from the lever 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.100
 from the change to the tensor part what 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:01.340
 which prevents water from the mud by 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.340
 much more time 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.740
 then summarizing the most points 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.150
 important is the bicycle set for 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.140
 the experience that we really 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.600
 we pretend or want later points of 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.299
 Contact 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.889
 good saddle 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.840
 Then comes the quality of the tires 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.789
 and the last thing really are the 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.680
 components because a component is something 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.620
 that can be removed can be put or not 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.939
 is going to really have a unit impact 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.529
 we do not have so much in the number of 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:33.240
 evictions that bring the bicycle that 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:35.669
 that is another moment that today 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.499
 sellers highlight a lot 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.930
 believe me that no bicycles that have 7 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:42.810
 millions back and 3 plates 21 speeds 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.090
 it's enough to shoot at any 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.539
 type of terrain but what it is 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.270
 important is the geometry points of 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.669
 contact the tires and the quality in 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.110
 general in addition to that 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.210
 I recommend asking what is behind 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.950
 of the product that make you forget the 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.770
 after-sales service 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.810
 The guarantee guarantee of which quantity 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.540
 the components if that guarantee has a 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.370
 cost or how efficient is some 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.040
 services offered brands 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.320
 replacement for theft especially if 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.850
 We have two years at no cost but 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.710
 we have something that is much more powerful 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.960
 We are convinced that our 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.720
 bicycles is the best option by value 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.520
 how much do I pay when they are giving me 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.800
 we offer a satisfaction service 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.600
 Guaranteed the person who buys a 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.600
 Special bicycle can use it 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.610
 for 15 days and without giving any 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.980
 explanation is in accordance with the 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.750
 bicycle in purchase can reach the 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.150
 store and ask for a money back 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.560
 or that the rent 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.420
 because we are sure that our 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.410
 advisers do the best job so that 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.410
 you have the best experience
