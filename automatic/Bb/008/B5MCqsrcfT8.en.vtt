00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.050 
need really personally I like to a
little<00:02:39.819> bit<00:02:40.030> more<00:02:40.209> control<00:02:40.720> over<00:02:41.670> my<00:02:42.670> brushes

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
little bit more control over my brushes

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.380 
little bit more control over my brushes
a<00:02:43.299> fine<00:02:43.659> this<00:02:44.409> a<00:02:44.769> little<00:02:45.069> bit<00:02:45.459> difficult<00:02:45.790> to

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
a fine this a little bit difficult to

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.080 
a fine this a little bit difficult to
control<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.409> pressure<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:48.069> but<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.939> know<00:02:49.060> I

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
control the pressure on but you know I

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.530 
control the pressure on but you know I
guess<00:02:49.359> with<00:02:50.319> practice<00:02:50.889> you<00:02:51.129> know<00:02:51.280> it's<00:02:51.540> could

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
guess with practice you know it's could

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.629 
guess with practice you know it's could
be<00:02:52.659> just<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.930> thing

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
be just the thing

00:02:53.639 --> 00:03:03.050 
be just the thing
anyway<00:02:54.639> let's<00:02:54.790> just<00:02:54.939> get<00:02:55.090> rid<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.299> those

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.120 

you
