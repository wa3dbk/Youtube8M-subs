00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.300 

let's<00:00:00.690> look<00:00:00.840> at<00:00:00.930> health<00:00:01.170> care<00:00:01.230> providers<00:00:01.860> who

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
let's look at health care providers who

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.490 
let's look at health care providers who
dramatically<00:00:03.060> improve<00:00:03.540> their<00:00:03.840> ability<00:00:04.290> to

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
dramatically improve their ability to

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.860 
dramatically improve their ability to
deliver<00:00:04.950> care<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.400> patients<00:00:05.640> by<00:00:06.390> creating<00:00:06.750> an

ever more coherent well integrated
system<00:00:09.510> based<00:00:10.320> on<00:00:10.530> their<00:00:10.679> ability<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.130> see

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
system based on their ability to see

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.190 
system based on their ability to see
problems<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.300> delivery<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.750> care<00:00:12.960> and

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
problems in the delivery of care and

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.640 
problems in the delivery of care and
improve<00:00:13.769> upon<00:00:14.070> those<00:00:14.420> situations<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.630> do<00:00:16.320> so

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
improve upon those situations and do so

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.230 
improve upon those situations and do so
because<00:00:16.890> they<00:00:17.100> had<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> reliable<00:00:17.580> way<00:00:17.970> of

because they had a reliable way of

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.269 
because they had a reliable way of
escalating<00:00:18.660> problems<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> successful

what's called the femoral placement this

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.030 
what's called the femoral placement this
gives<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> straight<00:02:37.230> shot<00:02:37.470> up<00:02:37.740> through<00:02:37.890> the
