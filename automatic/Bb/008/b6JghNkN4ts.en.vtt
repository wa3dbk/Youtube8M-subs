00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
is going to be hid and then you just

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.279 
is going to be hid and then you just
want<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.120> clip<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.570> place<00:00:50.539> next<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:51.989> just

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
want to clip it in place next with just

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
and after I curled each section I just

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.849 
and after I curled each section I just
pinned<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.480> allow<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.199> cool<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> get

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
pinned it up and allow it to cool to get

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.670 
pinned it up and allow it to cool to get
a<00:01:01.920> bouncy<00:01:02.520> curl<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:04.080> did<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.409> all

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:31.440 

I<00:01:29.280> dentists<00:01:30.280> waited<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.760> few<00:01:30.880> minutes<00:01:31.240> for<00:01:31.420> the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
I dentists waited a few minutes for the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.719 
I dentists waited a few minutes for the
curls<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.840> cool<00:01:32.110> down<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:32.680> then<00:01:33.130> I<00:01:33.460> began

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
curls to cool down and then I began

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.900 
curls to cool down and then I began
taking<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.450> mesh<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:36.340> just<00:01:36.580> took<00:01:36.729> the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
taking the mesh and I just took the

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.870 
taking the mesh and I just took the
bottom<00:01:37.240> section<00:01:37.630> out<00:01:38.050> first<00:01:38.080> and<00:01:38.710> I<00:01:39.190> ran<00:01:39.729> my

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
bottom section out first and I ran my

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.880 
bottom section out first and I ran my
fingers<00:01:39.940> through<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.630> section<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.440> give<00:01:41.680> them

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
fingers through the section to give them

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.210 
fingers through the section to give them
a<00:01:42.040> more<00:01:42.250> wispy<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.180> natural<00:01:43.810> look<00:01:47.160> now<00:01:48.160> the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
a more wispy and natural look now the

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.140 
a more wispy and natural look now the
fun<00:01:48.610> begins

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
fun begins

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.270 
fun begins
I<00:01:49.210> just<00:01:49.510> took<00:01:49.720> big<00:01:50.050> sections<00:01:50.680> and<00:01:50.950> began

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
I just took big sections and began

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.040 
I just took big sections and began
twisting<00:01:51.820> them<00:01:52.000> in<00:01:52.119> and<00:01:52.360> just<00:01:52.390> pinning<00:01:52.930> them

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
twisting them in and just pinning them

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.040 
twisting them in and just pinning them
randomly<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.910> I<00:01:54.910> left<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.270> ends<00:01:55.660> hanging

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
randomly and I left the ends hanging

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.790 
randomly and I left the ends hanging
because<00:01:56.259> I'm<00:01:56.560> just<00:01:56.710> going<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:56.979> fix<00:01:57.160> them<00:01:57.430> later

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.499 

once<00:02:02.800> I<00:02:03.009> twisted<00:02:03.550> in<00:02:03.670> both<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.180> bottom

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
once I twisted in both the bottom

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.840 
once I twisted in both the bottom
sections<00:02:04.960> I<00:02:05.170> then<00:02:05.350> just<00:02:05.530> began<00:02:05.920> twisting<00:02:06.670> the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
sections I then just began twisting the

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.910 
sections I then just began twisting the
curls<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.479> just<00:02:07.899> for<00:02:08.110> my<00:02:08.229> little<00:02:08.410> loops<00:02:08.679> and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
curls and just for my little loops and

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.880 
curls and just for my little loops and
pinning<00:02:09.280> them<00:02:09.459> in<00:02:09.610> place<00:02:09.790> and<00:02:10.260> I<00:02:11.260> Dad<00:02:11.470> went

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
pinning them in place and I Dad went

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.970 
pinning them in place and I Dad went
ahead<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.340> took<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.489> rest<00:02:12.700> of<00:02:12.910> my<00:02:12.970> curl<00:02:13.239> depth

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
ahead and took the rest of my curl depth

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.110 
ahead and took the rest of my curl depth
and<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.870> time<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.500> began<00:02:17.980> back<00:02:18.400> combing<00:02:18.730> some

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
and this time I began back combing some

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.090 
and this time I began back combing some
of<00:02:19.239> my<00:02:19.330> curls<00:02:19.690> just<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.140> give<00:02:20.350> a<00:02:20.380> bit<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.680> volume

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
of my curls just to give a bit of volume

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.800 
of my curls just to give a bit of volume
to<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.340> crown<00:02:21.370> area<00:02:23.910> then<00:02:24.910> again<00:02:25.269> I<00:02:25.299> ran<00:02:25.630> my

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
to the crown area then again I ran my

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.270 
to the crown area then again I ran my
fingers<00:02:25.870> through<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.500> curls<00:02:26.530> just<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.130> give

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
fingers through the curls just to give

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.449 
fingers through the curls just to give
them<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.549> more<00:02:27.730> messy<00:02:28.209> natural<00:02:28.780> look<00:02:28.959> and<00:02:29.459> I

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459
