hi<00:00:01.890> there<00:00:02.070> guys<00:00:02.190> today<00:00:02.669> I'll<00:00:02.939> be<00:00:02.970> showing<00:00:03.360> you

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
hi there guys today I'll be showing you

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.280 
hi there guys today I'll be showing you
this<00:00:04.110> concept<00:00:04.950> I<00:00:05.069> had<00:00:05.370> built<00:00:06.180> then<00:00:06.779> designed

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
this concept I had built then designed

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.339 
this concept I had built then designed
myself<00:00:07.550> for<00:00:08.550> an<00:00:09.000> automatic<00:00:09.599> melon<00:00:09.870> grower<00:00:10.170> and

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
myself for an automatic melon grower and

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.450 
myself for an automatic melon grower and
Harvester<00:00:11.480> as<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.809> can<00:00:12.929> see<00:00:13.200> here<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.920> melons

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
Harvester as you can see here the melons

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.340 
Harvester as you can see here the melons
will<00:00:14.639> grow<00:00:14.940> underneath<00:00:15.420> these<00:00:15.719> top<00:00:16.080> pistons

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
will grow underneath these top pistons

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.000 
will grow underneath these top pistons
and<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.760> block<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.210> they're<00:00:18.330> growing<00:00:18.810> on

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
and the block that they're growing on

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.590 
and the block that they're growing on
obviously<00:00:20.010> since<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.369> minecraft<00:00:20.789> 1.1<00:00:21.240> they

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
obviously since it's minecraft 1.1 they

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.660 
obviously since it's minecraft 1.1 they
don't<00:00:21.840> need<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.080> be<00:00:22.109> tilled<00:00:22.439> underneath<00:00:23.430> them

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
don't need to be tilled underneath them

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.599 
don't need to be tilled underneath them
are<00:00:23.880> sticky<00:00:24.330> pistons<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:25.920> sticky<00:00:26.250> pistons

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
are sticky pistons the sticky pistons

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.689 
are sticky pistons the sticky pistons
will<00:00:26.820> push<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.420> blocks<00:00:27.689> upward<00:00:28.429> which<00:00:29.429> will

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
will push the blocks upward which will

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.569 
will push the blocks upward which will
then<00:00:29.880> break<00:00:30.240> all<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.599> melon<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.040> exact

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
then break all the melon as at the exact

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.700 
then break all the melon as at the exact
same<00:00:32.790> moment<00:00:33.000> these<00:00:33.570> pistons<00:00:34.079> will<00:00:34.320> retract

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
same moment these pistons will retract

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.520 
same moment these pistons will retract
upward<00:00:35.160> leaving<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.270> empty<00:00:37.020> space<00:00:37.290> for

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
upward leaving the the empty space for

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.959 
upward leaving the the empty space for
the<00:00:37.620> melon<00:00:37.920> items<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.489> fall<00:00:38.899> at<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.079> same<00:00:40.350> time

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
the melon items to fall at the same time

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.220 
the melon items to fall at the same time
clear<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> back<00:00:42.390> which<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.930> can't<00:00:43.170> see

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
clear in the back which you can't see

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.779 
clear in the back which you can't see
now<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.530> will<00:00:43.920> want<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.129> activate<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> lever

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
now you will want to activate the lever

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.330 
now you will want to activate the lever
clear<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> back<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.899> water<00:00:46.530> block<00:00:46.890> will

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
clear in the back a water block will

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.790 
clear in the back a water block will
begin<00:00:47.579> flowing<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.239> we'll<00:00:48.960> deliver<00:00:49.170> all<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
begin flowing and we'll deliver all the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.860 
begin flowing and we'll deliver all the
mail<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.100> items<00:00:50.370> directly<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> front<00:00:51.809> of

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
mail and items directly to the front of

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.520 
mail and items directly to the front of
the<00:00:51.960> machine<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:53.010> zero<00:00:53.399> melon<00:00:53.820> loss<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.530> all

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the machine with zero melon loss and all

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.299 
the machine with zero melon loss and all
of<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.129> done<00:00:56.430> rather<00:00:57.300> rapidly<00:00:57.949> and<00:00:58.949> then

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
of this is done rather rapidly and then

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.520 
of this is done rather rapidly and then
once<00:00:59.670> it's<00:01:00.059> delivered<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> melons<00:01:01.079> I'll

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
once it's delivered all the melons I'll

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.520 
once it's delivered all the melons I'll
activate<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> lever<00:01:02.309> again<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.049> at<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.320> same

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
activate the lever again and at the same

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.920 
activate the lever again and at the same
time<00:01:04.670> both<00:01:05.670> these<00:01:05.850> top<00:01:06.119> pistons<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
time both these top pistons and the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.039 
time both these top pistons and the
Pistons<00:01:07.110> underneath<00:01:07.979> these<00:01:08.159> dirt<00:01:08.490> blocks

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
Pistons underneath these dirt blocks

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.080 
Pistons underneath these dirt blocks
will<00:01:10.049> shift<00:01:10.380> positions<00:01:10.950> which<00:01:11.610> will<00:01:11.820> destroy

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
will shift positions which will destroy

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.469 
will shift positions which will destroy
the<00:01:12.600> water<00:01:12.810> blocks<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:13.650> flowing<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
the water blocks that are flowing and

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.390 
the water blocks that are flowing and
keep<00:01:15.479> these<00:01:15.780> melon<00:01:16.350> stems<00:01:16.710> from<00:01:17.009> getting

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
keep these melon stems from getting

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:35.840 
keep these melon stems from getting
damaged<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> I'll<00:01:19.320> show<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.710> how<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.040> works

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.450 

and<00:01:36.850> as<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:37.510> can<00:01:37.660> see<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:38.350> melon<00:01:38.830> loss<00:01:38.980> ratio

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
and as you can see the melon loss ratio

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.560 
and as you can see the melon loss ratio
is<00:01:40.260> relatively<00:01:41.260> low<00:01:41.790> compared<00:01:42.790> to<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.300> melon

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
is relatively low compared to the melon

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.010 
is relatively low compared to the melon
machines<00:01:43.870> that<00:01:43.990> I've<00:01:44.170> seen<00:01:44.530> um<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:46.000> it's<00:01:46.750> it

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
machines that I've seen um and it's it

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.530 
machines that I've seen um and it's it
simply<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:47.920> very<00:01:48.400> simple<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.790> operate<00:01:48.880> and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
simply is very simple to operate and

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.760 
simply is very simple to operate and
it's<00:01:49.720> very<00:01:50.020> quick<00:01:50.470> in<00:01:50.740> what<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:51.040> does<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
it's very quick in what it does the

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.280 
it's very quick in what it does the
setup<00:01:54.070> is<00:01:54.250> basically<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.420> only<00:01:55.540> requirement

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
setup is basically the only requirement

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.040 
setup is basically the only requirement
that<00:01:56.800> i<00:01:56.860> found<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.610> that<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.270> wire<00:01:58.510> up<00:01:58.750> these

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
that i found is that you wire up these

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.930 
that i found is that you wire up these
top<00:01:59.380> pistons<00:01:59.620> and<00:02:00.540> these<00:02:01.540> bottom<00:02:01.960> pistons

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
top pistons and these bottom pistons

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.680 
top pistons and these bottom pistons
along<00:02:03.940> with<00:02:04.240> back<00:02:04.869> here<00:02:05.140> i<00:02:05.170> will<00:02:05.530> show<00:02:05.740> you

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
along with back here i will show you

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.600 
along with back here i will show you
there's<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.780> piston<00:02:08.320> there<00:02:08.770> if<00:02:09.130> you<00:02:09.280> can<00:02:09.429> see

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
there's a piston there if you can see

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.240 
there's a piston there if you can see
behind<00:02:09.760> the<00:02:09.970> glass<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.780> retracts<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.860> drop

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
behind the glass that retracts to drop

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.940 
behind the glass that retracts to drop
the<00:02:12.370> water<00:02:12.630> on<00:02:13.630> all<00:02:13.810> of<00:02:14.080> those<00:02:14.230> activate<00:02:14.800> at

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
the water on all of those activate at

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.370 
the water on all of those activate at
precisely<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.910> same<00:02:16.060> moment<00:02:16.690> so<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.230> it

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
precisely the same moment so that it

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.199 
precisely the same moment so that it
will<00:02:17.560> destroy<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.310> water<00:02:18.550> block<00:02:18.820> that<00:02:19.000> flow

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
will destroy the water block that flow

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.010 
will destroy the water block that flow
out<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.490> blocks<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:22.600> are<00:02:22.660> placed

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
out and the the blocks that are placed

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.820 
out and the the blocks that are placed
above<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.620> vines<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.630> melon<00:02:26.230> vines<00:02:26.380> have

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
above the vines the the melon vines have

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.190

to<00:02:27.010> be<00:02:27.190> glass<00:02:28.290> for<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.320> melon<00:02:29.980> vines<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.459> grow

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
to be glass for the melon vines to grow

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.990 
to be glass for the melon vines to grow
and<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.560> can't<00:02:32.800> leave<00:02:33.040> them<00:02:33.190> out<00:02:33.370> because<00:02:33.850> if

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
and you can't leave them out because if

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.640 
and you can't leave them out because if
you<00:02:34.090> leave<00:02:34.269> them<00:02:34.450> out<00:02:34.570> then<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.140> water<00:02:35.320> will

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
you leave them out then the water will

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.070 
you leave them out then the water will
spill<00:02:35.980> over<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.489> destroy<00:02:36.790> device<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:38.050> the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
spill over and destroy device so the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.440 
spill over and destroy device so the
glass<00:02:38.590> key<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.100> water<00:02:39.310> end<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.910> still

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
glass key to the water end and still

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.479 
glass key to the water end and still
allows<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.110> grow<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:43.510> decide<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.800> resets

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
allows it to grow and decide it resets

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.400 
allows it to grow and decide it resets
itself<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:46.120> melons<00:02:46.450> will<00:02:46.720> just

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
itself the melons will just

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.820 
itself the melons will just
automatically<00:02:47.860> come<00:02:48.070> back<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.989> if<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.680> give

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
automatically come back so if I give

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.560 
automatically come back so if I give
enough<00:02:51.070> comments<00:02:51.700> requesting<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.269> on<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.420> could

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
enough comments requesting it on I could

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.000 
enough comments requesting it on I could
probably<00:02:52.870> tear<00:02:53.230> this<00:02:53.380> apart<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.890> make<00:02:53.980> a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
probably tear this apart and make a

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.220 
probably tear this apart and make a
tutorial<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.700> hope<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:55.780> enjoyed<00:02:56.019> it<00:02:56.050> and<00:02:56.170> I

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
tutorial I hope you enjoyed it and I

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.670
