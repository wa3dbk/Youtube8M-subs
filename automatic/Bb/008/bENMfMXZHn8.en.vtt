tomorrow so out of what we saw today the

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.160 
tomorrow so out of what we saw today the
Canadian<00:05:32.850> Maple<00:05:33.240> Leafs<00:05:33.450> would<00:05:33.630> be<00:05:33.780> our<00:05:33.870> best

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
this Krugerrand is okay and probably the

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.270 
this Krugerrand is okay and probably the

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
best bet of the session would be the

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.310 
best bet of the session would be the

ocean filler mining gold coin for 1350

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
ocean filler mining gold coin for 1350
so<00:05:52.320> this<00:05:52.500> is<00:05:52.650> how<00:05:52.830> we<00:05:52.890> buy<00:05:53.330> gold<00:05:54.330> bullion<00:05:54.600> coins

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
so this is how we buy gold bullion coins

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.520 
so this is how we buy gold bullion coins
good<00:05:56.340> luck
