00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
of the game here and I come around this

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.730 
of the game here and I come around this

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
or set up somewhere not necessarily to

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.110 
or set up somewhere not necessarily to
kill<00:05:53.380> your<00:05:53.590> opponent<00:05:53.710> but<00:05:54.340> to<00:05:54.520> at<00:05:54.639> least<00:05:54.760> hear
