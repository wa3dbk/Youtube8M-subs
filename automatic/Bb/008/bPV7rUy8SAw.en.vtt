00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430 
bike for a little bit I'm gonna pick one

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.339 
bike for a little bit I'm gonna pick one
up<00:07:06.639> for<00:07:06.849> then<00:07:07.629> this<00:07:07.779> one's<00:07:07.930> quite<00:07:08.020> expensive

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:08.349 
up for then this one's quite expensive

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:09.659 
up for then this one's quite expensive
because<00:07:08.589> it's<00:07:08.770> a<00:07:08.830> limited<00:07:08.949> edition<00:07:09.400> if<00:07:09.520> you're

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:09.669 
because it's a limited edition if you're

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:10.829 
because it's a limited edition if you're
on<00:07:09.759> an<00:07:09.819> asteroid<00:07:10.089> you<00:07:10.210> can<00:07:10.330> pick<00:07:10.479> one<00:07:10.569> up<00:07:10.690> for

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:10.839 
on an asteroid you can pick one up for

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:14.760 
on an asteroid you can pick one up for
not<00:07:11.830> much<00:07:11.979> more<00:07:12.190> than<00:07:12.310> a<00:07:12.370> grand<00:07:13.650> insurance<00:07:14.650> on

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:14.770 
not much more than a grand insurance on

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.219 
not much more than a grand insurance on
a<00:07:14.800> bit<00:07:15.190> much<00:07:15.370> if<00:07:15.550> you're<00:07:15.699> a<00:07:15.759> new<00:07:15.909> rider<00:07:16.150> but<00:07:17.139> if

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229 
a bit much if you're a new rider but if

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.200 
a bit much if you're a new rider but if
you're<00:07:17.349> an<00:07:17.440> experienced<00:07:17.919> rider<00:07:18.210> not

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
you're an experienced rider not

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:26.249 
you're an experienced rider not
