00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:02.110
 and here we go again 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.470
 so you add show how to take the sea 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.370
 Wallemme 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.229
 they still want 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:10.240
 Its very important 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.819
 it is the sea that takes the man she is intact 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:13.669
 Lion 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.579
 there were ways that gives him a lifestyle 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:18.939
 right here 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.880
 but they put an end to these elections 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.789
 m trav art 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.069
 funny 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:26.359
 it takes French 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.489
 of course to make an atom start 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.489
 linear is done from the marine park 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.450
 it is an unlawful attack 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.750
 super the outfit is just but fata potatoes the social partners and 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.640
 humans 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.469
 17 passes but there is 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.300
 agreement 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.539
 so the cnlc from abb 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.760
 when of sovereignty ap to see learned 2 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
 in the student 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.580
 martin 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.580
 nantes is mathematical which weighs what things 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.370
 so it's me who was born sad took advantage if we want to go through the port 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.440
 were more and more not entitled to the same subject of the busy 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.520
 so it's first of all before you go on vacation 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.969
 often also part 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:18.000
 this pass right who can then that's it 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.930
 so here everything is very different 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.660
 what kind of source 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.660
 loncle who selects not embellished 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.590
 and as a result if you can go in your duty select the goods that 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.860
 you want 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.860
 the little story a little doubt of the job 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.200
 monster enough to make a career 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.630
 it would be nice if it was with the mass button maxim that were 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.540
 employees 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.250
 the maxim of so little 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.800
 but the same day 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.620
 evening 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.280
 if you want to put some 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.890
 the basement for eastern europe its yield 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.640
 ok you tell me I'm a study 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.990
 the league 1 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.329
 we are going with it the convergence between the volume in seventh 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.329
 the college m 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.470
 I do a little less first you can very well armed it's not cake 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.639
 now 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.579
 more and more to promote 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.340
 no here we are 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.090
 after the state now that we are finally going through our boat 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.339
 constantine 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.849
 we know that this destination 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.849
 here you see the different parameters 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:43.509
 that I let you discover all that it can be nice you have 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.769
 ignored what the surplus city in all this is it's not the 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.739
 good side here is an excellent 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.109
 andrÃ© take an assistant 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.189
 to get out of there mine 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:57.059
 especially here 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:59.359
 we may have problems 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.729
 if you choose another second round than on paper 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.819
 here it is not super hard to do so abbas 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:12.179
 why do we 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.429
 this procedure 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:20.029
 the important fact is very simple this one ok the speedometer not 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:24.439
 waste time we check it nothing to add another convoy the blow the 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.009
 France as his generous 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:30.549
 so they are all gold on the table the world map more then one 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.069
 selected 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.729
 he does not wear well boat it's not so simple it was their first shot for 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.099
 tomorrow 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.159
 right here 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.069
 then 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.359
 when I'm going to stop showing the boat 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.589
 what falls on me 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.599
 so what is still there is yet indicated the girls who are going 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.139
 to be applied and street 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.779
 we can say that to walk in the woods she added with the departure 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:55.829
 karim 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.380
 you attacked him during the 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.299
 agreement 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.559
 clearstream 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:06.189
 he chose to leave dubois and the lake 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.269
 all that implies 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.480
 like the pool 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.219
 so rare fee boats 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.349
 now it's the big box fighter a box 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.569
 as part of the stimulus that the pole of exchange for years then for 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:22.199
 worries here the state no contract does not leave it directly to him from 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.829
 vigilance is real the same thing that takes to me ccn the quantity 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.870
 by essence who had charged m 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.780
 she titled the guy who will appear as for the loading of agreement with 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.979
 lens in the pas-de-calais to arras you do not have because you do not have 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.370
 content to live 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.800
 to sell my goods you will go directly to the market 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.249
 in a pool 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:47.930
 little touches 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.360
 it's sinik six years 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.360
 the next day the boat you want 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.659
 see their resources and there you see before in the small houses of 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:59.689
 attempts of small boats is the quantity on your account 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:03.199
 we intend to sell wood that can take wood a little duck 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.559
 his certificate task what city 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:07.520
 also to adapt at best 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.469
 he advised the general commercial ccja 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:14.699
 so as far as possible the son of the country all party members m 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:17.930
 but even worse 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.110
 and the same for a baker 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.070
 it allows everything 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.070
 then the quantity was needed 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.039
 but still very well 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.050
 as for philippe little overview to end up at the trade yes for the 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.770
 getting up of the day we can even find ourselves between leaders it happens like that does not 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.930
 not necessarily very simple street 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.930
 afterwards it's up to you to see it's more profitable 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.490
 at the level of excess deaths to follow well 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:50.580
 dede of resource economics like other cities that are in short supply 

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:53.330
 of this kind I was draining excess 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.540
 the cities of the West Bank would allow electricity that's without counting the 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:58.300
 very well 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.389
 a few seconds 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.619
 the next to new york and the videos 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:03.839
 others more 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:06.889
 it's worth all the gold of the game world 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.889
 most men more in-depth introduction of the interface 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.870
