00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
first braid and tuck the end into the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.010 
first braid and tuck the end into the
other<00:01:40.270> braid<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:43.240> this<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:43.510> what<00:01:43.660> the<00:01:43.810> braids

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
other braid so this is what the braids

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.240 
other braid so this is what the braids
look<00:01:44.200> like<00:01:44.350> when<00:01:44.500> they're<00:01:44.590> fully<00:01:44.830> pinned<00:01:45.100> into

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
look like when they're fully pinned into

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.880 
look like when they're fully pinned into
place<00:01:45.580> this<00:01:46.270> next<00:01:46.660> step<00:01:46.900> is<00:01:47.170> optional<00:01:47.380> but<00:01:47.710> I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
place this next step is optional but I

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.280 
place this next step is optional but I
always<00:01:48.130> like<00:01:48.430> to<00:01:48.460> curl<00:01:48.940> my<00:01:48.970> bangs<00:01:49.330> back<00:01:49.720> so

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
always like to curl my bangs back so

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.170 
always like to curl my bangs back so
that<00:01:50.530> first<00:01:50.740> they<00:01:51.190> stay<00:01:51.430> out<00:01:51.550> of<00:01:51.580> my<00:01:51.729> face<00:01:51.970> but

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
that first they stay out of my face but

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.880 
that first they stay out of my face but
also<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:52.690> helps<00:01:52.810> give<00:01:53.080> them<00:01:53.200> some<00:01:53.380> more<00:01:53.500> volume

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
also it helps give them some more volume

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:05.210 
also it helps give them some more volume
so<00:01:54.040> they're<00:01:54.190> not<00:01:54.280> as<00:01:54.460> flat

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220
