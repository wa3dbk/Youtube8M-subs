before deer population is starting to
become<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:18.210> problem<00:00:18.539> for<00:00:18.869> us<00:00:19.199> as<00:00:20.390> one<00:00:21.390> person

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
become a problem for us as one person

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.870 
become a problem for us as one person
told<00:00:22.050> me<00:00:22.170> one<00:00:22.350> time<00:00:22.619> they<00:00:22.890> had<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.130> deer<00:00:23.550> problem

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
deer had a people problem because we

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.229 
deer had a people problem because we
were<00:00:28.500> moving<00:00:28.769> into<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.369> country<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:32.730> problem

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
were moving into the country the problem

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.000 
were moving into the country the problem
with<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.570> deer<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:34.050> they<00:00:34.469> will<00:00:34.649> eat<00:00:34.800> your

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
with the deer is they will eat your

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.030 
with the deer is they will eat your
plants<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.820> grass<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:37.170> some<00:00:37.410> disruptive

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
plants and grass and do some disruptive

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.750 
plants and grass and do some disruptive
damage<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:39.660> we'd<00:00:39.870> like<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.440> plan<00:00:40.920> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
damage so we'd like to have a plan to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.110 
damage so we'd like to have a plan to
keep<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.420> from<00:00:42.690> happening<00:00:43.940> now<00:00:44.940> you'll

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
keep that from happening now you'll

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.360 
keep that from happening now you'll
notice<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.660> some<00:00:45.690> areas<00:00:46.410> where<00:00:46.739> people<00:00:47.010> will

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
notice in some areas where people will

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.580 
notice in some areas where people will
put<00:00:47.579> cages<00:00:48.120> around<00:00:48.300> their<00:00:48.690> shrubs<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.350> things

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
put cages around their shrubs and things

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.260 
put cages around their shrubs and things
like<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.100> that's<00:00:50.370> not<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.640> very<00:00:50.789> attractive

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
like that that's not a very attractive

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.770 
like that that's not a very attractive
solution<00:00:52.850> but<00:00:53.850> there's<00:00:54.090> several<00:00:54.329> things<00:00:54.629> you

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
solution but there's several things you

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.270 
solution but there's several things you
can<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:55.230> from<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.680> natural<00:00:56.250> standpoint<00:00:56.550> that

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
can do from a natural standpoint that

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.689 
can do from a natural standpoint that
maybe<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> would<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.640> least<00:00:59.850> slow<00:01:00.329> them<00:01:00.539> down

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
maybe it would at least slow them down

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.570 
maybe it would at least slow them down
on<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.690> perimeter<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.619> properties<00:01:05.339> or

on the perimeter of your properties or

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.760 
on the perimeter of your properties or
at<00:01:05.700> least<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> area<00:01:06.570> where<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.229> know<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
at least in the area where you know the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.530 
at least in the area where you know the
deer<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.280> coming<00:01:08.729> from<00:01:10.159> can<00:01:11.159> plant<00:01:11.540> several

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
deer are coming from can plant several

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
different types of plants the oleander

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.399

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
that by its smell and they will stay

that either Lantana

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.789 
that either Lantana
it's<00:01:31.229> been<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.920> long<00:01:33.049> detriment<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> deer

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
it's been a long detriment for a deer

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.609 
it's been a long detriment for a deer
they<00:01:35.310> turn<00:01:35.610> from<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:35.939> as<00:01:36.240> well<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:37.439> by

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
they turn from that as well so by

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.830 
they turn from that as well so by
planting<00:01:38.479> some<00:01:39.479> Lantana<00:01:40.250> Holly<00:01:41.250> or<00:01:41.810> oleanders

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.990 

another<00:02:03.450> thing<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.409> do<00:02:04.790> would<00:02:05.790> be

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
another thing that you can do would be

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
another thing that you can do would be
to<00:02:06.140> take<00:02:07.140> an<00:02:07.320> egg<00:02:09.170> beat<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.379> mix<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.550> with<00:02:12.020> one

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
to take an egg beat it mix it with one

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.860 
to take an egg beat it mix it with one
pint<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.470> water

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
pint of water

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.240 
pint of water
and<00:02:14.489> spray<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.670> perimeter<00:02:16.560> but<00:02:17.560> first<00:02:17.950> before

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
and spray the perimeter but first before

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.979 
and spray the perimeter but first before
you<00:02:18.550> spray<00:02:18.849> it<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.030> need<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.330> let<00:02:19.599> that<00:02:19.629> egg

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
you spray it you need to let that egg

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.860 
you spray it you need to let that egg
sit<00:02:20.349> for<00:02:20.560> two<00:02:20.709> days<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:22.180> let's<00:02:22.420> go<00:02:22.569> over<00:02:22.840> that

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
sit for two days so let's go over that

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.949 
sit for two days so let's go over that
again<00:02:23.230> beat<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.310> egg<00:02:24.370> mix<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.300> with<00:02:25.450> one<00:02:25.660> pint

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
again beat the egg mix it with one pint

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.860 
again beat the egg mix it with one pint
of<00:02:26.050> water<00:02:26.290> let<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:26.980> sit<00:02:27.310> for<00:02:27.610> two<00:02:27.790> days<00:02:28.060> then

is a very good safe practice and it does
