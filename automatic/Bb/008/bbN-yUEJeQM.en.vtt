away from the pro level that's fine you

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.310 
away from the pro level that's fine you

know the more patience you have the guy
came<00:02:45.440> I<00:02:45.739> think<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.010> better<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.370> outcome<00:02:46.400> will

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
came I think the better the outcome will

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.250 
came I think the better the outcome will
be<00:02:46.820> because<00:02:47.540> he's<00:02:47.750> far<00:02:47.959> from<00:02:48.080> finished

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
be because he's far from finished

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.229 
be because he's far from finished
product<00:02:48.860> but<00:02:48.920> there's<00:02:49.340> um<00:02:49.670> there's<00:02:49.850> enough

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
product but there's um there's enough

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.890 
product but there's um there's enough
there<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.540> be<00:02:51.489> intriguingly<00:02:52.660> tempted<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.750> take

there to be intriguingly tempted to take
my<00:02:54.110> first<00:02:54.380> round<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:54.950> think<00:02:55.160> that'll<00:02:55.430> be

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
my first round and I think that'll be

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.210 
my first round and I think that'll be
what<00:02:56.120> happens<00:02:56.480> with<00:02:56.660> them<00:02:56.780> anyway<00:02:57.770> dodge
