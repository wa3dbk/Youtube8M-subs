probably

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.640 
probably
because<00:02:22.660> their<00:02:22.840> wives<00:02:22.990> might<00:02:23.410> not<00:02:23.560> be

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
because their wives might not be

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.060 
because their wives might not be
satisfying<00:02:23.830> them<00:02:24.400> oh<00:02:25.410> that's<00:02:26.410> like<00:02:26.560> one<00:02:26.920> of

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
satisfying them oh that's like one of

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.800 
satisfying them oh that's like one of
the<00:02:27.160> major<00:02:27.430> reasons<00:02:27.760> when<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.180> have<00:02:28.360> problems

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
the major reasons when you have problems

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.120 
the major reasons when you have problems
at<00:02:28.960> home<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:30.070> don't<00:02:30.190> really<00:02:30.310> get<00:02:30.880> such<00:02:31.510> sexual

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
at home you don't really get such sexual

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.320 
at home you don't really get such sexual
satisfaction<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.460> probably<00:02:33.760> go<00:02:34.120> outside

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
satisfaction so you probably go outside

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.160 
satisfaction so you probably go outside
to<00:02:34.480> look<00:02:34.630> for<00:02:34.870> it

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
to look for it

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.350 
to look for it
it's<00:02:35.380> alright<00:02:35.740> at<00:02:35.920> all<00:02:36.070> yeah<00:02:36.910> people<00:02:37.210> should

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
it's alright at all yeah people should

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.750 
it's alright at all yeah people should
really<00:02:38.200> know<00:02:38.350> patronize<00:02:38.830> what<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.430> because

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
really know patronize what it is because

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.030

the health factors I also have to
consider<00:02:42.390> satisfaction<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.510> at<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.930> end<00:02:43.960> of

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
consider satisfaction the at the end of

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.630 
consider satisfaction the at the end of
the<00:02:44.230> day<00:02:44.380> they<00:02:44.560> know<00:02:44.710> they<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:45.070> offer
