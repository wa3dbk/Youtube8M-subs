00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
this is let's it an approach shot to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.170 
this is let's it an approach shot to
volley<00:00:39.840> drill<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.520> guys<00:00:41.670> got<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.850> kind<00:00:42.090> of

okay let's say you're trying to hit an
approach<00:00:50.399> shot<00:00:50.430> into<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.390> backhand<00:00:51.989> corner

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
approach shot into the backhand corner

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.439 
approach shot into the backhand corner
and<00:00:52.649> you're<00:00:53.070> coming<00:00:53.399> into<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.850> net<00:00:54.059> from<00:00:54.239> that

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
and you're coming into the net from that

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.400 
and you're coming into the net from that
side<00:00:55.460> okay<00:00:56.460> where<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:57.059> approach<00:00:57.449> shot<00:00:57.780> lands

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
side okay where your approach shot lands

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.770 
side okay where your approach shot lands
it's<00:00:58.920> gonna<00:00:59.129> dictate<00:00:59.520> their<00:00:59.969> easiest<00:01:00.480> option

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
it's gonna dictate their easiest option

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.920 
it's gonna dictate their easiest option
and<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:02.340> want<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.730> shut<00:01:02.969> down<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.510> easiest

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
and you want to shut down the easiest

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.170 
and you want to shut down the easiest
option<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.920> make<00:01:05.100> them<00:01:05.309> beat<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
option and make them beat you with the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.380 
option and make them beat you with the
hardest<00:01:06.570> option<00:01:06.990> right<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:08.220> here's<00:01:09.090> how<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
hardest option right so here's how it

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.870 
hardest option right so here's how it
looks<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.689> little<00:01:09.810> bit<00:01:10.110> if<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.250> approach<00:01:11.580> shot

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
looks a little bit if the approach shot

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.800 
looks a little bit if the approach shot
comes<00:01:12.240> over<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.340> it's<00:01:14.340> landing<00:01:15.030> deep<00:01:15.479> deep

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
deep by this corner of the triangle what

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.749 
deep by this corner of the triangle what
do<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.320> guys<00:01:19.470> think<00:01:19.530> they're<00:01:20.159> gonna<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.549> on

shot is landing back here you're paying

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.510 
shot is landing back here you're paying
attention<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:42.200> where<00:01:42.440> your<00:01:42.620> approach<00:01:43.310> is

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
attention to where your approach is

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.850 
attention to where your approach is
landing<00:01:43.940> split<00:01:44.780> step<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:45.380> what<00:01:45.560> do<00:01:45.620> you<00:01:45.680> get

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
landing split step and what do you get

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.770 
landing split step and what do you get
ready<00:01:46.070> for<00:01:47.410> smash<00:01:48.410> or<00:01:48.950> read<00:01:49.190> smash<00:01:49.600> when<00:01:50.600> your

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
ready for smash or read smash when your

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.390 
ready for smash or read smash when your
approach<00:01:51.080> shot<00:01:51.320> is<00:01:51.440> coming<00:01:51.650> over<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.220> back

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
approach shot is coming over to the back

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.510 
approach shot is coming over to the back
end<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:52.880> it's<00:01:53.300> landing<00:01:53.750> here<00:01:54.170> anywhere<00:01:55.130> short

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
end and it's landing here anywhere short

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.490 
end and it's landing here anywhere short
in<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.729> middle<00:01:55.970> obviously<00:01:56.900> they<00:01:57.050> have<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.260> lot

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
in the middle obviously they have a lot

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.730 
in the middle obviously they have a lot
of<00:01:57.530> options<00:01:58.520> but<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.660> best<00:01:59.900> from<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.500> middle

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
of options but the best from the middle

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.830 
of options but the best from the middle
that's<00:02:00.860> very<00:02:01.160> very<00:02:01.460> difficult<00:02:01.729> to<00:02:02.540> get<00:02:02.690> it

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
that's very very difficult to get it

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.520 
that's very very difficult to get it
inside<00:02:03.320> out<00:02:03.530> down<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.070> line<00:02:04.360> passing<00:02:05.360> shot<00:02:05.630> so

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
inside out down the line passing shot so

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.600 
inside out down the line passing shot so
they're<00:02:06.680> probably<00:02:06.860> gonna<00:02:07.190> hook<00:02:07.430> it

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
they're probably gonna hook it

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.749 
they're probably gonna hook it
cross-court<00:02:08.119> so<00:02:09.110> split<00:02:09.950> step<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.459> kind<00:02:10.580> of

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
cross-court so split step and kind of

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.020 
cross-court so split step and kind of
look<00:02:10.880> for<00:02:11.090> cross-court<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:13.370> last<00:02:13.610> piece

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
look for cross-court and the last piece

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.330 
look for cross-court and the last piece
of<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.300> puzzle<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.870> when<00:02:15.500> your<00:02:15.709> approach<00:02:16.040> shot

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
of the puzzle is when your approach shot

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.199 
of the puzzle is when your approach shot
is<00:02:16.520> coming<00:02:16.730> way<00:02:17.030> over<00:02:17.300> here<00:02:17.480> wide<00:02:19.209> what's

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
is coming way over here wide what's

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.500 
is coming way over here wide what's
their<00:02:20.420> best<00:02:20.690> option<00:02:20.989> on<00:02:21.380> that<00:02:21.590> wide<00:02:21.770> ball<00:02:22.510> down

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
their best option on that wide ball down

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.260 
their best option on that wide ball down
the<00:02:23.660> line<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:25.130> guess<00:02:25.370> what<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.700> do<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:26.030> split

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
the line so guess what you do you split

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.610 
the line so guess what you do you split
step<00:02:26.570> in<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.930> sneak<00:02:27.739> down<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.190> line<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:29.620> look

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
step in you sneak down the line so look

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.290 
step in you sneak down the line so look
it<00:02:30.890> doesn't<00:02:31.070> matter<00:02:31.400> how<00:02:31.670> good<00:02:31.880> your<00:02:32.060> volley
