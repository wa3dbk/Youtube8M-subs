00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
see what I'm talking about in just a

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.100 
see what I'm talking about in just a
second<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:14.850> polo<00:02:15.300> jeans<00:02:15.720> company

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
Ralph Lauren sweater with an American

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.580 
Ralph Lauren sweater with an American
flag<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.840> could<00:02:22.140> see<00:02:22.320> if<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.560> was

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
flag on it so I I could see if it was

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.740 
flag on it so I I could see if it was
seasonal<00:02:23.070> for<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.310> fourth<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.580> July<00:02:23.880> but<00:02:24.210> for

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
seasonal for the fourth of July but for

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.540 
seasonal for the fourth of July but for
Christmas<00:02:25.320> maybe<00:02:25.710> it's<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:25.980> because<00:02:26.220> it's

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
Christmas maybe it's just because it's

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.920 
Christmas maybe it's just because it's
red<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.870> this<00:02:28.110> was<00:02:28.760> $5.99<00:02:29.760> wait<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:30.630> size<00:02:30.810> is

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
red so this was $5.99 wait what size is

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.320 
red so this was $5.99 wait what size is
this<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.380> think<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> large<00:02:32.520> they<00:02:33.060> had<00:02:33.210> it

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
this I think this is a large they had it

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.580 
this I think this is a large they had it
in<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.510> small<00:02:33.810> section<00:02:35.270> that's<00:02:36.270> weird

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
in the small section that's weird

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.410 
in the small section that's weird
but<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> tried<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.340> no<00:02:38.430> one<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.180> is

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
but I tried to no one and it is

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.970 
but I tried to no one and it is
oversized<00:02:39.960> but<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.290> think<00:02:40.470> that's<00:02:40.620> what<00:02:40.710> I<00:02:40.740> like

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
oversized but I think that's what I like

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.610 
oversized but I think that's what I like
about<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.820> could<00:02:42.270> probably<00:02:42.450> pair<00:02:43.350> this<00:02:43.560> with

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
about it I could probably pair this with

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.710 
about it I could probably pair this with
like<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.160> have<00:02:44.310> these<00:02:44.580> really<00:02:44.820> cool<00:02:45.090> velvet

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
like I have these really cool velvet

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.720 
like I have these really cool velvet
leggings<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.560> got<00:02:46.770> on<00:02:46.890> sale<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.460> kind<00:02:47.670> of

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
leggings that I got on sale that kind of

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.230 
leggings that I got on sale that kind of
have<00:02:48.440> mesh<00:02:49.440> like<00:02:50.010> see-through<00:02:50.490> stripes<00:02:50.940> in

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
have mesh like see-through stripes in

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.210 
have mesh like see-through stripes in
them<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.110> thought<00:02:52.350> like<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.800> could<00:02:53.160> be

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
them so I thought like that could be

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.340 
them so I thought like that could be
kind<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.490> cool<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.670> could<00:02:53.850> play<00:02:54.000> on<00:02:54.150> textures<00:02:54.690> so

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
kind of cool I could play on textures so

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.690 
kind of cool I could play on textures so
the<00:02:55.650> third<00:02:55.830> thing<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.280> picked<00:02:56.520> up<00:02:56.640> was

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
the third thing that I picked up was

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.730 
the third thing that I picked up was
something<00:02:57.210> that<00:02:57.240> I<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.870> think<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.440> might<00:02:58.620> have

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
something that I I think I might have

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.250 
something that I I think I might have
something<00:02:59.010> similar<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.790> already<00:03:00.510> I'm<00:03:00.960> not

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
something similar to it already I'm not

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.450 
something similar to it already I'm not
sure<00:03:01.590> but<00:03:01.800> this<00:03:02.070> one<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:03.140> fuzzy<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:05.070> gora

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
sure but this one is fuzzy and gora

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.960 
sure but this one is fuzzy and gora
blend<00:03:06.440> cropped<00:03:07.440> it's<00:03:08.130> not<00:03:08.310> really<00:03:08.460> 3/4

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
blend cropped it's not really 3/4

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.520 
blend cropped it's not really 3/4
sleeves<00:03:09.270> it's<00:03:09.450> longer<00:03:09.720> than<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.020> so<00:03:10.140> maybe

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
sleeves it's longer than that so maybe

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.480 
sleeves it's longer than that so maybe
it<00:03:10.770> is<00:03:10.950> just<00:03:11.660> black<00:03:12.660> sweater<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.860> it's<00:03:14.010> super

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
it is just black sweater and it's super

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.440 
it is just black sweater and it's super
supersoft<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.690> cropped<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:16.760> um<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.820> think

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
supersoft is cropped so um I think

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.690 
supersoft is cropped so um I think
that's<00:03:19.080> what<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.350> like<00:03:19.680> crop<00:03:20.040> t-shirts<00:03:20.489> because

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
that's what I like crop t-shirts because

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.000 
that's what I like crop t-shirts because
I<00:03:21.230> don't<00:03:22.230> know<00:03:22.320> if<00:03:22.440> I've<00:03:22.530> mentioned<00:03:22.560> this

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
I don't know if I've mentioned this

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.520 
I don't know if I've mentioned this
before<00:03:23.070> but<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:23.760> see<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.360> feel<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:25.050> I<00:03:25.140> have<00:03:25.320> long

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
before but I see I feel like I have long

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.680 
before but I see I feel like I have long
legs<00:03:25.830> but<00:03:26.340> it's<00:03:26.520> my<00:03:26.670> torso<00:03:26.910> that's<00:03:27.540> not

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
legs but it's my torso that's not

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.720 
legs but it's my torso that's not
proportionate<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.380> my<00:03:28.500> legs<00:03:28.830> so<00:03:29.040> my<00:03:29.160> torso<00:03:29.430> is

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
proportionate to my legs so my torso is

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.550 
proportionate to my legs so my torso is
really<00:03:29.970> short<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:30.570> I<00:03:30.959> can't<00:03:31.230> pull<00:03:31.440> off

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
really short and I can't pull off

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.500 
really short and I can't pull off
regular<00:03:32.100> size<00:03:32.340> t-shirts<00:03:32.850> so<00:03:33.030> everything<00:03:33.480> that

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
regular size t-shirts so everything that

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.540 
regular size t-shirts so everything that
I<00:03:33.660> own<00:03:33.780> has<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.140> be<00:03:34.230> cropped<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:35.190> makes<00:03:35.400> any

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
I own has to be cropped that makes any

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.110 
I own has to be cropped that makes any
sense

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
sense

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.300 
sense
so<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.930> was<00:03:38.480> $2.99<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.680> like<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.070> it's

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
so this was $2.99 and I like it it's

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.630
