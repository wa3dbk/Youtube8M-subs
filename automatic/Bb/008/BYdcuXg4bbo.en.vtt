00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
about the RAM which comes with the 2gb

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.590 
about the RAM which comes with the 2gb
of<00:03:39.390> RAM<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.810> turns<00:03:40.019> on<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.560> media<00:03:41.519> tech<00:03:41.670> MSM<00:03:42.150> 18

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
of RAM it turns on the media tech MSM 18

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.199 
of RAM it turns on the media tech MSM 18
1:6<00:03:42.989> quad<00:03:43.200> core<00:03:43.380> processor<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:44.010> in<00:03:44.820> terms<00:03:45.030> of

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
1:6 quad core processor and in terms of

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.060 
1:6 quad core processor and in terms of
the<00:03:45.450> storage<00:03:45.900> let's<00:03:46.230> quickly<00:03:46.470> move<00:03:46.680> on<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:46.950> the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
the storage let's quickly move on to the

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.509 
the storage let's quickly move on to the
storage<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:48.239> here<00:03:48.480> out<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.930> box<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:49.260> get

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
storage and here out of the box you get

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.979 
storage and here out of the box you get
9.1<00:03:50.550> 8<00:03:50.730> GB<00:03:51.360> available<00:03:51.510> out<00:03:51.930> of<00:03:51.959> 16gb<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:53.989> you

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
9.1 8 GB available out of 16gb and you

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.410 
9.1 8 GB available out of 16gb and you
can<00:03:55.170> also<00:03:55.410> check<00:03:56.250> out<00:03:56.430> what<00:03:56.670> all<00:03:56.880> has<00:03:57.180> been

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
can also check out what all has been

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.670 
can also check out what all has been
installed<00:03:57.840> on<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.080> device<00:03:58.140> under<00:03:58.620> the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
applications area so that's about it let

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.530 
applications area so that's about it let
me<00:04:01.140> quickly<00:04:01.350> capture<00:04:01.860> a<00:04:02.130> few<00:04:02.730> photos<00:04:03.120> with<00:04:03.330> the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
camera and show you the samples of the

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.820 
camera and show you the samples of the
same<00:04:08.840> talking<00:04:09.840> about<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.140> camera<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.590> comes

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
same talking about the camera it comes

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.410 
same talking about the camera it comes
with<00:04:11.040> some<00:04:11.250> interesting<00:04:11.609> effects<00:04:12.269> like

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
with some interesting effects like

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.690 
with some interesting effects like
normal<00:04:12.900> beautify<00:04:13.350> HTM

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
normal beautify HTM

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.210 
normal beautify HTM
now<00:04:14.849> chief<00:04:15.390> mode<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:15.900> again<00:04:16.859> very<00:04:17.130> interesting

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
now chief mode is again very interesting

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.730 
now chief mode is again very interesting
if<00:04:17.730> you<00:04:17.850> would<00:04:17.970> like<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.450> take<00:04:19.230> a<00:04:19.260> gif<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:20.790> some

specific moment and plate continiously
so<00:04:26.070> let's<00:04:26.430> try<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.210> see<00:04:27.570> that<00:04:29.780> it's<00:04:30.780> saving<00:04:31.200> the

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
so let's try to see that it's saving the

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.350 
so let's try to see that it's saving the
same<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:32.639> best<00:04:32.790> part<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.180> can

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
from the 8 megapixel camera not that

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.969 
from the 8 megapixel camera not that
great<00:05:02.190> but<00:05:02.460> it's<00:05:03.030> very<00:05:03.150> decent<00:05:03.660> enough<00:05:03.979> again

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
great but it's very decent enough again

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.650 
great but it's very decent enough again
this<00:05:05.160> is<00:05:05.340> not<00:05:05.490> an<00:05:05.639> flagship<00:05:06.180> device<00:05:06.450> you<00:05:06.540> can

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
this is not an flagship device you can

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.629 
this is not an flagship device you can
expect<00:05:07.020> much<00:05:07.229> and<00:05:07.440> here<00:05:07.979> is<00:05:08.070> a<00:05:08.100> capture<00:05:08.460> with

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
expect much and here is a capture with

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.930 
expect much and here is a capture with
the<00:05:08.910> 5<00:05:09.690> megapixel<00:05:09.889> front<00:05:10.889> camera<00:05:10.950> and<00:05:11.430> this

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
the 5 megapixel front camera and this

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.140 
the 5 megapixel front camera and this
also<00:05:12.180> is<00:05:12.419> grainy<00:05:12.690> but<00:05:12.990> again<00:05:13.229> this<00:05:13.950> has<00:05:14.520> a<00:05:14.940> wide

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
also is grainy but again this has a wide

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.719 
also is grainy but again this has a wide
angle<00:05:15.590> lens<00:05:16.590> on<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.919> front<00:05:16.950> which<00:05:17.310> helps<00:05:17.639> in

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
angle lens on the front which helps in

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.580 
angle lens on the front which helps in
good<00:05:17.880> selfie<00:05:18.300> photos<00:05:18.660> so<00:05:19.110> that's<00:05:19.320> about<00:05:19.440> the

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
good selfie photos so that's about the

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.469 
good selfie photos so that's about the
camera<00:05:20.070> on<00:05:20.220> this<00:05:20.460> device<00:05:20.700> now<00:05:20.940> let's<00:05:21.120> check<00:05:21.330> if

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
camera on this device now let's check if

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.930 
camera on this device now let's check if
the<00:05:21.630> device<00:05:21.840> also<00:05:22.080> supports<00:05:22.590> usb<00:05:23.190> OTG<00:05:23.220> or<00:05:23.639> not

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
the device also supports usb OTG or not

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.500 
the device also supports usb OTG or not
out<00:05:24.330> of<00:05:24.600> the<00:05:24.690> box<00:05:24.900> so<00:05:25.139> let's<00:05:25.770> insert<00:05:26.100> this<00:05:26.510> OTG

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
out of the box so let's insert this OTG

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.690 
out of the box so let's insert this OTG
Drive<00:05:27.750> and<00:05:28.110> by<00:05:28.590> default<00:05:29.039> it<00:05:29.130> does<00:05:29.280> not<00:05:29.460> support

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
Drive and by default it does not support

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.640 
Drive and by default it does not support
the<00:05:30.060> same<00:05:30.270> maybe<00:05:30.870> we'll<00:05:31.110> have<00:05:31.289> to<00:05:31.380> look<00:05:31.470> into

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
the same maybe we'll have to look into

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:39.969 
the same maybe we'll have to look into
the<00:05:31.770> settings<00:05:32.190> and<00:05:32.389> the<00:05:34.100> check<00:05:35.100> under<00:05:35.720> storage

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.020 

and<00:05:40.979> there<00:05:41.220> is<00:05:41.280> no<00:05:41.400> other<00:05:41.520> option<00:05:41.610> available

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
and there is no other option available
