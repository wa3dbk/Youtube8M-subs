00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.000 
be but it's there nonetheless the focal
length<00:05:40.800> on<00:05:41.340> that<00:05:41.400> zoom<00:05:42.210> then<00:05:42.480> is<00:05:42.750> 3<00:05:43.440> to<00:05:43.800> 30

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
length on that zoom then is 3 to 30

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.029 
length on that zoom then is 3 to 30
millimeters<00:05:44.640> and<00:05:44.910> that's<00:05:45.690> a<00:05:45.900> 35<00:05:46.860> mil

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
millimeters and that's a 35 mil

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.219 
millimeters and that's a 35 mil
equivalent<00:05:47.550> of<00:05:48.380> 42.9<00:05:49.550> to

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
equivalent of 42.9 to

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.519 
equivalent of 42.9 to
429<00:05:52.229> millimeters<00:05:52.919> as<00:05:53.669> I<00:05:53.819> mentioned<00:05:54.289> it<00:05:55.289> is

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:55.529 
429 millimeters as I mentioned it is

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:58.760 
429 millimeters as I mentioned it is
also<00:05:55.709> focus<00:05:56.339> but<00:05:57.059> unusually<00:05:57.809> also<00:05:58.259> manual

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
also focus but unusually also manual

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.969 
also focus but unusually also manual
focus<00:05:59.219> and<00:05:59.779> the<00:06:00.779> manual<00:06:01.110> focus<00:06:01.499> is<00:06:01.619> achieved

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
focus and the manual focus is achieved

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:03.949 
focus and the manual focus is achieved
actually<00:06:02.580> by<00:06:02.789> setting<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.479> switch<00:06:03.659> to<00:06:03.839> manual

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:03.959 
actually by setting the switch to manual

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:08.299 
actually by setting the switch to manual
and<00:06:05.059> then<00:06:06.499> using<00:06:07.499> the<00:06:07.589> controls<00:06:07.919> on<00:06:08.039> the<00:06:08.099> back

00:06:08.299 --> 00:06:08.309 
and then using the controls on the back

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:11.929 
and then using the controls on the back
to<00:06:08.869> finally<00:06:09.869> adjust<00:06:10.199> the<00:06:10.439> focus<00:06:10.860> finally<00:06:11.759> that

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:11.939 
to finally adjust the focus finally that

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.149 
to finally adjust the focus finally that
might<00:06:12.389> have<00:06:12.629> to<00:06:12.809> say<00:06:12.990> that<00:06:13.259> this<00:06:13.409> is<00:06:13.619> a<00:06:13.649> very

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
might have to say that this is a very

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:16.609 
might have to say that this is a very
light<00:06:14.659> came<00:06:15.659> forward<00:06:16.020> especially

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:16.619 
light came forward especially

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:19.309 
light came forward especially
considering<00:06:17.129> the<00:06:17.219> specification<00:06:18.110> it's<00:06:19.110> only

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 
considering the specification it's only

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:22.279 
considering the specification it's only
weights<00:06:19.529> 340<00:06:20.399> grams<00:06:20.689> so<00:06:21.689> holding<00:06:22.020> it<00:06:22.139> for

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
weights 340 grams so holding it for

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.859 
weights 340 grams so holding it for
extended<00:06:22.499> period<00:06:23.039> of<00:06:23.099> time<00:06:23.209> is<00:06:24.209> not<00:06:24.539> really<00:06:24.839> a

00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:24.869 
extended period of time is not really a

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:27.980 
extended period of time is not really a
problem<00:06:25.080> and<00:06:26.179> it's<00:06:27.179> certainly<00:06:27.509> small<00:06:27.809> enough

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
problem and it's certainly small enough

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.989 
problem and it's certainly small enough
to<00:06:28.729> fit<00:06:29.729> in<00:06:29.939> a<00:06:30.179> small<00:06:30.569> bag<00:06:30.779> or<00:06:31.259> maybe<00:06:32.249> a<00:06:32.699> large

00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:32.999 
to fit in a small bag or maybe a large

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:37.249 
to fit in a small bag or maybe a large
pocket<00:06:33.800> possibly<00:06:34.800> but<00:06:35.129> certainly<00:06:36.259> certainly

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 
pocket possibly but certainly certainly

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.320 
pocket possibly but certainly certainly
very<00:06:37.469> easy<00:06:37.709> to<00:06:37.889> carry<00:06:38.129> one<00:06:38.879> very<00:06:39.149> quick

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
very easy to carry one very quick

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.540 
very easy to carry one very quick
observation<00:06:40.019> is<00:06:40.199> that<00:06:40.860> it<00:06:41.039> doesn't<00:06:41.339> have<00:06:41.519> a

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
observation is that it doesn't have a

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.609 
observation is that it doesn't have a
built-in<00:06:41.819> viewfinder<00:06:42.659> so<00:06:42.899> you<00:06:42.959> do<00:06:43.229> have<00:06:43.259> to

00:06:43.609 --> 00:06:43.619 
built-in viewfinder so you do have to

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:46.969 
built-in viewfinder so you do have to
use<00:06:43.830> the<00:06:44.159> sight<00:06:44.669> display<00:06:45.149> or<00:06:45.419> else<00:06:46.349> guess

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
use the sight display or else guess

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:48.519 
use the sight display or else guess
where<00:06:47.339> you're<00:06:47.519> aiming<00:06:47.819> the<00:06:48.119> camera

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:48.529 
where you're aiming the camera

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:51.889 
where you're aiming the camera
personally<00:06:49.529> do<00:06:49.830> prefer<00:06:50.360> having<00:06:51.360> the<00:06:51.539> option

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:51.899 
personally do prefer having the option

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:54.439 
personally do prefer having the option
of<00:06:52.080> a<00:06:52.259> viewfinder<00:06:52.949> but<00:06:53.129> that's<00:06:54.119> one<00:06:54.300> of<00:06:54.389> the

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:54.449 
of a viewfinder but that's one of the

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:56.480 
of a viewfinder but that's one of the
drawbacks<00:06:54.659> of<00:06:55.050> this<00:06:55.439> small<00:06:55.709> device<00:06:55.829> but<00:06:56.430> I'm

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490 
drawbacks of this small device but I'm

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.219 
drawbacks of this small device but I'm
going<00:06:56.639> to<00:06:56.669> be<00:06:56.759> using<00:06:57.089> this<00:06:57.209> camera<00:06:57.809> over<00:06:58.139> the

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:58.229 
going to be using this camera over the

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:00.619 
going to be using this camera over the
next<00:06:58.439> few<00:06:58.680> weeks<00:06:58.829> to<00:06:59.189> record<00:07:00.149> our<00:07:00.360> unboxing

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:00.629 
next few weeks to record our unboxing

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:02.869 
next few weeks to record our unboxing
videos<00:07:01.110> and<00:07:01.559> hopefully<00:07:01.740> we'll<00:07:02.099> have<00:07:02.129> some<00:07:02.490> HD

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:02.879 
videos and hopefully we'll have some HD

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:05.989 
videos and hopefully we'll have some HD
footage<00:07:03.119> of<00:07:03.589> unboxing<00:07:04.589> of<00:07:04.740> other<00:07:04.889> devices<00:07:05.369> and

00:07:05.989 --> 00:07:05.999 
footage of unboxing of other devices and

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:08.569 
footage of unboxing of other devices and
we'll<00:07:06.689> compare<00:07:06.990> the<00:07:07.050> quality<00:07:07.289> and<00:07:07.769> write<00:07:08.430> up

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:08.579 
we'll compare the quality and write up

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:11.300 
we'll compare the quality and write up
our<00:07:08.729> full<00:07:08.939> review<00:07:09.089> to
