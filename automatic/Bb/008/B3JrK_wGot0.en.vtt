00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
rear-wheel skids on this good car as you

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.910 
rear-wheel skids on this good car as you
can<00:00:08.250> as<00:00:08.429> you'll<00:00:08.639> be<00:00:08.700> able<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:09.090> see<00:00:09.300> right<00:00:09.480> away

can as you'll be able to see right away

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.339 
can as you'll be able to see right away
we've<00:00:10.920> got<00:00:11.300> incidences<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.480> total<00:00:12.929> loss<00:00:13.139> of

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
we've got incidences of total loss of

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.849 
we've got incidences of total loss of
control<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.700> car<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.379> at<00:00:16.560> slow

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
control of the car and this is at slow

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.090 
control of the car and this is at slow
speed<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.820> at<00:00:17.970> about<00:00:18.529> 25<00:00:19.529> 30

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
speed so this is at about 25 30

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.070 
speed so this is at about 25 30
kilometers<00:00:20.789> an<00:00:20.939> hour<00:00:21.060> we're<00:00:21.449> actually<00:00:21.630> losing

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
total control of the car and we've got

00:00:30.510 --> 00:01:01.459 
total control of the car and we've got
one<00:00:30.750> more<00:00:31.019> here

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.700 

okay<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.370> we're<00:01:02.750> in<00:01:03.750> consideration<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
okay and we're in consideration of the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.460 
okay and we're in consideration of the
skid<00:01:04.979> car<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.720> again<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.110> rear-wheel

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
skid car and again this is rear-wheel

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.200 
skid car and again this is rear-wheel
skids<00:01:08.450> on<00:01:09.450> dry<00:01:09.840> pavement<00:01:10.520> thirty<00:01:11.520> kilometers

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
skids on dry pavement thirty kilometers

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:25.800 
skids on dry pavement thirty kilometers
an<00:01:12.390> hour<00:01:12.509> or<00:01:12.690> less

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.210 

and<00:01:26.940> that<00:01:27.940> concludes<00:01:28.840> our<00:01:29.200> rear<00:01:29.590> wheel<00:01:29.830> skid

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
and that concludes our rear wheel skid

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.109 
and that concludes our rear wheel skid
demonstration<00:01:32.190> now<00:01:33.190> we'll<00:01:33.460> get<00:01:33.640> set<00:01:33.909> up<00:01:33.940> for

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
demonstration now we'll get set up for

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:46.910 
demonstration now we'll get set up for
front<00:01:34.960> wheel<00:01:35.140> skids

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.140 

now<00:01:47.920> we're<00:01:48.189> going<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.460> be<00:01:48.640> demonstrating

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
now we're going to be demonstrating

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.590 
now we're going to be demonstrating
what's<00:01:50.140> called<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.619> full<00:01:50.979> slick<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:52.330> is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
what's called the full slick this is

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.560 
what's called the full slick this is
would<00:01:52.840> be<00:01:52.990> like<00:01:53.259> similar<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.490> driving<00:01:54.970> on<00:01:55.119> a<00:01:55.150> on

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
would be like similar to driving on a on

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.670 
would be like similar to driving on a on
an<00:01:55.840> icy<00:01:56.259> road

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
an icy road

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.969 
an icy road
we've<00:01:57.130> got<00:01:57.369> minimal<00:01:57.759> traction<00:01:58.390> in<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.600> front

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
we've got minimal traction in the front

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:28.780 
we've got minimal traction in the front
minimal<00:01:59.979> traction<00:02:00.549> in<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.790> back

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.580 

okay<00:02:29.790> we're<00:02:30.090> going<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.240> do<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.600> again<00:02:30.690> pull

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
okay we're going to do it again pull

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.770 
okay we're going to do it again pull
stick<00:02:31.890> we're<00:02:32.820> only<00:02:32.940> doing<00:02:33.180> about<00:02:33.360> 30

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
stick we're only doing about 30

stick we're only doing about 30
kilometres<00:02:34.440> an<00:02:34.590> hour

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:03.469 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.890 

and<00:03:04.469> that<00:03:05.129> concludes<00:03:05.639> our<00:03:05.879> full<00:03:06.209> slick<00:03:06.629> on<00:03:06.870> the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
and that concludes our full slick on the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.249 
and that concludes our full slick on the
