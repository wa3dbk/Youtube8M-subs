00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.040 
see frag turn towards the fraggin throw
it<00:02:26.740> now<00:02:26.920> keep<00:02:27.250> in<00:02:27.370> mind<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:28.030> when<00:02:28.840> we're

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
it now keep in mind that when we're

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.900 
it now keep in mind that when we're
going<00:02:29.590> back<00:02:29.770> or<00:02:29.950> needs<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.400> don't<00:02:30.640> actually

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
going back or needs you don't actually

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.360 
going back or needs you don't actually
have<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.420> throw<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:31.990> back<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.860> only<00:02:33.070> thing<00:02:33.280> you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
have to throw it back the only thing you

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.940 
have to throw it back the only thing you
have<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.550> do<00:02:33.820> is<00:02:34.000> grab<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.600> once<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.470> grab<00:02:35.920> it

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
have to do is grab it once you grab it

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.070 
have to do is grab it once you grab it
that<00:02:36.430> counts<00:02:36.700> as<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.000> thrown<00:02:37.300> back<00:02:37.480> grenade<00:02:37.840> but

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
that counts as a thrown back grenade but

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.840 
that counts as a thrown back grenade but
if<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.440> do<00:02:38.620> grab<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.370> don't<00:02:39.580> throw<00:02:39.730> it

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
if you do grab it and you don't throw it

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.940 
if you do grab it and you don't throw it
back<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.239> time<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.810> are<00:02:41.020> going<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.470> die<00:02:41.620> so

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
back in time you are going to die so

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.699 
back in time you are going to die so
that<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.310> downside<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:43.320> but<00:02:44.320> just<00:02:44.590> keep

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
that is a downside to that but just keep

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.880 
that is a downside to that but just keep
in<00:02:44.860> mind<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.250> if<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.730> do<00:02:45.940> get<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.650> throw<00:02:47.650> back

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
in mind that if you do get a throw back

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
in mind that if you do get a throw back
but<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.760> kills<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:50.200> are<00:02:50.910> you

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
but it kills you and and you are you

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.220 
but it kills you and and you are you
think<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:52.330> may<00:02:52.480> not<00:02:52.690> have<00:02:52.870> thrown<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.200> back

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
think you may not have thrown it back

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.890 
think you may not have thrown it back
because<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:53.950> blew<00:02:54.130> up<00:02:54.160> in<00:02:54.400> your<00:02:54.430> face<00:02:54.900> you're

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
because it blew up in your face you're

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.960 
because it blew up in your face you're
wrong<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.650> does<00:02:56.890> count<00:02:57.100> as<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.459> throwback

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
wrong and that does count as a throwback

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.390 
wrong and that does count as a throwback
I'm<00:02:58.360> sorry<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:58.690> sounded<00:02:58.900> really<00:02:59.350> rude<00:03:00.220> right
