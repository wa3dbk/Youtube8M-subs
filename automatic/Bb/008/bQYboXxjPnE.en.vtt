00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
it actually saves batteries so there's

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.710 
it actually saves batteries so there's
brights<00:01:58.049> non<00:01:58.740> rights<00:01:59.070> if<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:00.270> were<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.509> write

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
trust me that they work so we can kill

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.680 
trust me that they work so we can kill
it<00:02:30.730> kill<00:02:30.970> switch<00:02:31.240> right<00:02:31.420> here<00:02:33.360> take<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.510> key
