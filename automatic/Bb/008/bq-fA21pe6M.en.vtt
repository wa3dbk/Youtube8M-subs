snake we're gonna twist it in and pinch
at<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.500> end<00:03:03.820> so<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:04.850> it's<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.270> shape<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.540> a

donut now let's roll out this white

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.960 
donut now let's roll out this white
play-doh<00:03:09.380> would<00:03:09.590> make<00:03:09.740> it<00:03:09.860> nice<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:10.130> flat<00:03:10.430> and

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
play-doh would make it nice and flat and

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.250 
play-doh would make it nice and flat and
so<00:03:11.209> that<00:03:11.360> we<00:03:11.450> can<00:03:11.480> make<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:11.840> into<00:03:11.959> some

so that we can make it into some

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.240 
so that we can make it into some
frosting<00:03:12.920> for<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.550> top<00:03:13.820> of<00:03:14.090> our<00:03:14.209> donut<00:03:15.250> now
