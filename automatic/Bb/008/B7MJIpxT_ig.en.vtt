a 95 Jeep Grand Cherokee it's a v6
4-wheel<00:00:07.109> Drive<00:00:07.790> we're<00:00:08.790> gonna<00:00:09.059> change<00:00:09.360> the

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
4-wheel Drive we're gonna change the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.280 
4-wheel Drive we're gonna change the
rear<00:00:09.840> differential<00:00:10.340> gasket<00:00:11.340> right<00:00:11.759> here

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
rear differential gasket right here

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.330 
rear differential gasket right here
well<00:00:13.290> that's<00:00:13.410> supposed<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.679> be<00:00:13.740> right<00:00:13.980> here

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
well that's supposed to be right here

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.790 
well that's supposed to be right here
along<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.670> side<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:17.330> as<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.660> can<00:00:18.750> see<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
along the side and as you can see the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.599 
along the side and as you can see the
bolts<00:00:20.100> should<00:00:20.570> be<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.930> think<00:00:22.560> 1012<00:00:23.310> bolts

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
bolts should be I think 1012 bolts

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.849 
bolts should be I think 1012 bolts
that's<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.750> size<00:00:24.930> 13<00:00:25.460> I'm<00:00:26.460> using<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.880> as<00:00:27.859> to

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
that's a size 13 I'm using this as to

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.500 
that's a size 13 I'm using this as to
open<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.130> up<00:00:29.250> breaker<00:00:29.519> bar<00:00:29.760> with<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> one-inch

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
open it up breaker bar with a one-inch

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.799 
open it up breaker bar with a one-inch
extension<00:00:31.260> with<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> 13<00:00:32.239> that's<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.719> to

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
extension with a 13 that's to just to

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.319 
extension with a 13 that's to just to
break<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.170> just<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.710> open<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.430> once

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
break it just to open it up and once

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.810 
break it just to open it up and once
that<00:00:36.570> once<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.079> open<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.550> I'll<00:00:38.550> show<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that once I open it up I'll show the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.470 
that once I open it up I'll show the
inside<00:00:40.399> cuz<00:00:41.399> then<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> already<00:00:42.239> disconnected

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
inside cuz then I already disconnected

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.510 
inside cuz then I already disconnected
most<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.079> bullets<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:43.649> now<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
most of the bullets on here now the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.000 
most of the bullets on here now the
trick<00:00:44.789> about<00:00:44.910> differentials<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.739> jeeps

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
trick about differentials on the jeeps

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.880 
trick about differentials on the jeeps
is<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:48.110> since<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.230> doesn't<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:49.649> have

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
is that since this doesn't actually have

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.650 
is that since this doesn't actually have
a<00:00:49.920> drain<00:00:50.219> plug<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.940> only<00:00:51.180> way<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.360> actually

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
a drain plug the only way to actually

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.560 
a drain plug the only way to actually
change<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.350> fluid<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:54.030> literally<00:00:54.270> take

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
change this fluid is to literally take

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.720 
change this fluid is to literally take
off<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.840> cover<00:00:55.070> now<00:00:56.070> once<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.309> take<00:00:56.460> off<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
off this cover now once we take off the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.369 
off this cover now once we take off the
cover<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> change<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> gas<00:00:57.930> t<00:00:58.079> it's

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
cover you have to change the gas t it's

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.590 
cover you have to change the gas t it's
a<00:00:58.440> must

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
a must

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.180 
a must
there's<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.840> trick<00:01:01.079> with<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.379> those<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.680> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
there's a trick with this those that you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.119 
there's a trick with this those that you
have<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.609> able<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.239> slide<00:01:04.129> whatever

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
have to be able to just slide whatever

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.539 
have to be able to just slide whatever
you<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.630> inside<00:01:06.630> here<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:07.590> far<00:01:07.979> enough<00:01:08.100> to

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
you have inside here just far enough to

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.960 
you have inside here just far enough to
crack<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.540> open<00:01:10.400> so<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.670> don't<00:01:11.850> mess

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
crack it open so that you don't mess

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.600 
crack it open so that you don't mess
yourself<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.570> or<00:01:13.729> your<00:01:14.729> tools<00:01:15.439> and<00:01:16.610> absolute

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
yourself up or your tools and absolute

yourself up or your tools and absolute
Rick<00:01:17.900> it's<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.259> crack<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.650> open<00:01:19.740> just

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
Rick it's just to crack it open just

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.410 
Rick it's just to crack it open just
enough<00:01:21.439> so<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.890> able<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.310> leak<00:01:23.610> out<00:01:23.790> all<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
enough so it is able to leak out all the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.780 
enough so it is able to leak out all the
fluids<00:01:25.189> and<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.670> don't<00:01:27.180> get<00:01:27.270> any<00:01:27.450> mess<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
fluids and you don't get any mess on you

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.190 
fluids and you don't get any mess on you
and<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.540> anywhere<00:01:32.750> without<00:01:33.750> any

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and you can do this anywhere without any

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.460 
and you can do this anywhere without any
bit<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.619> trouble<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.100> you

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.520 

hi<00:01:41.470> guys<00:01:42.570> now<00:01:43.570> I'm<00:01:43.810> taking<00:01:43.990> out<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.350> last

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
hi guys now I'm taking out the last

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.790 
hi guys now I'm taking out the last
three<00:01:44.920> bolts<00:01:45.250> that<00:01:45.460> were<00:01:45.580> holding<00:01:45.610> it<00:01:45.970> in<00:01:46.800> and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
three bolts that were holding it in and

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.270 
three bolts that were holding it in and
pretty<00:01:48.040> much<00:01:48.159> just<00:01:48.220> holding<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:48.909> cover<00:01:53.280> well

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
pretty much just holding the cover well

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.810 
pretty much just holding the cover well
I<00:01:54.310> think<00:01:54.520> holding<00:01:54.880> its<00:01:55.000> cover<00:01:55.150> now<00:01:55.360> is<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
I think holding its cover now is the

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.760 
I think holding its cover now is the
seal<00:02:00.479> there<00:02:01.479> now<00:02:01.930> for<00:02:02.110> those<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.229> you<00:02:02.470> who<00:02:02.650> do

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
seal there now for those of you who do

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.550 
seal there now for those of you who do
not<00:02:02.920> want<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.190> get<00:02:03.310> messy<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.990> is<00:02:05.110> not<00:02:05.290> a<00:02:05.320> job

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
not want to get messy this is not a job

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:15.760 
not want to get messy this is not a job
shoot<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.790> guys

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.420 

and<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.960> my<00:02:17.960> friends<00:02:18.440> is<00:02:18.740> what<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.190> inside

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
and that my friends is what the inside

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.460 
and that my friends is what the inside
of<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.640> differential<00:02:20.030> looks<00:02:20.360> like<00:02:23.200> as<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.350> can

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
of a differential looks like as you can

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.790 
of a differential looks like as you can
see<00:02:24.650> it's<00:02:24.920> very<00:02:25.190> black<00:02:25.430> very<00:02:25.760> worn<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:27.050> this

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
see it's very black very worn and this

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.220 
see it's very black very worn and this
comes<00:02:28.070> from<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.460> changing<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.390> fluid<00:02:29.690> and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
comes from that changing the fluid and

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.360 
comes from that changing the fluid and
time<00:02:34.660> alright<00:02:35.660> guys<00:02:35.840> as<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.770> can<00:02:36.890> see<00:02:37.040> we<00:02:37.220> have

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
time alright guys as you can see we have

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.430 
time alright guys as you can see we have
the<00:02:37.520> gas<00:02:38.060> but<00:02:38.240> all<00:02:38.360> if<00:02:38.450> we<00:02:38.570> cleaned<00:02:38.810> up<00:02:38.990> both

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
the gas but all if we cleaned up both

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
couple dabs just to make

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.479 
couple dabs just to make
our<00:03:35.299> gaskets<00:03:36.299> down<00:03:36.540> here

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:50.510 

not<00:03:42.489> too<00:03:42.730> much<00:03:42.970> just<00:03:43.239> enough

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.130 

you<00:03:51.030> don't<00:03:51.180> add<00:03:51.420> an<00:03:51.600> excessive<00:03:52.050> amount

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
you don't add an excessive amount

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.680 
you don't add an excessive amount
because<00:03:52.650> then<00:03:52.950> what<00:03:53.550> will<00:03:53.670> happen<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:54.150> the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
because then what will happen is the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.880 
because then what will happen is the
gasket<00:03:55.220> will<00:03:56.220> not<00:03:56.400> be<00:03:56.580> able<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:56.940> seat<00:03:57.360> properly

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
gasket will not be able to seat properly

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.940 
gasket will not be able to seat properly
and<00:03:59.060> we're<00:04:00.060> gonna<00:04:00.150> have<00:04:00.360> bulges<00:04:01.260> where<00:04:01.800> we

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
and we're gonna have bulges where we

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.460 
and we're gonna have bulges where we
shouldn't<00:04:02.250> have<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.780> might<00:04:04.260> cause

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
shouldn't have and that might cause

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.450 
shouldn't have and that might cause
leaking<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:06.030> we<00:04:06.120> don't<00:04:06.240> want<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:06.480> so<00:04:07.460> we're

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
leaking so we don't want that so we're

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.730 
leaking so we don't want that so we're
just<00:04:08.490> putting<00:04:08.730> enough<00:04:09.240> so<00:04:09.660> we<00:04:10.380> have<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.560> nice

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.630 

as<00:04:44.940> all<00:04:45.840> caskets<00:04:46.410> do<00:04:46.650> they<00:04:47.070> have<00:04:47.190> a<00:04:47.220> front<00:04:47.520> and

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
there's a rough side now the rough side

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.060 
there's a rough side now the rough side
is<00:04:57.570> gonna<00:04:57.780> face<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:59.220> housing<00:04:59.580> right<00:04:59.730> here<00:05:01.070> so

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
is gonna face the housing right here so

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.960 
is gonna face the housing right here so
the<00:05:02.880> smooth<00:05:03.150> side<00:05:03.510> is<00:05:03.810> gonna<00:05:04.500> face<00:05:04.650> this<00:05:04.970> the
