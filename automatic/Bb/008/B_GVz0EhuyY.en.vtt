00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:37.249 
we got some other issues here once again
we<00:01:31.240> have<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.799> know<00:01:32.920> aftermarket<00:01:33.700> parts<00:01:33.999> and

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.469 

you<00:01:38.259> know<00:01:38.289> there's<00:01:38.560> always<00:01:39.270> get<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.329> better

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
you know there's always get a better

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.719 
you know there's always get a better
angle<00:01:40.719> here<00:01:41.109> maybe<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.990> is

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.819 

that's<00:01:48.689> pretty<00:01:48.960> loose<00:01:49.140> for<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> new<00:01:49.530> timing

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
that's pretty loose for a new timing

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:59.209 
that's pretty loose for a new timing
change<00:01:50.930> okay<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.610> want<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> compare<00:01:58.009> this<00:01:59.009> is

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
change okay so I want to compare this is

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.990 
change okay so I want to compare this is
the<00:01:59.570> original<00:02:00.570> chain<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.820> don't<00:02:02.820> know<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:02.939> you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the original chain I don't know if you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.169 
the original chain I don't know if you
can<00:02:03.119> see<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:04.319> about<00:02:04.679> twice<00:02:05.069> the<00:02:05.179> as

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
can see that it's about twice the as

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.080 
can see that it's about twice the as
much<00:02:06.450> beef<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.860> actually<00:02:08.700> this

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
much beef in there and actually this

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.759 
much beef in there and actually this
chain<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.660> very<00:02:10.550> stiff<00:02:11.550> yet<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:13.590> what<00:02:13.680> I'm

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
chain is very stiff yet so what I'm

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:14.780 
chain is very stiff yet so what I'm
going<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.920> do<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.130> I'm<00:02:14.250> going<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> clean<00:02:14.610> up

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
going to do is I'm going to clean up

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.699 
going to do is I'm going to clean up
this<00:02:14.940> chain<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.930> we're<00:02:16.049> gonna<00:02:16.140> try<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.560> on

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
this chain and we're gonna try it on

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.180 
this chain and we're gonna try it on
there<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.330> see<00:02:18.330> if<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.349> tightens<00:02:19.769> it<00:02:19.830> up<00:02:19.950> I'm

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
there and see if it tightens it up I'm

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.710 
there and see if it tightens it up I'm
gonna<00:02:20.280> make<00:02:20.459> sure<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:20.760> get<00:02:21.000> this<00:02:21.150> really<00:02:21.450> clean

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
gonna make sure I get this really clean

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.390 
gonna make sure I get this really clean

cleaned up and blow it off we're gonna
try<00:02:32.549> this<00:02:32.610> chain<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.390> see<00:02:33.569> if<00:02:33.660> it's

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
try this chain just to see if it's

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.470 
try this chain just to see if it's
tighter<00:02:34.340> than<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.579> new<00:02:35.760> one<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.030> do<00:02:36.209> have<00:02:36.420> a

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
tighter than the new one I do have a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.259 
tighter than the new one I do have a
little<00:02:36.840> bit<00:02:36.959> aware<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.440> my<00:02:37.590> gears<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.940> didn't

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
little bit aware of my gears so I didn't

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.699 
little bit aware of my gears so I didn't
that's<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.720> main<00:02:39.930> reason<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.380> wanted<00:02:40.590> to

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
that's the main reason I wanted to

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:48.289 
that's the main reason I wanted to
change<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:42.500> but<00:02:43.500> that's<00:02:44.269> to<00:02:45.269> me<00:02:45.450> that's<00:02:47.299> that's

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
change it but that's to me that's that's

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.600 
change it but that's to me that's that's
to<00:02:48.690> loose<00:02:48.930> as<00:02:49.230> far<00:02:49.410> as<00:02:49.500> I'm<00:02:49.680> concerned<00:02:50.160> for<00:02:50.549> a

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
to loose as far as I'm concerned for a

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.599 
to loose as far as I'm concerned for a
brand<00:02:50.849> new<00:02:50.910> chain<00:02:51.239> it's<00:02:51.510> brackets<00:02:52.019> so<00:02:52.609> well

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
brand new chain it's brackets so well

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.940 
brand new chain it's brackets so well
the<00:02:54.120> saga<00:02:54.389> continues<00:02:57.380> okay<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.410> put<00:02:58.799> the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
the saga continues okay I put the

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.559 
the saga continues okay I put the
original<00:02:59.760> chain<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.569> with<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.530> new<00:03:01.680> gears<00:03:02.569> and

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
original chain on with the new gears and

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.720 
original chain on with the new gears and
I<00:03:03.780> don't<00:03:03.989> know<00:03:04.079> if<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.290> can<00:03:04.500> see<00:03:04.799> it<00:03:04.950> very<00:03:05.190> well

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
I don't know if you can see it very well

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.090 
I don't know if you can see it very well
but<00:03:07.489> it's<00:03:08.489> extremely<00:03:09.380> tight<00:03:10.380> compared<00:03:10.920> to

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
but it's extremely tight compared to

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.050 
but it's extremely tight compared to
what<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:12.380> loose<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.650> flimsy<00:03:14.010> thing<00:03:14.519> is<00:03:14.760> I

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
what this loose and flimsy thing is I

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.979 
what this loose and flimsy thing is I
mean<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.660> thing<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.389> basically<00:03:18.870> a

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
mean this thing is this is basically a

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.069 
mean this thing is this is basically a
joke<00:03:20.780> compared<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.900> what<00:03:22.109> I<00:03:22.590> took<00:03:23.100> off<00:03:24.019> so<00:03:25.019> I

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
joke compared to what I took off so I

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.870 
joke compared to what I took off so I
guess<00:03:25.319> I'm<00:03:25.530> thinking<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.280> maybe<00:03:26.489> the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
guess I'm thinking that maybe the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.870 
guess I'm thinking that maybe the
gentleman<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:29.150> had<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.329> new<00:03:30.900> chain<00:03:31.200> put<00:03:31.440> on

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
gentleman that had the new chain put on

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.860 
gentleman that had the new chain put on
shortly<00:03:33.230> prior<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.290> parking<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.220> car<00:03:35.780> now<00:03:36.780> the

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
shortly prior to parking the car now the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.800 
shortly prior to parking the car now the
sprockets<00:03:37.440> had<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.620> little<00:03:37.769> wear<00:03:37.950> on<00:03:38.160> them<00:03:38.310> but

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
sprockets had a little wear on them but

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.569 
sprockets had a little wear on them but
this<00:03:39.810> chain<00:03:40.139> is<00:03:40.349> stiff<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.950> mean<00:03:41.190> it's<00:03:41.340> real

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
this chain is stiff I mean it's real

it and it looks like a brand new chain
and<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.090> fits<00:03:48.299> real<00:03:48.480> nice<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.970> that's<00:03:50.970> what

I'm gonna use

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.149 
I'm gonna use
so<00:03:53.389> once<00:03:54.389> again<00:03:54.599> aftermarket<00:03:55.470> parts<00:03:55.860> they'll

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
so once again aftermarket parts they'll

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.850 
so once again aftermarket parts they'll
work<00:03:56.720> but<00:03:57.720> they're<00:03:57.900> just<00:03:58.140> not<00:03:58.290> as<00:03:58.530> good<00:03:58.680> as

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
work but they're just not as good as

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.610 
work but they're just not as good as
what<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.220> original<00:03:59.250> was

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
what the original was

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.680 
what the original was
