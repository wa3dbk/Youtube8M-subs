couple<00:00:07.440> guys<00:00:07.589> on<00:00:07.710> internet<00:00:08.220> trying<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.519> figure

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
couple guys on internet trying to figure

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.259 
couple guys on internet trying to figure
this<00:00:08.790> thing<00:00:08.849> out

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
this thing out

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.770 
this thing out
and<00:00:09.360> no<00:00:09.960> one<00:00:10.080> had<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> real<00:00:10.440> answer<00:00:11.450> this<00:00:12.450> car

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
and no one had a real answer this car

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.860 
and no one had a real answer this car
came<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.110> it's<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.620> 2005<00:00:14.340> x5<00:00:14.880> with<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.450> 3<00:00:15.690> liter

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
came in it's a 2005 x5 with the 3 liter

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.429 
came in it's a 2005 x5 with the 3 liter
in<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.789> had<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> blown<00:00:18.570> fuse<00:00:18.600> for<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.289> AC

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
in it had a blown fuse for the AC

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.710 
in it had a blown fuse for the AC
circuit<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.160> whole<00:00:20.430> display<00:00:20.789> unit<00:00:21.480> air

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
circuit so the whole display unit air

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.269 
circuit so the whole display unit air
was<00:00:22.080> off<00:00:22.850> is<00:00:23.960> theirs<00:00:24.960> fuse<00:00:25.380> number<00:00:25.680> 48<00:00:25.980> was<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
was off is theirs fuse number 48 was a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.609 
was off is theirs fuse number 48 was a
7.5<00:00:26.880> PAMP<00:00:27.420> fuse

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
7.5 PAMP fuse

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.589 
7.5 PAMP fuse
put<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.220> new<00:00:29.429> fuse<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.150> pop<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.570> right

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
put the new fuse in it and pop it right

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.990 
put the new fuse in it and pop it right
away<00:00:30.990> first<00:00:31.650> two<00:00:31.920> three<00:00:32.189> times<00:00:32.369> putting<00:00:32.850> new

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
away first two three times putting new

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.299 
away first two three times putting new
fuse<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.510> would<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.920> after<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.100> it

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
fuse in it would do it after that it

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.740 
fuse in it would do it after that it
would<00:00:35.399> actually<00:00:35.790> function<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.510> rest<00:00:36.660> of

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
would actually function for the rest of

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.420 
would actually function for the rest of
the<00:00:36.840> day<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.260> I've<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:37.890> heard<00:00:38.190> guys

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the day and I've actually heard guys

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.310 
the day and I've actually heard guys
saying<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.420> would<00:00:39.480> blow<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.899> maybe<00:00:40.050> once

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
saying that it would blow it maybe once

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.190 
saying that it would blow it maybe once
a<00:00:40.440> month<00:00:40.620> or<00:00:40.860> something<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.930> there<00:00:42.930> is

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
a month or something like that there is

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.630 
a month or something like that there is
a<00:00:43.260> couple<00:00:43.559> things<00:00:43.770> first<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.219> factory

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
a couple things first the factory

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.299 
a couple things first the factory
released<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.590> bullets<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.739> technical<00:00:47.129> bolt

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
released a bullets and technical bolt

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.150 
released a bullets and technical bolt
and<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.030> issue<00:00:48.950> one<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and if you have this issue one of the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.350 
and if you have this issue one of the
main<00:00:50.309> things<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.579> want<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.820> check<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.090> first

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
main things you want to check for first

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.279 
main things you want to check for first
is<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:52.020> chafe<00:00:52.289> wires<00:00:53.300> well<00:00:54.300> usually<00:00:54.660> they<00:00:55.110> say

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
is for chafe wires well usually they say

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.229 
is for chafe wires well usually they say
to<00:00:55.350> pull<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.949> out<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.550> basically<00:00:56.850> want<00:00:57.180> to

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
to pull it out is you basically want to

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.900 
to pull it out is you basically want to
pull<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.780> now<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.980> use<00:00:59.430> pop

pull a see you now this one just use pop
it<00:01:00.090> out<00:01:00.149> from<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.629> sides<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.020> put<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
it out from the sides you put like a

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.650 
it out from the sides you put like a
little<00:01:01.440> wedge<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.949> here<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.180> both<00:01:03.600> sides

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
little wedge in here in it on both sides

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.640 
little wedge in here in it on both sides
and<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.559> should<00:01:04.739> pop<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.070> out<00:01:06.020> but<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.590> you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
and you should pop it out but if you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.039 
and you should pop it out but if you
pull<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.220> glovebox<00:01:08.549> out<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.840> whole

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
pull the glovebox out this whole

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.830 
pull the glovebox out this whole
assembly<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.890> want<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> do<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.280> both<00:01:11.430> sides

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
assembly you want to do on both sides

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.240 
assembly you want to do on both sides
right<00:01:12.840> around<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.409> harness<00:01:13.770> comes<00:01:14.070> down

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
right around here the harness comes down

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.130 
right around here the harness comes down
and<00:01:14.610> there's<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.000> bracing<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
and there's the bracing be for the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.770 
and there's the bracing be for the
instrument<00:01:16.590> panel<00:01:16.619> or<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.210> panel

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
instrument panel or this the panel

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.840 
instrument panel or this the panel
actually<00:01:18.869> bolts<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> bolts<00:01:20.759> are

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
actually bolts to and then a bolts are

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.020 
actually bolts to and then a bolts are
on<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.000> heater<00:01:21.150> box<00:01:21.330> there<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.710> some<00:01:23.430> sharp

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
on the heater box there is some sharp

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.870 
on the heater box there is some sharp
edges<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:25.650> when<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> harness<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.670> gets

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
edges that the when the harness it gets

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.870 
edges that the when the harness it gets
close<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:28.259> rub<00:01:28.740> against<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.280> cause

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
close to and can rub against and cause

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.390 
close to and can rub against and cause
shorting<00:01:30.360> out<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> harness<00:01:32.070> so

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
shorting out of the harness so

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.760 
shorting out of the harness so
especially<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.420> those<00:01:33.540> very<00:01:34.170> random

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
especially for those very random

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.920 
especially for those very random
occurrences<00:01:35.490> where<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.329> happens<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.900> know

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
occurrences where it happens you know

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.230 
occurrences where it happens you know
here<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.500> there<00:01:37.610> definitely<00:01:38.610> want<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.090> check

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
here and there definitely want to check

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.510 
here and there definitely want to check
that<00:01:39.420> first<00:01:39.630> make<00:01:40.290> sure<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.799> no<00:01:41.009> exposed

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that first make sure you have no exposed

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.870 
that first make sure you have no exposed
wires<00:01:41.850> there<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.990> some<00:01:43.950> shielding<00:01:44.729> they

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
wires there is a some shielding they

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.870 
wires there is a some shielding they
sell<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.140> dealer<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:47.520> put<00:01:47.700> on

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
sell at the dealer that you can put on

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.789 
sell at the dealer that you can put on
those<00:01:48.240> sharp<00:01:48.509> edges<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.840> prevent<00:01:49.229> any<00:01:49.439> further

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
those sharp edges to prevent any further

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.460 
those sharp edges to prevent any further
issues<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.299> your<00:01:51.479> case

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
issues with that if that is your case

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.550 
issues with that if that is your case
this<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> 2005<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.149> think<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.899> was<00:01:55.049> taken

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
this is a 2005 I think that was taken

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.060 
this is a 2005 I think that was taken
care<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:56.090> previously<00:01:57.979> through<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
care of previously through the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.530 
care of previously through the
manufacturing<00:01:59.579> process<00:01:59.969> because<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.299> pulled

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
manufacturing process because we pulled

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.389 
manufacturing process because we pulled
this<00:02:00.659> one<00:02:00.810> apart<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.740> already<00:02:02.040> had<00:02:02.159> all<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
this one apart and I already had all the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.910 
this one apart and I already had all the
guards<00:02:02.820> installed<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.509> those<00:02:04.290> edges<00:02:04.469> I

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
guards installed on those edges I

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.740 
guards installed on those edges I
definitely<00:02:05.790> want<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.939> check<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.149> make<00:02:06.630> sure

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
definitely want to check that make sure

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.609 
definitely want to check that make sure
that's<00:02:06.869> okay<00:02:08.000> this<00:02:09.000> one<00:02:09.209> actually<00:02:09.479> turned<00:02:10.470> out

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
that's okay this one actually turned out

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.750 
that's okay this one actually turned out
to<00:02:10.800> be

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
to be

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.570 
to be
yeah<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:13.230> hard<00:02:13.409> to<00:02:13.500> tell<00:02:13.709> what<00:02:14.099> that<00:02:14.129> fuse

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
yeah it's hard to tell what that fuse

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.280 
yeah it's hard to tell what that fuse
feat<00:02:14.909> because<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.540> goes<00:02:15.659> directly<00:02:16.019> into<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
feat because it goes directly into the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.690 
feat because it goes directly into the
control<00:02:16.650> unit<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.069> does<00:02:17.250> not<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:17.610> an

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
control unit and it does not have an

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.600 
control unit and it does not have an
explanation<00:02:17.970> as<00:02:18.930> far<00:02:19.140> as<00:02:19.230> what<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.799> all<00:02:20.310> is

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
explanation as far as what is all is

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.860 
explanation as far as what is all is
involved<00:02:20.879> on<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.390> because<00:02:21.569> there's<00:02:21.780> a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
involved on that because there's a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.740 
involved on that because there's a
multiple<00:02:22.319> circuits<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.860> has<00:02:23.670> power<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.629> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
multiple circuits that has power to the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.380 
multiple circuits that has power to the
control<00:02:25.080> unit<00:02:25.400> so<00:02:26.400> what<00:02:26.670> we<00:02:26.760> did<00:02:26.879> is<00:02:27.000> process

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
control unit so what we did is process

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.670 
control unit so what we did is process
of<00:02:27.480> elimination<00:02:27.840> we<00:02:27.989> check<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.379> make<00:02:28.500> sure<00:02:28.560> all

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
of elimination we check to make sure all

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.039 
of elimination we check to make sure all
the<00:02:28.920> stepper<00:02:29.129> motors<00:02:29.489> were<00:02:29.580> working<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.239> free

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
the stepper motors were working and free

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.009 
the stepper motors were working and free
of<00:02:31.170> binding<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.150> more<00:02:33.450> common<00:02:33.870> thing

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
of binding that the more common thing

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.729 
of binding that the more common thing
that<00:02:34.830> you'll<00:02:35.069> find<00:02:36.260> actually<00:02:37.260> had<00:02:37.590> some

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
that you'll find actually had some

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.410 
that you'll find actually had some
advice<00:02:37.950> from<00:02:38.129> another<00:02:39.000> tech<00:02:39.590> back<00:02:40.590> these<00:02:41.420> you

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
advice from another tech back these you

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.990 
advice from another tech back these you
want<00:02:42.599> to<00:02:42.659> make<00:02:42.840> sure<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.530> high<00:02:44.010> current

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.170 

consumers<00:02:48.000> on<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.870> AC<00:02:49.170> circuit<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:51.000> want

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
consumers on the AC circuit is you want

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.610 
consumers on the AC circuit is you want
to<00:02:51.209> check<00:02:51.420> for<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.720> heater<00:02:51.930> valve<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.440> one

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
to check for the heater valve this one

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.289 
to check for the heater valve this one
actually<00:02:52.799> has<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.099> dual<00:02:53.310> valve<00:02:53.640> setup<00:02:54.030> there's

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
actually has a dual valve setup there's

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.530 
actually has a dual valve setup there's
actually<00:02:54.629> two<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:56.190> open<00:02:56.519> up<00:02:56.609> and<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:56.910> lot

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
actually two that open up and a lot

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.839 
actually two that open up and a lot
pulling<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.049> flow<00:02:58.310> through<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.430> heater<00:02:59.609> core

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
pulling to flow through the heater core

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.210 
pulling to flow through the heater core
itself<00:03:00.349> those<00:03:01.400> supply<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.810> higher<00:03:03.810> demand<00:03:04.799> and

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
itself those supply a higher demand and

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.910 
itself those supply a higher demand and
as<00:03:05.760> well<00:03:05.970> as<00:03:06.090> down<00:03:06.299> here<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:07.620> have<00:03:07.799> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
as well as down here you have the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.430 
as well as down here you have the
axillary<00:03:08.310> water<00:03:08.640> pump<00:03:09.109> which<00:03:10.109> is<00:03:10.140> also

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
axillary water pump which is also

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.580 
axillary water pump which is also
another<00:03:10.799> current<00:03:11.629> in<00:03:12.629> our<00:03:12.870> case<00:03:13.170> we<00:03:13.470> actually

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
another current in our case we actually

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.150 
another current in our case we actually
had<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.549> axillary<00:03:14.940> water<00:03:15.150> pump<00:03:15.420> fail<00:03:16.160> which

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
had the axillary water pump fail which

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.020 
had the axillary water pump fail which
caused<00:03:17.750> from<00:03:18.750> what<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:18.930> can<00:03:19.380> gather<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.940> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
caused from what I can gather is in the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.240 
caused from what I can gather is in the
morning<00:03:21.389> it<00:03:21.480> would<00:03:21.959> be<00:03:22.049> bound<00:03:22.260> up<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.859> so<00:03:23.040> when

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
morning it would be bound up and so when

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.220 
morning it would be bound up and so when
it<00:03:23.400> would<00:03:23.489> try<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.730> get<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.389> same<00:03:24.569> moving<00:03:24.989> or

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
it would try to get the same moving or

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.259 
it would try to get the same moving or
spinning<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:26.459> would<00:03:26.579> blow<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:27.000> fuse

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
spinning it would blow that fuse

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.110 
spinning it would blow that fuse
automatically<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.799> once<00:03:29.099> it<00:03:29.250> freed<00:03:29.579> itself<00:03:29.730> up

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
automatically so once it freed itself up

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.539 
automatically so once it freed itself up
it<00:03:30.720> was<00:03:30.870> able<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.139> work<00:03:31.380> but<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.980> know<00:03:32.099> under

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
it was able to work but you know under

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.099 
it was able to work but you know under
normal<00:03:32.849> loaded<00:03:33.329> conditions<00:03:33.840> for<00:03:34.049> the

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
normal loaded conditions for the

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.830 
normal loaded conditions for the
electrical<00:03:34.410> system<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.269> that's<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.450> you<00:03:36.810> know

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
electrical system and that's a you know

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.220 
electrical system and that's a you know
is<00:03:37.200> fairly<00:03:38.040> random<00:03:38.489> at<00:03:38.669> that<00:03:38.880> so<00:03:39.599> we'll<00:03:39.989> put

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
is fairly random at that so we'll put

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.610 
is fairly random at that so we'll put
the<00:03:40.319> new<00:03:40.349> pump<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.829> it<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:42.019> we<00:03:43.019> had<00:03:43.139> no<00:03:43.349> other

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
the new pump in it and we had no other

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.470 
the new pump in it and we had no other
issues<00:03:44.010> from<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.430> point<00:03:44.639> on<00:03:44.849> but<00:03:45.060> definitely

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
issues from that point on but definitely

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
issues from that point on but definitely
if<00:03:45.569> it's<00:03:45.750> something<00:03:46.049> you're<00:03:46.200> dealing<00:03:46.470> with

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
if it's something you're dealing with

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.490 
if it's something you're dealing with
the<00:03:46.950> best<00:03:47.099> thing<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.310> do<00:03:47.489> is<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.880> unplug<00:03:48.500> the

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
the best thing to do is to unplug the

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.349 
the best thing to do is to unplug the
the<00:03:50.280> component<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:50.819> you<00:03:50.940> think<00:03:51.150> might<00:03:51.329> be

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359
