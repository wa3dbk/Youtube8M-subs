the<00:02:42.440> times<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.770> don't<00:02:42.950> really<00:02:43.099> need

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
the times you don't really need

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.780 
the times you don't really need
preloading<00:02:44.360> it's<00:02:44.660> I<00:02:44.870> mean<00:02:45.020> it's<00:02:45.050> good<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.410> have

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
preloading it's I mean it's good to have

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.059 
preloading it's I mean it's good to have
but<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:47.030> don't<00:02:47.270> exactly<00:02:47.560> need<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:48.800> for

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
but you don't exactly need it for

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.699 
but you don't exactly need it for
everything<00:02:49.489> like<00:02:50.000> if<00:02:50.239> I<00:02:50.360> characters<00:02:51.140> jumping

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
everything like if I characters jumping

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.800 
everything like if I characters jumping
he's<00:02:51.829> doing<00:02:52.069> eight<00:02:52.310> like<00:02:53.209> a

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
he's doing eight like a

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.570 
he's doing eight like a
or<00:02:54.050> you<00:02:54.650> know<00:02:54.680> he's<00:02:54.920> hitting<00:02:55.250> somebody<00:02:55.400> is

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
or you know he's hitting somebody is

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.059 
or you know he's hitting somebody is
going<00:02:55.760> whap<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:56.959> don't<00:02:57.620> really<00:02:57.739> need<00:02:57.980> to

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
going whap you don't really need to

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.920 
going whap you don't really need to
preload<00:02:58.489> those<00:02:58.730> type<00:02:58.970> sounds<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.510> just<00:02:59.720> have

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
preload those type sounds you just have

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.229 
preload those type sounds you just have
them<00:03:00.110> inside<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:00.920> game<00:03:01.099> engine<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.640> then

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
them inside the game engine and then

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.050 
them inside the game engine and then
uses<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.690> play<00:03:03.080> animation<00:03:03.680> or<00:03:04.160> place<00:03:04.459> out<00:03:04.760> no

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
uses a play animation or place out no

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.660 
uses a play animation or place out no
looping<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.810> then<00:03:05.959> you're<00:03:06.260> good<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.440> go<00:03:06.670> okay

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
looping and then you're good to go okay

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.180 
looping and then you're good to go okay
on<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.239> door<00:03:08.450> it's<00:03:09.370> basically<00:03:11.380> if<00:03:12.380> the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
on the door it's basically if the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.309 
on the door it's basically if the
players<00:03:13.430> overlapping<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.540> yellows<00:03:15.080> fight

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
players overlapping the yellows fight

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.660 
players overlapping the yellows fight
right<00:03:15.860> here<00:03:16.360> then<00:03:17.890> we're<00:03:18.890> going<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.160> subtract

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
right here then we're going to subtract

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.000 
right here then we're going to subtract
one<00:03:19.910> from<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.209> door<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.630> door<00:03:20.870> global<00:03:21.620> normal

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
one from the door the door global normal

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.360 
one from the door the door global normal
lot<00:03:22.310> of<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.780> global<00:03:23.780> no<00:03:24.019> number<00:03:24.620> variable<00:03:25.099> is

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
lot of the global no number variable is

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.940 
lot of the global no number variable is
200<00:03:26.000> well<00:03:26.569> I<00:03:26.600> think<00:03:26.780> that's<00:03:27.019> a<00:03:27.170> bit<00:03:27.590> short

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
200 well I think that's a bit short

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.780 
200 well I think that's a bit short
maybe<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.549> needs<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:28.850> be<00:03:28.970> 400<00:03:30.640> let's<00:03:31.640> see<00:03:31.730> how

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
maybe it needs to be 400 let's see how

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.960 
maybe it needs to be 400 let's see how
that<00:03:31.880> does<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:36.830> still<00:03:37.400> not<00:03:37.519> doing<00:03:37.730> anything

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
that does and still not doing anything

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.580 
that does and still not doing anything
I'll<00:03:38.510> set<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:38.900> back<00:03:39.110> doesn't<00:03:39.680> really<00:03:39.950> matter

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
I'll set it back doesn't really matter

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.940 
I'll set it back doesn't really matter
subtract<00:03:42.590> one<00:03:42.799> from<00:03:42.830> door<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.720> then<00:03:45.440> set<00:03:45.709> with

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
subtract one from door and then set with

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.880 
subtract one from door and then set with
2-door<00:03:49.330> play<00:03:50.330> sound<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:51.019> then<00:03:51.170> basically<00:03:51.410> do

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
2-door play sound and then basically do

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.559 
2-door play sound and then basically do
the<00:03:51.920> same<00:03:52.010> thing<00:03:52.370> when<00:03:52.700> it's<00:03:52.880> overlapping<00:03:53.239> the

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
the same thing when it's overlapping the

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.960 
the same thing when it's overlapping the
green<00:03:53.810> this<00:03:54.650> is<00:03:54.709> a<00:03:54.890> baby<00:03:55.130> signor<00:03:55.610> not<00:03:55.790> in

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
green this is a baby signor not in

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.880 
green this is a baby signor not in
advance<00:03:56.360> toward<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.989> advanced<00:03:57.470> or<00:03:57.620> later

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
advance toward to the advanced or later

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.620 
advance toward to the advanced or later
and<00:03:58.660> then<00:03:59.829> on<00:04:00.829> sort<00:04:01.310> of<00:04:01.430> lay<00:04:01.609> out<00:04:01.640> every<00:04:02.359> tick

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
and then on sort of lay out every tick

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.599 
and then on sort of lay out every tick
you<00:04:02.900> want<00:04:03.109> to<00:04:03.260> set<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.829> door<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:06.100> set<00:04:07.100> with<00:04:07.340> the

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
you want to set the door to set with the

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.690 
you want to set the door to set with the
door<00:04:07.820> it<00:04:08.420> basically<00:04:09.380> tells<00:04:09.920> it<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:10.250> watch

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
door it basically tells it to watch

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.720 
door it basically tells it to watch
everything<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.600> make<00:04:11.720> sure<00:04:11.750> that<00:04:11.930> it's<00:04:12.730> doing

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
everything and make sure that it's doing

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.300 
everything and make sure that it's doing
what's<00:04:13.910> supposed<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.299> be<00:04:14.390> doing<00:04:14.750> which<00:04:14.989> means

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
what's supposed to be doing which means

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.380 
what's supposed to be doing which means
if<00:04:16.310> it's<00:04:16.459> colliding<00:04:16.910> with<00:04:17.000> something<00:04:17.359> that

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
if it's colliding with something that

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.789 
if it's colliding with something that
affects<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.019> width<00:04:18.350> follow<00:04:19.010> the<00:04:19.280> orders<00:04:19.700> on

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
affects the width follow the orders on

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.390 
affects the width follow the orders on
is<00:04:21.799> overlapping<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:23.150> black<00:04:23.389> dot<00:04:23.930> then<00:04:24.740> you

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
is overlapping the black dot then you

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.230 
is overlapping the black dot then you
have<00:04:26.560> basically<00:04:27.560> it<00:04:27.860> resets<00:04:28.430> it<00:04:28.639> back<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.210> its

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
have basically it resets it back to its

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:38.590 
have basically it resets it back to its
normal<00:04:29.660> width<00:04:32.410> let's<00:04:33.410> do<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:33.860> real<00:04:34.100> quick

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.870 

it's<00:04:39.600> shrinking<00:04:39.900> it

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.390 

sets<00:04:44.570> of<00:04:44.690> extras<00:04:45.050> double<00:04:45.410> win<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:46.280> then

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
sets of extras double win and then

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.850 
sets of extras double win and then
closes<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:47.030> and<00:04:47.150> we<00:04:47.240> have<00:04:47.420> the<00:04:47.630> effects<00:04:48.500> sound

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
closes it and we have the effects sound

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.150 
closes it and we have the effects sound
later<00:04:49.100> but<00:04:50.030> this<00:04:50.150> is<00:04:50.360> a<00:04:50.390> basic<00:04:50.710> to<00:04:51.710> get<00:04:51.890> you

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
later but this is a basic to get you

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.960 
later but this is a basic to get you
where<00:04:52.370> you're<00:04:52.520> going<00:04:52.820> video<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:54.340> so<00:04:55.340> every

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
where you're going video and so every

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.050 
where you're going video and so every
time<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:56.360> hits<00:04:56.600> one<00:04:57.410> of<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.710> black<00:04:58.070> dots<00:04:58.400> then

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
time it hits one of the black dots then

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.640 
time it hits one of the black dots then
you're<00:04:59.210> good<00:04:59.360> to<00:04:59.390> go<00:04:59.600> no<00:04:59.840> this<00:04:59.990> is<00:05:00.200> for<00:05:00.440> like<00:05:00.620> a

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
you're good to go no this is for like a

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.590 
you're good to go no this is for like a
top-down<00:05:01.130> scenarios<00:05:01.670> so<00:05:01.880> you<00:05:01.970> would<00:05:02.120> normally

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
top-down scenarios so you would normally

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.460 
top-down scenarios so you would normally
have<00:05:03.140> the<00:05:03.170> floors<00:05:03.800> and<00:05:04.600> like<00:05:05.600> let<00:05:05.990> me<00:05:06.080> insert

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
have the floors and like let me insert

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.400 
have the floors and like let me insert
something<00:05:06.950> here<00:05:07.370> a<00:05:10.480> like<00:05:11.480> this<00:05:11.720> like<00:05:12.260> you

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
something here a like this like you

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.770 
something here a like this like you
would<00:05:12.560> have<00:05:12.740> tiles<00:05:13.250> so<00:05:13.880> what<00:05:14.060> I<00:05:14.090> would<00:05:14.210> do<00:05:14.480> is

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
would have tiles so what I would do is

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:23.830 
would have tiles so what I would do is
like<00:05:14.990> okay<00:05:21.970> so<00:05:22.970> he<00:05:23.090> doesn't<00:05:23.450> hit<00:05:23.690> it

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
like okay so he doesn't hit it

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.210 
like okay so he doesn't hit it
automatically<00:05:24.730> is<00:05:25.750> that<00:05:26.750> amazing<00:05:27.620> I<00:05:27.920> have<00:05:28.010> to

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
automatically is that amazing I have to

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:38.820 
automatically is that amazing I have to
you<00:05:28.760> know<00:05:28.910> touch<00:05:29.360> them<00:05:30.790> but<00:05:31.790> he's<00:05:32.030> going<00:05:32.300> to

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.960 

he's<00:05:39.830> not<00:05:40.070> going<00:05:40.280> to<00:05:40.490> touch<00:05:40.700> them

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
he's not going to touch them

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.910 
he's not going to touch them
automatically<00:05:43.510> and<00:05:44.510> then<00:05:44.630> we'll<00:05:44.920> make

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
automatically and then we'll make

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:55.400 
automatically and then we'll make
another<00:05:46.190> one<00:05:46.400> of<00:05:46.460> those<00:05:46.790> rotate<00:05:47.720> it<00:05:51.820> whoops

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.740 

and<00:05:56.410> you<00:05:57.010> can<00:05:57.190> make<00:05:57.310> these<00:05:57.490> disappear<00:05:58.180> or<00:05:58.360> a

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
and you can make these disappear or a

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.800 
and you can make these disappear or a
peer<00:05:59.230> so<00:06:00.130> he<00:06:00.760> doesn't<00:06:00.940> hit<00:06:01.210> them<00:06:01.360> in<00:06:01.480> the<00:06:01.510> first

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
peer so he doesn't hit them in the first

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.130 
peer so he doesn't hit them in the first
place<00:06:01.960> so<00:06:02.800> it's<00:06:02.950> basically<00:06:03.330> when<00:06:04.330> he<00:06:04.540> collides

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
place so it's basically when he collides

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:13.440 
place so it's basically when he collides
with<00:06:06.210> something<00:06:11.610> so<00:06:12.610> basically<00:06:12.940> you<00:06:13.330> could

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
with something so basically you could

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.450 
with something so basically you could
put<00:06:13.600> an<00:06:13.690> invisible<00:06:14.170> box<00:06:14.350> for<00:06:14.740> the<00:06:14.770> middle<00:06:15.070> door

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
put an invisible box for the middle door

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.530 
put an invisible box for the middle door
supposed<00:06:15.910> to<00:06:16.030> be<00:06:16.180> so<00:06:16.690> once<00:06:17.320> he<00:06:17.410> goes<00:06:17.650> through

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
supposed to be so once he goes through

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.820 
supposed to be so once he goes through
he<00:06:19.540> collides<00:06:19.900> with<00:06:20.050> that<00:06:20.320> these<00:06:20.920> appear<00:06:21.490> or

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
he collides with that these appear or

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.370 
he collides with that these appear or
set<00:06:23.830> to<00:06:23.980> the<00:06:24.100> position<00:06:24.310> or<00:06:24.910> whatever<00:06:25.390> and<00:06:25.630> then

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
set to the position or whatever and then

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.080 
set to the position or whatever and then
when<00:06:27.070> he<00:06:27.100> hits<00:06:27.400> one<00:06:27.490> the<00:06:28.150> door<00:06:28.330> closes<00:06:28.900> so

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
when he hits one the door closes so

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:37.050 
when he hits one the door closes so
let's<00:06:31.090> do<00:06:31.270> something<00:06:31.540> like<00:06:31.630> this<00:06:35.820> I'm<00:06:36.820> going

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
let's do something like this I'm going

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.360 
let's do something like this I'm going
to<00:06:37.240> make<00:06:37.990> a<00:06:38.020> space<00:06:38.350> so<00:06:38.530> we<00:06:38.560> can<00:06:38.770> go<00:06:38.950> through

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
to make a space so we can go through

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.220 
to make a space so we can go through
without<00:06:39.910> activating<00:06:40.570> one<00:06:40.870> of<00:06:40.900> these<00:06:43.230> very

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
without activating one of these very

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:52.740 
without activating one of these very
common<00:06:49.440> so<00:06:50.440> we're<00:06:50.560> opening<00:06:50.860> up<00:06:50.950> the<00:06:51.130> door<00:06:51.750> so

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
common so we're opening up the door so

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.290 
common so we're opening up the door so
opening<00:06:53.080> up<00:06:53.170> the<00:06:53.320> door<00:06:53.500> shower<00:06:54.430> now<00:06:54.970> we<00:06:55.030> close

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
opening up the door shower now we close

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.810 
opening up the door shower now we close
the<00:06:55.450> door

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820 
the door

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.350 
the door
and<00:06:57.480> there<00:06:58.140> we<00:06:58.230> go<00:06:58.260> so<00:06:58.950> I<00:06:58.980> mean<00:06:59.310> it's<00:06:59.490> rough<00:06:59.760> but

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
and there we go so I mean it's rough but

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.710 
and there we go so I mean it's rough but
it<00:07:00.570> gets<00:07:00.720> the<00:07:00.870> job<00:07:00.960> done<00:07:01.200> and<00:07:01.820> then<00:07:02.820> i'll

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
it gets the job done and then i'll

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.290 
it gets the job done and then i'll
probably<00:07:04.110> be<00:07:04.350> perfecting<00:07:05.100> this<00:07:05.280> in<00:07:05.640> the<00:07:06.090> next

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 
probably be perfecting this in the next

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.030 
probably be perfecting this in the next
video<00:07:07.640> or<00:07:08.640> they<00:07:09.360> appear<00:07:09.840> and<00:07:10.080> disappear<00:07:10.110> so<00:07:10.920> he

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040 
video or they appear and disappear so he

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.860 
video or they appear and disappear so he
has<00:07:11.250> to<00:07:11.400> hit<00:07:11.580> like<00:07:11.850> a<00:07:11.880> little<00:07:12.240> invisible<00:07:12.480> box

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870 
has to hit like a little invisible box

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.310 
has to hit like a little invisible box
here<00:07:13.230> and<00:07:13.490> then<00:07:14.490> these<00:07:14.640> guys<00:07:14.910> appear<00:07:15.360> then<00:07:16.170> he

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.320 
here and then these guys appear then he

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.250 
here and then these guys appear then he
hits<00:07:16.920> one<00:07:17.040> and<00:07:17.430> it<00:07:18.090> closes<00:07:18.510> it<00:07:18.900> and<00:07:19.050> then<00:07:19.170> the

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.260 
hits one and it closes it and then the

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.510 
hits one and it closes it and then the
sounds<00:07:19.530> will<00:07:19.680> be<00:07:19.800> a<00:07:19.830> whole<00:07:20.070> lot<00:07:20.100> better<00:07:20.190> so

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 
sounds will be a whole lot better so

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.340 
sounds will be a whole lot better so
I'll<00:07:20.610> probably<00:07:20.880> look<00:07:21.360> for<00:07:21.780> some<00:07:21.960> top<00:07:22.140> down

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350 
I'll probably look for some top down

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.950 
I'll probably look for some top down
sprites<00:07:23.220> I'd<00:07:23.700> open<00:07:24.060> game<00:07:24.270> or<00:07:24.450> something<00:07:24.870> like

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 
sprites I'd open game or something like

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.240 
sprites I'd open game or something like
that<00:07:25.020> to<00:07:25.440> make<00:07:25.560> it<00:07:25.680> a<00:07:25.710> little<00:07:25.830> more<00:07:25.920> pretty

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 
that to make it a little more pretty

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.200 
that to make it a little more pretty
this<00:07:26.460> is<00:07:26.670> just<00:07:26.880> a<00:07:27.000> basic<00:07:27.180> overview<00:07:27.600> and<00:07:28.500> then

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:29.210 
this is just a basic overview and then

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.780 
this is just a basic overview and then
we'll<00:07:30.210> make<00:07:30.330> it<00:07:30.360> look<00:07:31.130> realistic<00:07:32.130> i<00:07:32.490> think<00:07:32.670> i

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:32.790 
we'll make it look realistic i think i

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.090 
we'll make it look realistic i think i
might<00:07:33.000> use<00:07:33.240> the<00:07:33.450> top<00:07:33.630> down<00:07:33.780> spreads<00:07:34.140> from<00:07:34.860> our

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.100 
might use the top down spreads from our

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.090 
might use the top down spreads from our
cut<00:07:35.280> down<00:07:35.490> game<00:07:36.380> but<00:07:37.380> that's<00:07:37.560> about<00:07:37.800> it<00:07:37.860> guys

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:38.100 
cut down game but that's about it guys

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.920 
cut down game but that's about it guys
it's<00:07:38.550> kind<00:07:38.880> of<00:07:38.910> really<00:07:39.240> kind<00:07:39.510> of<00:07:39.600> simple<00:07:39.810> you

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:39.930 
it's kind of really kind of simple you

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.830 
it's kind of really kind of simple you
just<00:07:39.960> have<00:07:40.170> to<00:07:40.580> perfect<00:07:41.580> it<00:07:41.820> to<00:07:42.000> make<00:07:42.150> it<00:07:42.180> work

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 
just have to perfect it to make it work

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.180 
just have to perfect it to make it work
good<00:07:43.200> use<00:07:43.830> some<00:07:44.100> hacks<00:07:44.400> to<00:07:45.360> you<00:07:46.260> know<00:07:46.440> make

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.190 
good use some hacks to you know make

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.090 
good use some hacks to you know make
sure<00:07:47.450> look<00:07:48.450> to<00:07:49.410> you<00:07:49.680> know<00:07:49.770> what<00:07:49.890> you<00:07:50.010> don't

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:50.100 
sure look to you know what you don't

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.500 
sure look to you know what you don't
want<00:07:50.310> to<00:07:50.370> put<00:07:50.550> like<00:07:50.760> a<00:07:50.790> huge<00:07:51.090> amount<00:07:51.300> of<00:07:51.360> effort

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:51.510 
want to put like a huge amount of effort

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.970 
want to put like a huge amount of effort
something<00:07:52.050> that's<00:07:52.230> really<00:07:52.440> kind<00:07:52.710> of<00:07:52.740> simple

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:52.980 
something that's really kind of simple

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.050 
something that's really kind of simple
like<00:07:53.130> a<00:07:53.160> door<00:07:54.770> so<00:07:55.770> what<00:07:56.160> you<00:07:56.250> can<00:07:56.400> also<00:07:56.550> do<00:07:56.880> is

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.060 
like a door so what you can also do is

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.230 
like a door so what you can also do is

you can also animate the door so you

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.470 
you can also animate the door so you
have<00:08:00.600> the<00:08:00.900> you<00:08:01.290> know<00:08:01.440> for<00:08:01.950> six<00:08:02.310> parts<00:08:02.610> of<00:08:02.820> it

opening<00:08:03.900> and<00:08:04.050> then<00:08:04.530> you<00:08:04.680> just<00:08:04.860> reverse<00:08:05.220> that

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:05.490 
opening and then you just reverse that

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.930 
opening and then you just reverse that
to<00:08:05.820> closing<00:08:06.150> so<00:08:07.110> that<00:08:07.770> could<00:08:07.980> work<00:08:08.160> but<00:08:08.610> set

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 
to closing so that could work but set

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.930
