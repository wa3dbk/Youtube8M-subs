00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 That 's a bastard, I did not tell you that. 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.660
 I'll show you what that game in the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.420
 water I bought woman who is this 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.480
 here is here you can see what he 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.309
 Tell me the idec, this deck I'm going to 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.529
 to use with labyrinths of the mind that is 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.990
 of water as you can see here 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.970
 has the highest deck speed possible 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.029
 which means speed of 10 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.939
 means how much you can 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.220
 start type game in your 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.859
 first round and has a chance of you 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.170
 put several monsters understood the cards 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.950
 cost less to be voted on 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.710
 field that has four stars that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.770
 From here is the deck afonso hunter he has 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.140
 much more the size of creature o 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.090
 creature size is the comfort the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.910
 creatures will go kind of creature and will 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.829
 be much larger and much stronger and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.410
 will cost a lot more 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.750
 but he has too much of the creature 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.550
 to the detriment of synergy or 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.980
 normally a letter does not match the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.729
 other this kind of thing that also goes 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.200
 It's worth a lot in that hand. It's okay. 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.180
 so I'll keep it 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.380
 usually a good one when you have a 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.799
 good synergy between years and creatures 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.780
 that's what I have right now it's the whole 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.880
 side against each other and pc and never 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.820
 cast happens from here I do not know of 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.430
 far away the strategy that will make seeing the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.909
 defender put a barrier here nothing 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.909
 too much 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.579
 I 'm going to have a ghost that 's cool. 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.380
 idec is that it is very 2 of the hill of them are 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.159
 flying as you can see that it is 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.200
 written to and flyers they ignore 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.060
 all the monsters who can not not 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.930
 I'm going to or I can attack 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.350
 directly his life 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.270
 Ana is this is very good guy and if it helps 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.130
 fucking later attacked directly the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.310
 life of the caribbean new molds he has 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.310
 in the field 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.830
 and attack he only attacked again 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.990
 because if jk it will block with this 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.610
 vineyard of his draft and will not 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.340
 I will not lose anything yet. 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.620
 movement and I do not want to lose is because 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.959
 if he attacks me I will be able to defend it 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.580
 with this character type now 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.500
 He's probably not going to attack me. 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:27.380
 because if he attacks me I will defend 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:29.690
 and I will volvo him and he will power son guys 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.310
 his idec is also very it old game 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.170
 My god, he's putting a lot of 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.170
 monte very strong and I do not know 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.440
 and if from here I'm also using 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.989
 water is very good because he to him to it 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.030
 uses the strategy of turning the 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.370
 monsters of the various type technical guy 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.860
 letters here that there was a disassembly of it 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.459
 for defense among the six that he does not 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.500
 can attack and can not prevent the 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.120
 attack so far I can do this to 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.080
 directly attack health points 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.180
 his 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.500
 Wow, I vowed too old could 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.780
 attack his health points 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.100
 directly with this character he does not 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.340
 block because it has no 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.950
 no character ad to cancer 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.930
 you can only block a flight from pain if 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.090
 your hill has cancer could not have 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.829
 taken his fucking point of view 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.410
 only I had not thought of it our 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.090
 that situation 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.489
 I will directly attack life point 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.320
 it's just him because he's good and he's 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.910
 There's nothing going on and today I 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.930
 I could have done so long ago I 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.250
 I'm the silom botafogo here he goes 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.930
 able to defend this barrier 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.820
 vine because it has not reach me 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.030
 had seen range makes you 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.920
 You can defend the hills that good 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.690
 there he defends my attack I do not 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.209
 get to destroy his worm because 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.140
 had only three life of attack and two 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.140
 nothing came of nothing 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.880
 It would be better in this game if I took the 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.080
 my the character of the leaves I put 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.680
 on here 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.540
 such value that in that one there they will 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.020
 battle to leave him attack point of 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.000
 life 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.520
 I was talking, it was better to have taken 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.670
 my ten days a level he is very 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.489
 The stronger this question demonstrates our 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.010
 love to kill himself as he was not like that 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.890
 to kill he only had two guys 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.900
 No call no he had three in our room 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.410
 money at the top wavering a lot in this 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.410
 match 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.939
 Our old man, I'm sure I will lose. 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.029
 this match 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:49.610
 This mine must be very close to not so 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:51.229
 good against his character and 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.240
 besides I did a lot of shit 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.879
 old man just put this worm here 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.979
 which is very good against the sorcerer's magic 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.830
 did not vote any margin in the field 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:03.139
 so I'm well run and I can not 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.560
 put no attack on them because everyone 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:10.250
 of them have three defense and neither the name nor 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.319
 justice has three of attack heard a lot 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.580
 very cool now I will definitely 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:21.830
 miss this match is not to see much fuck 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:24.979
 No, I'm going to use this house here to 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:29.050
 turn two of his monsters and if that 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.050
 law does not attack me in the next match 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.530
 I might as well that now only 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.240
 I will not attack because he has 2 two 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.130
 of these barriers of being pauleira that do not 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.199
 Nothing advances I attack him because he 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.770
 will block with them and will not give anything 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.770
 you are welcome 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.539
 he decided to attack're hardcore mind I 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:57.630
 I will block and read if 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:58.380
 and that one in this putz lost from the 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.199
 scoundrel 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.050
 Good guys, I lost ugly but you guys. 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:07.650
 understood the purpose of this idec, which is the 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:10.020
 of water is more proof ben helli 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.910
 same game for you to attack each one everything 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.580
 and I managed to kill him only this guy 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.470
 I managed to neutralize by putting a lot of 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.720
 monster at the same time it screwed me 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.250
 But that's it, thank you. 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.250
 watched and until the next video
