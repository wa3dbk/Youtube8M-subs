00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello to all and good day to everything 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.339
 michael and today we find ourselves 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.300
 on minecraft a little independent game 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.880
 who you know him surely who had 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.950
 a huge success just he sold himself to 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.269
 almost 3 million copies then 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.310
 that he's still in the beta phase you 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.859
 see it here is really it's a 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.710
 huge success it sells by the thousands 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.150
 and I actually decided to see the concept of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.910
 game of presenting it to you in a way a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.890
 little more original it will be a whole 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.859
 small series of videos that will make you 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 discover my evolution really you 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.969
 miss anything like that you'll see 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.160
 really what it looks like and that at 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.050
 make a small series of videos 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.000
 so quickly for the technical part 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.100
 minecraft what is a game 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.829
 playable on browser or you can 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.780
 also download it 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.020
 it's a game that runs under java so 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.940
 it is necessarily a little ugly but 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.530
 it works very well so there you see 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.780
 we just appeared in a small 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.750
 world I just created this really 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.370
 I leave from the beginning I have nothing and we go 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.960
 try to see how we evolve in 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.030
 this universe so I explain you 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.590
 quickly the big principle in 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.390
 minecraft saw the world is enough 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.040
 cubic and that's the whole principle of the game 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.740
 saw his cubes 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.540
 we can break them and then I go 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.670
 to be able to put them back as I want to 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.470
 to build 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.720
 so that's all the big principle of 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.130
 game it reminds a little lego and it goes 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.630
 must actually use it to make 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.610
 constructions but we will also 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.890
 a whole crafting system for 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.020
 manufacture to make houses into 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.640
 wood tools for me you 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.430
 present it through a whole 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.710
 small series of videos it will tell me 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.780
 if you like it if that's the case I 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.360
 reiterate the experience to make others 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.320
 videos and otherwise and well as one 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.270
 will see 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.340
 what I decide so for example hawaii 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.800
 and there is a weapon and I will break the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.380
 wood of the hand it's weird I'm going 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.850
 not to say I'm going to break the tree 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.880
 saw it's not there is not a 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.110
 unbelievable physics no it's really 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.670
 something basic but you go 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.140
 see it this game is great and there I 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.420
 recovers wood actually 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.280
 so what is the wood used for 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.429
 you'll see it right after I do 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.209
 my little harvest it may be a 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.209
 not long enough here and here and there and 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.190
 this is I see there c cut Thursday taste of 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.260
 faith here I confirm so let go 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.550
 to harvest some good light wood in 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.150
 English the game is in English but that's 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.910
 not a problem 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.380
 and with that I will be able to make wood 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.840
 now they call it at least a plax 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.430
 planks of wood we will tell me 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.500
 I call it refined wood it's more 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.600
 simple with this wood you see in my 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.590
 little crafting system there through 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.330
 my inventory 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.640
 I have to do what's called a 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.620
 crafting t ball it's a kraft table 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.140
 which allow to make still 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.300
 more objects and you will see it 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.120
 it's great in minecraft it's 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.700
 the whole principle of the day so we're going 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.810
 try to go a little further 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.019
 to explore a little at the same time because 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.040
 fossard the universe is infinite I believe 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.570
 that they had it was the same 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.860
 not infinite but I think it's three 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.290
 times the surface of the earth 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.959
 because it is generated in fact randomly 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.370
 In short, we can say a girl because as and when 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.769
 as you move forward everything is 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.720
 randomly generated from 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.570
 some data which gives a 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.430
 result really very very 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.380
 impressive especially that we have beautiful 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.450
 moving forward we'll never find limits 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.610
 so there you see I'm going to settle 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.500
 here why carousel and understand from 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.690
 Minecraft the mines is important 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.760
 it's normal it's in the title and I 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.560
 have already found a tear you see I 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.780
 I'm going to install my little kraft tape 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.250
 and there I have more locations than if 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.530
 I was in my normal inventory 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.870
 look at my normal inventory i 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.420
 four kraft slots and there I 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.209
 have one two three four five six seven 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.280
 eight nine here you know how to count then 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.079
 with that for example with montboyer with 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.549
 wood like that just sea ​​in 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.930
 does what's called a boss a 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.419
 kind of schema of what we want to do 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.380
 and look good I can do in 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.850
 makes small wooden sticks 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.100
 which will be used to make 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.570
 picks or that kind of things you go 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.670
 immediately understand what I 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.810
 speak I'm going to harvest another little 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.240
 little wood forger that it's a 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.430
 game that separates complicated but there are 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.740
 a lot of bosses and things like 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.260
 that to assimilate a I know the 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.940
 most so it might not be great 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.320
 annoying at that level I played already 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.780
 not bad at minecraft 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.570
 I do not proclaim myself an expert of the game 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.550
 but I think that even though I'm not 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.250
 not the worst placed to present 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.650
 to present it for so see it 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.920
 I harvested wood and again 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.630
 this wood i will do it refined in game 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.820
 yesterday this all along the videos it's 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.040
 much simpler than transforming 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.500
 in wooden planks and with this little 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.960
 pat in the face of the games but in fact the 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.270
 boss of a pickaxe you see there that 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.830
 looks more or less a pick and there 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.810
 you see I 'm really producing a 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.220
 pick and with that I'll be able to do 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.760
 full of tools for example look at it and 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:56.150
 I am an ax and ge h I am doing a 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.400
 shovel and I'll have a shovel and it'll be 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.660
 that's really we'll have a lot of 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.210
 principles like that for example the 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:07.130
 watch I'm doing a sword and here I have 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.940
 all jets all possible items 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.460
 and imaginable 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.490
 in forger that according to the material that 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.410
 will be used you will have a tool more or 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.900
 less resistant eg wood 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.000
 it's less resistant than the stone that 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.590
 is less resistant than dealing with 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.450
 that kind of things totally logical 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.460
 you're going to tell me the young actually creates 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.200
 a safe to be able to place my 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.230
 business in for example i'm going to place 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.760
 half of my wood items like that 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.120
 if I die I know I'll have a little 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.760
 safe here so the first thing to 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.290
 to do is harvest wood I think 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.510
 that it will be very useful and there you 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.940
 see the saucer wood much more 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.290
 fast why did not bother h through 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.180
 call me I could dug into the 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.720
 earth and in the sand faster thanks to 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:55.420
 my draw will be in all that 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.490
 is in fact how to say all that is 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.290
 how to say 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.110
 all the mineral elements in fact that 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.360
 this is gold iron or even the 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.250
 stone yeah that's it's all 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.110
 million dhs elements will yield a lot 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.540
 faster with a pickaxe it makes sense 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.490
 somehow in view the choice 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.380
 to make you a series of super videos 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.180
 short I will soon stop that one 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.640
 I know she will not have been great 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.320
 hectic but it's the beginning must be good 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.600
 start in there you see I continue to 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.820
 to make refined wood why and well 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.790
 because I'm just going to close 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.670
 a little bit my cave the question of me 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.020
 to make a nice little house i'm going 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.280
 first make a door 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.040
 you see I'm going to do a little 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.510
 tac tac tac tac tac tac I think 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.250
 I'm going to make this video a little bit more 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.290
 long and I cut it in two parts 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.110
 it depends what I would like too 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:47.030
 posted on youtube 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.650
 so I will try to make a small 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.120
 door to my cave so first I'm going 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.130
 to make the wall all in wood and there you 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.510
 see it's really the system of 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.240
 crafting that takes shape 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.700
 I can really place develops 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.880
 as I wish and that allow me 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.430
 to make me a little house so damn 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.300
 here I did not want pop but it's 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.640
 no matter you see I can the 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.230
 recover without problem 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.420
 it's really a game that makes one think 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.880
 little to the lego gold if you played that 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.620
 like me when I was a kid 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.690
 really remember that so here I go 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.270
 place my little doors like that I 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:24.140
 could go anyway man and I 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:26.140
 will do it again but here yeah I think that
