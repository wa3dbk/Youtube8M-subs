00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.470
 that the joy 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.050
 What's more important for me is the children 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.840
 if the children have a joy 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.940
 feel when singing then it is for 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.190

 to teach that they are correct too 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.520
 can sing if they do not already 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.520
 know 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.060
 the children are very well prepared and 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.040
 very motivated and we have a lot 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.630
 long sample just behind us 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.250
 but it did not bother them 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.440
 were very disciplined 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.670
 that was a big surprise for me 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.090
 and I was very happy about it 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.550
 that the children are on the ideas and 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.980

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.710

 popular music place 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.910
 where the economy is very strong 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.980
 foreground is 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.400
 where the money is very strong in the foreground 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.050
 and we just have to do this 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.720
 change values 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.610
 that has to move a bit and how 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.280
 This can be done best by us 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.740
 the children educate themselves on others 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.680
 values that you can focus on 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.080

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.660
 gives as material values â€‹â€‹and the 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.990
 material goods and that we have the 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.310

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.780
 we sing together when we 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.400
 We see each other automatically 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.400
 that they are connected 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.050
 in this direction and just by the 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:21.699
 sing a means to give them that 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.300
 You can also spread yourself 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.870
 experience 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.409
 that is in my opinion a whole 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.409
 important task
