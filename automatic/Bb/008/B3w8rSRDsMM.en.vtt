00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 years 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.560
 philippe dupré horticulturists 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.610
 nurseries at eygalières in the 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.800
 mouths of the rhône next to 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.270
 saint-remy-de-provence I am going to 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.610
 explain today how we achieve 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.760
 a cutting the cuttings is a 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.130
 vegetative propagation technique 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.040
 which will consist of taking a piece of 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.009
 branch on a plant so if you have 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.770
 glimpse at a friend's house a laurel or a 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:37.190
 shrub that you like a lot you 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.600
 can by this principle multiply it by 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.650
 how to plant them in your garden 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.500
 when he will have roots and so the 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.700
 laurel-rose for example 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.970
 good is a shrub that we see 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.110
 commonly the principle will consist of 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.340
 take a piece of branch 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.710
 a branch that has a little bit of 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.010
 wood so called a ramos me out 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.360
 and the ideal sampling period on 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.360
 oleander and the month of June 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.640
 regarding the rose we will take a 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.670
 cutting earlier in November or 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.409
 December on twigs that grew 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.810
 in the year so for the realization of the 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.149
 cuttings i'm going to need one of a 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.780
 mother foot so of a plant on which 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.179
 we will take the cutting of a pruner 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.640
 disinfect with alcohol 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.100
 very sharp to allow a cut 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.630
 very frank of the cutting for not 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.249
 crush the tissues what could 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.929
 cause rot at the time of 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:41.030
 cuttings 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:43.490
 we will use nettle manure that will 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.170
 facilitate the resumption of the cutting is 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.850
 can use cuttings hormones 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.289
 but which are becoming more difficult 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.329
 to get in the shops 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.579
 so the nettle manure will activate 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.100
 rooting we will be able to use 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.950
 a little tip a bottle cut 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.280
 which will recreate a climate a little bit 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.259
 similar to a greenhouse not too much deposit 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.689
 big to allow the root of 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.709
 touch the edges pretty quickly a 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:13.000
 potting soil and a watering well 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.440
 sure to do the first watering 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.950
 so I'm going to take a cutting from a 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.170
 about ten centimeters in length on 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.480
 the semi-out part and so that starts 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.459
 to this woody 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.940
 so we took at a cutting of a 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.220
 about ten centimeters with 2 cm 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.390
 under the last leaves 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.269
 this is where the roots 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.420
 will be formed so we'll go 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.959
 cut his leaves for easter 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.250
 rot in the soil and 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.780
 other leaves that are a little bit 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.209
 long time on the species that make 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.390
 big leaves like that we'll go 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.459
 cut in half to avoid having a 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:03:00.620
 too much evaporation at the level of 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:02.629
 the cutting can be left small 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.390
 leaves from above we will take off we will 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.650
 remove the small leaves from the base 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:16.790
 so there the cutting is ready to be 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:19.519
 planted in the pot so we will plant 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.030
 the cuttings on the height that was 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.400
 denuded 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.739
 we are going to pack a little so that the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.549
 cuttings move so there we will cut a 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:31.130
 bottle that will allow us to 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:40.459
 recreate the climate conducive to recovery 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:42.530
 of the cutting so I took I 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.340
 prepared a solution in a watering can 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.280
 with 20% nettle manure what will 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.739
 encourage the recovery of the cutting 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.410
 accelerate it so you have to make a 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:59.660
 watering quite rich so as to well 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:01.970
 saturated the potting soil so have it after he 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.989
 remains more than to position the bottle 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.449
 cut on the cutting the plug goes 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.340
 can be aired from time to time to 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:13.099
 to escape the too much moisture that has 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:19.940
 in which can be created inside 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:23.870
 of the bottle and we will position the 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.010
 pot so the oleander that is cutting 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.539
 in june it will be necessary to make 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.810
 be careful the summer they do not have too much 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.190
 hot 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:34.240
 so we'll put it amber sooner 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.240
 so concerning the rose bush 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.870
 we do the same with the 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:49.120
 cuttings of the rose bush we water with a 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:53.680
 20% solution of nettle manure so we 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.599
 closes the bell and so the pot of the 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.060
 rose cuttings will be positioned 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:59.979
 on a window sill so that 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.080
 that the light rays is the sun 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.810
 heat the bottle and make the 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.680
 temperature at the soil so 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.259
 the same from time to time will be airy and 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.520
 so we'll leave there the pot on the 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:18.280
 window until May pretty much 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.780
 where the cutting will be enough 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.960
 roots and to be planted in full 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.960
 Earth
