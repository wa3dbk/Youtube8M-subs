mod aka the parachute mod now you guys
are<00:00:20.839> probably<00:00:21.050> wondering<00:00:21.259> how<00:00:21.710> in<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.070> world

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
are probably wondering how in the world

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.450 
are probably wondering how in the world
could<00:00:22.580> that<00:00:22.640> possibly<00:00:23.119> be<00:00:23.689> a<00:00:23.929> parachute<00:00:24.740> well

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
could that possibly be a parachute well

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.489 
could that possibly be a parachute well
the<00:00:25.970> way<00:00:26.119> this<00:00:26.359> actually<00:00:26.779> works<00:00:27.019> is<00:00:27.230> you<00:00:27.320> can

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:27.499 
the way this actually works is you can

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.859 
the way this actually works is you can
actually<00:00:27.529> get<00:00:28.099> on<00:00:28.310> the<00:00:28.609> pig<00:00:28.909> and<00:00:29.210> whenever<00:00:29.689> you

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
actually get on the pig and whenever you

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.319 
actually get on the pig and whenever you
fall<00:00:30.109> off<00:00:30.320> of<00:00:30.499> an<00:00:30.619> edge<00:00:30.949> it<00:00:31.279> is<00:00:31.669> actually<00:00:31.909> going

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
fall off of an edge it is actually going

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.360 
fall off of an edge it is actually going
to<00:00:32.570> save<00:00:32.930> you<00:00:33.140> from<00:00:33.170> actually<00:00:33.620> falling<00:00:34.220> and

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
to save you from actually falling and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.640 
to save you from actually falling and
hurting<00:00:34.490> yourself<00:00:35.030> because<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:36.020> chicken<00:00:36.470> is

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
hurting yourself because the chicken is

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.130 
hurting yourself because the chicken is
going<00:00:36.950> to<00:00:37.130> slow<00:00:37.520> your<00:00:37.820> actual<00:00:38.330> descent<00:00:38.660> so

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
going to slow your actual descent so

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.810 
going to slow your actual descent so
we're<00:00:39.560> going<00:00:39.620> to<00:00:39.740> go<00:00:39.800> ahead<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.340> touch<00:00:40.490> us<00:00:40.670> out

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
we're going to go ahead and touch us out

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.760 
we're going to go ahead and touch us out
of<00:00:40.850> course<00:00:41.150> we<00:00:41.300> are<00:00:41.450> in<00:00:41.690> creative<00:00:42.380> mode<00:00:42.410> right

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
of course we are in creative mode right

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.290 
of course we are in creative mode right
now<00:00:42.830> so<00:00:43.190> sonic<00:00:43.430> we<00:00:43.640> would<00:00:43.790> actually<00:00:43.970> get

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
now so sonic we would actually get

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.390 
now so sonic we would actually get
damaged<00:00:44.660> if<00:00:44.750> we<00:00:44.840> fail<00:00:45.020> anyway<00:00:45.320> but<00:00:45.860> just<00:00:46.220> for

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
damaged if we fail anyway but just for

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.940 
damaged if we fail anyway but just for
demonstration<00:00:46.840> purposes<00:00:47.840> imagine<00:00:48.710> you're<00:00:48.860> in

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
demonstration purposes imagine you're in

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.590 
demonstration purposes imagine you're in

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
of these things well basically you can

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.270 
of these things well basically you can
go<00:00:52.520> ahead<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:52.850> push<00:00:53.510> one<00:00:53.750> off<00:00:53.900> and<00:00:54.110> get<00:00:54.920> on<00:00:55.070> it

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
go ahead and push one off and get on it
