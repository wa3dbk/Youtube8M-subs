00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.690 
about ten steps now I'm accelerating for
about<00:02:19.150> twenty<00:02:19.540> five<00:02:19.720> steps<00:02:20.280> little<00:02:21.280> faster

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
about twenty five steps little faster

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.500 
about twenty five steps little faster
not<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:21.910> sprint<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.750> now<00:02:23.620> I'm<00:02:23.770> gliding

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
not a sprint and now I'm gliding

I'm 80 years old and I finally went to a
camp<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:45.130> actually<00:02:45.490> learned<00:02:45.700> how<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:45.880> ride

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
camp and actually learned how to ride

camp and actually learned how to ride
that<00:02:46.690> required<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.320> change<00:02:47.530> but<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.100> actually

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
that required to change but it actually

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.940 
that required to change but it actually
improved<00:02:49.120> my<00:02:49.360> efficiency<00:02:49.810> improve<00:02:50.739> my

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
improved my efficiency improve my

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.850 
improved my efficiency improve my
distance<00:02:51.489> running<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:53.050> that<00:02:53.350> allowed<00:02:53.620> me<00:02:53.650> to

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
distance running and that allowed me to

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:06.120 
distance running and that allowed me to
become<00:02:54.100> stabilized<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.269> my<00:02:55.840> Avenger<00:03:05.130> dorsen

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
become stabilized and my Avenger dorsen

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.920 
become stabilized and my Avenger dorsen
is<00:03:06.519> what<00:03:06.730> really<00:03:06.940> makes<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.360> difference<00:03:07.390> I

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
is what really makes a difference I

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.140 
is what really makes a difference I
actually<00:03:08.620> exercise<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.430> reach<00:03:09.640> that<00:03:09.850> point

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
actually exercise to reach that point

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.720 
actually exercise to reach that point
where<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.810> have<00:03:11.110> that<00:03:11.320> great<00:03:11.590> feeling<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:12.220> it's

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
where I have that great feeling and it's

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.000 
where I have that great feeling and it's
hard<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.239> tell<00:03:13.420> people<00:03:13.810> about<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.050> if<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.860> have

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
hard to tell people about it if you have
