awareness is having a target you should
always<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.310> target<00:00:26.789> when<00:00:27.150> you're<00:00:27.300> hitting

always have a target when you're hitting

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.689 
always have a target when you're hitting
four<00:00:27.720> hands<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.080> back<00:00:28.170> ends<00:00:28.529> rarely<00:00:29.490> will<00:00:29.670> you

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
four hands and back ends rarely will you

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.870 
four hands and back ends rarely will you
ever<00:00:29.789> hit<00:00:30.359> exactly<00:00:30.660> where<00:00:31.170> you're<00:00:32.040> aiming<00:00:32.250> but

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
ever hit exactly where you're aiming but

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.700 
ever hit exactly where you're aiming but
regardless<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.570> want<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> target<00:00:34.620> and

regardless you want to have a target and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.889 
regardless you want to have a target and
that<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.579> most<00:00:35.730> important<00:00:36.180> feedback<00:00:36.660> you

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
that is the most important feedback you

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.229 
that is the most important feedback you
can<00:00:37.020> get<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.649> determine<00:00:38.160> where<00:00:38.610> your<00:00:38.790> racket

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
can get to determine where your racket

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.479 
can get to determine where your racket
face<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.510> pointing<00:00:40.200> now<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.160> talked<00:00:41.399> about

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
face is pointing now we talked about

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.150 
face is pointing now we talked about
grips<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.570> certain<00:00:42.989> extent<00:00:43.410> how<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.739> grip

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
grips to a certain extent how you grip

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.950 
grips to a certain extent how you grip
the<00:00:44.190> racket<00:00:44.489> will<00:00:45.149> determine<00:00:45.510> where<00:00:45.780> your

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the racket will determine where your

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.410 
the racket will determine where your
racket<00:00:46.379> face<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.800> pointing<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:47.789> example<00:00:48.270> I'm

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
racket face is pointing for example I'm

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.930 
racket face is pointing for example I'm
now<00:00:48.570> holding<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:49.110> forehand<00:00:49.829> grip<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.789> my

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
now holding a forehand grip I have my

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.510 
now holding a forehand grip I have my
strings<00:00:51.360> pointed<00:00:52.320> pretty<00:00:52.559> much<00:00:52.770> straight

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
strings pointed pretty much straight

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.250 
strings pointed pretty much straight
ahead

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
ahead

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.779 
ahead
now<00:00:55.260> when<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.530> hit<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> ball<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
now when I hit the ball and I have a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.869 
now when I hit the ball and I have a
target<00:00:57.270> straight<00:00:57.539> ahead<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.590> let's<00:00:59.550> say<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
target straight ahead and let's say the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.660 
target straight ahead and let's say the
ball<00:01:00.059> goes<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.600> left<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.230> my<00:01:01.890> target<00:01:01.920> well

ball goes to the left of my target well

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.630 
ball goes to the left of my target well
I<00:01:02.699> know<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.420> at<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> point<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.739> impact<00:01:04.860> my

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
I know that at the point of impact my

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.789 
I know that at the point of impact my
racket<00:01:06.090> face<00:01:06.299> was<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.200> pointed<00:01:07.590> straight

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
racket face was not pointed straight

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.070 
racket face was not pointed straight
ahead<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:08.760> tilted<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.420> little<00:01:09.450> bit<00:01:09.960> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
ahead but it was tilted a little bit to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.260 
ahead but it was tilted a little bit to
the<00:01:10.350> left<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.830> generally<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.060> have

the palm of your hand mostly behind the
racket<00:01:14.250> which<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.520> recommend<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.360> palm<00:01:15.630> of

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
racket which I recommend the palm of

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.170 
racket which I recommend the palm of
your<00:01:15.869> hand<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.770> racket<00:01:17.159> face<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.970> the

your hand and the racket face is on the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.600 
your hand and the racket face is on the
same<00:01:18.570> plane<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.259> an<00:01:19.860> excellent<00:01:20.280> reference

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
same plane so an excellent reference

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.880 
same plane so an excellent reference
point<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.479> determine<00:01:21.600> racket<00:01:22.200> face<00:01:22.380> awareness

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
point to determine racket face awareness

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.190 
point to determine racket face awareness
for<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> forehand<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.390> keep<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> palm<00:01:25.020> of
