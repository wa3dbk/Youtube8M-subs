00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.880 
and it gives you a brief explanation of
what<00:02:25.010> what<00:02:25.519> they<00:02:25.670> are<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.230> that's<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.650> one

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
what what they are so that's that one

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.610 
what what they are so that's that one
let's<00:02:28.430> open<00:02:28.670> up<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.120> other<00:02:29.329> one<00:02:29.569> see<00:02:29.989> if<00:02:30.079> I'd

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
let's open up the other one see if I'd

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.140 
let's open up the other one see if I'd
like<00:02:30.829> I<00:02:30.860> don't<00:02:31.040> know<00:02:31.250> if<00:02:31.370> these<00:02:31.519> are<00:02:31.579> repeats

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
like I don't know if these are repeats

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.970 
like I don't know if these are repeats
we'll<00:02:32.959> see<00:02:33.140> what's<00:02:33.290> in<00:02:33.410> this<00:02:33.530> one<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.799> could<00:02:33.920> be

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
we'll see what's in this one it could be

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.000 
we'll see what's in this one it could be
different<00:02:34.250> animals<00:02:35.530> yes<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.799> it<00:02:36.890> is

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
different animals yes and it is

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.319 
different animals yes and it is
different<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:37.640> they're<00:02:37.849> each<00:02:37.940> different

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
different so they're each different

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.220 
different so they're each different
packages<00:02:38.900> that's<00:02:39.049> cool<00:02:39.459> let's<00:02:40.459> see<00:02:40.989> this<00:02:41.989> here

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
packages that's cool let's see this here

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.789 
packages that's cool let's see this here
looks<00:02:42.440> like<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.739> have<00:02:42.890> some<00:02:43.099> flying<00:02:43.489> creatures

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
looks like to have some flying creatures

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.199 
looks like to have some flying creatures
this<00:02:45.799> for<00:02:46.220> them<00:02:46.489> I'm<00:02:46.700> gonna<00:02:46.790> put<00:02:47.060> them

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
this for them I'm gonna put them

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.530 
this for them I'm gonna put them
together<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.870> I'll<00:02:48.319> be<00:02:48.440> back<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:48.799> one<00:02:48.950> second

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
together and I'll be back in one second

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.449 
together and I'll be back in one second
okay<00:02:50.540> guys<00:02:50.780> I'm<00:02:51.230> back<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.040> put<00:02:52.280> together

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
okay guys I'm back and I put together

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.629 
okay guys I'm back and I put together
these<00:02:52.989> flying<00:02:53.989> reptiles<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:55.069> they're

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
these flying reptiles and they're

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.550 
these flying reptiles and they're
actually<00:02:55.850> pretty<00:02:56.239> cool-looking<00:02:56.569> but<00:02:57.380> they

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
actually pretty cool-looking but they

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.990 
actually pretty cool-looking but they
are<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.680> little<00:02:57.859> challenging<00:02:58.549> to<00:02:58.579> put<00:02:58.850> together

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
are a little challenging to put together

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.509 
are a little challenging to put together
and<00:02:59.989> they<00:03:00.530> don't<00:03:00.709> stay<00:03:00.889> together<00:03:01.040> very<00:03:01.430> well

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
and they don't stay together very well

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.300 
and they don't stay together very well
so<00:03:02.060> if<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:03.019> want<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.380> could<00:03:03.560> probably<00:03:03.799> end<00:03:04.190> up

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
so if you want you could probably end up

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.250 
so if you want you could probably end up
gluing<00:03:05.180> them<00:03:05.299> together<00:03:05.450> but<00:03:05.810> they<00:03:05.959> kind<00:03:06.200> of

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
gluing them together but they kind of

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.530 
gluing them together but they kind of
snap<00:03:06.530> in<00:03:06.560> place<00:03:06.769> in<00:03:07.310> there<00:03:07.459> they're<00:03:08.030> flexible

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
snap in place in there they're flexible

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.800 
snap in place in there they're flexible
plastic<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:10.430> there's<00:03:10.639> the<00:03:10.819> four<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.150> got<00:03:11.510> right

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
plastic so there's the four I got right

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.539 
plastic so there's the four I got right
here<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.709> I'll<00:03:12.799> show<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.069> those<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.340> little

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
here and I'll show you those a little

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.879 
here and I'll show you those a little
bit<00:03:13.700> later<00:03:14.000> in<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.209> video<00:03:14.389> up<00:03:14.690> close<00:03:15.049> all

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
bit later in the video up close all
