a<00:01:18.299> not<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> big<00:01:19.340> decrease<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.939> was<00:01:21.060> hoping

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
a not a big decrease and I was hoping

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.080 
a not a big decrease and I was hoping
for<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:22.259> little<00:01:23.009> bit<00:01:23.100> bigger<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.430> started<00:01:23.909> like

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
for a a little bit bigger I started like

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.640 
for a a little bit bigger I started like
nineteen<00:01:24.540> seven<00:01:24.990> or<00:01:25.110> something<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.409> that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
nineteen seven or something like that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.480 
nineteen seven or something like that
and<00:01:25.890> now<00:01:26.549> I'm<00:01:26.700> down<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:28.189> 1889<00:01:29.900> I<00:01:30.900> mean<00:01:31.170> my

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
and now I'm down to like 1889 I mean my

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.060 
and now I'm down to like 1889 I mean my
analyzer<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.670> not<00:01:32.820> 100%<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.470> could<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.740> be

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
analyzer is not 100% so it could just be

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.770 
analyzer is not 100% so it could just be
that<00:01:35.340> it's<00:01:35.820> off<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> little<00:01:36.390> bit<00:01:36.540> or<00:01:36.630> whatever

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that it's off a little bit or whatever

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.010 
that it's off a little bit or whatever
but<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.500> mean<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.310> consistent<00:01:38.939> every<00:01:39.810> night<00:01:39.990> I

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
but I mean it's consistent every night I

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.359 
but I mean it's consistent every night I
usually<00:01:40.320> check<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.220> it's

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
usually check it in it and it's

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.520 
usually check it in it and it's
consistently<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.119> down<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.689> I'm<00:01:43.409> pretty

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
consistently going down so I'm pretty

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.330 
consistently going down so I'm pretty
pumped<00:01:43.740> about<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:45.950> man

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
pumped about that man

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.649 
pumped about that man
then<00:01:48.180> for<00:01:48.930> performing<00:01:49.590> I'm<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.479> really<00:01:51.479> like

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
then for performing I'm I really like

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.620 
then for performing I'm I really like
instant<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.229> mean<00:01:52.380> I've<00:01:52.799> taken<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.189> draw<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
instant I mean I've taken a draw and I

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.690
