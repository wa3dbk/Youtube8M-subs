this is a yard so almost 36 inches

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.679 
this is a yard so almost 36 inches
across<00:00:14.960> you<00:00:15.960> can<00:00:15.990> take<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:20.060> and<00:00:21.060> beat<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.510> all

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
across you can take this and beat it all

big what we got to do is use vengeance
usually<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.260> use<00:00:31.439> two<00:00:31.710> edges<00:00:32.300> because<00:00:33.300> they

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
usually you use two edges because they

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.650 
usually you use two edges because they
got<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.660> work<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:33.930> tandem<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:37.670> two<00:00:38.670> two<00:00:38.820> more<00:00:39.030> to

got it work in tandem to two two more to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.560 
got it work in tandem to two two more to
where<00:00:39.780> our<00:00:39.840> edges<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.500> better<00:00:40.649> than<00:00:40.829> none

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
where our edges are better than none

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.819 
where our edges are better than none
this<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.719> actually<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.110> third<00:00:43.320> wedge<00:00:43.559> but

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
this is actually the third wedge but

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.380 
this is actually the third wedge but
this<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.219> called<00:00:44.520> Salvage

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
this is called Salvage

when<00:00:46.140> those<00:00:46.289> two<00:00:46.350> wedges<00:00:47.420> won't<00:00:48.420> budge<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:49.140> use

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
when those two wedges won't budge I use

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.639 
when those two wedges won't budge I use
tell<00:00:50.480> v2<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.660> wedge<00:00:51.840> them<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.230> I'll<00:00:52.289> show<00:00:52.590> you

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649

two wedges and they're both stuck this

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:54.079 
two wedges and they're both stuck this
is<00:06:51.209> what<00:06:51.330> drives<00:06:51.599> it<00:06:51.930> in<00:06:52.050> there<00:06:52.699> the<00:06:53.699> question

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:54.089 
is what drives it in there the question

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:55.639 
is what drives it in there the question
would<00:06:54.180> be<00:06:54.240> well<00:06:54.599> why<00:06:54.870> don't<00:06:54.930> you<00:06:55.110> just<00:06:55.319> use<00:06:55.499> it

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:55.649 
would be well why don't you just use it

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:57.709 
would be well why don't you just use it
for<00:06:55.770> the<00:06:55.860> wedge<00:06:55.979> well<00:06:56.849> it's<00:06:57.029> very<00:06:57.149> hard<00:06:57.270> to<00:06:57.569> get

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:57.719 
for the wedge well it's very hard to get

00:06:57.719 --> 00:06:58.779 
for the wedge well it's very hard to get
this<00:06:57.870> started

00:06:58.779 --> 00:06:58.789 
this started

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.189 
this started
but<00:06:59.789> once<00:07:00.029> there's<00:07:00.240> a<00:07:00.300> split<00:07:00.629> in<00:07:00.749> there<00:07:01.080> you

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 
but once there's a split in there you

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.529 
but once there's a split in there you
can<00:07:01.349> put<00:07:01.529> that<00:07:01.649> in<00:07:01.830> there<00:07:02.009> so<00:07:02.309> bang<00:07:03.180> it<00:07:03.419> in

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 
can put that in there so bang it in

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:12.180 
can put that in there so bang it in
there<00:07:03.749> it<00:07:03.899> worked<00:07:04.139> very<00:07:04.259> very<00:07:04.559> good

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:12.190 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.750 

let<00:07:13.190> me<00:07:13.310> stop<00:07:13.550> it

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:13.760 
let me stop it

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.180
