00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.330 

the<00:00:10.880> ability<00:00:11.389> because<00:00:12.230> of<00:00:12.469> the<00:00:12.680> suspension<00:00:12.920> to

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
the ability because of the suspension to

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.029 
the ability because of the suspension to
travel<00:00:13.700> faster<00:00:14.289> I'm<00:00:15.289> guessing<00:00:15.799> we<00:00:15.920> can

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
travel faster I'm guessing we can

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.390 
travel faster I'm guessing we can
improve<00:00:16.309> our<00:00:16.520> efficiency<00:00:17.119> at<00:00:17.240> least<00:00:17.480> 50%

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
improve our efficiency at least 50%

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.100 
improve our efficiency at least 50%
possibly<00:00:19.400> more<00:00:19.610> if<00:00:20.000> we<00:00:20.180> get<00:00:20.360> in<00:00:20.480> a<00:00:20.540> large<00:00:20.779> field

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
possibly more if we get in a large field

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.029 
possibly more if we get in a large field
I<00:00:21.680> can<00:00:22.070> keep<00:00:22.369> we<00:00:23.029> just<00:00:23.210> have<00:00:23.360> a<00:00:23.710> 1,000<00:00:24.710> gallon

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
I can keep we just have a 1,000 gallon

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.979 
I can keep we just have a 1,000 gallon
tender<00:00:25.340> tank<00:00:25.610> we<00:00:25.910> used<00:00:26.119> with<00:00:26.270> pickup<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:26.840> put

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:26.989 
tender tank we used with pickup and put

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.280 
tender tank we used with pickup and put
the<00:00:27.079> chemicals<00:00:27.529> in<00:00:27.649> the<00:00:27.680> back<00:00:28.869> it<00:00:29.869> used<00:00:30.050> to<00:00:30.169> be

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.290 
the chemicals in the back it used to be

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.560 
the chemicals in the back it used to be
once<00:00:30.860> we<00:00:30.919> filled<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:31.309> other<00:00:31.430> sprayer<00:00:31.820> we<00:00:32.270> just

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
once we filled the other sprayer we just

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.290 
once we filled the other sprayer we just
use<00:00:32.780> a<00:00:32.809> 10<00:00:33.050> gallon<00:00:33.230> per<00:00:33.530> acre<00:00:33.829> rate<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:34.370> we<00:00:35.090> use

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
use a 10 gallon per acre rate and we use

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.660 
use a 10 gallon per acre rate and we use
a<00:00:35.329> 900<00:00:35.870> gallon<00:00:36.170> fill<00:00:36.380> we<00:00:36.559> can<00:00:36.649> spray<00:00:36.829> 90<00:00:37.160> acres

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
a 900 gallon fill we can spray 90 acres

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.150 
a 900 gallon fill we can spray 90 acres
well<00:00:38.059> it<00:00:38.270> seems<00:00:38.510> true<00:00:38.780> with<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.050> Apache<00:00:39.350> but

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
well it seems true with the Apache but

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.270 
well it seems true with the Apache but
we're<00:00:40.309> doing<00:00:40.399> that<00:00:40.670> probably<00:00:40.969> 50%<00:00:41.690> faster<00:00:42.280> so

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
we're doing that probably 50% faster so

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.840 
we're doing that probably 50% faster so
it<00:00:44.060> keeps<00:00:44.270> that<00:00:44.450> guy<00:00:44.660> a<00:00:44.690> little<00:00:44.990> busier<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:46.460> it

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
it keeps that guy a little busier and it

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.310 
it keeps that guy a little busier and it
keeps<00:00:47.060> me<00:00:47.320> doing<00:00:48.320> more<00:00:48.680> so<00:00:49.550> I<00:00:50.240> don't<00:00:50.930> feel<00:00:51.140> as

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
keeps me doing more so I don't feel as

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.729 
keeps me doing more so I don't feel as
rushed<00:00:51.670> with<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.820> other<00:00:52.970> sprayer<00:00:53.300> was<00:00:53.739> you

without<00:01:07.670> trying<00:01:08.090> harder<00:01:09.220> when<00:01:10.220> I<00:01:10.250> was<00:01:10.460> running

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
without trying harder when I was running

my pole behind I had a I had a 1,300
gallon<00:01:13.040> pool<00:01:13.219> behind<00:01:13.600> pulled<00:01:14.600> it<00:01:14.719> with<00:01:14.840> a

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
gallon pool behind pulled it with a

gallon pool behind pulled it with a
fairly<00:01:15.380> good-sized<00:01:15.770> tractor<00:01:16.280> we<00:01:16.670> would<00:01:16.880> run

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
fairly good-sized tractor we would run

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.569 
fairly good-sized tractor we would run
top<00:01:17.780> speed<00:01:18.139> 7<00:01:18.530> mile<00:01:18.679> and<00:01:18.799> I<00:01:18.859> just<00:01:19.340> couldn't

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
top speed 7 mile and I just couldn't

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.489 
top speed 7 mile and I just couldn't
ride<00:01:19.759> it<00:01:19.969> anymore

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499

were lucky to cover half that much and

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.639 
were lucky to cover half that much and
just<00:01:34.999> felt<00:01:35.270> completely<00:01:35.719> beat<00:01:36.049> up<00:01:36.229> by<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:36.469> end

once and it came out of it alright so
the<00:01:52.759> accumulators<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.950> first<00:01:55.189> time<00:01:55.429> I<00:01:55.459> filled

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
the accumulators the first time I filled

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.910 
the accumulators the first time I filled
it<00:01:55.939> up<00:01:56.029> was<00:01:56.240> with<00:01:56.659> Chemical<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.590> was<00:01:57.709> sitting

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
that running and as the cumulated it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.289 
that running and as the cumulated it
forced<00:02:00.920> down<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.340> then<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.520> machine<00:02:01.849> right

forced down and then the machine right

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.599 
forced down and then the machine right
in<00:02:02.450> itself<00:02:02.810> can't<00:02:03.109> it's<00:02:03.380> just<00:02:03.619> I<00:02:03.859> wasn't<00:02:04.340> quite

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:06.529 
ready for that I was but it if that's

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:08.020 
ready for that I was but it if that's
what<00:02:06.679> improves<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.279> ride<00:02:07.459> and<00:02:07.609> keeps<00:02:07.849> the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
what improves the ride and keeps the

I<00:02:16.040> mean<00:02:16.069> they've<00:02:16.370> got

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
I mean they've got

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.380 
I mean they've got

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
a cab very sound I like the parking

machine<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.650> had<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.160> had<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.430> worry<00:02:50.640> about<00:02:51.140> oil

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
machine I had you had to worry about oil

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.010 
machine I had you had to worry about oil
leaks<00:02:52.650> here<00:02:53.130> their<00:02:53.460> hoses<00:02:53.790> they<00:02:54.720> had

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
leaks here their hoses they had

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.800 
leaks here their hoses they had
everything<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:55.770> tight<00:02:56.270> in<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.450> framework

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
everything so tight in the framework

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.980 
everything so tight in the framework
that<00:02:58.700> over<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.820> years<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.180> war<00:03:00.570> through

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
that over the years of war through

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.070 
that over the years of war through
hydraulic<00:03:01.710> lines<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:03.450> first<00:03:03.630> place<00:03:03.900> I

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
hydraulic lines the first place I

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.810 
hydraulic lines the first place I
noticed<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.470> big<00:03:04.620> advantages<00:03:05.070> in<00:03:05.340> corners

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
noticed the big advantages in corners

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.690 
noticed the big advantages in corners
and<00:03:06.470> in<00:03:07.470> droves<00:03:07.770> on<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.010> fields<00:03:08.310> it's<00:03:08.460> just

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
and in droves on the fields it's just

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.490 
and in droves on the fields it's just
far<00:03:08.970> faster<00:03:09.240> and<00:03:09.630> more<00:03:09.750> accurate<00:03:10.230> with<00:03:10.350> this

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
far faster and more accurate with this

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.870 
far faster and more accurate with this
machine<00:03:11.150> we<00:03:12.150> don't<00:03:12.360> have<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.890> we<00:03:14.730> have<00:03:14.850> a

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
machine we don't have the the we have a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.310 
machine we don't have the the we have a
lot<00:03:15.180> more<00:03:15.210> crop<00:03:15.630> clearance<00:03:16.050> or<00:03:16.200> you're

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
lot more crop clearance or you're

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.200 
lot more crop clearance or you're
limited<00:03:16.740> by<00:03:16.770> the<00:03:16.920> front<00:03:17.190> axle<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.030> rear

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
limited by the front axle and the rear

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.500 
limited by the front axle and the rear
portion<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.780> sprayer<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:20.520> we<00:03:21.180> don't<00:03:21.360> get

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
portion of the sprayer and we don't get

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.080 
portion of the sprayer and we don't get
the<00:03:21.600> crop<00:03:21.810> damage<00:03:22.070> so<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.130> think<00:03:23.610> they're<00:03:23.760> just

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
the crop damage so I think they're just

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.900 
the crop damage so I think they're just
enough<00:03:24.330> items<00:03:24.540> there<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:25.730> make<00:03:26.730> that

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
enough items there that make that

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.470 
enough items there that make that
additional<00:03:27.330> cost<00:03:27.390> worth<00:03:28.260> it
