00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
contact points the nose is going to be

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.380

slightly<00:00:36.750> longer<00:00:37.260> than<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.890> tail<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:39.120> what's

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
slightly longer than the tail but what's

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.729 
slightly longer than the tail but what's
up<00:00:39.600> what's<00:00:39.899> good<00:00:40.110> about<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.350> deck<00:00:40.710> is

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
up what's good about this deck is

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.670 
up what's good about this deck is
actually<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.579> no<00:00:41.790> hang-ups<00:00:42.420> pop<00:00:42.809> which<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
actually the no hang-ups pop which is a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.119 
actually the no hang-ups pop which is a
is<00:00:44.100> Canada<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> camper<00:00:45.239> profile<00:00:45.980> that<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
is Canada is a camper profile that the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.279 
is Canada is a camper profile that the
board<00:00:47.460> has<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.090> what's<00:00:48.270> unique<00:00:48.360> about<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.050> is

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
board has but what's unique about it is

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.950 
board has but what's unique about it is
that<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.670> diamond<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.750> diamond

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that it's in this diamond like a diamond

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.130 
that it's in this diamond like a diamond
like<00:00:52.260> shape<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.420> for<00:00:54.420> instance<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
like shape so for instance like the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.010 
like shape so for instance like the
camera<00:00:55.559> will<00:00:55.770> kind<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.449> this

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
camera will kind of be in this this

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.130 
camera will kind of be in this this
diamond<00:00:58.680> type<00:00:58.920> shape<00:00:59.370> the<00:01:00.329> diamond<00:01:00.750> ends

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
diamond type shape the diamond ends

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.080 
diamond type shape the diamond ends
about<00:01:01.289> 10<00:01:01.559> millimeters<00:01:02.129> before<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> contact

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
about 10 millimeters before the contact

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.420 
about 10 millimeters before the contact
points<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.660> then<00:01:04.049> outside<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.769> diamond

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
points and then outside of that diamond

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.910 
points and then outside of that diamond
shape<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> triangle<00:01:06.420> shape<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:07.530> border

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
shape with a triangle shape the border

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.000 
shape with a triangle shape the border
actually<00:01:08.820> has<00:01:08.970> continuous<00:01:09.750> curve<00:01:10.530> linear

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
actually has continuous curve linear

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.060 
actually has continuous curve linear
rocker<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.420> cannot<00:01:12.659> boast<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.770> every

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
rocker so it cannot boast up in every

bit<00:01:58.060> more<00:01:58.439> structural<00:01:59.439> integrity<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:01.750> in

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
bit more structural integrity then in

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.200 
bit more structural integrity then in
combination<00:02:03.130> with<00:02:03.159> all<00:02:03.549> that<00:02:03.759> is<00:02:03.939> going<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.149> be

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
combination with all that is going to be

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.230 
combination with all that is going to be
a<00:02:04.240> traditional<00:02:04.509> by<00:02:04.990> ax<00:02:05.290> fiberglass<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.240> an

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
a traditional by ax fiberglass and an

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.620 
a traditional by ax fiberglass and an
impact<00:02:07.780> base<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.530> really<00:02:09.220> like<00:02:09.489> this<00:02:09.729> base<00:02:10.030> but

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
impact base I really like this base but

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.120 
impact base I really like this base but
what<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:10.840> like<00:02:11.080> more<00:02:11.349> than<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.680> base<00:02:11.860> is

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
what I like more than the base is

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.540 
what I like more than the base is
actually<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.819> quick<00:02:13.090> rip<00:02:13.330> side<00:02:13.630> cut<00:02:13.900> edges<00:02:14.550> in

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
actually the quick rip side cut edges in

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.009 
actually the quick rip side cut edges in
between<00:02:15.970> your<00:02:16.239> feet<00:02:16.450> there's<00:02:16.750> gonna<00:02:16.870> be<00:02:16.959> a

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
between your feet there's gonna be a

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.350 
between your feet there's gonna be a
smaller<00:02:17.349> side<00:02:17.620> cut<00:02:17.830> radius<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.459> then<00:02:19.030> outside

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
smaller side cut radius and then outside

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.270 
smaller side cut radius and then outside
of<00:02:19.690> where<00:02:20.019> your<00:02:20.170> feets<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:20.890> going<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.220> be

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
of where your feets it is going to be

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.190 
of where your feets it is going to be
about<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.430> medium<00:02:21.760> side<00:02:22.120> cut<00:02:22.300> radius<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.810> then

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
about a medium side cut radius and then

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.780 
about a medium side cut radius and then
go<00:02:23.680> through<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:23.950> nose<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.370> tail<00:02:24.430> the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
go through the nose and the tail the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.070 
go through the nose and the tail the
boards<00:02:25.000> can<00:02:25.090> have<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.300> larger<00:02:25.690> side<00:02:25.900> cut<00:02:26.050> radius

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
boards can have a larger side cut radius

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.000 
boards can have a larger side cut radius
so<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.910> know<00:02:28.000> depending<00:02:28.360> on<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:29.200> can<00:02:29.350> ride<00:02:29.620> at

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
so you know depending on you can ride at

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.220 
so you know depending on you can ride at
any<00:02:30.340> speed<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.970> make<00:02:31.209> any<00:02:31.480> size<00:02:31.750> are<00:02:32.019> key

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
any speed and make any size are key

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.680 
any speed and make any size are key
terms<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:32.890> want<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:34.299> brigade

snowboard is going to be able to let you
do<00:02:37.239> that<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:38.049> this<00:02:38.830> is<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.519> rad<00:02:39.850> board

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
do that so this is a this is a rad board

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.420 
do that so this is a this is a rad board
it<00:02:40.450> still<00:02:40.690> has<00:02:40.900> like<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.410> shape<00:02:41.739> in<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.069> feel

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
it still has like the shape in the feel

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.840 
it still has like the shape in the feel
of<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:43.269> traditional<00:02:43.750> camber<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:45.310> then<00:02:45.640> also

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
of a traditional camber and then also

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.880 
of a traditional camber and then also
has<00:02:46.150> like<00:02:46.360> almost<00:02:46.989> a<00:02:47.140> feel<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.620> rocker

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
has like almost a feel of a rocker

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.340 
has like almost a feel of a rocker
without<00:02:48.340> actually<00:02:48.790> having<00:02:48.970> rocker<00:02:49.930> um

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
without actually having rocker um

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.539 
without actually having rocker um
because<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.730> continuous<00:02:52.450> curve<00:02:53.019> linear

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
because of that continuous curve linear

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.900 
because of that continuous curve linear
on<00:02:54.630> nose<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.660> tail<00:02:56.080> so<00:02:56.739> yeah<00:02:57.280> that's<00:02:57.730> pretty

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
on nose and tail so yeah that's pretty

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.430 
on nose and tail so yeah that's pretty
