00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
put your camera down on the ground face

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.230 
put your camera down on the ground face
down<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:22.230> lens<00:00:22.470> itself<00:00:22.920> won't<00:00:23.580> actually<00:00:23.880> hit

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
down the lens itself won't actually hit

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.420 
down the lens itself won't actually hit
the<00:00:24.269> ground<00:00:24.539> where<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.050> hero<00:00:25.199> 2<00:00:25.400> when<00:00:26.400> the

the ground where the hero 2 when the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.570 
the ground where the hero 2 when the

ground the hero 3 this beveled edge on
the<00:00:33.450> lens<00:00:33.630> sticks<00:00:34.380> out<00:00:34.590> around<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.430> glass<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the lens sticks out around the glass and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.799 
the lens sticks out around the glass and
protects<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> lens<00:00:36.750> from<00:00:36.899> getting<00:00:37.110> scratched

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
protects the lens from getting scratched

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.270 
protects the lens from getting scratched
some<00:00:39.809> things<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:40.559> about<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.860> aren't

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
some things that I see about that aren't

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.020 
some things that I see about that aren't
so<00:00:41.430> good<00:00:42.230> it's<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.350> lot<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.829> seems<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.820> lot

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
so good it's a lot it seems to be a lot

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.860 
so good it's a lot it seems to be a lot
more<00:00:46.820> fingerprint<00:00:47.820> friendly<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.420> seems<00:00:48.719> like

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
more fingerprint friendly it seems like

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.029 
more fingerprint friendly it seems like
it's<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.140> little<00:00:49.200> bit<00:00:49.410> harder<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.739> keep<00:00:49.980> clean

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
it's a little bit harder to keep clean

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.590 
it's a little bit harder to keep clean
and<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:52.020> biggest<00:00:52.350> thing<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.860> I've<00:00:53.219> noticed

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
and the biggest thing that I've noticed

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.180 
and the biggest thing that I've noticed
I<00:00:54.600> don't<00:00:55.140> know<00:00:55.199> if<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.530> see<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.860> or<00:00:56.039> not

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
I don't know if you can see it or not

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.330 
I don't know if you can see it or not
but<00:00:56.309> I've<00:00:56.550> got<00:00:56.820> dirt<00:00:57.210> stock<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:58.440> between<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
but I've got dirt stock in between the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.330 
but I've got dirt stock in between the
lens<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.260> this<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.649> middle<00:01:01.949> section

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
lens and this in that middle section

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.600 
lens and this in that middle section
where<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.910> lens<00:01:03.210> poked<00:01:03.629> into<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:05.159> don't

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
where the lens poked into and I don't

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.780 
where the lens poked into and I don't
really<00:01:06.000> know<00:01:06.210> how<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.689> out<00:01:07.640> with<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
really know how to get it out with the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.910 
really know how to get it out with the
hero<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.780> could<00:01:10.020> clean<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.530> inside<00:01:10.890> of

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
hero to you could clean the inside of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.179 
hero to you could clean the inside of
the<00:01:11.430> positively<00:01:12.000> no<00:01:12.119> problem<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.930> hero<00:01:13.140> 3<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the positively no problem the hero 3 the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.190 
the positively no problem the hero 3 the
ins<00:01:14.369> islands<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.000> almost<00:01:15.270> impossible<00:01:15.509> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
ins islands is almost impossible to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.260 
ins islands is almost impossible to
clean<00:01:16.409> because<00:01:17.210> you<00:01:18.210> open<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.509> up<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:24.090> can

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
clean because you open this up you can

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.120 
clean because you open this up you can
see<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.420> there's<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.900> big<00:01:25.380> round<00:01:25.650> section

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
see that there's that big round section

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.560 
see that there's that big round section
which<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.299> could<00:01:27.450> easily

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
which we can get to and we could easily

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.030 
which we can get to and we could easily
clean<00:01:28.049> with<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> cloth<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.670> edges<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.540> it

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
clean with a cloth but the edges of it

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.980 
clean with a cloth but the edges of it
you<00:01:32.040> can<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.640> they've<00:01:33.270> put<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.689> safety

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
you can and they've put the safety

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.410 
you can and they've put the safety
screwdriver<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> front<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> which<00:01:36.210> we

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
screwdriver on the front of it which we

corner of the lens which seems to have

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.560 
corner of the lens which seems to have
got<00:01:45.390> dirt<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:46.159> that's<00:01:47.159> by<00:01:47.399> big<00:01:47.759> con<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.450> it

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
got dirt in it that's by big con to it

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.319 
got dirt in it that's by big con to it
the<00:01:48.810> big<00:01:48.960> pluses<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.470> course<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.180> it's<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the big pluses of course that it it's a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.600 
the big pluses of course that it it's a
lot<00:01:51.509> wise<00:01:52.170> better<00:01:52.740> underwater<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.549> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
lot wise better underwater it's like a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.490 
lot wise better underwater it's like a
dive<00:01:53.790> housing<00:01:54.030> it'll<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.659> focus<00:01:55.110> underwater

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
dive housing it'll have focus underwater

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.850 
dive housing it'll have focus underwater
and<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.969> old<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.329> doesn't<00:01:58.049> obviously<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.680> has

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
and the old one doesn't obviously it has

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.069 
and the old one doesn't obviously it has
very<00:01:59.070> fuzzy<00:01:59.310> focus<00:01:59.700> underwater<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.240> lots<00:02:00.869> of

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
very fuzzy focus underwater so lots of

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.499 
very fuzzy focus underwater so lots of
big<00:02:01.259> pluses<00:02:01.649> it'll<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.640> better<00:02:02.850> call<00:02:03.329> I

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
big pluses it'll have better call I

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.520 
big pluses it'll have better call I
think<00:02:03.719> it'll<00:02:03.840> have<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> lot<00:02:04.320> sharper

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
think it'll have to be a lot sharper

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.590 
think it'll have to be a lot sharper
it'll<00:02:05.460> won't<00:02:05.579> get<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.790> start<00:02:05.969> underwater<00:02:06.360> will

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
it'll won't get to start underwater will

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.670 
it'll won't get to start underwater will
be<00:02:06.689> able<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.840> go<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.079> out<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.350> water<00:02:07.530> with

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
be able to go in out of the water with

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.040 
be able to go in out of the water with
no<00:02:07.710> problems<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.670> doesn't<00:02:09.420> get<00:02:09.509> scratched<00:02:09.750> you

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
no problems it doesn't get scratched you

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.839 
no problems it doesn't get scratched you
put<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.319> on<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.470> ground<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.129> think<00:02:11.370> overall

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
put it on the ground so I think overall

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.020 
put it on the ground so I think overall
lots<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.420> pluses<00:02:12.720> but

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
lots of pluses but

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.309
