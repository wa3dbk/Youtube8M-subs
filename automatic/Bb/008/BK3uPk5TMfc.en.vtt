00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:12.450
 open rhinoceros open any 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.760
 model and the first thing to do for 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.720
 order to transfer her to pick it up 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.789
 use the mesh from tool 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:28.140
 surface translate our could in polygons 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:32.450
 at maximum we hide 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.540
 nurbs select the resulting mesh and 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.230
 export it 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.230
 both format 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:56.980
 then open pick press import 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:03.040
 import our file here stretch 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:05.940
 press it edit and almost possible 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.670
 get to work then go to the tab 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:14.680
 diameter in this tab is a sea ​​of facts about 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:21.130
 friend and click weld point for what it is 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:24.460
 our object is now not connected 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:31.110
 weld point 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.110
 he connects all our points 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.100
 and so the second option we select nurbs 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.940
 export it 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.940
 you goal format 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:56.590
 then open the magic import our 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.590
 Ester here we treat him 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.810
 and keep the same style 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.820
 further we load our stl pancake and 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.950
 select it export it again in about 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.950
 god format 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.030
 so after downloading directly 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:45.300
 object in the scene pick we have two 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:50.310
 the way first is the tab diameter and 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.720
 polygon division button device 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.100
 so we have majesty 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:01.780
 the number of polygons increases and 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:08.020
 allows us to work the following is ari 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:12.400
 the topology is used with the tab 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:16.830
 Dynamic raise the resolution and press 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.239
 the button is dynamic we have the whole model 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.230
 rebuilt 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:26.080
 new grid and so can 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.810
 continue to work well all good 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.630
 light mood models participate in 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.930
 group life and see you next 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.930
 mini lessons
