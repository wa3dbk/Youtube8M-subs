00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.310
 welcome to a new episode of 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.830
 independence play your format for 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.179
 exciting and curious indie games us 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.490
 start with a new announcement 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.019
 The rice is the name of the rice 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.990
 developer comes with that probably 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.320
 best names of the industry super from the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.300
 not only hyper people of the mega team 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.100
 the name is cool also the gameplay will be 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.630
 really much promise the first trailer 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.550
 If you look closely, it looks 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.980
 a little bit like going in the direction of metal 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.050
 slug with alien hormonal homenet it 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.270
 was this game with the little alien 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.250
 what bios the developers of castle 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.809
 Crashers have made the developers 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.870
 So great outside of the people 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.149
 negative is cool name say 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.030
 again, it's more of a limbo like that 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.980
 weapon so your task is the world 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.780
 save for space marines and thereby 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.730
 every shot to enjoy what that now 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.840
 somehow I have to do with limo 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.300
 not exactly so 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.879
 It does not matter because the world is 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.649
 Hand drawn looks really good 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.149
 a mixture of easily destroyed and 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.520
 always in the background this debil 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.110
 grinning sun looks fantastic 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.939
 Risen seems in any case already now 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.450
 on my top list of in games 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.450
 yet to come 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.140
 less debile and colorful then it goes off 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.520
 this winter at fragments of him too 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.310
 that reflects more in the direction 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.130
 sad depressed and emotional for it 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.540
 works the death of a man on turns 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.640
 So what were his last 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.869
 thoughts and how did he live the lives of 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.210
 his family and his friends 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.009
 The game is influenced by the match 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.750
 he also kept his eyes visually simple 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.250
 So here rather a sterile white 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.869
 look and the figures do not have either 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.570
 eyes and mouths but rather him 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.100
 like mannequins out of the whole 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.530
 playful rather an interactive one 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.979
 story could be like this 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.390
 like gone home just just less colorful 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.220
 but certainly is in any case that 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:04.250
 her a lot of handkerchiefs 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:05.929
 will want to destroy the more im 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.640
 kickstarter spotlight is there 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.229
 week the game times binner das 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.420
 especially you like retro fans 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.880
 it is likely to be one 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.500
 classic 2d metroid if you like that 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.209
 brings along elements such as the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.050
 to be able to stop time for opponents 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.390
 expel 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.150
 The story is about revenge 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.280
 story a woman travels through time 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.290
 to destroy a technology empire 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.820
 there is someone for that 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.170
 responsible for your family 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.750
 died and that is natural 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.519
 not as cool as an edward 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.250
 less typical then depending on 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.260
 time period new area should be current 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.810
 the game definitely for ps4 ps vita 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.610
 pc mac and linux come out if you 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.230
 because to kicks about it and one 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.850
 then invest a bit in the game 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.260
 It may even happen that too 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.260
 still comes out for the 3ds 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.450
 Envy is and play that yourself 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.099
 probably would never play 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.319
 if not so nice minimalist 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.360
 and it would be clear that it's about 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.819
 the topic sap and stents I am 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.010
 basically shit bad 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.659
 but here you play little 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.560
 rectangle and you can see on the map 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.239
 pretty good 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.430
 which view you somehow field 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.319
 you have to dodge it then you can too 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.970
 Doors open Doors Adjust 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.890
 Turn off guards in the closet hide 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.379
 the typical dumb thing you stop in the 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.609
 sales game but so does's 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.530
 on top of that, another story 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.970
 who is one actually as 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.129
 this rectangle and what about the 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.109
 Rectangle happens somehow completely 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.120
 interesting especially because of 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.920
 a minimalist version of monaco 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.290
 remembers with a few elements of 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.209
 whole two really cool in the games 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:59.239
 which should definitely catch up if they 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:04:01.430
 have not yet played the coming out 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.989
 simulator is only 20 minutes long and 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.329
 free of charge in the browser playable 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.230
 which is why I am only referring to each one of you 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.389
 can lay heart 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.650
 I have the little game played and 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.150
 was really touched by that 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.790
 personal history of developers 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.889
 niki case it is about how he is 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.579
 his conservative parents confess that 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.959
 he is gay 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.489
 you are in the game for it 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.079
 responsible the appropriate dialogue 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.550
 options in different scenes too 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.949
 The whole thing is a bit reminiscent 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.539
 dead on the walking and then you have to 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.449
 wait as the parents and yours 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.370
 environment reacts to your reaction so 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.410
 seriously the topic is now all the better 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.449
 I found with what humor and what 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.710
 movie allusions djs now be on 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.539
 approached 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.729
 and then of course there is the 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:44.400
 fair that remains at the end and for 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:46.050
 the worth the 20 minutes anyway 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.449
 you remember the last one 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.210
 march as the internet this great 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.400
 told trailer of Kroll emerged 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.680
 that was this game with the local 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.139
 multiplayer where your friends the monsters 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.660
 play and as soon as you die the 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.550
 Friends take over your role cool 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.160
 Concept and actually the game should be 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.199
 already tomorrow for early access appears 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.750
 but unfortunately the developer bauerhof 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.419
 the game now from tax law 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.490
 but moving has one but 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.810
 wonderful funny gif published 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.760
 then they are finally the ones 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.750
 only true method so a message 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.699
 get across 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.470
 which in turn is good news 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.210
 probably the thing just shifts 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.660
 a few days maybe only 12 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.030
 weeks 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.160
 So it could come out every day 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.490
 So keep your eyes to call 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.490
 open 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.160
 one of the most promising projects 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.430
 the week is probably cloud would come a msg 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.289
 So almost a massively multiplayer 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.930
 story game instead of its classic 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.370
 game experience tends to go in the direction 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.440
 Scavenger hunt you have to be on the internet 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.240
 together with other people found 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.550
 footage movies diary entries 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.400
 electronic music photographs cards 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.590
 and analyze documentation and 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.389
 to find out together why 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.370
 this mysterious signal from the 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.789
 Space was kept secret for 40 years 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.470
 has been 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.960
 the whole thing reminded me right away 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.599
 a little bit of the lost experience of 2006 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.760
 that was almost an internet game where fans 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.830
 the tv-serie lost together in the net 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.750
 they were looking for the mysterious ones 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.320
 further explain the events of the series 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.479
 should 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.880
 the concept of cloud chamber sounds 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.260
 very similar to the lost experience and 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.840
 if you now not just 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.789
 Excited like me then let you have one 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.590
 say the actor of ray 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:32.440
 liberation from game of thrones plays 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.860
 With 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.860
 release date 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.789
 and finally a note in own 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.550
 Thing 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:51.199
 currently there is a steam on the game 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.960
 namely a big hype learns namely 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:56.330
 an turn of days at and 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.370
 Minecraft- like look became the game 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.900
 developed by the 16-year-old and for that 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.940
 early access is really pretty 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.900
 Impressive matz ​​and I have that 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.270
 all played on 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.130
 a full two-part giga gameplay 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.490
 you can find on giga de and dogs 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.110
 link more to the answer 's in the giga 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.940
 gameplay you will find if you are there 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.680
 down on this beautiful rectangle 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.479
 besides, we have two more 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.860
 special videos for you in the one 

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.900
 Look at the guys a few sell 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.120
 applications and rate them in the 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.430
 others dream you two German 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.199
 really great youtube channels before the 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.530
 nothing to do with let's play a lot 

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.530
 fun
