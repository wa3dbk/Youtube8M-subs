come<00:04:23.230> off<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:23.560> mean<00:04:23.680> you<00:04:23.830> could<00:04:23.950> take<00:04:24.130> the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
come off I mean you could take the

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.220 
come off I mean you could take the
doll's<00:04:24.490> head<00:04:24.700> off<00:04:24.850> I<00:04:25.000> guess<00:04:25.210> to<00:04:25.840> take<00:04:26.020> it<00:04:26.140> off

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230

because she really um the arrow ones
really<00:04:41.500> stand<00:04:41.830> out<00:04:42.040> from<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.610> other<00:04:42.790> ones<00:04:43.060> in

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
really stand out from the other ones in

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.560 
really stand out from the other ones in
terms<00:04:43.810> of<00:04:44.110> detail<00:04:45.120> they're<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.150> little<00:04:46.330> bit

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
terms of detail they're a little bit

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.810 
terms of detail they're a little bit
more<00:04:46.600> expensive<00:04:47.020> uh<00:04:49.980> as<00:04:50.980> you<00:04:51.160> can<00:04:51.190> see<00:04:51.550> they

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
more expensive uh as you can see they

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.670 
more expensive uh as you can see they
don't<00:04:52.000> necessarily<00:04:52.240> have<00:04:52.840> boots<00:04:53.080> because<00:04:53.500> our

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
don't necessarily have boots because our
