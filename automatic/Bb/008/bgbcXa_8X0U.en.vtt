00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.270 
and into it I'm adding 800 grams of
butter<00:00:51.650> now<00:00:52.650> I'm<00:00:52.830> probably<00:00:52.980> going<00:00:53.190> to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
butter now I'm probably going to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
butter now I'm probably going to
disappear<00:00:53.880> in<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.090> cloud<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.540> icing<00:00:55.050> smoke<00:00:55.440> now

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.190 

now<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:04.110> your<00:01:04.290> butter<00:01:04.530> isn't<00:01:04.830> oh<00:01:05.960> if<00:01:06.960> your

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
now if your butter isn't oh if your

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.170 
now if your butter isn't oh if your
butter<00:01:07.440> isn't<00:01:07.710> already<00:01:08.160> softened<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.970> can

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
butter isn't already softened you can

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.000 
butter isn't already softened you can
pop<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.660> microwave<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.290> 10<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.650> 20

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
pop it in the microwave for 10 to 20

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.880 
pop it in the microwave for 10 to 20
seconds<00:01:11.990> if<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.080> don't<00:01:13.140> remember<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.650> leave

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
seconds if you don't remember to leave

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.540 
seconds if you don't remember to leave

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
it out of the fridge now it's ideal to

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.550

use a big bowl for this as you can see I

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.750 
use a big bowl for this as you can see I
could<00:01:19.830> probably<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.250> with<00:01:20.430> something<00:01:20.700> a

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
could probably do with something a

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:32.160 
could probably do with something a
little<00:01:20.900> larger

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.890

going to put half a tablespoon of
vanilla<00:01:50.650> in<00:01:51.180> now<00:01:52.180> that's<00:01:53.140> about<00:01:53.290> two<00:01:53.619> teaspoon

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
full but this is a large amount of icing

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:04.320 
full but this is a large amount of icing
so<00:02:01.830> okay<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.040> then<00:02:03.460> we've<00:02:03.610> also<00:02:03.729> got<00:02:03.970> some

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
so okay and then we've also got some

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.600 
so okay and then we've also got some
milk<00:02:04.570> on<00:02:04.720> hand<00:02:05.050> just<00:02:05.259> in<00:02:05.649> case<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:06.160> icing

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
milk on hand just in case the icing

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:22.290 
milk on hand just in case the icing
needs<00:02:06.789> thinning<00:02:07.180> a<00:02:07.240> little

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.780 

right<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.420> can<00:02:23.600> see<00:02:23.840> now<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:25.280> icing

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
right you can see now that the icing

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.760 
right you can see now that the icing
sugar<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.180> almost<00:02:26.560> incorporated<00:02:29.470> it's<00:02:30.470> still

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
sugar is almost incorporated it's still

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.380 
sugar is almost incorporated it's still
quite<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.010> firm<00:02:31.370> icing<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:34.640> we're<00:02:35.120> just<00:02:35.150> going

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
quite a firm icing so we're just going

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
quite a firm icing so we're just going
to<00:02:35.480> add<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.660> little<00:02:36.140> splash<00:02:36.440> of<00:02:36.680> milk<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.160> this

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
to add a little splash of milk to this

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.900 
to add a little splash of milk to this
now<00:02:39.410> remember<00:02:39.770> if<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:39.980> add<00:02:40.100> too<00:02:40.370> much<00:02:40.400> milk

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
now remember if you add too much milk

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.710 
now remember if you add too much milk
you<00:02:41.060> can<00:02:41.240> always<00:02:41.390> add<00:02:41.600> more<00:02:41.630> icing<00:02:42.380> sugar<00:02:42.590> to

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
you can always add more icing sugar to

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:52.040 
you can always add more icing sugar to
get<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.810> mixture<00:02:45.050> firm<00:02:45.320> again

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.080 

so<00:02:52.620> but<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.490> just<00:02:53.640> about<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:53.970> right

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
so but this is just about the right

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.440 
so but this is just about the right
consistency<00:02:54.990> if<00:02:55.110> you're<00:02:55.230> going<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.530> pipe<00:02:55.770> it

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
consistency if you're going to pipe it

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.230 
consistency if you're going to pipe it
with<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.480> bag<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.490> what<00:03:02.670> we<00:03:02.820> end<00:03:02.970> up

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
with a bag and this is what we end up

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:12.110 
with a bag and this is what we end up
with<00:03:06.080> that's<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.260> delicious<00:03:07.860> vanilla<00:03:09.110> frosting
