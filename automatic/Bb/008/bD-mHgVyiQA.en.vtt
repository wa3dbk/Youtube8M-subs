doesn't<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.340> functionality<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.539> in

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
doesn't have that functionality but in

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.090 
doesn't have that functionality but in
my<00:00:51.780> case<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.199> believe<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> router<00:00:52.890> does

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
my case I believe that the router does

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.590 
my case I believe that the router does
have<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.430> functionality<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.059> therefore<00:00:54.480> I'm

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
have that functionality is therefore I'm

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.720 
have that functionality is therefore I'm
gonna<00:00:54.750> I'm<00:00:54.840> gonna<00:00:54.899> show<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.230> guys<00:00:55.410> if<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.489> are

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
gonna I'm gonna show you guys if you are

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.720

home owners to version media router and
their<00:01:00.000> service<00:01:00.449> then<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.590> router<00:01:01.770> there

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
their service then on the router there

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.529 
their service then on the router there
is<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> setting<00:01:02.550> where<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:02.969> assign<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
console to a static IP rather than going

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.480 
console to a static IP rather than going
for<00:01:06.450> your<00:01:06.570> Xbox<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:07.170> console<00:01:07.619> itself<00:01:07.890> but

make it a static IP what we're gonna

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.860 
make it a static IP what we're gonna
have<00:02:46.829> to<00:02:47.010> do<00:02:47.129> is<00:02:47.250> we<00:02:47.370> have<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.609> assign<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.480> an<00:02:48.599> IP

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
have to do is we have to assign it an IP

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.390 
have to do is we have to assign it an IP
address<00:02:48.900> such<00:02:49.349> as<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.709> right<00:02:49.769> here

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.500

192.168.0.1 thats by default by the way
so<00:02:54.569> whenever<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.829> console<00:02:56.250> came<00:02:56.549> online<00:02:56.790> the

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
so whenever the console came online the

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.030 
so whenever the console came online the
router<00:02:57.780> itself<00:02:57.989> assigned<00:02:58.590> at<00:02:58.709> this<00:02:58.859> IP

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
router itself assigned at this IP

router itself assigned at this IP
address<00:02:59.220> right<00:02:59.669> now<00:02:59.730> this<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.120> dynamic<00:03:00.299> that

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
address right now this is dynamic that

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.220 
address right now this is dynamic that
means<00:03:00.840> if<00:03:00.930> we<00:03:01.019> turn<00:03:01.200> off<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.349> console<00:03:01.909> and

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
means if we turn off the console and

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.179 
means if we turn off the console and
enable<00:03:04.230> another<00:03:04.470> device<00:03:04.799> to<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:05.040> network

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
enable another device to the network

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.250 
enable another device to the network
before<00:03:05.790> turning<00:03:06.599> this<00:03:06.659> console<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.200> that

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
before turning this console and that

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.710 
before turning this console and that
will<00:03:07.500> change<00:03:07.739> now<00:03:08.519> when<00:03:08.909> that<00:03:09.090> changes<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.569> IP

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
will change now when that changes the IP

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.479 
will change now when that changes the IP
address<00:03:10.109> changes<00:03:10.409> dynamically<00:03:10.889> it<00:03:11.129> causes

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
address changes dynamically it causes

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.240 
address changes dynamically it causes
the<00:03:11.549> game<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:12.379> not<00:03:13.379> play<00:03:13.620> properly<00:03:13.799> in<00:03:14.159> their

to fix it so here we are to assign this

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.789 
to fix it so here we are to assign this
to<00:03:29.909> a<00:03:29.940> static<00:03:30.359> IP<00:03:30.479> it<00:03:30.870> must<00:03:31.139> be<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.620> have<00:03:31.709> to

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
to a static IP it must be you have to

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.500 
to a static IP it must be you have to
make<00:03:31.919> a<00:03:31.949> reservation<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.729> what<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.180> do<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.419> you

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
make a reservation so what you do is you

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.030

a<00:03:41.190> device<00:03:41.489> name<00:03:41.790> in<00:03:42.000> my<00:03:42.239> case<00:03:42.449> I'll<00:03:42.569> just<00:03:42.690> keep

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
a device name in my case I'll just keep

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.300 
a device name in my case I'll just keep
it<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:42.989> same<00:03:43.019> do<00:03:43.650> not<00:03:43.769> change<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.129> MAC

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
it the same do not change the MAC

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.369 
it the same do not change the MAC
addresses<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:45.030> is<00:03:45.180> what<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.449> console<00:03:45.810> is

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
addresses that is what the console is

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.469 
addresses that is what the console is
known<00:03:46.709> on<00:03:46.919> the<00:03:47.010> network<00:03:47.340> as<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:47.909> the<00:03:48.329> IP

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
known on the network as and the IP

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.319 
known on the network as and the IP
address<00:03:48.959> just<00:03:48.989> simply<00:03:49.500> gives<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:49.829> a<00:03:50.090> digit<00:03:51.090> to

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
address just simply gives it a digit to

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.569 
address just simply gives it a digit to
say<00:03:52.079> that<00:03:52.229> it's<00:03:52.409> this<00:03:52.620> number<00:03:52.919> on<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.220> network

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
say that it's this number on the network

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.240 
say that it's this number on the network
so<00:03:54.359> all<00:03:54.659> you<00:03:54.780> got<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:54.900> do<00:03:55.019> now<00:03:55.049> is<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:56.010> can<00:03:56.069> see

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
so all you got to do now is you can see

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.530 
so all you got to do now is you can see
that<00:03:56.280> these<00:03:56.489> are<00:03:56.549> all<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.849> devices

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
that these are all the devices

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.589 
that these are all the devices
none<00:03:57.989> of<00:03:58.019> them<00:03:58.139> are<00:03:58.519> none<00:03:59.519> of<00:03:59.549> them<00:03:59.669> are<00:03:59.819> which

call this and none of them are reserved
they're<00:04:03.030> all<00:04:03.120> just<00:04:03.150> standards<00:04:03.659> that<00:04:03.840> change

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
they're all just standards that change

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.289 
they're all just standards that change
from<00:04:04.260> time<00:04:04.439> to<00:04:04.560> time<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:05.069> we're<00:04:06.030> gonna<00:04:06.090> have<00:04:06.269> to

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
from time to time so we're gonna have to

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.699 
from time to time so we're gonna have to
make<00:04:06.479> a<00:04:06.510> reservation<00:04:06.870> so<00:04:07.109> this<00:04:07.260> never<00:04:07.620> changes

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
make a reservation so this never changes

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.559 
make a reservation so this never changes
