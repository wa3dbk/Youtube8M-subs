stocks<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.300> here's<00:02:12.480> my<00:02:12.660> suggestion

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
stocks so here's my suggestion

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.160 
stocks so here's my suggestion
first<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.100> foremost<00:02:14.340> ethanol<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.510> only<00:02:15.690> one

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
first and foremost ethanol is only one

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.100 
first and foremost ethanol is only one
solution<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.920> many<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.910> number<00:02:18.239> two<00:02:18.420> let's

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
solution of many and number two let's

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.780 
solution of many and number two let's
send<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.350> delegation<00:02:19.739> down<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.280> Brazil<00:02:20.430> and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
send a delegation down to Brazil and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.390 
send a delegation down to Brazil and
decode<00:02:21.150> what<00:02:21.480> they<00:02:21.750> did<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:22.560> we<00:02:22.739> two<00:02:22.950> can<00:02:23.190> say

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
decode what they did so we two can say

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.180 
decode what they did so we two can say
