00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.620
 hello everybody says hello to adilson 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.199
 Fonseca, I'm giving continuity to the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.779
 videotapes I'm doing now I 'm going 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.400
 talk music thousand fall from fernandinho 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.990
 I think it's one of the most requested songs 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.330
 in the channel 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.050
 If you did not see the video click here you 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.690
 go to see the song so there are several 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.270
 ways to touch it you can tune 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:37.680
 with the guitar half tone down to 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:40.470
 touch it do not take sun or not there but 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.390
 Anyway, I'm going to play the hand tuning fork 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.670
 normal party let's say you do not want 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.350
 stay in the water do not want to change anything is just 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.500
 pick up a guitar played the way it 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.270
 It's okay to leave the tone of the cb. 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.460
 I'll play the right tone without 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.380
 even nothing because this here is 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.630
 Floating bridge for me here is 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.210
 My work by the case 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:11.369
 so come on the music is on the button 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:15.149
 me and the introduction let's start over 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.499
 obvious production the introduction is 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:27.469
 marked by the chords of only the wounded 

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:27.469
 It is getting so 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.820
 after you do this part of the 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.950
 introduction you will sustain your note 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.690
 in a single being idol or labmon remembering that 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.520
 the music has two guitars we do not 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.690
 will have details that will not appear 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.180
 not here 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.830
 I did not take the strident song to fight in the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.619
 cd I do not have time for these things 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.290
 I only took this fast was moved well 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.270
 fast and then those people who 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.540
 They like to talk, it's not the same 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.130
 I know I do not have more then to 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.290
 Interesting people starting interesting. 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.380
 Even playing music is cool, you make one. 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.910
 sound so modern only the dreaded ones already 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.910
 I was like this all alone 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.400
 Here comes the sung part. 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.420
 let's go now the details of the match 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.019
 continuity to the first part of 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:48.569
 sung she is beautiful for two chords 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:52.640
 in this case the basic side mol film 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.640
 it seems to him that dwells 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:04.500
 only there is a detail these chords them 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:07.290
 are even that open between them the ceiling 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.480
 of a case with the details 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.910
 in the case of fake timid it stays like this 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.540
 the lip mall 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:28.569
 only there they united 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:31.810
 rep amy mall and here is the mall and 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:37.870
 repeating only friends 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:43.410
 mimoun nelci so that the court give me 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:46.410
 it stays divided to print if 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.410
 spaced 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.360
 so it's just not that there is a detail 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.490
 yes 20 so far detail the following 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.490
 Are you going to do as I say? 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:29.580
 slowly we had here on the rope in 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.580
 block 4 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:53.850
 thus becomes the first part 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:53.850
 You will make the bones together will come back. 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.729
 to invest and make the slide ball in this 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:06.820
 detail you will fall for us together 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:10.360
 dedicate a chord on the track in the case here 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.870
 it is normal our fear only followed and stressed 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.870
 again 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.979
 kaka then the first part will fall to 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.979
 me you will do 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.270
 in the second part 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.900
 You can understand the first part every time 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:37.420
 you're going to dissolve the unirea is like saying 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:43.510
 so the second part when you 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:48.700
 come back because we united ending up like this 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:51.210
 a cycle closing a time only that this 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.210
 music time 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.039
 ae 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.960
 Good, this takes practically if it goes 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.700
 lead to the end of the song is direct 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.880
 repeating and repeating 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.470
 there is a part that does not 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:37.870
 have a guitar do not do anything but I like 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:44.260
 to do what to do in the case here uses the 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:55.600
 mne mon note 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:58.330
 arrow 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.130
 After that we'll run to your 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:05.400
 misleading name 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:05.400
 the chorus is quiet only united one thousand kilometers 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.910
 just follow 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:20.950
 I only do these four chords in these 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:25.210
 five then you make one lord me 

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.210
 if it's easy 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.699
 the tone 

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.970
 basically I think that's it 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.360
 I think the song has nothing else to it. 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:58.780
 I remind you then so any doubt 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:02.740
 again leave your message there in your 

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:05.590
 question in the case of the video and 

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.960
 is betting on videos there if it is 

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:10.780
 make a criticism we also accept 

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.390
 not ignorant but sorry for mistakes 

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:16.300
 If you forget something, you have to 

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:19.380
 come on, I've had it up to 

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.380
