we<00:00:47.969> go<00:00:48.090> ahead<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.300> pry<00:00:48.390> back<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> panel<00:00:49.050> to

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
we go ahead and pry back the panel to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.889 
we go ahead and pry back the panel to
get<00:00:49.800> access<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.250> our<00:00:50.399> wiring<00:00:50.520> point<00:00:51.090> as<00:00:51.300> shown

get access to our wiring point as shown
here<00:00:52.280> we're<00:00:53.280> done<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.550> driver<00:00:53.760> side<00:00:54.059> we'll<00:00:54.239> go

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
here we're done for driver side we'll go

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.729 
here we're done for driver side we'll go
to<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> passenger<00:00:54.809> side<00:00:55.020> repeat<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> same

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
to the passenger side repeat the same

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.010 
to the passenger side repeat the same
process<00:00:56.239> okay<00:00:57.239> once<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.629> our<00:00:57.660> panels

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
process okay once we have our panels

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.450 
process okay once we have our panels
loose<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.800> go<00:00:58.890> ahead<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.160> point<00:00:59.280> our

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
loose we can go ahead and point our

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.130 
loose we can go ahead and point our
connection<00:00:59.820> points<00:01:00.180> then<00:01:00.690> go<00:01:00.780> ahead<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.020> push

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
connection points then go ahead and push

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.080 
connection points then go ahead and push
down<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.469> small<00:01:01.649> tab<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.670> separate

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
down on a small tab so we can separate

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.850 
down on a small tab so we can separate
the<00:01:03.210> connection<00:01:03.570> point<00:01:03.809> starting<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.769> our

the connection point starting on our

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.260 
the connection point starting on our
driver's<00:01:04.920> side<00:01:05.250> we'll<00:01:05.670> go<00:01:05.760> ahead<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.060> take

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
driver's side we'll go ahead and take

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.870 
driver's side we'll go ahead and take
the<00:01:06.450> wire<00:01:06.600> harness<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.770> red<00:01:08.010> wire<00:01:08.250> and

the wire harness with the red wire and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.130 
the wire harness with the red wire and
we'll<00:01:09.030> go<00:01:09.150> ahead<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.450> install<00:01:09.570> between<00:01:09.990> two

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
we'll go ahead and install between two

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.289 
we'll go ahead and install between two
halves<00:01:10.409> we'll<00:01:11.220> snap<00:01:11.490> them<00:01:11.640> back<00:01:11.670> together

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
halves we'll snap them back together

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.170 
halves we'll snap them back together
leave<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.380> alone<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.680> now<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.880> we'll<00:01:15.000> take

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
leave it alone for now then we'll take

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.340 
leave it alone for now then we'll take
