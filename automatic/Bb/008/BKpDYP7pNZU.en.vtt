00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:24.460 

a<00:00:21.859> previous<00:00:22.859> lecture<00:00:23.070> we<00:00:23.369> talked<00:00:23.580> about<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
a previous lecture we talked about the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.500 
a previous lecture we talked about the
storm<00:00:25.470> tracks<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.039> how<00:00:26.160> they<00:00:26.340> develop<00:00:26.510> how

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
storm tracks and how they develop how

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.599 
storm tracks and how they develop how
fast<00:00:27.750> they<00:00:27.960> develop<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.529> where<00:00:29.070> they<00:00:29.189> go

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
fast they develop and where they go

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.490 
fast they develop and where they go
those<00:00:30.240> were<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> storm<00:00:30.750> tracks<00:00:31.050> now<00:00:31.230> let's

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
those were the storm tracks now let's

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.970 
those were the storm tracks now let's
talk<00:00:31.619> about<00:00:31.679> points<00:00:32.519> of<00:00:32.960> cyclogenesis<00:00:33.980> here

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
talk about points of cyclogenesis here

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.360 
talk about points of cyclogenesis here
we<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.880> Pacific<00:00:36.390> Ocean<00:00:36.890> we<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.130> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
we have the Pacific Ocean we have the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.330 
we have the Pacific Ocean we have the
Rocky<00:00:38.790> Mountains<00:00:39.500> we<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> Great<00:00:41.010> Plains

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
Rocky Mountains we have the Great Plains

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.299 
Rocky Mountains we have the Great Plains
and<00:00:41.730> then<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:43.140> Mississippi<00:00:44.100> River

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
and then we have the Mississippi River

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.690 
and then we have the Mississippi River
here<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.530> eastern<00:00:47.100> or<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
here and then we have the eastern or the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.520 
here and then we have the eastern or the
Midwest<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> Appalachian

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
Midwest and then the Appalachian

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.299 
Midwest and then the Appalachian
Mountains<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.129> then<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:50.579> end<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.270> with<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
Mountains and then we end up with the

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.670 
Mountains and then we end up with the
coastal<00:00:53.309> plain<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.820> then<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.300> Atlantic<00:00:54.809> so

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
coastal plain and then the Atlantic so

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.650 
coastal plain and then the Atlantic so
let<00:00:55.829> me<00:00:55.920> go<00:00:56.039> ahead<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.219> label<00:00:56.430> these<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
let me go ahead and label these the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.590 
let me go ahead and label these the
Pacific<00:00:59.809> and<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.050> Atlantic<00:01:04.399> okay<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.670> in

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
Pacific and the Atlantic okay and in

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.120 
Pacific and the Atlantic okay and in
between<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.229> Rockies<00:01:07.590> these<00:01:07.920> are<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
between the Rockies these are the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.590 
between the Rockies these are the
Rockies<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:11.119> then<00:01:12.119> Mississippi<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:14.479> in<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
Rockies and then Mississippi and in the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.640 
Rockies and then Mississippi and in the
Appalachian<00:01:16.110> Mountains<00:01:20.420> okay<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.869> what<00:01:22.500> we're

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
Appalachian Mountains okay so what we're

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.520 
Appalachian Mountains okay so what we're
dealing<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.340> topography<00:01:24.119> and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
dealing with here is topography and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.249 
dealing with here is topography and
points<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.650> cyclogenesis<00:01:26.420> now<00:01:27.420> we've<00:01:27.990> talked

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
points of cyclogenesis now we've talked

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.620 
points of cyclogenesis now we've talked
about<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.770> Alberta<00:01:29.280> clipper<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
about the Alberta clipper and the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.520 
about the Alberta clipper and the
Colorado<00:01:31.560> low<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.430> inside<00:01:32.729> leader<00:01:33.530> what

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
Colorado low and the inside leader what

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.760 
Colorado low and the inside leader what
we<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.240> kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.110> looked<00:01:37.320> at<00:01:37.530> that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
we have if you kind of looked at that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.499 
we have if you kind of looked at that
map<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.430> had<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.759> previous<00:01:38.909> video

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
map that we had in the previous video

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.440 
map that we had in the previous video
lecture<00:01:39.869> all<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.740> those<00:01:40.950> points<00:01:41.520> began<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
lecture all of those points began on the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.910 
lecture all of those points began on the
eastern<00:01:42.930> side<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.409> Rockies

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
eastern side of the Rockies

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.520 
eastern side of the Rockies
so<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.689> air<00:01:46.520> descends<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.380> Rockies<00:01:49.380> on

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
so as the air descends the Rockies on

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.969 
so as the air descends the Rockies on
the<00:01:49.560> eastern<00:01:49.979> side<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:51.090> warms<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.079> will

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the eastern side it warms up and will

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.870 
the eastern side it warms up and will
force<00:01:54.200> cyclogenesis<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.740> occur

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.550 

these<00:02:00.880> are<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.270> points<00:02:01.540> of<00:02:01.960> strong

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
these are the points of strong

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.760 
these are the points of strong
cyclogenesis<00:02:03.630> where<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.870> mid-latitude

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
cyclogenesis where the mid-latitude

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.870 
cyclogenesis where the mid-latitude
cyclone<00:02:06.220> will<00:02:06.550> form<00:02:07.229> now<00:02:08.229> as<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:08.590> comes<00:02:08.830> we<00:02:09.610> see

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
cyclone will form now as it comes we see

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.020 
cyclone will form now as it comes we see
in<00:02:10.119> maps<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.710> mid-latitude<00:02:12.640> cyclone

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
in maps that the mid-latitude cyclone

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.510 
in maps that the mid-latitude cyclone
does<00:02:13.240> move<00:02:13.510> from<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.050> Pacific<00:02:14.800> Ocean<00:02:14.920> into

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
does move from the Pacific Ocean into

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.270 
does move from the Pacific Ocean into
the<00:02:16.210> rock<00:02:16.390> into<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.930> United<00:02:17.230> States<00:02:17.320> as<00:02:17.830> it

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
the rock into the United States as it

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.800 
the rock into the United States as it
does<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:19.510> dissipates<00:02:20.260> because<00:02:20.770> it's<00:02:20.980> changing

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
does it dissipates because it's changing

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.130 
does it dissipates because it's changing
it<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:23.200> forced<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:24.420> weaken<00:02:25.420> because<00:02:25.990> the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
it is forced to weaken because the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.430 
it is forced to weaken because the
change<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.590> topography<00:02:27.630> alright<00:02:28.630> so<00:02:29.140> then

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
change in topography alright so then

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.070 
change in topography alright so then
when<00:02:29.770> that<00:02:29.950> system<00:02:30.400> hits<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.570> Rockies<00:02:31.900> it's

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
when that system hits the Rockies it's

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.970 
when that system hits the Rockies it's
already<00:02:32.470> dissipated<00:02:33.390> then<00:02:34.650> east<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.890> the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
already dissipated then east of the

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.150 
already dissipated then east of the
Rockies<00:02:36.370> we<00:02:36.580> have<00:02:36.820> cyclogenesis<00:02:37.450> occurs<00:02:38.200> at

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
Rockies we have cyclogenesis occurs at

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.050 
Rockies we have cyclogenesis occurs at
particular<00:02:39.760> points<00:02:40.420> now<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.020> averages

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
particular points now the averages

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.420 
particular points now the averages
Alberta<00:02:43.060> Canada<00:02:43.680> Colorado<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.070> inside

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
Alberta Canada Colorado and the inside

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.490 
Alberta Canada Colorado and the inside
Lee<00:02:45.640> are<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.180> Colorado<00:02:46.810> low<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.200> then<00:02:47.350> the

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
Lee are the Colorado low and then the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.440 
Lee are the Colorado low and then the
Four<00:02:47.709> Corners<00:02:47.890> region<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:49.270> we<00:02:49.330> have

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
Four Corners region so we have

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.960 
Four Corners region so we have
cyclogenesis<00:02:49.990> that<00:02:50.440> begins<00:02:50.770> here<00:02:51.070> as<00:02:51.340> it

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
cyclogenesis that begins here as it

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.390 
cyclogenesis that begins here as it
progresses<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:53.080> east<00:02:53.470> across<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:54.220> Great

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
progresses to the east across the Great

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.570 
progresses to the east across the Great
Plains<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.030> into<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.540> Midwest<00:02:56.020> it<00:02:56.580> continues

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
Plains and into the Midwest it continues

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.710 
Plains and into the Midwest it continues
to<00:02:57.850> develop<00:02:58.470> intensify<00:02:59.470> if<00:02:59.770> you<00:03:00.190> will<00:03:00.510> once<00:03:01.510> it

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
to develop intensify if you will once it

hits<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.080> Appalachian<00:03:02.800> Mountains<00:03:03.190> there's<00:03:03.430> a

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
hits the Appalachian Mountains there's a

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.940 
hits the Appalachian Mountains there's a
bit<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:05.670> weakness<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:07.600> its<00:03:07.810> development<00:03:08.470> so

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
bit of a weakness to its development so

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.940 
bit of a weakness to its development so
it<00:03:09.220> will<00:03:09.370> kind<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.989> weaken<00:03:10.989> dissipate<00:03:11.920> a

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
it will kind of weaken dissipate a

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.250 
it will kind of weaken dissipate a
little<00:03:12.070> bit<00:03:12.459> but<00:03:13.000> then<00:03:13.180> once<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.750> goes<00:03:13.900> past

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
little bit but then once it goes past

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.949 
little bit but then once it goes past
the<00:03:14.560> Appalachian<00:03:15.340> Mountains<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:16.120> redevelops

it<00:03:17.470> intensifies<00:03:18.280> again<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.060> if<00:03:19.570> you're<00:03:19.750> in

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
it intensifies again and if you're in

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.960 
it intensifies again and if you're in

particular<00:04:05.200> class<00:04:05.549> but<00:04:06.549> we<00:04:06.700> call<00:04:06.880> this<00:04:07.000> the

particular class but we call this the

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.690 
particular class but we call this the
Hatteras<00:04:07.540> low<00:04:07.900> it<00:04:08.230> develops<00:04:09.069> in<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.280> Hatteras

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
Hatteras low it develops in the Hatteras

Hatteras low it develops in the Hatteras
region

east<00:04:11.230> eastern<00:04:12.230> coast<00:04:12.530> of<00:04:12.920> the<00:04:13.040> United<00:04:13.310> States

east eastern coast of the United States

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.219 
east eastern coast of the United States
so<00:04:14.590> in<00:04:15.590> essence<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:17.359> development<00:04:17.989> of<00:04:18.139> the

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
so in essence the development of the

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.830 
so in essence the development of the
mid-latitude<00:04:18.829> cyclone<00:04:19.280> is<00:04:19.489> based<00:04:19.970> on<00:04:20.359> the

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
mid-latitude cyclone is based on the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.620 
mid-latitude cyclone is based on the
topography<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:22.430> if<00:04:22.550> we<00:04:22.729> did<00:04:22.910> not<00:04:23.030> have<00:04:23.090> these

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
topography so if we did not have these

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.240 
topography so if we did not have these
mountains<00:04:24.080> here<00:04:24.410> in<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.650> United<00:04:24.889> States<00:04:24.949> at

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
mountains here in the United States at

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.159 
mountains here in the United States at
all<00:04:25.370> then<00:04:26.090> we<00:04:26.270> could<00:04:26.479> expect<00:04:26.900> that

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
all then we could expect that

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.700 
all then we could expect that
cyclogenesis<00:04:27.860> would<00:04:28.340> not<00:04:28.550> occur<00:04:28.990> because<00:04:29.990> we

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
cyclogenesis would not occur because we

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.070 
cyclogenesis would not occur because we
don't<00:04:30.949> have<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.280> changes<00:04:31.759> in<00:04:31.880> elevation<00:04:32.479> the

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
don't have the changes in elevation the

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.540 
don't have the changes in elevation the
changes<00:04:34.750> of<00:04:35.750> elevation<00:04:36.440> sorry<00:04:36.979> about<00:04:37.160> that

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
changes of elevation sorry about that

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.839 
changes of elevation sorry about that
the<00:04:37.759> changes<00:04:38.210> in<00:04:38.300> elevation<00:04:38.620> caused

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
the changes in elevation caused

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.870 
the changes in elevation caused
cyclogenesis<00:04:40.849> to<00:04:41.449> occur
