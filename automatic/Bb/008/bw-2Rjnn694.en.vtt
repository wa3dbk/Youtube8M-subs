see<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.210> may<00:01:54.450> see<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:54.899> my<00:01:55.259> finger

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
see this but you may see that my finger

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.130 
see this but you may see that my finger
is<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.159> level<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.360> when<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.750> push

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
is on this level here and when you push

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.260 
is on this level here and when you push
it

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.390 

it<00:02:03.270> spins<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.840> figure<00:02:04.050> round<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:04.980> know<00:02:05.220> if

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
it spins the figure round so you know if

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.850 
it spins the figure round so you know if
you<00:02:05.520> if<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.970> have<00:02:06.840> them<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.050> display<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.740> you

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
you if you have them on display and you

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.830 
you if you have them on display and you
don't<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.220> want<00:02:08.460> to<00:02:08.490> touch<00:02:08.670> them<00:02:08.850> all<00:02:09.630> you

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
don't really want to touch them all you

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.900 
don't really want to touch them all you
need<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.050> do<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.410> kind<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.830> push<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.550> lever<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
need to do is kind of push the lever and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.460 
need to do is kind of push the lever and
you<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.120> show<00:02:12.270> people<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.720> back<00:02:12.900> kind<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.290> thing

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
you can show people a back kind of thing

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.630 
you can show people a back kind of thing
so<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.610> really<00:02:14.880> cool<00:02:15.060> base<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:16.340> don't<00:02:17.340> think

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
so it's a really cool base I don't think

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.860 
so it's a really cool base I don't think
I'm<00:02:17.790> going<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.000> keep<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.360> with<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.630> figure

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
I'm going to keep it with this figure

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.410 
I'm going to keep it with this figure
I'll<00:02:19.350> probably<00:02:19.820> put<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:20.910> with<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> different

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
I'll probably put it with a different

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.060 
I'll probably put it with a different
figure<00:02:21.570> but<00:02:21.840> it's<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:22.050> nice<00:02:22.200> accessory<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.770> guess

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
figure but it's a nice accessory I guess

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.890 
figure but it's a nice accessory I guess
and<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.970> would<00:02:24.060> have<00:02:24.120> been<00:02:24.270> nicer<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.780> have

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
and it would have been nicer to have

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.500 
and it would have been nicer to have
some<00:02:25.200> kind<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.560> maybe<00:02:26.040> some<00:02:26.370> kind<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.270> like

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
some kind of maybe some kind of like

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.030 
some kind of maybe some kind of like
Hellfire<00:02:27.840> or<00:02:28.440> something

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
Hellfire or something

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.530 
Hellfire or something
time<00:02:29.550> displayed<00:02:30.060> with<00:02:30.300> right<00:02:30.600> behind<00:02:30.870> them

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
time displayed with right behind them

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.900 
time displayed with right behind them
but<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.810> guess<00:02:34.380> it's<00:02:34.560> okay<00:02:34.680> now<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.550> one

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
but I guess it's okay now the one

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.330 
but I guess it's okay now the one
drawback<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.810> his<00:02:37.320> legs<00:02:37.680> are<00:02:38.010> obviously

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
drawback is his legs are obviously

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.580 
drawback is his legs are obviously

personally<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.450> prefer<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:21.079> issue<00:04:21.560> 7<00:04:22.130> spawn

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.150 
personally I prefer the issue 7 spawn
and<00:04:22.990> because<00:04:23.990> I've<00:04:24.200> only<00:04:24.410> right<00:04:24.740> into<00:04:25.040> the

good<00:04:40.100> things<00:04:40.310> about<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:40.940> figure<00:04:41.240> my<00:04:41.900> camera

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
good things about the figure my camera

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.719 
good things about the figure my camera
really<00:04:42.530> doesn't<00:04:42.889> do<00:04:42.979> it<00:04:43.100> justice<00:04:43.490> on<00:04:43.610> the

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
really doesn't do it justice on the

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.690 
really doesn't do it justice on the
detail<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.720> is<00:04:44.900> rather<00:04:45.320> basic<00:04:45.770> detail<00:04:46.370> I<00:04:46.490> guess

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
detail it is rather basic detail I guess

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.629 
detail it is rather basic detail I guess
constant<00:04:47.180> I<00:04:47.210> mean<00:04:47.360> it's<00:04:47.510> mostly<00:04:47.690> black<00:04:48.229> and

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
constant I mean it's mostly black and

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.120 
constant I mean it's mostly black and
with<00:04:49.639> the<00:04:49.790> red<00:04:50.030> like<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:50.479> say<00:04:50.690> this<00:04:50.750> is<00:04:51.229> like<00:04:51.410> the

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
with the red like I say this is like the

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.969 
with the red like I say this is like the
paint<00:04:52.430> grimy<00:04:52.910> wash<00:04:53.240> in<00:04:53.600> there<00:04:54.380> cape<00:04:54.620> but<00:04:54.889> you

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
paint grimy wash in there cape but you

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.500 
paint grimy wash in there cape but you
know<00:04:55.100> this<00:04:55.280> is<00:04:55.430> just<00:04:55.669> for<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:55.910> most<00:04:56.120> part<00:04:56.389> the

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
know this is just for the most part the

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.800 
know this is just for the most part the
solid<00:04:56.900> black<00:04:57.110> solid<00:04:57.169> whites<00:04:58.690> with<00:04:59.690> an

solid black solid whites with an
absolutely<00:05:00.320> amazing<00:05:01.160> looking<00:05:01.729> figure<00:05:01.940> even

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
absolutely amazing looking figure even

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.300 
absolutely amazing looking figure even
if<00:05:02.780> you<00:05:02.870> maybe<00:05:03.139> don't<00:05:03.320> like<00:05:03.440> spawn<00:05:04.010> I<00:05:04.040> don't

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
if you maybe don't like spawn I don't

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.129 
if you maybe don't like spawn I don't
know<00:05:04.430> whose<00:05:04.610> spawn<00:05:04.940> is<00:05:05.150> these<00:05:05.750> guys<00:05:06.020> are

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
know whose spawn is these guys are

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.320 
know whose spawn is these guys are
definitely<00:05:06.560> worth<00:05:06.979> picking<00:05:07.250> up<00:05:07.550> just<00:05:07.850> try<00:05:08.090> and

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
definitely worth picking up just try and

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.510 
definitely worth picking up just try and
how<00:05:08.840> badass<00:05:09.169> they<00:05:09.590> look<00:05:09.740> on<00:05:09.860> your<00:05:10.010> shelf<00:05:10.250> I

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
how badass they look on your shelf I

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.850 
how badass they look on your shelf I
mean<00:05:11.090> I<00:05:11.270> think<00:05:11.479> like<00:05:11.990> I<00:05:12.110> say<00:05:12.320> I<00:05:12.350> mean<00:05:12.620> right<00:05:12.830> up

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
mean I think like I say I mean right up

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.010 
mean I think like I say I mean right up
to<00:05:13.070> this<00:05:13.190> point<00:05:13.280> of<00:05:13.580> spawn<00:05:13.850> but<00:05:14.479> it<00:05:14.570> just<00:05:14.810> looks

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
to this point of spawn but it just looks

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.560 
to this point of spawn but it just looks
absolutely<00:05:15.320> fantastic<00:05:16.120> I'll<00:05:17.120> get<00:05:17.300> into<00:05:17.450> the

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
absolutely fantastic I'll get into the

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.870 
absolutely fantastic I'll get into the
articulation<00:05:18.320> now<00:05:18.500> it<00:05:19.130> actually<00:05:19.340> has<00:05:19.729> about

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
articulation now it actually has about

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.140 
articulation now it actually has about
10<00:05:20.270> points<00:05:20.510> I<00:05:20.780> think<00:05:20.810> which<00:05:21.350> and<00:05:21.789> make<00:05:22.789> seem

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
10 points I think which and make seem

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.420 
10 points I think which and make seem
good<00:05:23.419> but<00:05:23.690> it's<00:05:24.080> really<00:05:24.169> limited<00:05:24.620> even<00:05:25.280> where

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
good but it's really limited even where

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.010 
good but it's really limited even where
it<00:05:25.520> is<00:05:25.639> so<00:05:25.910> you<00:05:26.000> can<00:05:26.090> see<00:05:26.270> his<00:05:26.360> head<00:05:26.600> moves<00:05:26.810> a

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
it is so you can see his head moves a

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.500 
it is so you can see his head moves a
little<00:05:27.169> but<00:05:28.039> I<00:05:28.100> do<00:05:28.250> it's<00:05:28.669> very<00:05:28.940> stiff<00:05:29.300> and<00:05:29.450> I

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
little but I do it's very stiff and I

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.270 
little but I do it's very stiff and I
don't<00:05:29.720> want<00:05:29.870> to<00:05:29.930> force<00:05:30.139> it<00:05:30.320> and<00:05:30.530> you<00:05:30.950> can<00:05:31.070> see

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
don't want to force it and you can see

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.080 
don't want to force it and you can see
like<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.700> color

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
like the color

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.080 
like the color
and<00:05:32.530> like<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:33.740> kind<00:05:34.250> of<00:05:34.310> collar<00:05:34.580> of<00:05:34.760> the<00:05:34.789> cape

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
and like the kind of collar of the cape

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.150 
and like the kind of collar of the cape
really<00:05:35.900> would<00:05:36.080> hinder<00:05:36.289> that<00:05:36.500> anyway<00:05:38.470> his<00:05:39.470> hand

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
really would hinder that anyway his hand

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.020 
really would hinder that anyway his hand
I<00:05:40.720> do<00:05:41.720> believe<00:05:42.110> rotates<00:05:42.650> so<00:05:43.490> you<00:05:43.580> can<00:05:43.700> kind<00:05:43.940> of

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
I do believe rotates so you can kind of

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.879 
I do believe rotates so you can kind of
rotate<00:05:44.419> this<00:05:44.570> fist<00:05:44.930> there<00:05:45.200> you<00:05:45.350> can<00:05:45.470> see<00:05:45.680> the

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
rotate this fist there you can see the

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.159 
rotate this fist there you can see the
but<00:05:46.820> I<00:05:46.880> once<00:05:47.240> again<00:05:47.479> I<00:05:47.510> don't<00:05:47.720> really<00:05:47.930> want<00:05:48.139> to

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
but I once again I don't really want to

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.260 
but I once again I don't really want to
move<00:05:48.350> it<00:05:48.530> you<00:05:48.710> can<00:05:49.130> see<00:05:49.250> some<00:05:49.639> backing<00:05:49.820> kind<00:05:50.150> of

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
move it you can see some backing kind of

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.029 
move it you can see some backing kind of
go<00:05:50.360> 360<00:05:51.050> but<00:05:51.229> once<00:05:51.410> again<00:05:51.590> it's<00:05:51.800> a<00:05:51.860> little

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
go 360 but once again it's a little

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.850 
go 360 but once again it's a little
pointless<00:05:52.340> this<00:05:53.090> left<00:05:53.600> arm<00:05:53.870> can<00:05:54.410> move<00:05:54.470> a

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
pointless this left arm can move a

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.360 
pointless this left arm can move a
little<00:05:55.160> you<00:05:55.340> can<00:05:55.490> see<00:05:55.550> that<00:05:56.139> put<00:05:57.139> if<00:05:57.860> once

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
little you can see that put if once

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.100 
little you can see that put if once
again<00:05:58.490> kind<00:05:58.880> of<00:05:59.000> hindered<00:05:59.300> by<00:05:59.450> the<00:05:59.479> Cape<00:05:59.840> back

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
again kind of hindered by the Cape back

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.730 
again kind of hindered by the Cape back
there<00:06:00.410> this<00:06:01.190> gauntlet<00:06:02.110> there's<00:06:03.110> at<00:06:03.200> least<00:06:03.320> an

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
there this gauntlet there's at least an

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.589 
there this gauntlet there's at least an
inch<00:06:03.860> of<00:06:04.010> motion<00:06:04.490> but<00:06:04.729> once<00:06:05.360> again<00:06:07.090> it's<00:06:08.090> kind

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
inch of motion but once again it's kind

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.310 
inch of motion but once again it's kind
of<00:06:08.720> limited<00:06:09.080> he<00:06:09.770> has<00:06:10.210> the<00:06:11.229> articulation<00:06:12.229> and

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
of limited he has the articulation and

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.550 
of limited he has the articulation and
the<00:06:12.380> weight<00:06:13.090> as<00:06:14.090> you<00:06:14.479> maybe<00:06:14.690> all<00:06:14.930> see<00:06:15.260> there

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
the weight as you maybe all see there

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.400 
the weight as you maybe all see there
but<00:06:16.220> once<00:06:16.430> again<00:06:16.610> very<00:06:17.150> very<00:06:17.510> limited<00:06:17.720> all<00:06:18.139> in

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
but once again very very limited all in

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.200 
but once again very very limited all in
I<00:06:18.620> mean<00:06:18.800> I<00:06:19.010> think<00:06:19.340> you<00:06:19.580> can<00:06:19.729> either<00:06:19.820> get<00:06:20.030> in<00:06:20.150> the

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
I mean I think you can either get in the

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.450 
I mean I think you can either get in the
points<00:06:20.570> to<00:06:20.690> all<00:06:20.780> very<00:06:21.080> very<00:06:21.320> limited

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
points to all very very limited

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.219 
points to all very very limited
and<00:06:23.090> then<00:06:23.540> he<00:06:23.690> has<00:06:24.009> he<00:06:25.009> actually<00:06:25.130> has<00:06:25.400> cuts<00:06:26.229> at

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
and then he has he actually has cuts at

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.010 
and then he has he actually has cuts at
the<00:06:27.560> leg<00:06:27.830> here<00:06:28.190> so<00:06:29.000> this<00:06:29.150> is<00:06:29.419> there<00:06:29.570> is<00:06:29.690> leg

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
the leg here so this is there is leg

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.180 
the leg here so this is there is leg
articulation<00:06:30.830> which<00:06:31.789> is<00:06:31.940> all<00:06:32.090> cool<00:06:32.360> and<00:06:33.190> but

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
articulation which is all cool and but

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.760 
articulation which is all cool and but
obviously<00:06:34.820> if<00:06:35.000> you<00:06:35.120> I<00:06:35.419> can't<00:06:36.259> I<00:06:36.410> do<00:06:36.470> if<00:06:36.710> you

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
obviously if you I can't I do if you

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:37.900 
obviously if you I can't I do if you
don't<00:06:36.860> want<00:06:37.039> to<00:06:37.130> move<00:06:37.220> it<00:06:37.370> but<00:06:37.550> obviously<00:06:37.639> if

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
don't want to move it but obviously if

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.890 
don't want to move it but obviously if
you<00:06:38.000> put<00:06:38.180> this<00:06:38.270> leg<00:06:38.539> up

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
you put this leg up

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.719 
you put this leg up
there's<00:06:39.169> no<00:06:39.350> need<00:06:39.620> are<00:06:39.740> titillation<00:06:40.340> so<00:06:40.580> it

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:40.729 
there's no need are titillation so it

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.480 
there's no need are titillation so it
kind<00:06:41.000> of<00:06:41.090> be<00:06:41.150> pointless<00:06:41.479> and<00:06:41.780> both<00:06:42.470> feet<00:06:42.800> do

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
kind of be pointless and both feet do

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.060 
kind of be pointless and both feet do
swivel<00:06:43.990> so<00:06:44.990> it's<00:06:45.139> all<00:06:45.289> good<00:06:45.530> it's<00:06:45.740> all<00:06:45.860> cool

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
swivel so it's all good it's all cool

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.460 
swivel so it's all good it's all cool
and<00:06:47.050> do<00:06:48.050> the<00:06:48.350> one<00:06:48.530> drawback<00:06:48.979> is<00:06:49.580> I<00:06:50.270> find<00:06:50.630> even<00:06:51.169> a

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:51.470 
and do the one drawback is I find even a

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.620 
and do the one drawback is I find even a
hope<00:06:51.740> like<00:06:52.190> I<00:06:52.340> say<00:06:52.550> how<00:06:52.759> gorgeous<00:06:53.270> the<00:06:53.389> paint

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630 
hope like I say how gorgeous the paint

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.050 
hope like I say how gorgeous the paint
after<00:06:53.990> I<00:06:54.289> have<00:06:54.889> had<00:06:55.100> a<00:06:55.130> few<00:06:55.400> and<00:06:55.639> quality

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
after I have had a few and quality

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.719 
after I have had a few and quality
control<00:06:56.389> issues<00:06:56.810> I<00:06:57.080> don't<00:06:57.530> think<00:06:58.039> the<00:06:58.130> cameras

00:06:58.719 --> 00:06:58.729 
control issues I don't think the cameras

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:01.689 
control issues I don't think the cameras
gonna<00:06:58.880> pick<00:06:59.120> this<00:06:59.270> up<00:06:59.449> but<00:07:00.289> this<00:07:00.800> is<00:07:00.860> one<00:07:01.310> part

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:01.699 
gonna pick this up but this is one part

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:03.760 
gonna pick this up but this is one part
I<00:07:01.940> think<00:07:02.600> he<00:07:02.810> fell<00:07:02.990> over<00:07:03.289> and<00:07:03.350> got<00:07:03.530> knocked

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770 
I think he fell over and got knocked

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.210 
I think he fell over and got knocked
once<00:07:04.039> and<00:07:04.310> and<00:07:05.300> this<00:07:06.260> some<00:07:06.500> paint<00:07:06.770> came<00:07:07.039> off

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
once and and this some paint came off

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.909 
once and and this some paint came off
here<00:07:07.490> I<00:07:07.729> mean<00:07:08.330> once<00:07:08.720> again<00:07:08.990> it's<00:07:09.410> kind<00:07:09.650> of<00:07:09.740> my

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
here I mean once again it's kind of my

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:10.300 
here I mean once again it's kind of my
fault

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
fault

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.219 
fault
I<00:07:10.370> guess<00:07:10.550> so<00:07:11.060> I<00:07:11.300> guess<00:07:11.750> I<00:07:11.780> kind<00:07:12.020> of<00:07:12.050> learned

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:12.229 
I guess so I guess I kind of learned

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:14.260 
I guess so I guess I kind of learned
about<00:07:12.470> this<00:07:12.650> but<00:07:13.220> the<00:07:13.310> spikes<00:07:13.699> on<00:07:13.970> the<00:07:14.060> booth

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.270 
about this but the spikes on the booth

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.150 
about this but the spikes on the booth
you<00:07:14.810> can<00:07:14.930> see<00:07:15.080> there's<00:07:15.289> some<00:07:15.410> black<00:07:15.680> splotches

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 
you can see there's some black splotches

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.189 
you can see there's some black splotches
there<00:07:16.639> and<00:07:17.000> it's<00:07:17.419> more<00:07:17.599> visible<00:07:17.750> to<00:07:17.990> the<00:07:18.139> naked

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 
there and it's more visible to the naked

eye put on the little spikes the paint
isn't<00:07:21.229> isn't<00:07:21.949> great<00:07:22.610> I<00:07:22.639> guess<00:07:23.030> but<00:07:23.720> I'm<00:07:23.900> really
