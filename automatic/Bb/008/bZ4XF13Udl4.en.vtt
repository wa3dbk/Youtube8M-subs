right<00:00:14.309> here<00:00:14.670> here's<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.420> clutch<00:00:16.139> master

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
right here here's the clutch master

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.450 
right here here's the clutch master
cylinder<00:00:16.949> Aram<00:00:17.880> I'm<00:00:18.359> sorry<00:00:18.690> slave<00:00:19.460> whatever

you<00:00:20.730> know<00:00:20.850> what<00:00:20.939> I'm<00:00:21.029> saying<00:00:21.590> pushes<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
you know what I'm saying pushes the

you know what I'm saying pushes the
shift<00:00:23.250> fork<00:00:23.550> see<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.330> crack<00:00:25.130> inside<00:00:26.130> there

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
shift fork see that crack inside there

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.709 
shift fork see that crack inside there
well<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> a.c.t<00:00:29.480> pressure<00:00:30.480> plate<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.140> guess<00:00:31.610> is

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
well the a.c.t pressure plate I guess is

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.090 
well the a.c.t pressure plate I guess is
so<00:00:33.719> stiff<00:00:34.649> or<00:00:35.600> but<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.200> second<00:00:37.739> fork

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
so stiff or but this is the second fork

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.619 
so stiff or but this is the second fork
I<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.730> cracked<00:00:40.010> not<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:42.059> other<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:42.420> was

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
I have cracked not the other one was

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.240 
I have cracked not the other one was
with<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> other<00:00:43.079> motor<00:00:43.440> setup<00:00:45.829> so<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
with the other motor setup so with the

the<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.750> bell<00:01:13.560> housing<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.220> this

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the the bell housing to this

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.340 
the the bell housing to this
transmission<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.770> whole<00:01:18.200> well<00:01:19.200> it

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
transmission on here the whole well it

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.630 
transmission on here the whole well it
was<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> little<00:01:19.799> different<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.369> whole<00:01:22.640> fork

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
was a little different the whole fork

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.620 
was a little different the whole fork
set<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.320> anyway<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.729> was<00:01:26.729> able<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.090> trim<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
set up anyway I was able to trim the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.359 
set up anyway I was able to trim the
whole<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.500> bit<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.979> could<00:01:29.189> get

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
whole just a little bit and I could get

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.160 
whole just a little bit and I could get
that<00:01:29.549> out<00:01:29.900> well<00:01:30.900> now<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.470> rb25<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.360> way

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
that out well now this rb25 with the way

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.030 
that out well now this rb25 with the way
the<00:01:34.350> leverage<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.009> set<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:36.829> no<00:01:37.829> matter

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
the leverage is set on that no matter

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.120 
the leverage is set on that no matter
what<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:40.310> cannot<00:01:41.540> make<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.810> fork<00:01:43.229> clear

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
what I do I cannot make a fork clear

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.560 
what I do I cannot make a fork clear
between<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.420> pressure<00:01:45.720> plate<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:48.000> this

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
between the pressure plate and the this

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.380 
between the pressure plate and the this
pivot<00:01:49.020> thing<00:01:49.320> here<00:01:49.619> which<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.729> will<00:01:50.939> unscrew

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
pivot thing here which that will unscrew

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.399 
pivot thing here which that will unscrew
but<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.460> mean<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.210> need<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.020> pull<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
but I mean it's I need to pull the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.819 
but I mean it's I need to pull the
transmission<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:57.049> regardless<00:01:58.049> ah<00:02:00.229> in<00:02:01.229> order

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
transmission out regardless ah in order

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.620 
transmission out regardless ah in order
to<00:02:01.860> fix<00:02:02.399> my

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
to fix my

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.150 
to fix my
input<00:02:05.630> shaft<00:02:05.899> bearing<00:02:06.880> so<00:02:09.009> what<00:02:10.009> does<00:02:10.099> that

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
input shaft bearing so what does that

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.370 
input shaft bearing so what does that
tell<00:02:10.340> me<00:02:11.319> I<00:02:13.540> gotta<00:02:14.540> pull<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.840> freaking

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
tell me I gotta pull the freaking

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.030 
tell me I gotta pull the freaking
transmission<00:02:16.150> which<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.900> know<00:02:18.050> it's<00:02:18.709> it's

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
transmission which you know it's it's

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.650 
transmission which you know it's it's
really<00:02:19.160> cool<00:02:19.550> being<00:02:20.000> able<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.360> work<00:02:20.540> on<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:21.019> I

just want to I like to show the motor

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.960 
just want to I like to show the motor
every<00:02:25.880> video<00:02:26.680> there's<00:02:27.680> so<00:02:27.920> many<00:02:28.040> people<00:02:28.760> that
