00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
everything in English too so the goal is

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.530 
everything in English too so the goal is
to<00:01:32.790> put<00:01:33.150> exactly<00:01:33.450> two<00:01:34.110> ovals<00:01:34.620> of<00:01:34.980> radios<00:01:35.760> 24

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
to put exactly two ovals of radios 24

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.900 
to put exactly two ovals of radios 24
and<00:01:37.580> 26<00:01:38.840> on<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.350> table<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:41.310> exactly

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
and 26 on that table like exactly

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.100 
and 26 on that table like exactly
replacing<00:01:42.660> rocker<00:01:43.790> track<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.900> almost
