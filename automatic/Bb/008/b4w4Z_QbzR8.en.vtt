00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.370
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.620
 This is a table tennis wisdom bag 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.900
 Thank you in advance The theme of today is here 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.090
 The deployment of the fast-paced sermon's deadly 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.500
 I would like to introduce this is a YouTube video 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.030
 I've done a fast handful of serpent's sideways intensely fast long sex 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.630
 It is a service, but deployment of the deadly of this time's chorus serve 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.670
 I would like to introduce how to take 4 hard points 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.879
 If you remember these four well 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.620
 There are a lot of service aces 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.780
 I can strike as I thought to my third team 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.569
 Receive comes back where you thought 

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:46.230
 Because it is an ideal serve that 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.679
 This is not only you want to score in the serve 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.929
 It is said that the third game after it can be scored firmly 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:01:08.640
 I would like to introduce the deployment of the deadly 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.200
 First of all, deployment one eye of Furiko serve dead 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.780
 It aims at the back from the back side 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.369
 Please give me a chopstick serve and I will 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.719
 If you put a serve on the back and another 70% back 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.850
 I will throw a ball back to the back 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.770
 Then it will return to the back diagonally 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.109
 Drive the third ball firmly in the drive 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.979
 Or the development called hitting with smash 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.079
 It's very easy to do, and the speed of the fretful serve is too much 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.590
 Too much speed and too much lateral rotation strength 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.210
 The other party just put the ball on and off 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.229
 I will return to the cross, so wait for that 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:02:08.979
 You can have the third ball as you waited 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.970
 This time is the second development of the second killing 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.690
 This time, when I'm going to throw out the back side 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.280
 This time, please put the chopstick serve straight 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.580
 When I put on my forefoot 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.780
 If you put your name on the forehead this time 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.390
 When the other party matches, it is like a racket this time 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.440
 Will come back to the forecross 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.940
 So wait for it fore drive 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.340
 You can bang on the forehand 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.640
 Especially recommended for people who are 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.840
 When I put on my forefoot 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.920
 After all if you notice, the other party will automatically adjust 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:03:00.470
 I will come back to the fore 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.590
 So it's so funny it's this fancy serve 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.290
 If you put it back, it will come back 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.310
 It is easy to return to the fore when putting it on the fore 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.720
 While waiting for a cross 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.840
 It is very very good to say that the third game can be done 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.780
 It is an attractive place This time the third one 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.640
 It is development of recommendation This time backhand 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.480
 Those who are not good at moving the backhand and feet to the person who is good 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.760
 This is a great way to recommend for ladies 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.440
 The third recommended way is now middle middle 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.230
 From the middle of the dare of stand stand saying serve 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.040
 Please try to serve the こ

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.680
 Serve a chopstick serve at the center of the platform here 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.160
 At this time I will put it back 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.910
 It will come back with most chances 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.000
 Since the distance is shrinking, the distance to the other party is 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.580
 Furthermore, the rate of returning to the back is very high 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.840
 So if you put the flick back 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.290
 It will return to the back, so hit it as it is waiting 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:12.960
 I can say that I slam on the back 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:22.070
 It is this development and put out a swatch in the middle 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.090
 A backhand smash hit from the middle 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.570
 Come out back and come back back 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.130
 The iron rule is said to be a chopstick serve 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.190
 This is the fourth recommended development 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.350
 The fourth also serves from middle to middle 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.320
 I'm putting out, but at that time I'll give it a chopstick serve 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.290
 Please put it in the fore When put out in the fore 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.060
 This is also more likely to come back to the foreground 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.570
 If you put a note on the fore, then the other party was quite upset 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.910
 It will fit together with the package, so if you have the momentum of the side turn 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.010
 The probability of returning to the forecross is 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.570
 It's very expensive so wait there 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.910
 With your best forehand 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.670
 It means that you can hit it, so don't move your body 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.440
 It's good 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.460
 You don't have to move your body if you're talking about serve 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.250
 When put on the fore When put on the foreback 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:29.490
 back 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.000
 Now I just want you to watch out for this choreograph serve 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.460
 As it is service that horizontal rotation takes 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.290
 If you hang the side strongly still the side remains a little 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.940
 Will be coming back 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.930
 It's my own development, so the rotation is a little more 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.620
 It hangs, but there is firmly 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.280
 In a sense that I turn over my rotation 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.070
 Please have a good system 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.920
 If you do so, it's a bit of a side turn 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.580
 Don't worry about the guy who hung 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.139
 I will be able to hit it, so the four deployments 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.590
 If it does so, it feels like already playing table tennis 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.350
 It's a shame kun, the other party goes on 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.870
 I think it's very interesting, so give it a go 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.840
 Put a note on the back coming back 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.919
 If you want to increase the probability of returning to the fore 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.110
 I think that the side rotation should be made stronger and put out deeper 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.210
 The more you become more aware 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.770
 Back to the cross back is back 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.650
 Fore has a very high probability of being fore 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.919
 Conversely speaking, when the rotation is weak and it's released slowly 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:41.310
 It is more likely to be returned straight 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.200
 The ideal shape of the third ball hit and even with the service ace 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.460
 That's why I can get rid of the blind spots 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.620
 Four by all means as development of everyone killing 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.510
 Please incorporate it into yourself 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.340
 Thank you very much
