our first mistake is having too wide of
a<00:01:08.930> stance<00:01:09.280> we<00:01:10.280> can<00:01:10.400> see<00:01:10.580> here<00:01:10.760> my<00:01:10.880> feet<00:01:11.090> are

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
a stance we can see here my feet are

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.630 
a stance we can see here my feet are
almost<00:01:11.660> beyond<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.650> shoulders<00:01:13.130> where<00:01:13.430> they

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
almost beyond the shoulders where they

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.820 
almost beyond the shoulders where they
should<00:01:13.910> be<00:01:13.940> directly<00:01:14.930> under<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.290> hips<00:01:15.320> at<00:01:15.710> all

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
should be directly under the hips at all

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.650 
should be directly under the hips at all
time<00:01:18.160> for<00:01:19.160> our<00:01:19.310> next<00:01:19.460> mistake<00:01:19.700> we<00:01:20.420> have<00:01:20.450> the

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
time for our next mistake we have the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.840 
time for our next mistake we have the
bar<00:01:20.840> going<00:01:21.080> forward<00:01:21.650> of<00:01:21.770> our<00:01:21.890> centerline<00:01:22.400> it's

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
bar going forward of our centerline it's

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.340 
bar going forward of our centerline it's
very<00:01:23.030> important<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.480> keep<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:23.750> bar<00:01:23.960> directly

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
overhead at the top of the movement this

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.430 
overhead at the top of the movement this
mistake<00:01:28.370> will<00:01:28.490> often<00:01:28.850> self-correct<00:01:29.450> when<00:01:30.320> you

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
mistake will often self-correct when you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
mistake will often self-correct when you
use<00:01:30.680> a<00:01:30.860> heavy<00:01:31.250> weight<00:01:32.800> next<00:01:33.800> mistake<00:01:33.950> we<00:01:34.340> have

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
use a heavy weight next mistake we have

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.790 
use a heavy weight next mistake we have
hand<00:01:34.700> placement<00:01:35.150> too<00:01:35.360> far<00:01:35.630> outside<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.530> hands

should be just outside the shoulders
also<00:01:38.660> the<00:01:39.170> elbows<00:01:39.890> should<00:01:40.220> be<00:01:40.280> flaring

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
also the elbows should be flaring

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.900 
also the elbows should be flaring
forward<00:01:41.120> instead<00:01:41.510> of<00:01:41.690> out<00:01:41.870> to<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.110> sides<00:01:42.350> to
