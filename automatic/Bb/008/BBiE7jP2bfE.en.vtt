then relax it for four tense it for four
relax<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.009> four<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.490> then<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.210> want<00:01:18.390> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
relax it for four and then you want to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.050 
relax it for four and then you want to
go<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.080> subdivide<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> into<00:01:19.920> two<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.520> tends<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
go and subdivide it into two so tends to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.649 
go and subdivide it into two so tends to
relax<00:01:21.540> too<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.110> then<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.369> want<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.729> go<00:01:24.570> ahead

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
relax too and then you want to go ahead

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.149 
relax too and then you want to go ahead
and<00:01:24.840> subdivide<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.350> more<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.740> go<00:01:25.830> tense

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
and subdivide it more so you go tense

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.090 
and subdivide it more so you go tense
relax<00:01:26.670> tense<00:01:27.240> relax<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.710> then<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.979> know

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
relax tense relax and then you know

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.390 
relax tense relax and then you know
eventually<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.670> get<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.970> faster<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:31.009> just<00:01:32.009> an

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
eventually just get it faster so just an

00:01:32.400 --> 00:02:12.900 
eventually just get it faster so just an
example<00:01:32.729> Palace<00:01:33.150> exercise<00:01:33.600> work<00:01:34.400> here<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.460> go

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:26.860 

heading<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.060> beach<00:02:25.450> doing<00:02:26.450> those<00:02:26.570> kinds

heading to the beach doing those kinds

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.260 
heading to the beach doing those kinds

of exercises will allow you to hit a lot
faster<00:02:29.810> like<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:31.270> here<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:52.180> day

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
faster like that here that day

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.140 
faster like that here that day
so<00:02:54.890> now<00:02:55.070> something<00:02:55.760> good<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.180> practice<00:02:58.150> your
