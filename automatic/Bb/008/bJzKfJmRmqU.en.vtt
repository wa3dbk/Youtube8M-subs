of the riff we're gonna alternate

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.340 
of the riff we're gonna alternate
between<00:02:03.220> bending<00:02:03.820> on<00:02:03.940> this<00:02:03.970> D<00:02:04.300> to<00:02:05.110> make<00:02:05.230> it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
between bending on this D to make it

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.440 
between bending on this D to make it
sound<00:02:05.440> like<00:02:05.560> an<00:02:05.740> e<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.190> bending<00:02:06.970> on<00:02:07.120> this<00:02:07.300> a

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
sound like an e and bending on this a

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.499 
sound like an e and bending on this a
the<00:02:07.900> 14th<00:02:08.320> fret<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.590> your<00:02:08.619> g<00:02:08.740> string<00:02:09.509> bending

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
the 14th fret of your g string bending

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.570 
the 14th fret of your g string bending
it<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.899> whole<00:02:11.110> step<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.590> B<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:12.130> make<00:02:12.250> it<00:02:12.430> sound

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
it a whole step to B to make it sound

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.060 
it a whole step to B to make it sound
like<00:02:12.820> a<00:02:13.090> B<00:02:13.870> which<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.320> same<00:02:14.530> as<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.770> 12th

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
like a B which is the same as the 12th

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.180 
like a B which is the same as the 12th
fret<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:16.840> your<00:02:16.990> D<00:02:17.140> string<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.680> then<00:02:18.040> we're

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
fret of your D string and then we're

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.580 
fret of your D string and then we're

then<00:03:02.230> my<00:03:02.380> pinky<00:03:02.770> for<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.010> pool<00:03:04.110> that's<00:03:05.110> just

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
then my pinky for the pool that's just

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.020 
then my pinky for the pool that's just
for<00:03:05.620> me<00:03:05.709> as<00:03:05.980> far<00:03:06.280> as<00:03:06.370> picking<00:03:06.670> let's<00:03:06.850> take<00:03:06.970> a

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
for me as far as picking let's take a

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.220 
for me as far as picking let's take a
look<00:03:07.180> at<00:03:07.269> what<00:03:07.390> we<00:03:07.480> could<00:03:07.600> do<00:03:07.750> for<00:03:07.780> picking

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
look at what we could do for picking

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.780 
look at what we could do for picking
here<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.860> couple<00:03:09.370> options

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
here a couple options

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.479 
here a couple options
I<00:03:09.850> would<00:03:10.090> definitely<00:03:10.239> down<00:03:10.690> pick<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.110> bend

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
I would definitely down pick the bend

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.380 
I would definitely down pick the bend
because<00:03:12.489> that's<00:03:12.670> starting<00:03:12.970> right<00:03:13.090> on<00:03:13.209> beat

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
because that's starting right on beat

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.940 
because that's starting right on beat
one<00:03:13.570> I<00:03:13.600> want<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:13.959> down<00:03:14.110> pick<00:03:14.320> beat<00:03:14.500> one<00:03:14.680> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
one I want to down pick beat one the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.979 
one I want to down pick beat one the
next<00:03:15.790> though<00:03:15.940> is<00:03:16.060> there's<00:03:16.330> an<00:03:16.420> option<00:03:16.810> you

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
next though is there's an option you

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.840 
next though is there's an option you
could<00:03:17.140> either<00:03:17.290> go<00:03:17.530> down<00:03:17.739> on<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.070> ski<00:03:18.310> in<00:03:18.580> which

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
could either go down on the ski in which

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.670 
could either go down on the ski in which
case<00:03:19.090> if<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.360> do<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:19.720> would<00:03:19.989> go<00:03:20.140> up<00:03:20.350> on<00:03:20.560> the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
case if you do that I would go up on the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.810 
case if you do that I would go up on the
D<00:03:20.860> along<00:03:21.640> start<00:03:22.390> again<00:03:22.660> down<00:03:23.560> in<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.739> bend

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
D along start again down in the bend

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.850 
D along start again down in the bend
down<00:03:25.820> on<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.060> eat<00:03:26.300> up<00:03:26.750> on<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.290> beach<00:03:27.440> pull<00:03:27.710> off

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
down on the eat up on the beach pull off

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.270 
down on the eat up on the beach pull off
or<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:29.150> other<00:03:29.360> way<00:03:29.660> would<00:03:29.930> be<00:03:30.010> down<00:03:31.010> on<00:03:31.160> the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
or the other way would be down on the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.650 
or the other way would be down on the
end<00:03:31.460> up<00:03:32.000> on<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.750> e<00:03:32.780> up<00:03:33.260> again<00:03:34.480> velocity<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.540> of

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
end up on the e up again velocity it of

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:43.150 
end up on the e up again velocity it of
two<00:03:35.840> ups<00:03:36.020> in<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.260> row<00:03:40.540> so<00:03:41.540> again<00:03:41.840> either<00:03:41.990> down<00:03:42.500> up

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
two ups in a row so again either down up

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.730 
two ups in a row so again either down up
up<00:03:43.520> cloth<00:03:44.210> up<00:03:45.140> up<00:03:45.530> or<00:03:46.330> down<00:03:47.330> down<00:03:48.290> up<00:03:48.590> down<00:03:48.830> down

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.810 

but<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.470> definitely<00:04:01.010> do<00:04:01.070> the<00:04:01.190> bends<00:04:01.400> which<00:04:01.640> way

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
but I definitely do the bends which way

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.260 
but I definitely do the bends which way
