give me a checkmark and then choose fake
location<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:38.489> think<00:02:39.489> when<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.730> blur<00:02:39.940> this

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
location and I think when to blur this

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.830 
location and I think when to blur this
out<00:02:40.420> because<00:02:40.989> that's<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.410> sheet<00:02:41.800> where<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.010> am

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
out because that's a sheet where I am

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.560 
out because that's a sheet where I am
but<00:02:43.840> I'm<00:02:44.140> gonna<00:02:44.290> move<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.650> over<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:46.540> see

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
but I'm gonna move it over and you see

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.020 
but I'm gonna move it over and you see
how<00:02:46.810> it's<00:02:46.959> like<00:02:47.080> cross<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:48.010> cross<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.550> or<00:02:48.880> it

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
how it's like cross the cross I or it
