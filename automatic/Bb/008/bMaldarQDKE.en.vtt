 we have desired is in the design 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.540
 and in God's plan more however to 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.550
 Sometimes we do not know how to build it 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.110
 through today's program and through 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.430

 discover those secrets and those 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.500
 principles that must be applied to 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.050
 bring harmony peace balance and about 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.420
 a whole family full of love for this 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.400
 we have a very special guest is a 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.800
 our friend of no borders and that 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.080
 has helped us a lot to find that 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.080
 balance and those principles that bring 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.470
 so much peace and so much blessing and already slider 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.870
 rise that is the founder of funam and com 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.790
 and that he will be with us in this 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.480
 series of programs for us to know 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.790
 how 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.310
 bring a family dynamic that brings 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.170
 health and that produces of course love 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.060
 peace and harmony in the middle of our psyche 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.160
 zulay thank you very much for being with 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.200
 We who for this invitation 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.250
 I am very happy to be able to participate 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.770
 of these family orientation series 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.560
 I think we need a lot of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.300
 to be able to share and enjoy the family 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.100
 as that great gift that God has given us 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.840
 given and I think we've stopped 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.240
 enjoy not sometimes we enjoy more with 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.670
 our friends enjoy more sometimes 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.530
 at work even more satisfactions 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.330
 labor standards are greater than the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.250
 satisfaction is our home and I have 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.800
 Sometimes friends who prefer not to 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.140
 get to your house because it is a chaos a 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.190
 problem with the wife the children are 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.170
 they become a blessing without any 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.240
 nature in a torture and prefer not to 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.910
 get home to not live that torture 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.110
 is what is happening today if that 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.300
 could this be the diagnosis 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.520
 what difference does day difference 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.850
 for example a family with a dynamic 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.730
 heal one who is not me this is one of 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.700
 those elements little satisfaction little 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.330
 enjoy within the home few laughs 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.790
 little this time of song games 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.700
 it takes that our homes makes 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.710
 lack is to enjoy the experience of being 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.510
 father and it is an art that can be 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.580
 practice every day good we're going 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.890
 to teach through this series several 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.320
 elements that will contribute to 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.090
 our family is a healthy family and 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.400
 that there is a healthy dynamic in between 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.840
 ours if we talk about a healthy dynamic 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.060
 we can say then that there is no 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.700
 dynamics that is not healthy they bring 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.280
 prejudice rather let's talk about a 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.190
 healthy family basically what is the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.040
 dynamic that they can take good 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.800
 we could say that a healthy family is 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.110
 one whose dynamics is oriented 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.200
 towards one as we said before to 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.540
 the satisfaction of the role of being a family or 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.040
 we are executing us as 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.670
 father we exercise the roles 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.129
 the role of a couple and the role of parents as 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.629
 we mentioned earlier many couples 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.810
 not even have it come to your 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:20.140
 house and that's already an indication that the 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.140
 our healthy family is not carrying the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.420
 full satisfaction in your role as a couple and 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.879
 consequently a couple that is not 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.849
 working well maybe it will reverberate 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.040
 directly in his role as parents because 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.680
 let's do it in two sections 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.799
 zulay I think we start with our 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.859
 role as parents because many times the 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:45.099
 couple is happy happy they have tics 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:47.079
 that there is exactly a honeymoon but 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.879
 When the children arrive, they change 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.829
 totally the dynamics of the house so 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.650
 less to me it happened partly to me one after 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.470
 of pregnancy changes physically 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.579
 sometimes emotionally hormonally 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.709
 women who do not even want to have 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.480
 sex with her husband after a 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.549
 pregnancy for many reasons then 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.870
 when the children come, a 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.659
 personality that brings many joys 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.860
 but it also changes the dynamics of 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.710
 home 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.130
 how do you see that gesture like that in all 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.950
 homes like this is a process what 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.200
 we call the family cycle all the 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.360
 family takes a cycle and the idea is that 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.210
 all that process within the cycle have been 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.030
 taken a healthy way as not 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.520
 bring consequences and that everyone is 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.530
 go prepare water continuity to the 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.110
 cycle change because I want to say no 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.920
 it is the same a young single he is 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.570
 single he goes to his job he has fun 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.160
 when this young man assumes 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.950
 responsibility to have a wife 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.050
 maybe he is already a young man but 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.510
 now he is married now he has a house 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.740
 to share between two more when 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:56.020
 these two who already assume a role of married 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.880
 they embark on the life of a motherhood or 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.430
 a fatherhood they have to 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.160
 psychologically prepare that here in 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.560
 a change of stage is a child can not 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.260
 come by surprise a child must be 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.940
 planned and one of the dynamics between 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.990
 a healthy family is that children are 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.729
 desired 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.099
 children are planned 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.129
 and a for libya and a space although now 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:22.150
 something important like achievement as a father 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:25.270
 that my son enters the dynamics of 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.819
 my home and do not come to misfit or 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.279
 neither does it constitute prejudice 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.599
 for the couple as we achieved that I know 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:33.999
 that there are several steps that we have to 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:37.300
 take into account where we started 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:39.879
 good as I said first in that that child 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.219
 has been planned and desired when a 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:44.830
 child is desired there is an environment of 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:47.199
 joy of much expectation because 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.990
 comes a new member to the family that 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.610
 it will definitely change all the 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.219
 dynamic forms the town I have a 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.659
 three year old baby now nicole she is 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:58.050
 the queen house but I want to have another 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:00.879
 baby then I am right now 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.339
 planning what we have brought presents in 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:04.870
 organic dough and I put pillows in the 

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:07.449
 belly and for active having a baby 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.520
 your little brother comes to prepare her 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:11.800
 because just as you are preparing 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.430
 what the arrival of that baby means 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.169
 they are already preparing mentally 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.400
 then have a physical preparation and 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.490
 after a preparation 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.620
 they had the economic jump not and then by 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.139
 course the economic because that 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.680
 requires time requires attention without 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.990
 abandon the child that already exists because 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.000
 many children feel displaced 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.800
 get to the little brother that is a topic that 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.810
 we can develop then but what 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.500
 important is to create space for 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:44.139
 child understand that I already have a child and that 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.419
 that child has some demands children 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:48.580
 they have their rights and many times 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:49.900
 we violate the right in the 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.850
 process of education of the children 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.620
 we have to go to a commercial in these 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:57.160
 moments but when we come back we're going to 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.740
 keep talking about the dynamics of 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.720
 a healthy family and how to achieve it 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:05.580
 important so do not go away 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.580
 we're back with more than without borders
