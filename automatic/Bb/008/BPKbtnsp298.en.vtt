00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.389 
I find the most entertaining are those
that<00:00:42.030> do<00:00:42.210> not<00:00:42.360> use<00:00:42.750> save<00:00:43.290> states<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
that do not use save states at in the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
slightest so you know in my mind it

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.690 
slightest so you know in my mind it
would<00:00:49.140> make<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> lot<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:49.710> interesting<00:00:50.370> videos
