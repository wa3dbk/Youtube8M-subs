00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
by it's the 22nd of September and today

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:40.580 
by it's the 22nd of September and today
we're<00:00:28.900> looking<00:00:29.140> at<00:00:29.230> new<00:00:29.500> trees

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.660 

okay<00:00:41.590> well<00:00:41.740> as<00:00:41.860> you<00:00:41.980> can<00:00:42.130> see<00:00:42.310> I'm<00:00:42.490> in<00:00:42.640> a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
okay well as you can see I'm in a

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.390 
okay well as you can see I'm in a
graveyard<00:00:43.330> at<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:43.960> moment<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:45.160> there's<00:00:45.310> an

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
graveyard at the moment and there's an

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.090 
graveyard at the moment and there's an
old<00:00:45.520> yew<00:00:45.910> tree<00:00:46.210> here<00:00:46.540> and<00:00:46.810> you'll<00:00:47.530> often<00:00:47.680> find

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
old yew tree here and you'll often find

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.650 
old yew tree here and you'll often find
them<00:00:48.280> in<00:00:48.450> graveyards<00:00:49.450> because<00:00:51.510> churches<00:00:52.510> are

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
them in graveyards because churches are

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.189 
them in graveyards because churches are
often<00:00:52.930> built<00:00:53.200> on<00:00:53.470> old<00:00:54.420> religious<00:00:55.420> sites<00:00:55.780> and

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
often built on old religious sites and

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.530 
often built on old religious sites and
where<00:00:57.129> you<00:00:57.220> can<00:00:57.340> see<00:00:57.520> by<00:00:57.699> this<00:00:57.879> tree<00:00:58.239> and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
where you can see by this tree and

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.080 
where you can see by this tree and
there's<00:00:58.900> there's<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.530> church<00:00:59.800> there<00:01:00.340> this

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
there's there's the church there this

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.330 
there's there's the church there this
tree<00:01:01.420> is<00:01:01.570> clearly<00:01:02.140> much<00:01:02.680> older<00:01:03.100> than<00:01:03.190> the

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
tree is clearly much older than the

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.540 
tree is clearly much older than the
church<00:01:04.440> and<00:01:05.440> there's<00:01:05.619> obviously<00:01:05.710> here<00:01:06.160> before

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
church and there's obviously here before

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.490 
church and there's obviously here before
and<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:09.310> also<00:01:09.550> hollow<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.420> this<00:01:11.200> particular

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
and it's also hollow and this particular

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.520 
and it's also hollow and this particular
tree<00:01:11.950> yeah<00:01:12.700> it's<00:01:13.360> supposed<00:01:13.660> to<00:01:13.899> be<00:01:13.960> cursed<00:01:14.229> if

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
tree yeah it's supposed to be cursed if

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.249 
tree yeah it's supposed to be cursed if
you<00:01:14.619> go<00:01:14.770> inside<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:15.369> but<00:01:15.780> let's<00:01:16.780> give<00:01:16.930> it<00:01:17.050> a<00:01:17.110> go

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
you go inside it but let's give it a go

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.219 
you go inside it but let's give it a go
anyway<00:01:20.550> and<00:01:21.550> yeah<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.509> can<00:01:22.750> see<00:01:22.899> it's<00:01:23.050> pretty

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
anyway and yeah you can see it's pretty

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:37.300 
anyway and yeah you can see it's pretty
dark<00:01:23.530> in<00:01:23.710> here<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:26.470> quite<00:01:26.979> quite<00:01:27.580> fascinating

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310

also down here as you can see there's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.050 
also down here as you can see there's
some<00:01:45.900> chicken<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.680> woods<00:01:46.890> that's<00:01:47.310> really

especially<00:03:05.689> cattle<00:03:06.439> and<00:03:07.840> yeah<00:03:08.840> when<00:03:09.019> it<00:03:09.140> dries

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
especially cattle and yeah when it dries

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.130 
especially cattle and yeah when it dries
is<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.310> becomes<00:03:10.640> even<00:03:10.909> more<00:03:10.939> toxic<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.750> them<00:03:11.870> so

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
is it becomes even more toxic to them so

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.390 
is it becomes even more toxic to them so
I'm<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.379> cattle<00:03:13.069> who<00:03:13.129> have<00:03:13.940> died<00:03:14.299> from<00:03:14.599> eating

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
I'm the cattle who have died from eating

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:23.460 
I'm the cattle who have died from eating
you<00:03:16.400> new<00:03:16.940> foliage

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.160 

now<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.040> edible<00:03:24.430> part<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.060> usury<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.690> the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
now the edible part of the usury is the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.320 
now the edible part of the usury is the
berries<00:03:26.560> but<00:03:26.980> um<00:03:28.590> only<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.920> red<00:03:30.490> fleshy<00:03:30.910> part

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
berries but um only the red fleshy part

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.410 
berries but um only the red fleshy part
of<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.540> berries<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.870> seeds<00:03:32.440> are<00:03:33.420> poisonous

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
of the berries the seeds are poisonous

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.100 
of the berries the seeds are poisonous
like<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.320> rest<00:03:35.530> of<00:03:35.710> the<00:03:35.800> tree<00:03:36.040> years<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:37.630> when

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
like the rest of the tree years so when

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.600 
like the rest of the tree years so when
are<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.260> eating<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:38.890> berries<00:03:39.070> from<00:03:39.460> the

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
are you eating the berries from the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.670 
are you eating the berries from the
safest<00:03:40.060> thing<00:03:40.300> to<00:03:40.330> do<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.630> try<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:40.900> extract

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
safest thing to do is try and extract

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.410 
safest thing to do is try and extract
the<00:03:41.890> seed<00:03:42.130> before<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.700> put<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.030> in<00:03:43.120> your<00:03:43.150> mouth

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
the seed before you put it in your mouth

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.400 
the seed before you put it in your mouth
but<00:03:43.750> as<00:03:44.200> you<00:03:44.350> can<00:03:44.500> see<00:03:44.770> they're<00:03:45.750> really<00:03:46.750> slimy

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
but as you can see they're really slimy

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.580 
but as you can see they're really slimy
and<00:03:48.240> it's<00:03:49.240> actually<00:03:49.600> quite<00:03:49.720> difficult<00:03:49.990> to<00:03:50.350> do

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
and it's actually quite difficult to do

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.760 
and it's actually quite difficult to do
they're<00:03:50.830> really<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.610> easiest<00:03:51.970> way<00:03:52.330> is<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.840> put

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
they're really the easiest way is to put

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.480 
they're really the easiest way is to put
the<00:03:53.920> berry<00:03:54.160> in<00:03:54.310> your<00:03:54.460> mouth<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.980> spit<00:03:57.459> out

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
the berry in your mouth and and spit out

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
the berry in your mouth and and spit out
a<00:03:57.670> bit<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.860> when<00:03:59.860> eating<00:04:00.250> these<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.360> is

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
a bit and when eating these and it is

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.180 
a bit and when eating these and it is
quite<00:04:01.810> important<00:04:02.290> that<00:04:02.380> you<00:04:02.500> make<00:04:02.740> sure<00:04:02.770> you

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
quite important that you make sure you

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.670 
quite important that you make sure you
don't<00:04:03.459> swallow<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:04.150> pit<00:04:04.390> I've<00:04:05.050> heard<00:04:05.290> stories

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680

hence they're a bit more toxic for us
our<00:05:22.660> digestive<00:05:23.380> systems<00:05:23.860> are<00:05:24.100> more<00:05:24.250> effective

Xu<00:05:31.029> is<00:05:31.330> very<00:05:31.659> toxic<00:05:31.930> to<00:05:32.259> cats

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:36.119 

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:40.049 

now<00:05:37.119> you<00:05:37.659> trees<00:05:38.020> have<00:05:38.439> separate<00:05:39.129> sexes<00:05:39.729> on

00:05:40.049 --> 00:05:40.059 
now you trees have separate sexes on

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:43.170 
now you trees have separate sexes on
different<00:05:40.539> trees<00:05:40.960> so<00:05:41.499> I'm<00:05:41.849> you're<00:05:42.849> only<00:05:42.879> gonna

different trees so I'm you're only gonna

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.659 
different trees so I'm you're only gonna
find<00:05:43.589> berries<00:05:44.589> on<00:05:44.919> the<00:05:45.039> female<00:05:45.490> trees<00:05:46.319> and<00:05:47.669> of

find berries on the female trees and of

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.769 
find berries on the female trees and of
course<00:05:48.909> aside<00:05:49.330> from<00:05:49.360> the<00:05:49.779> the<00:05:50.469> edible<00:05:51.129> berries

course aside from the the edible berries

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:56.070 
course aside from the the edible berries
another<00:05:53.309> traditional<00:05:54.309> use<00:05:54.580> for<00:05:54.909> new<00:05:55.389> trees<00:05:55.809> is

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
another traditional use for new trees is

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.959 
another traditional use for new trees is
using<00:05:56.439> the<00:05:56.529> wood<00:05:56.710> to<00:05:56.889> make<00:05:57.069> long<00:05:57.399> bows<00:05:58.830> and

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
using the wood to make long bows and

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.089 
using the wood to make long bows and
this<00:06:00.969> is<00:06:01.120> a<00:06:01.149> you<00:06:01.539> long<00:06:01.930> bow<00:06:02.199> here<00:06:02.559> this<00:06:02.830> one's

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
this is a you long bow here this one's

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:07.290 
this is a you long bow here this one's
actually<00:06:03.339> a<00:06:03.580> replica<00:06:04.089> of<00:06:05.879> one<00:06:06.879> of<00:06:06.909> the<00:06:07.089> ones

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
actually a replica of one of the ones

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.179 
actually a replica of one of the ones
that<00:06:07.539> was<00:06:07.839> found<00:06:08.259> on<00:06:08.469> Henry<00:06:08.919> the<00:06:09.039> eighth's

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:09.189 
that was found on Henry the eighth's

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:12.059 
that was found on Henry the eighth's
flagship<00:06:10.059> the<00:06:10.089> mary-rose<00:06:10.719> and<00:06:11.529> you<00:06:11.649> can<00:06:11.830> see

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
flagship the mary-rose and you can see

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.189 
flagship the mary-rose and you can see
it<00:06:12.249> some<00:06:12.550> got<00:06:13.029> the<00:06:13.120> heartwood<00:06:13.539> on<00:06:13.689> the<00:06:13.809> inside

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
it some got the heartwood on the inside

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.610 
it some got the heartwood on the inside
there<00:06:14.529> and<00:06:15.779> yeah<00:06:16.779> quite<00:06:16.990> interesting<00:06:17.409> and<00:06:17.499> it

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
there and yeah quite interesting and it

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:25.780 
there and yeah quite interesting and it
actually<00:06:17.740> works

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.240 

with<00:06:26.390> my<00:06:26.570> boots<00:06:26.840> on<00:06:27.140> I'm<00:06:27.320> about<00:06:27.590> 6<00:06:27.980> feet<00:06:28.190> tall

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
with my boots on I'm about 6 feet tall

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.610 
with my boots on I'm about 6 feet tall
so<00:06:28.850> you<00:06:28.880> can<00:06:29.090> see<00:06:29.270> how<00:06:29.480> large<00:06:29.750> this<00:06:30.170> longbow

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
so you can see how large this longbow

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.780 
so you can see how large this longbow
actually<00:06:31.040> is<00:06:31.540> anyway<00:06:32.540> here's<00:06:32.840> my<00:06:33.050> friend<00:06:33.290> John

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
actually is anyway here's my friend John

00:06:33.790 --> 00:07:06.589 
actually is anyway here's my friend John
demonstrating<00:06:34.790> a<00:06:34.880> bit<00:06:35.090> more<00:06:35.270> efficiently
