an<00:00:04.319> image<00:00:04.470> on<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.740> brick<00:00:04.980> wall<00:00:05.160> in<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.460> completely

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
an image on a brick wall in a completely

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.730 
an image on a brick wall in a completely
non<00:00:06.120> destructive<00:00:06.450> fashion<00:00:07.049> so<00:00:07.529> at<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.710> end

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
non destructive fashion so at the end

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.379 
non destructive fashion so at the end
you<00:00:07.919> have<00:00:07.980> life<00:00:08.280> type<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.790> live<00:00:08.970> pictures

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
you have life type and live pictures

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.720 
you have life type and live pictures
this<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> document<00:00:10.590> with<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.460> painting

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
this is the document with the painting

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.339 
this is the document with the painting
on<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:11.910> as<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.420> can<00:00:12.509> see<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:12.840> have<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:12.990> number<00:00:13.200> of

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
on it as you can see we have a number of

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.820 
on it as you can see we have a number of
type<00:00:13.679> layers<00:00:13.920> some<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.700> these<00:00:14.820> layers<00:00:15.120> have

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
type layers some of these layers have

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.410 
type layers some of these layers have
various<00:00:16.830> effects<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.580> them<00:00:17.730> some<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.330> them

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
various effects on them some of them

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.960 
various effects on them some of them
don't<00:00:18.600> at<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:20.100> bottom<00:00:20.310> behind<00:00:20.670> all<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.789> those

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
don't at the bottom behind all of those

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.670 
don't at the bottom behind all of those
you<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> picture<00:00:22.140> that's<00:00:22.289> taken

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
you have just the picture that's taken

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.410 
you have just the picture that's taken
from<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.890> over<00:00:23.100> book<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.490> behind<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.240> you

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
from it over book and behind that you

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.689 
from it over book and behind that you
have<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> brick<00:00:24.930> wall<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.980> particular<00:00:26.189> wall

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
have the brick wall this particular wall

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.339 
have the brick wall this particular wall
is<00:00:26.880> one<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.180> i<00:00:27.210> made<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.510> filter<00:00:28.109> forge

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
is one that i made in filter forge

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.929 
is one that i made in filter forge
because<00:00:28.769> i<00:00:28.800> wanted<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> wall<00:00:29.760> where

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
because i wanted to have a wall where

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.310 
because i wanted to have a wall where
the<00:00:29.970> more<00:00:30.179> color<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.750> brick<00:00:30.929> color<00:00:31.109> were

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the more color and the brick color were

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.870 
the more color and the brick color were
fairly<00:00:31.679> similar<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.340> i<00:00:32.369> could<00:00:32.550> show<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.730> that

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
fairly similar so i could show you that

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.520 
fairly similar so i could show you that
you<00:00:33.000> don't<00:00:33.149> need<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.899> large

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
you don't need to have a large

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080 
you don't need to have a large
difference<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.100> those<00:00:35.219> colors<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.700> order<00:00:35.940> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
difference in those colors in order to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.630 
difference in those colors in order to
use<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.450> technique<00:00:37.040> it<00:00:38.040> will<00:00:38.219> work<00:00:38.399> better

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
use this technique it will work better

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.970 
use this technique it will work better
if<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.090> do<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.329> course<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.649> also<00:00:40.770> do

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
if you do of course and you can also do

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.410 
if you do of course and you can also do
this<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.309> photograph<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.030> wall<00:00:42.180> but<00:00:42.300> you

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
this with a photograph of a wall but you

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.729 
this with a photograph of a wall but you
don't<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:42.989> either<00:00:43.200> one<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.500> can

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
don't have to have either one you can

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.690 
don't have to have either one you can
just<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.649> this<00:00:46.649> picture<00:00:47.399> of

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
just do it like this so this picture of

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.160 
just do it like this so this picture of
course<00:00:47.910> looks<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.480> floating<00:00:48.840> here

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
course looks like it's floating here

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.470 
course looks like it's floating here
because<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.730> need<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
because it is we need to have the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.090 
because it is we need to have the
illusion<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:52.079> having<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.559> painted<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.980> their

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
illusion of having it painted on their

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.229 
illusion of having it painted on their
bricks<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.520> we're<00:00:53.640> going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> by

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
bricks and we're going to do that by

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.990 
bricks and we're going to do that by
putting<00:00:54.480> some<00:00:54.809> brick<00:00:55.079> shadows<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.129> to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
putting some brick shadows on it and to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.979 
putting some brick shadows on it and to
do<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.210> we're<00:00:57.449> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.840> isolate

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
do that we're going to have to isolate

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.750 
do that we're going to have to isolate
the<00:00:58.320> bricks<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.010> we're<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> do<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.640> by

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the bricks and we're going to do that by

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.610 
the bricks and we're going to do that by
isolating<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.329> mortar<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.289> first<00:01:01.500> we're

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
isolating the mortar so first we're

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.229 
isolating the mortar so first we're
going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> hide<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.100> these<00:01:02.370> layers<00:01:02.640> by

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
going to hide all of these layers by

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.270 
going to hide all of these layers by
dragging<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.840> visibility<00:01:04.589> icon<00:01:04.710> you

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
dragging on the visibility icon you

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.469 
dragging on the visibility icon you
don't<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.640> click<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.240> drag

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
don't have to click you can just drag

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.590 
don't have to click you can just drag
then<00:01:07.439> we're<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.970> zoom<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.180> some<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
then we're going to zoom in some of the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.410 
then we're going to zoom in some of the
bricks<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.610> now<00:01:11.610> we're<00:01:11.790> going<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.390> using

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
bricks and now we're going to be using

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.050 
bricks and now we're going to be using
the<00:01:12.869> select<00:01:13.200> color<00:01:13.439> range<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the select color range and for that to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.850 
the select color range and for that to
work<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.360> best<00:01:15.509> first<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.619> get<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
work the best first you get the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.980 
work the best first you get the
eyedropper<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:18.000> select<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> color<00:01:18.750> that

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
eyedropper and you select the color that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.200 
eyedropper and you select the color that
you<00:01:19.020> want<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.500> selected<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.250> we're<00:01:21.090> going

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
you want to be selected so we're going

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.080 
you want to be selected so we're going
to<00:01:21.420> click<00:01:21.810> someplace<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.009> mortar<00:01:23.280> that

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
to click someplace in the mortar that

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.399 
to click someplace in the mortar that
puts<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> mortar<00:01:24.750> color<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> foreground

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
puts the mortar color in the foreground

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.190 
puts the mortar color in the foreground

we<00:03:14.320> have<00:03:14.470> some<00:03:14.680> bricks<00:03:14.860> here<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.130> are<00:03:15.220> just

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
we have some bricks here that are just

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.970 
we have some bricks here that are just
way<00:03:15.910> too<00:03:15.970> selected<00:03:16.660> or<00:03:16.810> some<00:03:17.170> mortar<00:03:17.800> that's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
way too selected or some mortar that's

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.340 
way too selected or some mortar that's
not<00:03:18.160> selected<00:03:18.580> enough<00:03:18.820> you<00:03:19.390> can<00:03:19.540> also<00:03:19.750> go<00:03:20.170> back

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
not selected enough you can also go back

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.950 
not selected enough you can also go back
and<00:03:20.560> tweak<00:03:20.710> this<00:03:20.980> by<00:03:21.250> adding<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.880> mask<00:03:22.120> and

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.530 

selecting<00:03:25.960> some<00:03:26.230> bricks<00:03:27.180> just<00:03:28.180> select<00:03:28.300> a

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
selecting some bricks just select a

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.030 
selecting some bricks just select a
couple<00:03:28.780> of<00:03:28.900> them<00:03:29.020> here<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:31.890> filling<00:03:32.890> that

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
couple of them here and filling that

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.010 
couple of them here and filling that
with<00:03:33.220> black<00:03:33.460> on<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.700> mask<00:03:33.970> layer<00:03:34.270> I'm<00:03:34.480> going

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
with black on the mask layer I'm going

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.770 
with black on the mask layer I'm going
to<00:03:35.580> fill<00:03:36.580> it<00:03:36.700> by<00:03:36.880> using<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.180> option<00:03:37.540> Alt<00:03:37.690> key

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
to fill it by using the option Alt key

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.900 
to fill it by using the option Alt key
again<00:03:38.140> if<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:39.040> have<00:03:39.220> some<00:03:39.430> more<00:03:39.640> turvy<00:03:39.850> you

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
again if you have some more turvy you

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:40.980 
again if you have some more turvy you
don't<00:03:40.060> have<00:03:40.180> enough<00:03:40.270> I<00:03:40.480> remember<00:03:40.840> there's

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
don't have enough I remember there's

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.440 
don't have enough I remember there's
nothing<00:03:41.380> there<00:03:41.590> so<00:03:42.190> in<00:03:42.520> order<00:03:42.730> to<00:03:42.910> select<00:03:43.300> that

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
nothing there so in order to select that

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.190 
nothing there so in order to select that
we're<00:03:44.410> going<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.650> have<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:45.100> select<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.550> actual

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
we're going to have to select the actual

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.250 
we're going to have to select the actual
mortar<00:03:47.200> Rose<00:03:47.530> themselves<00:03:49.020> just<00:03:50.020> the<00:03:50.110> way<00:03:50.200> you

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
mortar Rose themselves just the way you

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.290 
mortar Rose themselves just the way you
would<00:03:50.470> ordinarily<00:03:50.710> select<00:03:51.280> stuff<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:51.760> then

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
would ordinarily select stuff and then

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.570 
would ordinarily select stuff and then
with<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.750> layer<00:03:53.230> selected<00:03:53.740> not<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.070> mask<00:03:54.280> the

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
with the layer selected not the mask the

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.620 
with the layer selected not the mask the
layer<00:03:55.320> fill<00:03:56.320> that<00:03:56.470> with<00:03:56.650> white<00:03:57.450> so<00:03:58.450> that<00:03:58.570> you

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
layer fill that with white so that you

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.450 
layer fill that with white so that you
can<00:03:58.750> select<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:59.140> if<00:03:59.470> we<00:03:59.620> wanted<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.190> you

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
can select that if we wanted to you

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.070 
can select that if we wanted to you
could<00:04:00.580> go<00:04:00.790> back<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:00.970> retouch<00:04:01.420> this<00:04:01.600> a<00:04:01.630> lot<00:04:01.870> I

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
could go back and retouch this a lot I

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.540 
could go back and retouch this a lot I
don't<00:04:02.500> think<00:04:02.620> that's<00:04:02.680> really<00:04:02.950> necessary<00:04:02.980> and

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
don't think that's really necessary and

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.150 
don't think that's really necessary and
so<00:04:03.700> this<00:04:03.850> will<00:04:04.000> all<00:04:04.120> match<00:04:04.300> I'm<00:04:04.570> going<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:05.160> undo

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
so this will all match I'm going to undo

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.520 
so this will all match I'm going to undo
that<00:04:06.310> so<00:04:06.700> that<00:04:06.850> it<00:04:06.970> looks<00:04:07.780> about<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:08.230> same<00:04:08.380> as

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
that so that it looks about the same as

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.380 
that so that it looks about the same as
all<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.680> rest<00:04:08.770> of<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.160> now<00:04:09.940> I'm<00:04:10.060> going<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.360> show

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
all the rest of it now I'm going to show

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.800 
all the rest of it now I'm going to show
all<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:10.930> these<00:04:11.080> layers<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:12.060> now<00:04:13.060> we<00:04:13.120> just<00:04:13.480> drag

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
all of these layers and now we just drag

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.530 
all of these layers and now we just drag
this<00:04:14.080> layer<00:04:14.410> behind<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.520> brick<00:04:15.670> wall<00:04:15.910> so<00:04:16.510> that

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
this layer behind the brick wall so that

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.450 
this layer behind the brick wall so that
I<00:04:16.690> have<00:04:16.930> this<00:04:17.140> pristine<00:04:17.799> layer<00:04:18.010> that<00:04:18.160> I<00:04:18.220> can

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.460 
I have this pristine layer that I can

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.979 
I have this pristine layer that I can
work<00:04:18.850> with<00:04:18.910> later<00:04:19.270> if<00:04:19.390> I<00:04:19.480> ever<00:04:19.600> need<00:04:19.840> to<00:04:19.870> go

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
work with later if I ever need to go

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.630 
work with later if I ever need to go
back<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.260> it<00:04:20.380> I've<00:04:20.530> got<00:04:20.560> it<00:04:20.739> but<00:04:21.310> it's<00:04:21.430> not

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
back to it I've got it but it's not

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.010 
back to it I've got it but it's not
showing<00:04:22.000> in<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.300> image<00:04:22.540> so<00:04:22.660> i<00:04:22.720> don't<00:04:22.870> have<00:04:22.900> to

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
showing in the image so i don't have to

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.480 
showing in the image so i don't have to
worry<00:04:23.200> about<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.530> i'm<00:04:24.100> going<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.310> hold<00:04:24.370> down

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
worry about it i'm going to hold down

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.090 
worry about it i'm going to hold down
option<00:04:25.080> that's<00:04:26.080> alt<00:04:26.320> on<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.500> pc

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
option that's alt on a pc

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.560 
option that's alt on a pc
and<00:04:27.190> drag<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.460> copy<00:04:27.730> of<00:04:27.910> that<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.360> top<00:04:28.540> of

and drag a copy of that to the top of

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.900 
and drag a copy of that to the top of
the<00:04:28.720> layer<00:04:28.930> stack<00:04:29.170> I'm<00:04:30.010> going<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.340> right<00:04:30.880> click

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
the layer stack I'm going to right click

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.840 
the layer stack I'm going to right click
on<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.810> layer<00:04:31.960> thumbnail<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.650> choose<00:04:33.460> apply

layer mask from the menu here and now

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.540 
layer mask from the menu here and now
the<00:04:37.600> layer<00:04:38.590> masking<00:04:38.920> that<00:04:39.070> we<00:04:39.160> made<00:04:39.340> is

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
the layer masking that we made is

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.970 
the layer masking that we made is
actually<00:04:39.940> part<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:41.050> image<00:04:41.470> it's<00:04:41.800> no

actually part of the image it's no

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.310 
actually part of the image it's no
longer<00:04:42.160> a<00:04:42.280> mask<00:04:42.550> and<00:04:42.820> then<00:04:43.660> I'm<00:04:43.780> going<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.200> go

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
longer a mask and then I'm going to go

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.410 
longer a mask and then I'm going to go
up<00:04:44.470> here<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.680> filter<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.370> blur<00:04:45.790> that<00:04:45.820> just<00:04:46.300> a

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
up here to filter and blur that just a

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.280 
up here to filter and blur that just a
little<00:04:46.660> bit<00:04:47.070> with<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.220> blur<00:04:48.520> more<00:04:48.900> so<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:49.930> it

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
little bit with the blur more so that it

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.900 
little bit with the blur more so that it
kind<00:04:50.530> of<00:04:50.590> knocks<00:04:50.890> the<00:04:51.100> edge<00:04:51.190> off<00:04:51.400> of<00:04:51.460> it<00:04:51.730> and

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
kind of knocks the edge off of it and

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.030 
kind of knocks the edge off of it and
it's<00:04:52.150> sort<00:04:52.330> of<00:04:52.450> like<00:04:52.540> cheap<00:04:53.440> fake<00:04:53.710> anti

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
it's sort of like cheap fake anti

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.980 
it's sort of like cheap fake anti
aliasing<00:04:54.490> now<00:04:55.450> as<00:04:55.510> you<00:04:55.600> can<00:04:55.720> see<00:04:55.840> we<00:04:55.960> have

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
aliasing now as you can see we have

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.630 
aliasing now as you can see we have
toothpaste<00:04:56.440> where<00:04:56.680> we<00:04:56.770> don't<00:04:56.980> actually<00:04:57.430> want

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
toothpaste where we don't actually want

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.030 
toothpaste where we don't actually want
it<00:04:57.730> so<00:04:58.450> what<00:04:58.750> I'm<00:04:58.840> going<00:04:59.020> to<00:04:59.110> do<00:04:59.290> to<00:04:59.680> fix<00:04:59.920> that

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
it so what I'm going to do to fix that

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.100 
it so what I'm going to do to fix that
is<00:05:00.400> hold<00:05:01.060> down<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:01.420> command<00:05:01.570> key<00:05:01.780> that's

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
is hold down the command key that's

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.920 
is hold down the command key that's
control<00:05:02.500> in<00:05:02.620> a<00:05:02.710> PC<00:05:03.070> and<00:05:03.280> click<00:05:04.030> on<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.510> actual

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
control in a PC and click on the actual

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.650 
control in a PC and click on the actual
painting<00:05:05.560> itself<00:05:05.920> to<00:05:06.220> select<00:05:06.580> that<00:05:06.790> and<00:05:07.030> then

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
painting itself to select that and then

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.390 
painting itself to select that and then
I'm<00:05:07.780> going<00:05:07.930> to<00:05:08.020> make<00:05:08.290> a<00:05:08.320> new<00:05:08.530> mask<00:05:08.890> since<00:05:09.310> I

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
I'm going to make a new mask since I

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.310 
I'm going to make a new mask since I
have<00:05:09.550> a<00:05:09.580> selection<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.270> will<00:05:10.750> mask<00:05:11.080> out

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
have a selection it will mask out

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.320 
have a selection it will mask out
anything<00:05:11.860> that<00:05:12.040> is<00:05:12.370> not<00:05:12.400> within<00:05:13.060> that

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
anything that is not within that

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.180 
anything that is not within that
selection<00:05:13.690> so<00:05:14.560> now<00:05:14.650> we<00:05:14.710> just<00:05:14.800> have<00:05:15.010> the

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
selection so now we just have the

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.980 
selection so now we just have the
toothpaste<00:05:15.490> where<00:05:15.670> we<00:05:15.760> want<00:05:15.940> it<00:05:15.970> and<00:05:16.510> we're

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
toothpaste where we want it and we're

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.030 
toothpaste where we want it and we're
ready<00:05:17.140> to<00:05:17.230> do<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:18.370> magic<00:05:19.230> so<00:05:20.230> we're<00:05:20.620> going<00:05:20.800> to

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
ready to do the magic so we're going to

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.850 
ready to do the magic so we're going to
go<00:05:21.880> to<00:05:21.910> the<00:05:22.150> make<00:05:22.930> sure<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:23.170> layer<00:05:23.620> is

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
go to the make sure the layer is

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.600 
go to the make sure the layer is
selected<00:05:24.270> go<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.450> FX<00:05:25.810> and<00:05:26.050> choose<00:05:26.830> inner

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
selected go to the FX and choose inner

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.040 
selected go to the FX and choose inner
shadow<00:05:29.760> that<00:05:30.760> will<00:05:30.910> open<00:05:31.180> this<00:05:31.360> dialog<00:05:31.750> box

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
shadow that will open this dialog box

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.350 
shadow that will open this dialog box
now<00:05:32.680> we're<00:05:32.830> trying<00:05:33.070> to<00:05:33.250> match<00:05:33.670> the<00:05:33.970> shadow<00:05:34.210> to

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
now we're trying to match the shadow to

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.720 
now we're trying to match the shadow to
what's<00:05:34.690> already<00:05:34.930> there<00:05:35.230> on<00:05:35.680> the<00:05:35.980> other<00:05:36.280> bricks

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
what's already there on the other bricks

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.000 
what's already there on the other bricks
are<00:05:36.940> going<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.120> change<00:05:37.300> that<00:05:37.530> light<00:05:38.530> angle<00:05:38.860> to

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
are going to change that light angle to

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.240 
are going to change that light angle to
about<00:05:39.280> 90<00:05:39.700> make<00:05:40.240> sure<00:05:40.390> global<00:05:40.780> light<00:05:40.930> is

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
about 90 make sure global light is

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.080 
about 90 make sure global light is
checked<00:05:42.480> reduce<00:05:43.480> the<00:05:43.690> distance<00:05:43.930> to<00:05:44.970> one<00:05:45.970> or

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
checked reduce the distance to one or

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.030 
checked reduce the distance to one or
two<00:05:46.240> pixels<00:05:46.660> and<00:05:46.900> I'm<00:05:47.110> going<00:05:47.260> to<00:05:47.290> change<00:05:47.830> the

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
two pixels and I'm going to change the

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.530 
two pixels and I'm going to change the
size<00:05:48.690> so<00:05:49.690> that<00:05:49.720> that's<00:05:50.820> only<00:05:51.820> a<00:05:52.180> couple<00:05:52.420> of

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
size so that that's only a couple of

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.920 
size so that that's only a couple of
pixels<00:05:52.900> as<00:05:53.050> well<00:05:53.880> and<00:05:54.880> that<00:05:55.510> looks<00:05:55.630> pretty

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
pixels as well and that looks pretty

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.540 
pixels as well and that looks pretty
close<00:05:56.200> to<00:05:56.320> what<00:05:56.410> we've<00:05:56.500> gotten<00:05:56.860> in<00:05:57.010> the<00:05:57.370> rest

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
close to what we've gotten in the rest

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.620 
close to what we've gotten in the rest
of<00:05:57.670> it<00:05:57.790> so<00:05:58.150> click<00:05:58.450> OK<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:59.620> now<00:05:59.850> we<00:06:00.850> have<00:06:01.210> the

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
of it so click OK and now we have the

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.930 
of it so click OK and now we have the
shaded<00:06:02.230> toothpaste<00:06:03.070> which<00:06:03.340> isn't<00:06:03.760> what<00:06:03.850> we

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
shaded toothpaste which isn't what we

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.080 
shaded toothpaste which isn't what we
wanted<00:06:04.210> so<00:06:04.750> to<00:06:05.020> fix<00:06:05.320> that<00:06:05.590> we<00:06:06.310> go<00:06:06.430> over<00:06:06.670> here<00:06:06.820> to

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
wanted so to fix that we go over here to

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.020 
wanted so to fix that we go over here to
fill<00:06:07.510> not<00:06:07.840> opacity<00:06:08.350> fill<00:06:08.800> and<00:06:09.130> we<00:06:09.520> reduce<00:06:10.000> the

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
fill not opacity fill and we reduce the

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.100 
fill not opacity fill and we reduce the
fill<00:06:10.420> to<00:06:11.200> nothing<00:06:11.860> and<00:06:12.040> that<00:06:13.030> takes<00:06:13.390> all<00:06:13.630> of<00:06:13.690> a

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
fill to nothing and that takes all of a

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.950 
fill to nothing and that takes all of a
white<00:06:14.320> away<00:06:14.650> but<00:06:15.280> this<00:06:15.400> does<00:06:15.610> is<00:06:15.790> reduce<00:06:16.480> the

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
white away but this does is reduce the

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.950 
white away but this does is reduce the
actual<00:06:17.680> pixels<00:06:18.100> on<00:06:18.250> the<00:06:18.490> layer<00:06:18.730> to<00:06:19.360> nothing<00:06:19.840> at

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
actual pixels on the layer to nothing at

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.140 
actual pixels on the layer to nothing at
all<00:06:20.110> while<00:06:20.740> leaving<00:06:20.950> the<00:06:21.070> opacity<00:06:21.460> of<00:06:21.880> the

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
all while leaving the opacity of the

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.330 
all while leaving the opacity of the
layer<00:06:22.180> effect<00:06:22.690> at<00:06:23.050> full<00:06:23.440> strength<00:06:23.710> we<00:06:24.220> could

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
layer effect at full strength we could

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.980 
layer effect at full strength we could
also<00:06:24.460> reduce<00:06:24.700> the<00:06:24.970> opacity<00:06:25.060> if<00:06:25.600> we<00:06:25.690> wanted<00:06:25.930> to

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
also reduce the opacity if we wanted to

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.240 
also reduce the opacity if we wanted to
and<00:06:26.260> in<00:06:26.350> fact<00:06:26.500> it<00:06:26.620> might<00:06:26.710> look<00:06:26.830> better<00:06:26.980> if<00:06:27.190> we

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
and in fact it might look better if we

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.390 
and in fact it might look better if we
did<00:06:27.430> reduce<00:06:27.700> the<00:06:27.850> opacity<00:06:27.940> a<00:06:28.300> bit<00:06:28.450> and<00:06:29.400> there

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
did reduce the opacity a bit and there

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.600 
did reduce the opacity a bit and there
we<00:06:30.550> have<00:06:30.580> our<00:06:31.000> live<00:06:31.630> image<00:06:32.110> with<00:06:32.980> the<00:06:33.250> bricks

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
we have our live image with the bricks

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.070 
we have our live image with the bricks
shaded<00:06:34.090> so<00:06:34.270> it<00:06:34.390> looks<00:06:34.540> like<00:06:34.720> it's<00:06:34.870> painted

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
shaded so it looks like it's painted

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.280 
shaded so it looks like it's painted
directly<00:06:35.440> on<00:06:35.770> the<00:06:36.040> wall<00:06:36.750> we<00:06:37.750> could<00:06:37.900> change<00:06:38.080> the

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
directly on the wall we could change the

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.470 
directly on the wall we could change the
type<00:06:38.470> we<00:06:38.830> can<00:06:38.950> do<00:06:39.070> anything<00:06:39.160> we<00:06:39.370> want<00:06:39.460> to<00:06:39.729> hear

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480 
type we can do anything we want to hear

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.790 
type we can do anything we want to hear
I'll<00:06:40.630> just<00:06:40.840> show<00:06:41.080> you<00:06:41.110> that<00:06:41.290> this<00:06:41.410> type<00:06:41.680> is

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
I'll just show you that this type is

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.100 
I'll just show you that this type is
selectable<00:06:42.480> I'm<00:06:43.480> not<00:06:43.660> going<00:06:43.810> to<00:06:43.870> take<00:06:43.990> the

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
selectable I'm not going to take the

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.630 
selectable I'm not going to take the
time<00:06:44.290> to<00:06:44.410> change<00:06:44.680> it<00:06:44.800> because<00:06:44.980> we<00:06:45.310> really

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:45.640 
time to change it because we really

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.660 
time to change it because we really
don't<00:06:46.060> have<00:06:46.270> a<00:06:46.300> lot<00:06:46.360> of<00:06:46.480> time<00:06:47.430> but<00:06:48.430> there<00:06:48.580> you

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:48.670 
don't have a lot of time but there you

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.610 
don't have a lot of time but there you
go<00:06:48.700> I'll<00:06:49.300> have<00:06:49.510> to<00:06:49.660> make<00:06:49.780> a<00:06:49.810> third<00:06:50.020> tutorial<00:06:50.200> to

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
go I'll have to make a third tutorial to

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.960 
go I'll have to make a third tutorial to
show<00:06:50.680> how<00:06:50.890> you<00:06:50.920> can<00:06:51.040> make<00:06:51.280> this<00:06:51.460> into<00:06:51.730> shiny

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
show how you can make this into shiny

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.060 
show how you can make this into shiny
new<00:06:52.150> paint<00:06:52.390> with<00:06:52.570> bevel<00:06:52.840> and<00:06:52.930> emboss<00:06:52.960> but<00:06:53.890> for

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
new paint with bevel and emboss but for

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.050 
new paint with bevel and emboss but for
now<00:06:54.100> we're<00:06:54.430> just<00:06:54.460> going<00:06:54.580> to<00:06:54.730> leave<00:06:54.850> it<00:06:54.880> here

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
now we're just going to leave it here

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.210 
now we're just going to leave it here
next<00:06:55.630> time<00:06:55.810> we'll<00:06:56.260> see<00:06:56.320> how<00:06:56.590> to<00:06:56.650> age<00:06:56.830> the<00:06:57.010> paint

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
next time we'll see how to age the paint

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.320 
next time we'll see how to age the paint
so<00:06:57.370> it<00:06:57.400> looks<00:06:57.640> like<00:06:57.760> it's<00:06:57.910> been<00:06:58.060> there<00:06:58.090> for

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330 
so it looks like it's been there for

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.420 
so it looks like it's been there for
years<00:06:58.450> until<00:06:58.720> then<00:06:59.470> this<00:06:59.620> is<00:06:59.680> Robin<00:07:00.070> wood<00:07:00.250> and

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 
years until then this is Robin wood and

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.210 
years until then this is Robin wood and
I<00:07:00.580> hope<00:07:00.760> you<00:07:00.880> found<00:07:01.000> this<00:07:01.150> helpful
