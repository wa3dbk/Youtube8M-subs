00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.910
 m2 data are new videos are and 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.550
 asks for everyone's collaboration for a 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.770
 new control of playstation 3 good not 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.900
 commanded it would not be new but only the 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.700
 color will not suffer any modification to 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.000
 command although yes it is true that if 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.860
 we would not decide some kind of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.660
 suggestion now is the time but 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.529
 well what they ask basically is that 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.510
 color or what design we want for the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.800
 game for him for the next command not 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.590
 I'm going to approach we have time 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.289
 until August 15, good link 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.600
 that you have the description you can 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.909
 put your idea and such always when 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.649
 put it in English since it's all 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:44.339
 in English it's worth where you put a 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.519
 little box green you think you give it there 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:51.149
 they will ask for data it puts digital 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.920
 put your idea of some of some 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.139
 color you want and to say that goes 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.789
 winning the gray playstation one not 

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:58.409
 it seems that many people at least 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.019
 in the comments why they do not want 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.880
 that have the gray knob of the of the 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.489
 prison or the same color 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.020
 as I say the modification is only unity 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.000
 of color although I also said that if 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.980
 do you want some kind of specific thing 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.720
 put the opposite that it is possible that 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.050
 make for precision 4 is worth it now 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.430
 it would be time to give an idea and not 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.620
 well basically I do not know what color 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.750
 would I think it would also be 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.210
 supporter of putting the gray of the command of 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.880
 the play 1 the truth is that I liked 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.940
 pretty good it would be a very nostalgic and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.479
 surely I wanted to not have to 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.670
 be tremendous that and good to have 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.640
 a camouflage dinosaurs 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.060
 I do not know what color they will add but what 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.880
 it is clear is a new color 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.920
 and we do not know what it is not to put your 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.590
 ideas as I say if you want in the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.600
 comments or if you want where you put 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.270
 raining ideas in the link that you have in the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.590
 description you do not know what to put in 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.600
 the comments we turn and the one that 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.310
 you put ideas seriously and what counts not 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.780
 so that it arrives alone but good 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.060
 way I would like to know what is the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.970
 color or the design that you would like to have 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.519
 I do not command software only from which its 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.780
 three and I mean the color is worth nothing more 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.160
 kids cough all and see you in 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.160
 the next video until next time
