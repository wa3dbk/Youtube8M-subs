00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
guys today is a piston doorway activated

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.049 
guys today is a piston doorway activated
by<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> ho<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.129> switch<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.910> was

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
by a ho but switch so this was

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.600 
by a ho but switch so this was

recommended to me by Mikey 41 after I

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.279 
recommended to me by Mikey 41 after I
had<00:00:47.789> built<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.090> invisible<00:00:48.600> door<00:00:48.840> while<00:00:48.989> using

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
had built the invisible door while using

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.319 
had built the invisible door while using
a<00:00:49.590> redstone<00:00:50.370> torch<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.000> haven't<00:00:51.120> seen

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
a redstone torch so if you haven't seen

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.939 
a redstone torch so if you haven't seen

and show you this one more time we hold

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.020 
and show you this one more time we hold
the<00:01:00.809> ground<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.289> door<00:01:02.129> opens<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.910> can

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the ground and the door opens up we can

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.969 
the ground and the door opens up we can
go<00:01:03.180> inside<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.899> hang<00:01:04.320> out<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.619> chill<00:01:04.830> in

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
here we can flip the lever again the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.710 
here we can flip the lever again the
door<00:01:07.740> closes<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.820> want<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.090> go<00:01:09.150> back<00:01:09.270> out<00:01:09.390> we

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
door closes we want to go back out we

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.320 
door closes we want to go back out we
flipped<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.049> again<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.189> go<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.820> we

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
flipped it again we can go out and we

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.760 
flipped it again we can go out and we
just<00:01:12.570> hold<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> ground<00:01:12.990> again<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
just hold the ground again and the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.499 
just hold the ground again and the
double<00:01:14.040> clothes<00:01:14.250> now<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.060> actually<00:01:15.150> just

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
double clothes now we can actually just

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.080 
double clothes now we can actually just
keep<00:01:15.689> hoeing<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> ground<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.909> it'll<00:01:17.909> open

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
keep hoeing the ground and it'll open

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.140 
keep hoeing the ground and it'll open
and<00:01:18.450> close<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.140> open<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.560> closed<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:21.000> can

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
and close and open it closed and we can

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.179 
and close and open it closed and we can
do<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> same<00:01:21.570> with<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> lever<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> inside

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
do the same with a lever on the inside

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.120 
do the same with a lever on the inside
so<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.180> actually<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.860> bud

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
so what this actually is is it's a bud

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.770 
so what this actually is is it's a bud
switch<00:01:26.250> hence<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.909> name<00:01:27.030> Oh<00:01:27.270> bud<00:01:27.600> switch

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
switch hence the name Oh bud switch

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.950 
switch hence the name Oh bud switch
connected<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.189> tee<00:01:29.820> flip-flop<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.810> where

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
connected to a tee flip-flop so where

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.480 
connected to a tee flip-flop so where
you<00:01:31.049> go<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.040> blood<00:01:32.250> switch

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you go in here we have the blood switch

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.609 
you go in here we have the blood switch
right<00:01:32.670> here<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.479> T<00:01:33.659> flip-flop<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.170> over

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
right here and the T flip-flop is over

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.980 
right here and the T flip-flop is over
on<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.220> side<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.299> first<00:01:36.509> off<00:01:36.659> I'm<00:01:36.780> going<00:01:36.930> to

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
on this side so first off I'm going to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.719 
on this side so first off I'm going to
explain<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.380> bud<00:01:37.590> switch<00:01:37.710> really<00:01:38.040> fast<00:01:38.250> so

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
explain the bud switch really fast so

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.090 
explain the bud switch really fast so
every<00:01:38.939> time<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.240> block<00:01:39.630> updates<00:01:40.170> next<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
every time a block updates next to the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.550 
every time a block updates next to the
bud<00:01:41.700> switch<00:01:41.850> um<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.720> redstone<00:01:43.200> current<00:01:43.409> will

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
bud switch um the redstone current will

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.130 
bud switch um the redstone current will
be<00:01:43.590> pulsed<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.490> it'll<00:01:44.909> change<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.840> when<00:01:45.990> we

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
be pulsed and it'll change so when we

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.359 
be pulsed and it'll change so when we
hold<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> ground<00:01:46.590> right<00:01:46.799> next<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.159> which

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
hold the ground right next to it which

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.310 
hold the ground right next to it which
is<00:01:47.520> actually<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> outside<00:01:48.479> it

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
is actually the one on the outside it

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.399 
is actually the one on the outside it
changes<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.729> activates<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.420> turns<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.720> we

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
changes and it activates and turns on we

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.160 
changes and it activates and turns on we
hope<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.619> again<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.040> it'll<00:01:53.729> close<00:01:53.990> because<00:01:54.990> of

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
hope it again and it'll close because of

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.170 
hope it again and it'll close because of
the<00:01:55.290> T<00:01:55.590> flip-flop<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.850> when<00:01:57.060> we

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
the T flip-flop that is so when we

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.270 
the T flip-flop that is so when we
actually<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.380> piston<00:01:58.920> right<00:01:59.070> here

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
actually have this piston right here

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.889 
actually have this piston right here
this<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.790> actually<00:02:00.000> hooked<00:02:00.360> up<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> lever

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
this is actually hooked up to the lever

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.620 
this is actually hooked up to the lever
on<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.140> inside<00:02:01.649> over<00:02:02.430> over<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.509> house

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
on the inside over over in the house

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.780 
on the inside over over in the house
that<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.320> built<00:02:04.500> over<00:02:04.799> there<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.460> flip<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
that I built over there so we flip the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.459 
that I built over there so we flip the
lever<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.270> goes<00:02:06.450> up<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.930> goes<00:02:07.079> back<00:02:07.290> down

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
lever this goes up and goes back down

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.949 
lever this goes up and goes back down
basically<00:02:08.340> activating<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:08.970> bud<00:02:09.090> switch<00:02:09.209> so

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
basically activating the bud switch so

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.420 
basically activating the bud switch so
it<00:02:10.170> works<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.530> same<00:02:10.560> if<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.950> actually<00:02:11.190> were

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
it works the same if I actually were

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.340 
it works the same if I actually were
just<00:02:11.790> place<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.330> dirt<00:02:12.599> block<00:02:12.870> here

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
just place a dirt block here

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.770 
just place a dirt block here
as<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.710> can<00:02:13.770> see<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.070> door<00:02:14.310> would<00:02:15.000> open<00:02:15.120> we

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
as you can see the door would open we

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.580 
as you can see the door would open we
break<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.110> block<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.850> door<00:02:18.210> will<00:02:18.750> close<00:02:18.780> its

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
break the block the door will close its

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.950 
break the block the door will close its
that<00:02:19.680> simple<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:21.060> wiring<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.570> everything

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
that simple the wiring and everything

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.440 
that simple the wiring and everything
else<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> bit<00:02:22.560> complicated<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:24.150> don't

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
else is a bit complicated so I don't

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.060 
else is a bit complicated so I don't
think<00:02:24.570> I'll<00:02:24.750> be<00:02:24.900> able<00:02:24.990> to<00:02:25.170> go<00:02:25.290> into<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.530> very

the<00:02:35.970> t<00:02:36.120> flip-flop<00:02:36.570> we<00:02:36.720> have<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> button<00:02:37.350> to

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the t flip-flop we have a button to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.670 
the t flip-flop we have a button to
manually<00:02:38.190> toggle<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.210> impress<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.690> it

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
manually toggle it so impress this it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.950 
manually toggle it so impress this it
goes<00:02:41.130> like<00:02:41.370> soap<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.090> we<00:02:42.420> can<00:02:42.570> actually<00:02:42.660> just

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
goes like soap and we can actually just

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.650 
goes like soap and we can actually just
close<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.290> door<00:02:43.350> again<00:02:43.650> by<00:02:43.950> using<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.660> so

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
close the door again by using that so

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.170 
close the door again by using that so
that's<00:02:46.290> about<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.860> for<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.430> video<00:02:47.550> guys<00:02:47.940> i'm

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
like my prototype that i built before

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.170 
like my prototype that i built before
before<00:02:52.830> i<00:02:53.040> actually<00:02:53.250> put<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.610> into<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.940> wall

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
before i actually put it into the wall

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.780 
before i actually put it into the wall
it<00:02:54.510> just<00:02:54.750> looked<00:02:54.960> like<00:02:55.050> this<00:02:55.470> we<00:02:55.770> have<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.370> t

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.640 
it just looked like this we have the t
flip<00:02:56.970> flop<00:02:57.210> right<00:02:57.390> here<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.290> bud<00:02:58.500> switch

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
flip flop right here and the bud switch

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.250 
flip flop right here and the bud switch
right<00:02:59.280> there<00:02:59.490> so<00:03:00.210> when<00:03:00.480> we<00:03:00.570> hold<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.960> piece<00:03:01.110> of

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
right there so when we hold the piece of
