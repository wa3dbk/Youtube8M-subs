00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.650
 no no 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.230
 and 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.430
 Y 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.159
 good what you just heard is the 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.680
 main idea of a book that I wrote 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.619
 which is called harmony in layers that is 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.560
 can go from the scale of a note 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.810
 up to the scale of twelve notes the 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.390
 main concept then of harmony 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.310
 in layers is that there are no good notes nor 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.890
 bad notes but you can play 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.670
 any note on any chord 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.640
 but of course there is a probability that 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.720
 the note that you touch that you should then 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.640
 the first phrase you heard 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.130
 it was a single note that is to say only 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.979
 using the root note or tonic as 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:45.920
 you prefer to tell him and the last sentence was 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.640
 a phrase using the twelve notes that is 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.360
 that on a minor one touched the 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.600
 sharp and 22 sharp and so on 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.289
 twelve notes on that chord this 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.299
 means there are some notes that 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.440
 they identify the chord very much and then 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.240
 there are other notes that progressively 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.090
 they identify less and less to that agreed 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.660
 then clear play on a minor 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.330
 the note is always a safe option 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.880
 while playing the note the sharp 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.260
 maybe it's less likely but because 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.260
 course it may look good 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.280
 it is in this way that the idea 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.730
 of layers is to first touch with a 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.370
 scale of a single note then to that layer 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.520
 to add a note and reach a scale 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.680
 of two notes add another note and scales 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.990
 of three notes and obviously he already 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.240
 you understood the idea like this until you get to the 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.360
 chromatic scale that is the scale of 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.660
 twelve notes what's important to me about this 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.560
 to go layer by layer from something very simple 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:00.340
 until something complex is that your hand and your 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.010
 heard know the sound of each one 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.720
 of those notes 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.120
 in any aspect that is 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.700
 related to memory it is good to go 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.879
 of a small mouthfuls the more 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.849
 information all together one takes more 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.670
 difficult is to be able to memorize the then 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.250
 the idea of going layer by layer is power 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.590
 first master the first layers that 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.780
 they are those notes that are very 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.470
 important ones that strongly identify 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.880
 to the chord and then go adding more and more 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.100
 notes 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.100
 until you reach the twelve notes 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.560
 returning to those phrases that touch the 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.040
 beginning of the video the first thing you touch 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.940
 it is a phrase using only the note 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.790
 root is to say the tonic on a chord 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:57.020
 the chord with the minor and just touch 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:04:00.230
 using note that obviously the note 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.860
 the on a minor chord is a 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.860
 safe option 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.050
 the next step that would be the second 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.720
 layer of the book is to add the third one already 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.700
 having the third one you're saying that 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.330
 the chord is smaller you're touching the 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.330
 third minor 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.609
 and 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.030
 having the third one is good to add 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.730
 the fifth and reach the noble and always 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.060
 powerful triads in this case triad 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.060
 less 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.110
 already to have the triad adding the seventh 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.260
 you have what I call four many 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.480
 they say arpeggio I prefer the word 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.250
 aqua triad that others say you tickets 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.270
 but as I told you I prefer the 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.270
 square word 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.129
 once you have the cuatreada sums 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.039
 one tension in this case is the eleventh 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:14.099
 over a minor chord and you have the noble 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:17.159
 pentatonic scale a little known by 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:19.440
 we the guitarists although in the 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:24.139
 The book proposes a different use where 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.139
 there are in fact five types of pentatonic 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.030
 having the pentatonic you are only two 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:39.449
 notes of the defined but effective 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:43.550
 modes in this case is the least 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.550
 we are touching it as if it were doric 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.370
 Y 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.390
 we already have seven notes we have passed the 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.690
 half the way adding a chromatism 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:02.700
 in this case between the root and the seventh 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.700
 minor on the scales live 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:08.209
 in this case the historical living scale 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.850
 do not 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.140
 and speaking of chromatics there are only 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.360
 that add to a pica the notes that 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.240
 we are there spinning and you are already 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.930
 playing the twelve notes on this chord 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.930
 of the minor 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.690
 everything we touch is just based on 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.570
 a unique position that is what I 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.040
 I call sixth right there's in the book you're going 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.200
 to have more data regarding those 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.880
 names and in the first volume of harmony 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.270
 in layers all this is based on 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:11.580
 build chords my way to see it 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.130
 the greater our knowledge 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.370
 when playing chords so much easier it will be 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:19.950
 play melodies in volume 2 and in the volume 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.650
 3 of harmony in layers are seen in much 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:26.250
 more detail how to apply this same 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:28.440
 philosophy of the different layers for not 

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.450
 only play chords but by playing 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.780
 any kind of things all over the 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.780
 I send 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.360
 I hope the video has turned out 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:41.230
 interesting and you have understood this 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:43.450
 general philosophy of the book method 

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.730
 harmony in layers of course everything 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:48.250
 that we speak is explained a lot 

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:50.350
 greater detail precisely in the book that 

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.820
 is there is free distribution and it 

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.730
 is dying of desire that what 

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:57.090
 download thank you very much 

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.090
 a hug 

00:07:57.689 --> 00:08:00.110
 to me
