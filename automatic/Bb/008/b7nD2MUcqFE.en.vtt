contaminants steps of playing a fish
start<00:00:41.070> with<00:00:41.430> making<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.969> cut<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.510> behind<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
start with making a cut just behind the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.200 
start with making a cut just behind the
head<00:00:43.379> at<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.800> top<00:00:44.040> part<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> fillet<00:00:44.760> then

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
head at the top part of the fillet then

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.500 
head at the top part of the fillet then
you<00:00:45.780> make<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.309> cut<00:00:47.309> along<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.879> back<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
you make a cut along the back of the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.360 
you make a cut along the back of the
fish<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.289> create<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> outline<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
fish to create the outline for the

fillet then starting without an outline

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.250 
fillet then starting without an outline
you<00:00:53.370> make<00:00:53.579> cuts<00:00:53.879> keeping<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> knife<00:00:54.899> flat

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
you make cuts keeping the knife flat

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.529 
you make cuts keeping the knife flat
against<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> bones<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> fish<00:00:56.489> which<00:00:57.120> will

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
against the bones of the fish which will

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.900 
against the bones of the fish which will
cut<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.989> fillet<00:00:58.500> away<00:00:58.829> from<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.399> bones<00:00:59.730> of

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
cut the fillet away from the bones of

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.970 
cut the fillet away from the bones of
the<00:01:00.000> fish<00:01:00.180> until<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.870> reach<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.289> belly<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the fish until you reach the belly and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.889 
the fish until you reach the belly and
you<00:01:02.160> continue<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.090> cut<00:01:03.239> along<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.690> bones

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
you continue to cut along the bones

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.050 
you continue to cut along the bones
across<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.680> ribs<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> fillet<00:01:05.489> until

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
across the ribs of the fillet until

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.490 
across the ribs of the fillet until
you've<00:01:06.180> removed<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> entire<00:01:06.869> play<00:01:07.140> from<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
you've removed the entire play from the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.100 
you've removed the entire play from the
fish<00:01:07.740> leaving<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.340> triangular<00:01:08.909> shaped<00:01:09.479> piece

of<00:01:10.290> fish<00:01:10.619> one<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> benefits<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.119> filleting

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
of fish one of the benefits of filleting

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.499 
of fish one of the benefits of filleting
the<00:01:12.600> fish<00:01:12.720> by<00:01:13.619> cutting<00:01:13.950> around<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.670> ribs<00:01:15.119> is

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the fish by cutting around the ribs is

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.080 
the fish by cutting around the ribs is
it<00:01:15.810> keeps<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.290> fillet<00:01:16.619> isolated<00:01:17.520> from<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
it keeps the fillet isolated from the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.300 
it keeps the fillet isolated from the
internal<00:01:18.810> organs<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.320> fish<00:01:19.590> some<00:01:20.040> people

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
internal organs of the fish some people

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.590 
internal organs of the fish some people
when<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:20.460> fillet<00:01:20.820> fish<00:01:21.060> they'll<00:01:21.330> cut

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
when they fillet fish they'll cut

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.200 
when they fillet fish they'll cut
through<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.110> ribs<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.490> what<00:01:24.030> that

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
through the ribs like this and what that

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.780 
through the ribs like this and what that
does<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:25.020> will<00:01:25.259> expose<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.740> fillet<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.189> blood

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
does it will expose the fillet to blood

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.120 
does it will expose the fillet to blood
and<00:01:27.150> internal<00:01:27.990> organs<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.590> high<00:01:28.829> levels

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and internal organs to have high levels

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.830 
and internal organs to have high levels
of<00:01:29.220> contaminants<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.270> much<00:01:30.420> better<00:01:30.600> to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
of contaminants so it's much better to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.050 
of contaminants so it's much better to
try<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> cut<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.320> round<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.950> belly<00:01:32.159> instead<00:01:32.369> of

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
try to cut it round the belly instead of

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.030 
try to cut it round the belly instead of
through<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.600> next<00:01:34.560> step<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> remove

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
through it the next step is to remove

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.789 
through it the next step is to remove
the<00:01:35.430> skin<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.930> very<00:01:36.990> important<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.470> do<00:01:37.590> so

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the skin it's very important to do so

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.280 
the skin it's very important to do so
because<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.490> skin<00:01:38.759> has<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> lot<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:40.049> fat

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
because the skin has a lot of the fat

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.109 
because the skin has a lot of the fat
content<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.040> by<00:01:41.310> removing<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.789> skin<00:01:42.030> you

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
content and by removing the skin you

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.450 
content and by removing the skin you
reduce<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.689> additional<00:01:43.259> fat<00:01:43.530> do<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.159> you

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
reduce that additional fat do that you

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.789 
reduce that additional fat do that you
lay<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> fillet<00:01:45.270> flat<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> cutting

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
lay the fillet flat on the cutting

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.060 
lay the fillet flat on the cutting
boards<00:01:47.100> with<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.280> skin<00:01:47.700> side<00:01:47.939> down<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:49.070> hold

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
boards with the skin side down and hold

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.779 
boards with the skin side down and hold
on<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> tail<00:01:51.390> end<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.049> fillet<00:01:52.350> and

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
on to the tail end of the fillet and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.060 
on to the tail end of the fillet and
your<00:01:53.789> other<00:01:54.090> hand<00:01:54.450> cut<00:01:55.049> with<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> knife<00:01:55.649> flat
