that<00:00:14.490> up<00:00:14.849> basically<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.960> seed<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:17.310> believe

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
that up basically this seed is I believe

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.519 
that up basically this seed is I believe
there's<00:00:18.060> about<00:00:18.119> six<00:00:18.690> well<00:00:19.140> we'll<00:00:19.289> find<00:00:19.380> out

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
there's about six well we'll find out

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.510 
there's about six well we'll find out
when<00:00:19.619> we<00:00:19.680> go<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.890> think<00:00:19.949> there's<00:00:20.130> not<00:00:20.189> six

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
when we go and I think there's not six

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.340 
when we go and I think there's not six
islands<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:20.970> rest<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.300> water<00:00:21.570> if<00:00:22.289> we

there<00:01:07.080> I'm<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.560> too<00:01:07.950> sure<00:01:08.280> all<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.030> was<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.270> I

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
there I'm not too sure all that was it I

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.039 
there I'm not too sure all that was it I
think<00:01:09.360> they're<00:01:09.600> all<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.720> way<00:01:09.810> down<00:01:09.930> to

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
think they're all the way down to

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.630 
think they're all the way down to
bedrock<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.650> as<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.130> keep<00:01:11.310> going<00:01:11.430> down

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
bedrock and as you keep going down

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.980 
bedrock and as you keep going down
there's<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> lot<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.030> gold<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.450> well<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.900> I'm

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
there's a lot of gold as well and I'm

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.330 
there's a lot of gold as well and I'm
sure<00:01:13.020> obviously<00:01:13.470> though<00:01:13.560> we've<00:01:13.710> done<00:01:13.890> this

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
sure obviously though we've done this

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.070 
sure obviously though we've done this
somewhere<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:15.509> start<00:01:15.840> looking<00:01:16.020> all

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
somewhere but right start looking all

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.359 
somewhere but right start looking all
this<00:01:16.200> cold<00:01:16.500> I'd<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:16.740> brilliant<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
this cold I'd be brilliant for a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.760 
this cold I'd be brilliant for a
hardcore<00:01:17.640> survival<00:01:18.360> island<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.530> quite

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770

you the biggest one it's not as good as
it<00:01:58.079> sounds<00:01:58.229> because<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.369> massive

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
it sounds because it's just a massive

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.760 
it sounds because it's just a massive
look<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.140> mean<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.040> not<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:02.520> awful<00:02:03.770> but

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
look I mean it's not it's not awful but

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.350 
look I mean it's not it's not awful but
it's<00:02:04.860> probably<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> bit<00:02:05.369> too<00:02:05.549> big<00:02:05.729> for<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
it's probably a bit too big for the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.910 
it's probably a bit too big for the
night<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.719> what<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.079> like<00:02:07.590> doing<00:02:07.710> there's<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
night and what you like doing there's a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.080 
night and what you like doing there's a
lot<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.069> mushrooms<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.459> could<00:02:08.610> even<00:02:08.789> travel

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090
