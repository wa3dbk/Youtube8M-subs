00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.300
 hello everyone how are I, lusa and today 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.000
 I'm going to teach you how to prepare a 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.370
 pineapple jelly with cream cheese I hope 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.130
 that you like it and then let's see the 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.370
 ingredients because then we are going to occupy 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:19.060
 a cream cheese bar we are going to occupy 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:23.410
 also pineapple in syrup a can of 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.900
 condensed milk a cup of cream for 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.220
 shake 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:33.379
 grenetina powder that is natural 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.719
 the syrup of the pineapple a house 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.480
 we will use a blender and obviously 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.610
 we need a mold of preference that 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.070
 metal it is easier to detach the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.460
 gelatin and with the figure that you 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.460
 want 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.790
 Well then what are we going to 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.060
 do is take three tablespoons of grenet 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.500
 and we are not going to empty them in our cup 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:06.170
 of the snow we will incorporate very well 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.660
 until we dissolve it and we're going to leave it 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.020
 stand approximately three 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.030
 minutes until it 's public good what 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.090
 that we let our agreement rest on 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.520
 and that's because we're going to add in 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.100
 our glass of the blender what 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.229
 it was that the syrup of the pineapple and 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.740
 some pieces of pineapple not all because 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.740
 the rest 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.180
 this whole in what he came doing 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.540
 our jelly already when they are in 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.000
 moles 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.420
 let's also add our cup of 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.050
 cream to beat and we're going to add the 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.390
 cream cheese can add all 190 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.790
 grams of cream cheese that are if that 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.340
 they really like the cheese design can 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.500
 add half the truth is that more 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.710
 that nothing for rabid we are also going 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.680
 add what condensed milk is 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.830
 here I'm not only going to add one as 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.860
 the can must act because it changes me 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.570
 to beat had already driven and set apart 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.750
 of the minaret because it already contains a lot 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.750
 sugar 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.590
 well then once we have left 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.100
 rest our ghrelin will take this 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.190
 consistency like fluffy and we're going to 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.400
 take to the microwave approximately 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.610
 about 20 to 25 seconds until I 'm 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.610
 again 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.690
 then believe that we beat everything in the 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.180
 blender that's how it has to look 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.260
 our shake is a consistency 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.569
 thick and you're ready to empty 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.280
 the mold of gelatin 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.920
 how 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.500
 I tell them the mold can have the figure 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.569
 that you want but if you 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.010
 I recommend that it be made of metal because 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.010
 it's an easier position 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.549
 with the same spoon we push them a 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.769
 little bit to the center and then we go 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.560
 to shake our mold a little for 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.170
 everything is comfortable 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.530
 you are already ready to put an ether 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.530
 to know 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.530
 already once inside the solitary meeting 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:28.159
 from 15 to 20 minutes the truth is that this 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.430
 Gelatine is very fast and at the time of 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.680
 dismantle it if you urge them so much 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.959
 I recommend that while they put water 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.340
 warm and immerse not a little bit what 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.590
 it's been the mold with our 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.909
 gelatin as not going to come all 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.209
 because the gelatin will enter water 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:46.220
 it's nothing else I think in the part of 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.680
 down the world so that you can 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.739
 detach and the truth is at most 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.560
 about 30 seconds and we already flipped it over 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.900
 a dish or where you want to put it 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.319
 Well that's how our jelly is 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.170
 It is already creativity of each one as 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.030
 decorate you can put strawberry you can 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.819
 put on it will be can be bathed with a 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.590
 little chocolate but that I leave it 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.569
 in your creativity I hope that I have 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.200
 liked the recipe we see for the 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.510
 next 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.510
 I am a muse and I send you many foods
