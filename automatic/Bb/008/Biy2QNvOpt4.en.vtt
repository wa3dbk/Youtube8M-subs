something

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
something

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.290 
something

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
we're at a point that we can't play like

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.780 
we're at a point that we can't play like
this<00:00:39.450> we're<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:40.050> sure<00:00:40.230> what's<00:00:40.440> happening

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
this we're not sure what's happening

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.110 
this we're not sure what's happening
we're<00:00:41.790> not<00:00:42.030> not<00:00:42.960> getting<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.620> thing<00:00:44.250> moving

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
we're not not getting in it thing moving

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.790 
we're not not getting in it thing moving
on<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> ball<00:00:45.540> we<00:00:46.170> got<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.410> get<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.590> ball

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
on the ball we got to get the ball

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.950 
on the ball we got to get the ball
moving<00:00:47.100> got<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> get<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> ball<00:00:47.850> moving<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
moving got to get the ball moving and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.350 
moving got to get the ball moving and
one<00:00:49.290> of<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.500> bread<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.250> butters<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.090> had

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
one of the bread and butters that we had

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.180 
one of the bread and butters that we had
with<00:00:51.720> our<00:00:51.840> running<00:00:52.260> game<00:00:52.290> we<00:00:52.829> didn't<00:00:53.070> even

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
with our running game we didn't even

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.090 
with our running game we didn't even
have<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.370> going<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:55.079> had<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.559> change<00:00:55.829> up

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
have that going so we had to change up

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.160 
have that going so we had to change up
on<00:00:56.579> something<00:00:57.030> at<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.329> time<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.930> think

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
on something at that time and I think

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.250 
on something at that time and I think
that's<00:00:58.410> when<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.879> go<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> decided<00:01:00.750> time<00:01:00.930> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that's when I go do the decided time and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.750 
that's when I go do the decided time and
I<00:01:01.350> think<00:01:01.620> he<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:01.980> decided<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.460> give<00:01:02.610> me<00:01:02.700> an

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
I think he just decided to give me an

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.880 
I think he just decided to give me an
opportunity<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.450> get<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> game<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.829> don't

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
opportunity to get in the game I don't

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.529 
opportunity to get in the game I don't
know<00:01:05.159> whether<00:01:05.369> he<00:01:05.579> was<00:01:05.700> gonna<00:01:05.789> let<00:01:05.999> me<00:01:06.119> play

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
know whether he was gonna let me play

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:08.870 
know whether he was gonna let me play
the<00:01:07.020> whole<00:01:07.350> game<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.889> maybe<00:01:08.039> just<00:01:08.399> give<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the whole game but maybe just give to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.510 
the whole game but maybe just give to
get<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.119> little<00:01:09.389> spark<00:01:09.749> going<00:01:10.159> so<00:01:11.159> he<00:01:11.280> gave<00:01:11.459> me

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
get a little spark going so he gave me

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.209 
get a little spark going so he gave me
that<00:01:11.639> opportunity<00:01:11.969> on<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.740> get<00:01:13.979> any

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
that opportunity on you just get any

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:19.609 
that opportunity on you just get any
game<00:01:14.429> and<00:01:14.929> as<00:01:15.929> I<00:01:16.969> as<00:01:17.969> I<00:01:18.810> went<00:01:18.990> into<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> game<00:01:19.439> I

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
game and as I as I went into the game I

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.449 
game and as I as I went into the game I
was<00:01:19.709> too<00:01:20.509> naive<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.929> realize<00:01:22.319> that<00:01:22.679> I<00:01:22.889> was<00:01:23.279> in<00:01:23.429> a

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:23.459 
was too naive to realize that I was in a

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:25.370 
was too naive to realize that I was in a
college<00:01:23.880> football<00:01:24.060> game<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.929> did<00:01:25.139> not

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
college football game so I did not

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.230 
college football game so I did not
employ

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.969 

as<00:01:30.240> I'm<00:01:30.390> looking<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:30.870> the<00:01:30.930> line<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.710> see

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
as I'm looking to do the line I can see

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.399 
as I'm looking to do the line I can see
that<00:01:32.220> I'm<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.240> looking<00:01:33.690> at<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.870> hole<00:01:34.080> which

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
that I'm just looking at the hole which

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.660 
that I'm just looking at the hole which
is<00:01:34.440> something<00:01:34.860> you've<00:01:34.979> never<00:01:35.010> supposed<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.520> do

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
is something you've never supposed to do

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.190 
is something you've never supposed to do
I'm<00:01:35.820> looking<00:01:35.970> at<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> hole<00:01:36.420> looking<00:01:37.020> at<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
I'm looking at the hole looking at the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.840 
I'm looking at the hole looking at the
hole<00:01:37.350> all<00:01:37.620> I<00:01:37.830> want<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.160> is<00:01:38.310> make<00:01:38.670> sure<00:01:38.700> I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
hole all I want to do is make sure I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.310 
hole all I want to do is make sure I
don't<00:01:38.940> fall<00:01:39.240> -<00:01:39.300> now<00:01:42.710> there's<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:44.930> big<00:01:45.930> gaping

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
don't fall - now there's a big gaping

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.050 
don't fall - now there's a big gaping
hole<00:01:48.380> for<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> end<00:01:49.619> zone<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.400> when<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.580> hit<00:01:50.759> feel

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
hole for the end zone so when I hit feel

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.780 
hole for the end zone so when I hit feel
my<00:01:51.630> legs<00:01:51.869> I'm<00:01:52.200> still<00:01:52.500> moving<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.340> feel<00:01:53.580> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
my legs I'm still moving I can feel the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.590 
my legs I'm still moving I can feel the
bill<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.360> not<00:01:54.420> there<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.759> I<00:01:56.759> think<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.150> got

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
bill it's not there but I think I got

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.450 
bill it's not there but I think I got
enough<00:01:57.869> speed<00:01:58.170> I'm<00:01:58.470> not<00:01:58.650> gonna<00:01:58.830> stop<00:01:59.100> right

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
enough speed I'm not gonna stop right

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.969 
enough speed I'm not gonna stop right
here<00:02:02.030> as<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.300> came<00:02:04.080> back<00:02:04.229> oh<00:02:04.410> dude<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.740> think<00:02:04.800> is

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
here as I came back oh dude I think is

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.100 
here as I came back oh dude I think is
available<00:02:05.520> now<00:02:05.970> we're<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.360> road<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.050> I

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
available now we're on the road and I

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.310 
available now we're on the road and I
think<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.470> momentum<00:02:07.830> has<00:02:08.130> switched<00:02:08.429> as<00:02:08.700> well

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
think the momentum has switched as well

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.520 
think the momentum has switched as well
because<00:02:10.370> the<00:02:11.370> defense<00:02:11.820> mast<00:02:12.120> or<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.720> little

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
because the defense mast or the little

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.270 
because the defense mast or the little
bunker<00:02:13.950> down<00:02:14.100> also<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.780> whole<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.590> momentum

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
bunker down also the whole the momentum

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.330 
bunker down also the whole the momentum
is<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.730> change
