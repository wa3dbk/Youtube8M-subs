00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.139
 hello everyone I'm super yawning to cut 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.670
 and offer a small tutorial on the 

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:10.560
 mascots 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.740
 to people who have lived know how 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.540
 they go then 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.540
 so they can be oriented a little 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.160
 to catch a pet first everything 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.330
 as you see here they do not come out 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.330
 a capture aid notification 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.020
 we hit 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.870
 on the left 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.870
 it is the way that is missing 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.570
 things have already been taken will be a good 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.070
 companion 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.550
 I would have liked peron zombie pig 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.990
 dwarf 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.070
 and here we have it 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.280
 to change em 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.940
 in our pet 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.940
 to compose 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.740
 with the psuv 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.979
 has changed 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.890
 we can make our pet 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.730
 disappear if it bothers us in a 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.900
 home or we can not take them 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.250
 that we put our pet's 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.330
 matter 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.330
 as the chat tells us 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.340
 and by hand 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.720
 our pet will come to our side 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.240
 we can assign several skills to 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.240
 our mascot with the command pc etc 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.310
 Makes our our pet 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.369
 we can store things 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.900
 to know what skills our 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.900
 mascot composing the command to screen 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.000
 we have other skills that you have 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.730
 learned in my case like him 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.720
 has only one inventory of one row 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.720
 as you have seen before 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.069
 can learn more skills 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.599
 so nothing happens if you change 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.599
 skill every five minutes 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.420
 As you can see here, he has acquired new 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.420
 skills 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.329
 with the rope if we left click 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.489
 in that pet we will see more information 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.880
 about our mascot our mascot 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.700
 now he has the maximum 20 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.910
 as 5 damage 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.370
 97 of talented men fighting level 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.920
 1 and experience 0 of the 7 that you need 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.620
 we had very easy experience 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.800
 we look for a pet with an enemy to 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.220
 we want to kill we hit 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.440
 and our pet as you see my pet 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.240
 now it has gone up to level 2 and now 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.630
 regenerates a point of life each one 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.630
 second 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.370
 The more level our pet has 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.950
 the skills learned 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.599
 up to level 10 from 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.290
 there every time you go up there because no 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.290
 learn nothing more 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.120
 as you see now our mascot is level 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.860
 3 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.290
 when our pet is level 3 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.750
 will learn 3 new friendship modes 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.750
 aggression and mourning we can 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.600
 in friendly mode 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.890
 It serves so that when someone is up 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.890
 that your pet does not act 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.169
 aggressive every time your pet sees a 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.169
 aim to attack without you giving it 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.560
 and with normal mode it will not act like 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.720
 well, the wolves 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.670
 targets that place or attacks 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.090
 target that your pet will try 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.090
 kill her 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.700
 putting the command pete skin the damage 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.580
 increased to 3 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.860
 he learned new ways and now he has another 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.860
 generation of plus 1 every second 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.990
 if you accidentally hit a target at 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.290
 that you did not want to attack him and your pet 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.620
 keep composing that is your pet will leave 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.690
 to attack him 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.940
 as you see here your pet should now 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.740
 stop attacking 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.020
 if it does not convince us in our pet and 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.190
 we want 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.190
 to compose the command 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.700
 pet 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.440
 super cushion 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.390
 when we give him -between our pet 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.200
 it will no longer be ours so it is to continue 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.200
 will be free 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.400
 if you have confused yourself in what is already 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.750
 release this pet as I'm going to put 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.820
 bch and hit him again to kill him 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.460
 will convert yours 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.639
 The only bad point is that the 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:56.700
 skills without starting that level 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:59.330
 in my case the zombie eats rotten flesh 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.330
 as you see 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.090
 for example the bats with eyes of 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.090
 Spider 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.770
 but now they are murcia and will also give them 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.770
 hearts like the zombies 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:26.750
 if not a fight our animal dies you 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.750
 will appear at a certain time
