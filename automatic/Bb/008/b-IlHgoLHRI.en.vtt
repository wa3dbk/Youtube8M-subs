00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
hand controller and then you've got all

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.670 
hand controller and then you've got all
these<00:02:57.220> own<00:02:59.430> button<00:03:00.430> layouts<00:03:01.020> now<00:03:02.020> if<00:03:02.320> we<00:03:02.500> look

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
these own button layouts now if we look

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.810 
these own button layouts now if we look
at<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:04.320> at<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.440> n64<00:03:06.250> hand<00:03:06.550> controller

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
at the at the n64 hand controller

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.030 
at the at the n64 hand controller
obviously<00:03:07.810> it's<00:03:08.140> not<00:03:08.260> got<00:03:08.470> as<00:03:08.590> many<00:03:08.800> buttons

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
obviously it's not got as many buttons

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.310 
obviously it's not got as many buttons
as<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:10.800> 360<00:03:11.800> so<00:03:11.920> you've<00:03:12.040> got<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.400> compensate

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
as the 360 so you've got to compensate

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.820 
as the 360 so you've got to compensate
for<00:03:14.320> that<00:03:14.580> okay<00:03:15.580> so<00:03:15.640> we've<00:03:16.000> got<00:03:16.030> the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
for that okay so we've got the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.640 
for that okay so we've got the
directional<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:19.660> we've<00:03:19.810> got<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.020> digital<00:03:20.470> and

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
directional so we've got the digital and

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.990 
directional so we've got the digital and
the<00:03:20.740> analog<00:03:20.770> now<00:03:21.280> what<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.430> like<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:21.730> do<00:03:21.880> is<00:03:22.800> I

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
the analog now what I like to do is I

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.190 
the analog now what I like to do is I
like<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.060> use<00:03:25.210> them<00:03:25.950> on<00:03:26.950> my<00:03:27.130> analog<00:03:27.850> sticks<00:03:28.210> say

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
like to use them on my analog sticks say

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.410 
like to use them on my analog sticks say
on<00:03:29.500> your<00:03:29.620> Xbox<00:03:30.220> 360<00:03:30.910> controller

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
I use the left analog stick for this

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.310 
I use the left analog stick for this
section<00:03:36.190> here<00:03:36.580> so<00:03:36.790> up<00:03:37.030> up<00:03:37.630> down<00:03:37.930> left<00:03:38.170> right

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.660 

don't<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.920> that's<00:04:01.040> something<00:04:01.280> else<00:04:01.340> Arnold

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
don't and that's something else Arnold

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.210 
don't and that's something else Arnold
us<00:04:01.819> on<00:04:01.939> the<00:04:02.030> rise<00:04:02.180> analog<00:04:02.599> analog<00:04:02.870> stick<00:04:03.319> okay

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
us on the rise analog analog stick okay

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.710 
us on the rise analog analog stick okay
so<00:04:04.280> now<00:04:04.430> we've<00:04:04.579> got<00:04:04.700> these<00:04:04.849> ones<00:04:05.090> here<00:04:05.269> this<00:04:05.540> a

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
so now we've got these ones here this a

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.910 
so now we've got these ones here this a
and<00:04:05.930> B<00:04:06.430> I'm<00:04:07.430> assuming<00:04:08.030> that<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.470> in<00:04:09.470> this<00:04:09.680> game

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
and B I'm assuming that a in this game

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.429 
and B I'm assuming that a in this game
would<00:04:10.099> be<00:04:10.129> accelerating<00:04:11.060> B<00:04:11.299> would<00:04:11.480> be<00:04:11.750> to

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 
would be accelerating B would be to

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
would be accelerating B would be to
decelerate<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.400> I'm<00:04:13.579> actually<00:04:13.700> gonna<00:04:15.459> pitch

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
decelerate so I'm actually gonna pitch

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.300 
decelerate so I'm actually gonna pitch
again<00:04:16.729> so<00:04:16.970> be<00:04:17.150> obviously<00:04:17.479> is<00:04:17.660> there<00:04:18.139> so<00:04:19.070> a

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
again so be obviously is there so a

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.920 
again so be obviously is there so a
would<00:04:19.699> be<00:04:19.729> accelerate<00:04:20.419> I<00:04:20.509> believe<00:04:20.750> so<00:04:20.870> I'm

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
would be accelerate I believe so I'm

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.219 
would be accelerate I believe so I'm
gonna<00:04:21.019> go<00:04:21.169> to<00:04:21.229> that<00:04:21.350> unselect<00:04:22.539> said<00:04:23.539> -<00:04:23.840> that

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
gonna go to that unselect said - that

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.409 
gonna go to that unselect said - that
would<00:04:25.039> basically<00:04:25.190> make<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.699> right<00:04:25.940> trigger

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
would basically make the right trigger

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.230 
would basically make the right trigger
on<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.500> 360<00:04:27.860> hand<00:04:28.550> controller<00:04:28.850> the

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
on the 360 hand controller the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.159 
on the 360 hand controller the
accelerator<00:04:29.780> and<00:04:30.740> be<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:31.789> decelerator<00:04:32.360> we'll

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
accelerator and be the decelerator we'll

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.570 
accelerator and be the decelerator we'll
use<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:33.500> other<00:04:33.530> one<00:04:34.210> said<00:04:35.210> plus<00:04:36.520> now<00:04:37.520> the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
use the other one said plus now the

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.379 
use the other one said plus now the
shoulder<00:04:38.090> pads<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:39.220> didn't<00:04:40.220> really<00:04:40.430> use<00:04:40.789> them

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
shoulder pads I didn't really use them

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.629 
shoulder pads I didn't really use them
because<00:04:42.729> my<00:04:44.860> we've<00:04:45.860> got<00:04:45.979> to<00:04:46.070> start<00:04:46.280> here<00:04:46.520> as

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
because my we've got to start here as

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:52.779 
because my we've got to start here as
well<00:04:46.789> by<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.150> way<00:04:47.270> don't<00:04:48.760> my<00:04:51.610> shoulder<00:04:52.610> pad

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
well by the way don't my shoulder pad

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.270 
well by the way don't my shoulder pad
kind<00:04:53.000> of<00:04:53.090> sucks<00:04:53.330> because<00:04:54.139> the<00:04:54.530> left<00:04:55.099> one's

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
kind of sucks because the left one's

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.839 
kind of sucks because the left one's
broken

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
broken

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.390 
broken
