family member was two feet away

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.240 
family member was two feet away
I'd<00:00:56.879> say<00:00:57.420> demand<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.079> Wi-Fi<00:00:58.530> could<00:00:58.590> cause<00:00:59.010> it

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
I'd say demand for Wi-Fi could cause it

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.580 
I'd say demand for Wi-Fi could cause it
I<00:00:59.420> wonder<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> controller<00:01:00.870> might<00:01:01.440> be

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
I wonder if the controller might be

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.830 
I wonder if the controller might be
broken<00:01:02.030> there<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.149> people<00:01:03.480> who've<00:01:03.629> reported

the same issue remaining an issue even

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.140 
the same issue remaining an issue even
after<00:01:06.750> they<00:01:06.869> replaced<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.590> controller<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:09.119> it

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
after they replaced the controller so it

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.890 
after they replaced the controller so it
is<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> software<00:01:10.020> issue<00:01:10.320> an<00:01:11.060> Xbox<00:01:12.060> update<00:01:12.659> in

out<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.759> end<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.330> 2014<00:01:27.840> Microsoft<00:01:28.770> said

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
out at the end of 2014 Microsoft said

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.160 
out at the end of 2014 Microsoft said
they<00:01:29.700> knew<00:01:29.880> about<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.509> their<00:01:30.630> engineers

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
they knew about it and their engineers

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.590 
they knew about it and their engineers
were<00:01:31.439> working<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.159> which<00:01:32.970> means<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.540> will

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
were working on it which means it will

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.560 
were working on it which means it will
be<00:01:33.780> fixed<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> Xbox<00:01:34.710> too<00:01:35.240> now<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.450> it

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
be fixed in the Xbox too now if it

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.960 
be fixed in the Xbox too now if it
suddenly<00:01:36.930> started<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.560> my<00:01:38.009> first<00:01:38.369> suggestion

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
suddenly started up my first suggestion

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.719 
suddenly started up my first suggestion
is<00:01:39.210> checking<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.659> batteries<00:01:40.369> that's<00:01:41.369> more

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
is checking the batteries that's more

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.880 
is checking the batteries that's more
likely<00:01:41.970> if<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.390> stopped<00:01:42.689> vibrating<00:01:43.409> earlier

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
likely if it stopped vibrating earlier

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.789 
likely if it stopped vibrating earlier
and<00:01:44.159> now<00:01:44.310> too<00:01:44.369> weak<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.909> connect<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.530> not

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and now too weak to connect this is not

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.850 
and now too weak to connect this is not
just<00:01:47.070> connection<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.570> seems<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.170> turn<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
just connection it seems to turn on and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.460 
just connection it seems to turn on and
then<00:01:50.070> die<00:01:50.509> then<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.750> batteries<00:01:52.229> should<00:01:52.259> be

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
then die then the batteries should be

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.859 
then die then the batteries should be
replaced<00:01:52.590> because<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.030> batteries<00:01:54.450> may<00:01:54.630> only

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
replaced because the batteries may only

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.870 
replaced because the batteries may only
have<00:01:55.200> enough<00:01:55.530> juice<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.890> turn<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:56.610> die

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
have enough juice to turn on but die

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.719 
have enough juice to turn on but die
