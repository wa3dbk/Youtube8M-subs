00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.800 
take this piece off they can go back
more<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:11.590> just<00:03:12.190> added<00:03:12.340> those<00:03:12.579> there<00:03:12.850> for<00:03:13.690> no

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
more I just added those there for no

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.050 
more I just added those there for no
apparent<00:03:14.230> reason<00:03:14.640> might<00:03:15.640> change<00:03:15.820> that<00:03:16.030> up

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
apparent reason might change that up

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.470 
apparent reason might change that up
later<00:03:16.329> in<00:03:16.600> an<00:03:16.810> update<00:03:17.079> but<00:03:17.260> up<00:03:17.880> yeah<00:03:18.880> that<00:03:19.239> one

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
later in an update but up yeah that one

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.120 
later in an update but up yeah that one
moves<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.959> back<00:03:20.140> this<00:03:20.530> one<00:03:20.709> moves<00:03:20.920> back

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
moves to the back this one moves back

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.630 
moves to the back this one moves back
and<00:03:21.459> spins<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.959> then<00:03:23.079> his<00:03:23.260> feet<00:03:23.650> can<00:03:24.130> move<00:03:24.370> up

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
and spins and then his feet can move up

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.500 
and spins and then his feet can move up
forward<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.900> spin<00:03:26.230> 360<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:28.090> that's<00:03:28.239> about<00:03:28.480> it

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
forward and spin 360 so that's about it

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
forward and spin 360 so that's about it
for<00:03:28.660> articulation<00:03:30.090> pretty<00:03:31.090> good<00:03:31.299> actually

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
for articulation pretty good actually

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.440 
for articulation pretty good actually
his<00:03:32.530> arms<00:03:32.950> are<00:03:33.160> really<00:03:33.489> loose<00:03:33.820> though<00:03:34.090> so<00:03:34.420> I

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
his arms are really loose though so I
