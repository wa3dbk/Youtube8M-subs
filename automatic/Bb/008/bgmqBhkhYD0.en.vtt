00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.120
 So nothing is nothing from me 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.280
 Nothing 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.920
 It's like I have little time today 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.990
 why does that with me just like that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.789

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.699

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.429
 Tomorrow morning will be very screen 20 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.700
 pm today evening not know how they've 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.110
 deserves to know the attentively listened 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.719
 have exactly 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.579
 tomorrow, Sunday 20, until the game 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.390
 we cut directly for that 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.309
 and tomorrow will come the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.289
 remaining armor that not all me 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.760
 I will do a lot tomorrow 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.610
 I'll have a little bit tomorrow 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.059
 more time when it hopes komparsen 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.390
 unfortunately tomorrow , too, gone 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:03.199
 and it is this that this 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.199
 zugekleistert with our 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.860
 I'm glad that the code lock and 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.100
 the test cars arrive 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.880
 okay that's always the case but I'm glad 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.330
 again and again and I'm positive 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.330
 surprised 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:26.500
 the panzer expectation only I find the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.210
 tanks are not really that way 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.760
 partly really a bit strong 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.479
 new who made the order twelve 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.240
 centimeter 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.500
 which probably because I have now 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.830
 never a nectar or browser in the evening 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.600
 so I'm just fast but 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.820
 quickly the tens I find that relatively 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.060
 and because he is really now 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.990
 armor has so in the tower and the tower 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.350
 You can not miss it 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.080
 and I think I do not have it yet 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.509
 played a lot but I think mine 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.979
 my two, I find find it halt 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:13.090
 but I think so balanced I have 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:16.500
 the under not played so under 48 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.799
 exactly I did not play and the 5 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.720
 The Japanese just under 80 gets confused 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.970
 I already have one twice 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.430
 unfortunately played with human bad luck 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.930
 but I think that's it too 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.650
 already a whole part that will be natural 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.060
 everything will come in the next few days 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.440
 otherwise there is again from youtube 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.950
 nothing is the number let's play rows 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.450
 yes now so sales exception state have 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.410
 I used to call that when you test 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.570
 to wait I'll do that 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.670
 main test period so that you yours 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.640
 content or content that we see 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.860
 also wants to get punctual moves 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.010
 unfortunately now because of this 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.570
 weekend but that's no different 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.920
 and still reasonably punctual and the 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.110
 other rows then go back to regular 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.310
 if that feels so with the little videos 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.110
 from the test marek from then run the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.989
 last tests videos by the way yet and 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.280
 the region regular let's play 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:19.180
 then comes in again back with him 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:22.650
 there is nothing repertoire at wti either 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.520
 new in main events from dr 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.210
 in Europe 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.700
 as I said or old 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:35.750
 coming was the flat 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.750
 so you can stick 8.9 testers expires 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.250
 what else is there to come with 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.730
 videos about the new panzer new premium 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.950
 tanks and the remaining new cd 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.040
 is that I will, I think even I 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.430
 I take all and then over the 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:59.190
 new maps new apps new and 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:03.600
 revised naps ellenberg and i am 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:10.220
 I did not drive like that already 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.220
 so found nothing new 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.160
 otherwise I have nothing at all 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.419
 I did not really have anything 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.660
 nothing and would say that was about it 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.810
 already as far as said you know everything 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.850
 and otherwise I have one now 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.910
 little info was now in the final 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.730
 asked how is it going to be with the blog 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.180
 Anyone coming this is not a rumor 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.350
 and should come this year with 9.0 or 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.160
 9.1 he will probably still a lot 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.470
 fundamentally changed all over 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.820
 world of tanks after that all pretty much 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.250
 be progressive I'm curious 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.470
 but on the side I think slowly too 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.870
 I thought I was bored 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.980
 several videos zuetextet who that 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.140
 Video has seen and wants to see 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.700
 go short on my star, then click 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.390
 enter the magnifying glass and a gentleman place 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.000
 then you should already the extra hamburg 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:17.680
 Just look at it or listen to it 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:24.979
 go too and then you have a chance 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:29.720
 well so far so good watch if I 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:33.940
 One thing does not fit in time and 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.940
 otherwise it would be until the next time
