00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.149
 those meryl streep words that you put 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.739
 I love that you're friend and and nothing 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.329
 what to see is not personal with anyone but me 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.489
 I got tired of calling you to call me no no 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.070
 it can not be formed or not by 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.110
 please not about other interesting things 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.180
 who have the letter pointed to talk about what 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.460
 well he says he does not know if he can go back 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.680
 with someone that you ultimately threw 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.320
 an indirect marcelo linda that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.320
 they can return the children still unite them 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.710
 pretty good good surely should 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.260
 be very mobilized by the issue of 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.940
 premiere and good to try to put a 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.640
 little cold cloth to everything that is 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.990
 the crisis not obviously and said marcelo 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.399
 because I think the first time that what 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.890
 named but does not name it has to happen 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.330
 something very serious of something that does not have 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.070
 turn back as for you 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.500
 keep the anticipation I do not know I speak 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.330
 of my common sense that is not the common 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.399
 of the mortals I say well of all but 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.110
 I must say one good if there is something very 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.800
 serious one is likely to have many 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.800
 differences with the other but if I have 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.840
 a good relationship but we are going to crisis 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.420
 publicly separated is the first 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.330
 Once I mentioned it, it says marcelo good 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.100
 wave I say because we're going to agree that 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.780
 be next to marcelo when he was 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.250
 while he was next to marcelo had 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.600
 the added value of being the woman of 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.460
 marcelo that this 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.020
 no matter how much the best actress is 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.880
 that is the best businesswoman there is 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.370
 recognize that all the press that is 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.960
 He was also partly thronged him and 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.870
 good is one of the most men 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.740
 important 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.740
 I would say logical 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.880
 understanding that for her I do not want 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.010
 talk more about the subject but you could see it 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.440
 happy and they should talk on the phone 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.590

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.100

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.260
