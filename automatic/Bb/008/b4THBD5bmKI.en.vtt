this<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.550> becoming<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.630> very<00:00:27.689> very<00:00:28.439> big<00:00:28.740> concern

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
this is becoming a very very big concern

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.659 
this is becoming a very very big concern
for<00:00:29.939> me<00:00:30.090> lon<00:00:30.560> probably<00:00:31.560> one<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.980> even<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
for me lon probably one of the even the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.520 
for me lon probably one of the even the
lowest<00:00:33.290> scoring<00:00:34.290> teams<00:00:35.899> not<00:00:36.899> only<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
lowest scoring teams not only in the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.900 
lowest scoring teams not only in the
Champions<00:00:38.070> League<00:00:38.129> are<00:00:38.340> missing<00:00:38.640> everything

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
Champions League are missing everything

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.170 
Champions League are missing everything
and<00:00:39.180> go<00:00:39.420> Xion<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:39.930> instead<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.379> especially

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
and go Xion but instead I especially

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.940 
and go Xion but instead I especially
with<00:00:42.180> only<00:00:42.390> three<00:00:42.809> goals<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.290> three<00:00:43.920> games

with only three goals in three games

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.860 
with only three goals in three games
that's<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.489> an<00:00:44.670> average<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.120> one<00:00:45.390> Whooper

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870

from last year to this year has changed
drastically<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.499> this<00:04:34.710> can<00:04:34.949> be<00:04:35.129> happening

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
drastically and this can be happening

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.459 
drastically and this can be happening
you<00:04:36.120> need<00:04:36.300> every<00:04:36.539> player<00:04:36.749> hundred<00:04:37.110> percent

you need every player hundred percent

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:40.070 
you need every player hundred percent
fifth<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.009> the<00:04:38.279> work<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:39.360> work<00:04:39.389> rate<00:04:39.779> has<00:04:39.960> to

be hundred percent so he got he got
pretty<00:04:44.639> bad<00:04:44.939> when<00:04:45.210> you<00:04:45.330> got<00:04:45.479> subbed<00:04:45.749> off<00:04:46.909> but

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
pretty bad when you got subbed off but

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.439 
pretty bad when you got subbed off but
that's<00:04:48.659> a<00:04:48.900> that's<00:04:49.889> a<00:04:50.550> sport<00:04:50.819> that's<00:04:51.210> what

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
that's a that's a sport that's what

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:52.909 
that's a that's a sport that's what
happens<00:04:51.840> while<00:04:52.110> you're<00:04:52.139> not<00:04:52.439> having<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:52.770> good

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
happens while you're not having a good

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:59.709 
happens while you're not having a good
performance<00:04:53.840> um<00:04:55.340> now<00:04:56.810> so<00:04:57.810> was<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.080> 0-0<00:04:58.680> tie<00:04:58.770> game

00:04:59.709 --> 00:04:59.719 
performance um now so was a 0-0 tie game

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:05.480 
performance um now so was a 0-0 tie game
didn't<00:05:00.719> get<00:05:00.900> a<00:05:01.259> goal<00:05:02.039> and<00:05:02.370> I<00:05:04.250> guess<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.400> only

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
didn't get a goal and I guess the only

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.929 
didn't get a goal and I guess the only
positive<00:05:05.789> thing<00:05:06.029> is<00:05:06.979> that<00:05:07.979> we<00:05:08.340> can't<00:05:08.580> a<00:05:08.699> clean

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:08.939 
positive thing is that we can't a clean

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.390 
positive thing is that we can't a clean
sheet<00:05:09.240> and<00:05:09.599> we<00:05:10.080> gotta<00:05:10.379> start<00:05:10.710> keeping<00:05:11.129> clean

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
sheet and we gotta start keeping clean

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.219 
sheet and we gotta start keeping clean
sheets<00:05:11.430> guys<00:05:12.029> because<00:05:12.689> we're<00:05:12.900> not<00:05:12.930> going<00:05:13.169> to

we're not going to see a meal on up more
than<00:05:30.270> two<00:05:30.419> goals<00:05:30.449> every<00:05:31.289> game<00:05:31.500> like<00:05:31.529> we<00:05:31.919> used

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
than two goals every game like we used

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:35.300 
than two goals every game like we used
to<00:05:32.509> last<00:05:33.509> year<00:05:33.779> so<00:05:34.020> it's<00:05:34.169> very<00:05:34.379> important<00:05:35.099> to

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
to last year so it's very important to

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.409 
to last year so it's very important to
keep<00:05:35.849> a<00:05:36.029> very<00:05:36.270> clean<00:05:36.629> sheet<00:05:37.610> and<00:05:38.610> not<00:05:38.939> concede

keep a very clean sheet and not concede

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.809 
keep a very clean sheet and not concede
which<00:05:39.930> I<00:05:40.080> find<00:05:40.289> very<00:05:40.469> hard<00:05:41.009> with<00:05:41.219> this<00:05:41.310> defense

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
which I find very hard with this defense

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:45.260 
which I find very hard with this defense
but<00:05:42.379> that's<00:05:43.379> the<00:05:43.680> place<00:05:44.520> that<00:05:44.550> we<00:05:44.909> have<00:05:45.029> at<00:05:45.149> the

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
but that's the place that we have at the

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.740 
but that's the place that we have at the
moment<00:05:45.300> we<00:05:45.750> can<00:05:45.930> do<00:05:46.080> other<00:05:46.259> than<00:05:46.379> that<00:05:46.669> so

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
moment we can do other than that so

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.089 
moment we can do other than that so
we'll<00:05:48.750> see<00:05:48.960> what<00:05:49.080> happens<00:05:49.139> with<00:05:49.649> the<00:05:49.770> next

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099
