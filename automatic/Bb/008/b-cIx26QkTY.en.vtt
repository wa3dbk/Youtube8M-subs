00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hello everyone and welcome video video 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.310
 Today we will see some small 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.030
 trick trick to make it last 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.530
 more our first played before 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.030
 apply the surface polish 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.870
 of the nail must be beautiful smooth and 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.170
 smooth 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.580
 how we could make it smooth and smooth 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.590
 we can use as many beer as they are 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.210
 of special products on the market that 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.869
 serve others leave to the surface 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.160
 of the nail we can use a scrub 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.380
 when we do our manicure 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.480
 or we could use the brick 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.420
 white then the buffer is slightly 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.059
 we will go over the surface to make it 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.980
 precisely smooth and polished 2 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.540
 this is a very important thing is the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.640
 most people don't 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.559
 sometimes as complete 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.030
 you have to use the gloves in fact every 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.890
 once the chores are done 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.750
 housekeepers so you work cleaning 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.090
 in the square and everything is good to use i 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.539
 gloves to protect the enamel because 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.360
 just with the gloves the polish will not be 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.600
 contact with water or with detergents e 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.449
 various things will therefore obviously last of 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.840
 plus 3 immediately after applying it 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.400
 nail polish is good not to get a good job immediately 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.860
 hot bath 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.140
 yes you can still use water 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.430
 cold better than hot obviously not 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.180
 to bathe you 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.380
 but if you have to wash immediately after having 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.240
 done your manicure or have it 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.920
 applied your nail polish and always 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.619
 better to take a shower instead 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.000
 mate this because because in the bathroom 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.409
 nails know too much in contact with 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.040
 the water then softens 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.860
 softening up there is more risk than jumping 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.900
 another 4 I leave advise that 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.700
 of the enamel states is true as it goes 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.880
 applied the enamel the enamel o 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.950
 applied from 12 layers maximum maximum 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.660
 three, however, all these states must 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.400
 be made quite thin then 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.110
 don't put too much polish on 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.840
 brush then too snobby on the nail 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.910
 better thin layers so maybe if 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.800
 with two the color is not beautiful covering 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.620
 ago while a but must always be 33 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.540
 thin 5 in the fifth board that of 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.110
 avoid bubbles in the application 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.300
 of the glaze or when you agitated 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.369
 enamel not where to load this al 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.570
 musical world in this way in this 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.209
 just in case one is created 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.650
 bubbles inside the enamel e 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.720
 especially when he founded a stretch 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.590
 you will come if the enamel is extended into 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.120
 homogeneous way 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.790
 then if they are formed with small 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.670
 bubbles because those could 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.530
 be a reason why the enamel o 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.450
 detaches from the nail 6 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.610
 I myself recommend that of tout 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.780
 court and base in fact before 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.910
 always apply the polish 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.800
 use a phase both in point for 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.290
 increase the duration so a base must 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.720
 being a base is good and why 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.070
 precisely the base also protects the nail 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.019
 pigments of the enamel color 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.430
 therefore it has two functions speaks of 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.800
 woo to make last longer 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.930
 nail polish after applying the nail polish e 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.580
 less and less also use these must 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.920
 still be pretty good because 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.310
 is the one that fixes the long glaze longer 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.920
 and therefore does not last longer 7 the 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.780
 seventh advice is to complicated 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.600
 the polish sought if yours 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.400
 especially they are long to go a little 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.530
 that on the tip to stimulate the tip in 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.310
 this way you will avoid that the enamel does 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.650
 you catch more easily indeed 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.650
 final of the nail these were mine 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.450
 small seven tips and trivia for 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.660
 make the shepherd's glaze last longer 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.550
 hoping I was useful let me 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.310
 to know if you respect them but if there is 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.989
 something you don't do and you will be too 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.030
 some more idea tips of course 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.610
 write to all of us below like this 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.530
 we learn something more in a little way 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.190
 look for the untidy at the next video 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.190
