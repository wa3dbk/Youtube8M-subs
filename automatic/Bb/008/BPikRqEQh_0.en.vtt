00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.710
 by default most applications 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.080
 installed on a smartphone with the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.160
 android is placed in the internal memory of 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.080
 appliance 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.719
 in this way this internal space is 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.220
 busy fast but there is a way 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.740
 to make apps 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.750
 installed directly on the SD card. 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.340
 your device is what you give it 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.340
 plus a tutorial from tecmundo 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.960
 before we begin, we stress that this 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.480
 requires a lot of attention. 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.120
 next check the prerequisites that 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.519
 must be properly installed 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.460
 you will need the java s and candle 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:46.519
 thousand kits and the android sdk installed in 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.390
 a computer with windows xp vista 7 or 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.480
 8 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.600
 both can be downloaded in the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.579
 links are in the description of this video 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.359

 developer and check the debug option 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:16.190
 usb if developer options do not 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.360

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.020
 settings 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.030
 then more on the device 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:28.000
 now finds the number of 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.000
 compile and tap seven times on it 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:43.320

 a computer with a USB cable 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.930
 the detail is that the smartphone should be 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.119
 connected only when the unit is 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.340
 mounted on the computer 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.160

 if this is not done automatically 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.950
 you need to download them from the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.620

 appliance 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.290
 done that the applications should be 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.110
 installed directly on your SD card 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.540
 if you want to undo the changes
