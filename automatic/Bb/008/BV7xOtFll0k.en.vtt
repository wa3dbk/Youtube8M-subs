our refined or larger house I just think

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.460 
our refined or larger house I just think
it<00:02:14.920> adds<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.550> charm<00:02:15.819> of<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.330> frankly<00:02:16.930> so

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
it adds to the charm of it frankly so

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.110 
it adds to the charm of it frankly so
what<00:02:17.860> we're<00:02:17.980> trying<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.250> work<00:02:18.459> out<00:02:18.670> right<00:02:18.880> now

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
what we're trying to work out right now

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.800 
what we're trying to work out right now
is<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.440> line<00:02:20.680> between<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.970> fascia<00:02:22.270> where

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
is the the line between the fascia where

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.590 
is the the line between the fascia where
the<00:02:22.990> house<00:02:23.890> comes<00:02:24.459> down<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.880> house<00:02:25.030> roof<00:02:25.300> come

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
the house comes down the house roof come

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.690 
the house comes down the house roof come
down<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.080> this<00:02:26.500> line<00:02:26.800> from<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.190> point<00:02:27.370> out

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
down and this line from this point out

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.000 
down and this line from this point out
to<00:02:28.030> where<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.480> edge<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.200> porch<00:02:29.500> comes

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
to where the edge of the porch comes

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.520 
to where the edge of the porch comes
together<00:02:30.220> so<00:02:30.970> we're<00:02:31.840> looking<00:02:31.959> at<00:02:32.140> just

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
together so we're looking at just

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.199 
together so we're looking at just
finishing<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.220> also<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.730> be<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.880> thin

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
finishing that also to be a thin

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.210 
finishing that also to be a thin
triangle<00:02:34.959> there<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.590> that'll<00:02:35.890> be<00:02:36.040> pretty

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
triangle there and that'll be pretty

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.610 
triangle there and that'll be pretty
much<00:02:36.459> it<00:02:36.760> it's<00:02:37.060> getting<00:02:37.569> exciting<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.290> mean<00:02:38.410> I'm

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620
