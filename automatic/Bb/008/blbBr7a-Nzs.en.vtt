the second you know hardware reason that

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.100 
the second you know hardware reason that
I<00:02:03.979> like<00:02:04.250> this<00:02:04.490> phone<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:05.149> because<00:02:05.659> as<00:02:05.780> opposed

guys don't know what that is it's like

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.120 
guys don't know what that is it's like
LTE<00:02:09.950> x<00:02:10.729> 2<00:02:11.030> or<00:02:11.270> LTE<00:02:11.690> on<00:02:11.870> steroids<00:02:12.350> as<00:02:12.770> people

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
LTE x 2 or LTE on steroids as people

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.090 
LTE x 2 or LTE on steroids as people
call<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.760> basically<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:15.230> technology<00:02:15.860> is

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
call it and basically this technology is

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.120 
call it and basically this technology is
big<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.580> China<00:02:16.880> but<00:02:17.270> is<00:02:17.480> moving<00:02:17.989> vastly<00:02:18.830> and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
big and China but is moving vastly and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.640 
big and China but is moving vastly and
rapidly<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.910> United<00:02:20.330> States<00:02:20.569> meaning<00:02:21.530> that

rapidly to United States meaning that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.729 
rapidly to United States meaning that
your<00:02:21.860> data<00:02:22.069> plans<00:02:22.459> are<00:02:22.640> gonna<00:02:22.790> go<00:02:23.380> yeah<00:02:24.380> not

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
your data plans are gonna go yeah not

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.729 
your data plans are gonna go yeah not
the<00:02:24.920> best<00:02:24.950> but<00:02:25.690> it's<00:02:26.690> totally<00:02:26.959> worth<00:02:27.230> if<00:02:27.590> you

the best but it's totally worth if you
guys<00:02:27.890> want<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.220> speed<00:02:28.489> if<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.760> guys<00:02:28.880> want<00:02:29.090> to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
guys want to speed if you guys want to

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.390 
guys want to speed if you guys want to
watch<00:02:29.300> videos<00:02:29.780> without<00:02:30.470> buffering<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.220> all

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
watch videos without buffering and all

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.490 
watch videos without buffering and all
that<00:02:31.580> stuff<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.209> one<00:02:32.600> of<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.780> most<00:02:32.989> pickiest

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
that stuff and one of the most pickiest

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.650 
that stuff and one of the most pickiest
reasons<00:02:34.040> is<00:02:34.160> because<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.760> design<00:02:34.940> if<00:02:35.450> you

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
reasons is because of the design if you

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.809 
reasons is because of the design if you
guys<00:02:35.810> look<00:02:36.050> at<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.470> bezel<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:37.040> very<00:02:37.430> very

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
guys look at it the bezel is very very

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.059 
guys look at it the bezel is very very
thin<00:02:38.180> it's<00:02:38.390> not<00:02:38.600> even<00:02:39.050> noticeable<00:02:39.380> kind<00:02:39.920> of

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
thin it's not even noticeable kind of

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.300 
thin it's not even noticeable kind of
like<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.640> iphone<00:02:41.030> 5<00:02:41.330> but<00:02:41.840> way<00:02:42.410> more<00:02:42.799> dinner

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
like the iphone 5 but way more dinner

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.539 
like the iphone 5 but way more dinner
and<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:44.390> screen<00:02:44.720> is<00:02:44.750> of<00:02:45.080> 5.2<00:02:45.709> inch<00:02:46.010> screen<00:02:46.370> it

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
and the screen is of 5.2 inch screen it

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.970 
and the screen is of 5.2 inch screen it
looks<00:02:46.580> very<00:02:46.790> nice<00:02:47.360> sharp<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.590> just<00:02:48.799> looks

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
looks very nice sharp and it just looks

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.030 
looks very nice sharp and it just looks
phenomenal<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.730> guys<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.120> looks<00:02:50.150> amazing

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
phenomenal you guys it looks amazing

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.170 
phenomenal you guys it looks amazing
videos<00:02:52.040> are<00:02:52.190> going<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.340> look<00:02:52.489> very<00:02:52.519> sharp<00:02:53.000> on

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
videos are going to look very sharp on

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.509 
videos are going to look very sharp on
its<00:02:53.360> display<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.110> already<00:02:54.860> from<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.280> leak

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
its display and already from the leak

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.090 
its display and already from the leak
videos<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:56.150> we<00:02:56.269> see<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.470> a<00:02:57.500> very<00:02:58.070> good

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
videos that we see it is a very good

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.170 
videos that we see it is a very good
display<00:02:58.579> but<00:02:59.360> the<00:03:00.280> other<00:03:01.280> reason<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:01.970> like

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
display but the other reason that I like

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.800 
display but the other reason that I like
about<00:03:02.360> it<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.810> because<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.910> know<00:03:04.910> if<00:03:05.209> you

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
about it is because you know if you

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.050 
about it is because you know if you
looked<00:03:06.109> at<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.290> back<00:03:06.620> it's<00:03:06.950> very<00:03:07.459> very<00:03:07.820> nice

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
looked at the back it's very very nice

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.270 
looked at the back it's very very nice
you<00:03:08.900> have<00:03:09.079> volume<00:03:09.470> rockers<00:03:09.799> at<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.040> back

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
you have volume rockers at the back

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.580 
you have volume rockers at the back
which<00:03:10.459> is<00:03:10.670> not<00:03:10.910> found<00:03:11.540> on<00:03:11.750> any<00:03:11.810> other<00:03:12.260> phone

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
which is not found on any other phone

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.930 
which is not found on any other phone
and<00:03:12.829> I<00:03:12.890> think<00:03:13.160> it's<00:03:13.250> definitely<00:03:13.430> couldn't<00:03:13.820> be

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
and I think it's definitely couldn't be

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.780 
and I think it's definitely couldn't be
as<00:03:14.030> some<00:03:14.209> adjusting<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:14.900> but<00:03:15.320> if<00:03:15.560> LG<00:03:16.340> pulls

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
as some adjusting to it but if LG pulls

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.729 
as some adjusting to it but if LG pulls
it<00:03:16.940> off<00:03:17.090> right<00:03:17.359> and<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.720> buns<00:03:17.930> are<00:03:18.140> soft<00:03:18.440> and

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
it off right and the buns are soft and

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.090
