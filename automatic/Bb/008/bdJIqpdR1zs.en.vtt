now<00:04:03.940> when<00:04:04.940> replacing<00:04:05.240> this<00:04:05.690> path<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:07.430> need<00:04:07.640> to

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
now when replacing this path you need to

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:15.390 
now when replacing this path you need to
make<00:04:08.060> sure<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.430> spring<00:04:12.940> real<00:04:13.940> lines

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
make sure that the spring real lines

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.160 
make sure that the spring real lines
with<00:04:16.400> this<00:04:16.609> little<00:04:16.880> knob<00:04:17.060> let's<00:04:17.570> below<00:04:17.959> the

with this little knob let's below the

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.570 
with this little knob let's below the
screw<00:04:19.000> otherwise<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:21.440> won't<00:04:21.769> spring<00:04:22.220> in<00:04:22.460> and

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
screw otherwise it won't spring in and

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.530 
screw otherwise it won't spring in and

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
out so you put this part in first line

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:37.990
