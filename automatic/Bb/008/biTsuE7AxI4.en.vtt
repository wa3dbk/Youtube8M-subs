00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:27.060
 well here I am showing you 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.660
 this me first of all without threatening me 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.850
 I call jose and this is a video that I'm 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.399
 hanging where we are checking that 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.320
 the neo geo system works in the 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.320
 good TV 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.600
 for this 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.269
 and get help from a friend and well what 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.030
 what he did was adapt my screen 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.530
 transform it but adapt it is to say I 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.789
 I can watch normal television 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.430
 and with a few couplings to soccer I've 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.110
 managed to send colors for that 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.140
 way to play and I'm going to 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.070
 check how you can see there 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.070
 the game is appearing 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.820
 so they do not see what a mockery or a 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.630
 or a montage 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.630
 are watching 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.829
 here they are watching 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.829
 Well the truth is that it is a bit dark 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.070
 here are the cables 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.619
 here are the cables 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.280
 as you can see here are the 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.270
 colored wires 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.090
 what sent 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.450
 help from any converting card 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.920
 simply by sending the neo geo 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.159
 ah and this year it arrived as you can 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.810
 see him 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.319
 in this case I have put the king of 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.600
 2002 plus fighters that is a good game 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.909
 that today does not die 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.439
 and there they are as in the hamÃ¡s connector 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.439
 big is the promise in the video 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.240
 and if you realize good here 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.130
 there are my dark apparatuses 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.130
 I'm going to bring a guitar so I can see it 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.290
 well do not consider the intern 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.290
 but they give it to you 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.370
 there you will be able to see it 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.150
 here are the cables 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.819
 today we are going to achieve 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.260
 in the dark part but if you want 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.380
 in account which are within the 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.240
 skin is adapted to the sun 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.610
 so if they tell you that you can not 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.050
 dictating week in the head breaking up 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.200
 cellular if you can not you can 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.910
 I'm going to tell you that if you can 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.940
 that transformation is also adaptable 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.980
 for all types of hama plates and 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.069
 also for multi games since the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.970
 multi games is scheduled for a 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:12.130
 15 keyloggers 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.130
 and the television we have 15 kilos 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.549

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.170

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.240
 good 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.819

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.209
