00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
he faces his head unfortunately because

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.139 
he faces his head unfortunately because
we<00:00:35.520> couldn't<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.270> back<00:00:36.450> for<00:00:37.350> reasons<00:00:38.250> but

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
we couldn't do the back for reasons but

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.720 
we couldn't do the back for reasons but
when<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.809> behind<00:00:40.260> him<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.309> see<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the third star starts glowing and now if

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.950 
the third star starts glowing and now if
we<00:00:44.460> punch<00:00:44.789> ponter<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.840> instantly<00:00:46.440> kills<00:00:46.770> him

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
we punch ponter it instantly kills him

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.069 
we punch ponter it instantly kills him
whether<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:51.329> were<00:00:51.480> facing<00:00:51.690> another

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
whether but it if we were facing another

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.520 
whether but it if we were facing another
direction<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.949> does<00:00:53.370> breathe<00:00:54.149> damage<00:00:54.539> or<00:00:54.750> no

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
can see that it's pretty neat concept

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.380 
can see that it's pretty neat concept
definitely<00:01:25.650> could<00:01:25.830> add<00:01:26.009> some<00:01:26.280> value<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.549> PvP

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
definitely could add some value to PvP

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.980 
definitely could add some value to PvP
and<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.950> Team<00:01:29.220> Fortress<00:01:29.250> maps<00:01:29.939> when<00:01:30.869> you

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and in like Team Fortress maps when you

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.859 
and in like Team Fortress maps when you
try<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.259> recreate<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.040> class<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.450> class<00:01:33.479> of

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
try to recreate the class the class of

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.990 
try to recreate the class the class of
spy<00:01:34.340> for<00:01:35.340> example<00:01:36.350> so<00:01:37.350> yeah<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.070> will<00:01:38.610> include

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
spy for example so yeah we will include

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.929 
spy for example so yeah we will include
the<00:01:39.320> schematic<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> command<00:01:41.579> blocks<00:01:41.790> in

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
the schematic to the command blocks in

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.969 
the schematic to the command blocks in
the<00:01:42.030> description<00:01:42.540> let<00:01:43.259> me<00:01:43.380> quickly<00:01:43.860> explain

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the description let me quickly explain

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.370 
the description let me quickly explain
how<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.820> works<00:01:45.090> basically<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.350> are

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
how this works basically we are

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.270 
how this works basically we are
detecting<00:01:47.070> what<00:01:47.960> side<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.649> side<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
detecting what side is a side of the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.910 
detecting what side is a side of the
world<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.670> player<00:01:50.939> facing<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.750> then<00:01:52.500> if

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
world is player facing and then if

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.999 
world is player facing and then if
another<00:01:53.640> player<00:01:53.939> faces<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.630> same<00:01:54.869> side<00:01:55.170> then

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
another player faces the same side then

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.330 
another player faces the same side then
the<00:01:56.369> player<00:01:56.759> behind<00:01:57.000> him<00:01:57.509> gets<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.619> his<00:01:59.009> sword

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the player behind him gets the his sword

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.469 
the player behind him gets the his sword
enchanted<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.200> deals<00:02:01.200> massive<00:02:01.439> damage<00:02:02.299> so<00:02:03.299> we

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
enchanted and deals massive damage so we

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.319 
enchanted and deals massive damage so we
just<00:02:03.780> did<00:02:04.020> four<00:02:04.560> sides<00:02:05.100> here<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.640> initially

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
just did four sides here but initially

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.800 
just did four sides here but initially
we<00:02:06.869> tried<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.649> make<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.069> accurate<00:02:08.390> accurate<00:02:09.390> to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
we tried to make it accurate accurate to

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.190 
we tried to make it accurate accurate to
10<00:02:10.229> degrees<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:11.730> made<00:02:11.940> 36<00:02:12.660> command<00:02:12.989> blocks

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
10 degrees so we made 36 command blocks

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.520 
10 degrees so we made 36 command blocks
but

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
but

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.250 
but
that<00:02:13.650> was<00:02:13.860> harder<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.490> control<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.750> we<00:02:16.020> just

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
that was harder to control so we just

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.540 
that was harder to control so we just
made<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> for<00:02:17.490> comment<00:02:17.760> blog<00:02:17.880> version<00:02:18.240> here<00:02:18.450> and

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
made a for comment blog version here and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.150 
made a for comment blog version here and
