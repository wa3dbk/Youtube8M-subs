00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
lot of plans for the show and I think

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.850 
lot of plans for the show and I think
it's<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.320> better<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
it's really just going to get better and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.399 
it's really just going to get better and
better<00:01:17.100> each<00:01:17.369> year<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.939> think<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.750> key<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.020> it

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
better each year I think the key to it

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.010 
better each year I think the key to it
is<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:20.130> community<00:01:20.970> involvement<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.689> getting

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
is is community involvement in getting

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.050 
is is community involvement in getting
so<00:01:22.290> many<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.680> people<00:01:23.009> locally<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
so many of the people locally in the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.330 
so many of the people locally in the
woodworking<00:01:24.450> community<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.590> show<00:01:25.979> up<00:01:26.220> the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.800 
integration thing between google+ and
youtube<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.940> if<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.270> don't<00:03:06.480> know<00:03:06.660> i<00:03:06.690> guess

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
youtube and if you don't know i guess

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.420 
youtube and if you don't know i guess
the<00:03:07.050> deal<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.350> have<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.620> have<00:03:07.710> a<00:03:07.800> Google+

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
the deal is you have to have a Google+

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.340 
the deal is you have to have a Google+
account<00:03:08.550> if<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.060> want<00:03:09.210> to<00:03:09.270> comment<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.930> the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
account if you want to comment and the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.770 
account if you want to comment and the
comments<00:03:10.830> are<00:03:10.950> new<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.540> personally<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.720> think

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
comments are new and personally I think

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.400 
comments are new and personally I think
it's<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.680> change<00:03:14.280> for<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.700> better<00:03:14.790> because

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
it's a change for the better because

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.980 
it's a change for the better because
YouTube<00:03:16.410> comments<00:03:16.920> were<00:03:17.040> just<00:03:17.280> kind<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.990> they

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
YouTube comments were just kind of they

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.340 
YouTube comments were just kind of they
were<00:03:19.050> devolving<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.790> if<00:03:21.450> this<00:03:21.870> could<00:03:22.080> kind

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
were devolving and so if this could kind

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.050 
were devolving and so if this could kind
of<00:03:22.410> get<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.590> better<00:03:22.830> caliber<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.550> comment<00:03:23.970> and

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
of get a better caliber of comment and

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.580 
of get a better caliber of comment and
it<00:03:24.150> seems<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.570> be<00:03:24.600> working<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.260> they're<00:03:25.410> kind

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
it seems to be working and they're kind

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.700 
it seems to be working and they're kind
of<00:03:25.650> organized<00:03:26.420> you<00:03:27.420> know<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.780> tree<00:03:28.080> fashion

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
YouTube has always been making these

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.980

just<00:03:58.410> youtube<00:03:58.800> its<00:03:59.010> kind<00:03:59.640> of<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.880> Internet<00:04:00.390> in

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
just youtube its kind of the Internet in

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.620 
just youtube its kind of the Internet in
general<00:04:00.660> if<00:04:01.320> you<00:04:01.800> can't<00:04:02.190> really<00:04:02.850> adapt<00:04:03.330> to

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
general if you can't really adapt to

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.030 
general if you can't really adapt to
these<00:04:03.750> changes<00:04:03.810> you're<00:04:04.590> just<00:04:04.740> going<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:04.920> be

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
these changes you're just going to be

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.610 
these changes you're just going to be
left<00:04:05.250> in<00:04:05.490> the<00:04:05.520> dust<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:06.180> my<00:04:06.930> philosophy<00:04:07.500> is

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
left in the dust so my philosophy is

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.410 
left in the dust so my philosophy is
just<00:04:07.800> embrace<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.250> for<00:04:08.610> what<00:04:08.730> it's<00:04:08.850> worth<00:04:08.910> find

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
just embrace it for what it's worth find

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.360 
just embrace it for what it's worth find
out<00:04:09.630> how<00:04:09.870> it's<00:04:10.140> going<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.470> work<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.130> think

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
out how it's going to work and I think

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.130 
out how it's going to work and I think
in<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.640> long<00:04:11.820> run<00:04:11.880> it's<00:04:12.360> not<00:04:12.600> such<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.870> bad

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
in the long run it's not such a bad

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.840 
in the long run it's not such a bad
thing<00:04:13.200> I<00:04:13.740> guess<00:04:13.920> my<00:04:14.070> biggest<00:04:14.190> complaint<00:04:14.730> is

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
thing I guess my biggest complaint is

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.630 
thing I guess my biggest complaint is
that<00:04:14.940> people<00:04:15.810> typically<00:04:16.440> join<00:04:16.919> facebook

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
that people typically join facebook

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.500 
that people typically join facebook
because<00:04:18.359> they<00:04:18.570> like<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:19.020> and<00:04:19.229> they<00:04:19.470> want<00:04:19.680> to

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
because they like it and they want to

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.420 
because they like it and they want to
Google<00:04:21.290> is<00:04:21.410> kind<00:04:21.470> of<00:04:21.770> making<00:04:21.890> you<00:04:22.190> join

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
Google is kind of making you join

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.340 
Google is kind of making you join
google+<00:04:23.060> because<00:04:23.360> you<00:04:23.450> sort<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.690> have<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.140> if

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
google+ because you sort of have to if

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.190 
google+ because you sort of have to if
you<00:04:24.530> want<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.860> do<00:04:25.610> anything<00:04:25.850> on<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.780> internet
