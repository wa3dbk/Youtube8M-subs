of them except for this one but from
what<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.009> understand<00:01:38.520> people<00:01:38.819> really<00:01:39.060> don't

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
what I understand people really don't

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.260 
what I understand people really don't
enjoy<00:01:39.569> the<00:01:39.750> sound<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.289> pickup<00:01:40.679> anyways

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
enjoy the sound of this pickup anyways

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.510

as<00:01:42.270> much<00:01:42.539> as<00:01:42.720> they<00:01:43.080> do<00:01:43.140> others<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.310> so

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
as much as they do others and so

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.550 
as much as they do others and so
probably<00:01:45.450> wouldn't<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> bad<00:01:45.990> idea<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.409> take

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
probably wouldn't be a bad idea to take

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.940 
probably wouldn't be a bad idea to take
that<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.039> put<00:01:47.280> another<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.789> in<00:01:47.909> anyways
