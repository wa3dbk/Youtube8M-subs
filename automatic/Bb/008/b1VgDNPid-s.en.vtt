bar mounts to your standard triple yolk

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.070 
bar mounts to your standard triple yolk
but<00:02:14.940> there's<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.270> lot<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.510> room<00:02:15.780> there's

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
but there's not a lot of room there's

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.350 
but there's not a lot of room there's
always<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.290> lot<00:02:16.560> cut<00:02:16.860> out<00:02:17.070> of<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.670> pretty

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
always a lot cut out of the in pretty

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.270 
always a lot cut out of the in pretty
modern<00:02:18.690> sports<00:02:19.020> like<00:02:19.290> top<00:02:19.560> yoke<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.130> don't

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
modern sports like top yoke so you don't

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.860 
modern sports like top yoke so you don't
have<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.430> lot<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.670> room<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.850> mount<00:02:21.210> on<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.630> and

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
have a lot of room to mount on to and

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.230 
have a lot of room to mount on to and
you<00:02:22.590> don't<00:02:22.770> have<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.980> lot<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.280> space<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.700> drill

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
you don't have a lot of space to drill

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.300 
you don't have a lot of space to drill
if<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.510> want<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.780> try<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.080> drill<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:26.130> mount

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
if you want to try and drill to mount

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.240 
if you want to try and drill to mount
these<00:02:26.460> on<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.410> my<00:02:28.410> recommendation<00:02:29.130> is

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
these on to so my recommendation is

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.420 
these on to so my recommendation is
buying<00:02:29.670> new<00:02:30.300> topic<00:02:30.770> probably<00:02:31.770> only<00:02:32.130> one<00:02:32.340> you

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
buying new topic probably only one you

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.010 
buying new topic probably only one you
can<00:02:32.610> do<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:32.970> quality<00:02:33.390> when<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.540> can<00:02:33.690> find<00:02:33.900> a

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
can do so quality when you can find a

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.700 
can do so quality when you can find a
