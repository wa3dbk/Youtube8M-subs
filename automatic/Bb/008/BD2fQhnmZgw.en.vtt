00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
right there i'm going to show you guys a

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.569 
right there i'm going to show you guys a
couple<00:01:36.960> more<00:01:37.320> times<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.159> different

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
couple more times just like different

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.819 
couple more times just like different
like<00:01:39.110> variations<00:01:40.110> i<00:01:40.229> guess<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.500> could<00:01:40.650> call

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
like variations i guess you could call

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.039 
like variations i guess you could call
it<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.159> example<00:01:41.670> am<00:01:41.790> i<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.090> min<00:01:42.470> just<00:01:43.470> watch<00:01:43.619> as

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
it for example am i a min just watch as

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.080 
it for example am i a min just watch as
you<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.229> see<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.490> weird<00:01:47.700> swap

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
you can see it like just a weird swap

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.679 
you can see it like just a weird swap
and<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.860> really<00:01:50.130> weird<00:01:50.399> swap<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.090> know<00:01:51.210> like

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and it's a really weird swap I know like

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.690 
and it's a really weird swap I know like
the<00:01:51.840> white<00:01:52.439> light<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.159> see<00:01:53.280> me<00:01:53.430> wild

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the white light you can see me wild

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.179 
the white light you can see me wild
lying<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.090> trust<00:01:54.390> me<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.720> not<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
lying but trust me is not like just a

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.100 
lying but trust me is not like just a
normal<00:01:56.399> piece<00:01:56.820> wop<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.540> guess<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.810> could<00:01:57.960> call

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
normal piece wop I guess you could call

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.389 
normal piece wop I guess you could call
it<00:01:59.090> it's<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:01.049> see<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.409> right<00:02:01.590> yet<00:02:02.100> like

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
it it's like you see that right yet like

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.789 
it it's like you see that right yet like
I'm<00:02:02.790> really<00:02:03.030> bad<00:02:03.360> at<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.899> i'm<00:02:04.049> pretty<00:02:04.259> sure<00:02:04.469> if

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
I'm really bad at it i'm pretty sure if

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.950 
I'm really bad at it i'm pretty sure if
like<00:02:05.100> people<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.299> if<00:02:06.509> i<00:02:06.600> made<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> tutorial

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
like people like if i made a tutorial

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.619 
like people like if i made a tutorial
for<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.829> people<00:02:07.950> like<00:02:08.369> start<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.450> for

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
for this and people like start going for

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.240 
for this and people like start going for
it<00:02:09.720> they<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.959> make<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> look<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.619> lot<00:02:10.979> like

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
it they can make it a look a lot like

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.670 
it they can make it a look a lot like
more<00:02:11.550> smooth<00:02:11.849> but<00:02:12.180> basically

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
more smooth but basically

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.149 
more smooth but basically
like<00:02:14.189> it's<00:02:14.849> that<00:02:15.120> basically<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.260> like<00:02:16.980> it

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
like it's that basically and like it

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.190 
like it's that basically and like it
looks<00:02:17.310> really<00:02:17.519> sloppy<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:18.359> way<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.510> do<00:02:18.689> I<00:02:18.840> guess

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
looks really sloppy the way I do I guess

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.720 
looks really sloppy the way I do I guess
it<00:02:19.409> kind<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.620> looks<00:02:19.769> cool<00:02:19.980> i<00:02:20.010> guess<00:02:20.189> but<00:02:20.670> i

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
it kind of looks cool i guess but i

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.339 
it kind of looks cool i guess but i
don't<00:02:21.120> know<00:02:21.180> it's<00:02:21.359> just<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.689> new<00:02:21.840> shot<00:02:22.140> and

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
don't know it's just a new shot and

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.199 
don't know it's just a new shot and
really<00:02:22.590> just<00:02:22.799> want<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.370> show<00:02:23.519> you<00:02:23.609> guys<00:02:23.670> right

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.729 
really just want to show you guys right
now<00:02:24.239> i'm<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.659> gonna<00:02:24.780> show<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.049> guys<00:02:25.230> like

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
now i'm just gonna show you guys like

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.670 
now i'm just gonna show you guys like
another<00:02:26.670> gun<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.239> can<00:02:27.359> do<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.629> with<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.379> can

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
another gun you can do it with this can

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.410 
another gun you can do it with this can
be<00:02:28.859> done<00:02:29.069> with<00:02:29.280> most<00:02:29.459> weapons<00:02:29.700> i<00:02:30.000> think<00:02:30.239> it

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
be done with most weapons i think it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.080 
be done with most weapons i think it
might<00:02:30.780> actually<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.409> fact<00:02:31.439> be<00:02:32.069> like<00:02:32.310> able<00:02:32.969> to

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
might actually in fact be like able to

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.879 
might actually in fact be like able to
be<00:02:33.209> done<00:02:33.420> with<00:02:33.750> all<00:02:33.959> weapons<00:02:34.409> i'm<00:02:34.590> not<00:02:34.739> sure

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
be done with all weapons i'm not sure

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:36.589 
be done with all weapons i'm not sure
though<00:02:35.099> just<00:02:35.519> i<00:02:35.670> know<00:02:35.730> there's<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.359> problem

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
though just i know there's a problem

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.959 
though just i know there's a problem
with<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.019> with<00:02:37.139> pistols<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:37.799> i<00:02:38.069> don't<00:02:38.670> know<00:02:38.730> i

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
with it with pistols but i don't know i

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.729 
with it with pistols but i don't know i
think<00:02:39.329> there<00:02:39.719> might<00:02:39.810> be<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.959> way<00:02:40.109> around<00:02:40.139> it<00:02:40.530> but

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
think there might be a way around it but

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.129 
think there might be a way around it but
let's<00:02:40.889> just<00:02:41.010> get<00:02:41.579> right<00:02:41.819> through<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.359> so<00:02:42.810> here
