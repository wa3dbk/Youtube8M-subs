00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.170 

the<00:00:54.140> tray<00:00:54.380> comes<00:00:54.620> out<00:00:54.829> and<00:00:55.040> now<00:00:55.880> we<00:00:55.940> have<00:00:56.150> just

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
the tray comes out and now we have just

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.710 
the tray comes out and now we have just
the<00:00:56.540> hard<00:00:56.810> drive<00:00:58.300> now<00:00:59.300> I'm<00:00:59.390> going<00:00:59.540> to<00:00:59.600> pull

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
the hard drive now I'm going to pull

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.120 
the hard drive now I'm going to pull
over<00:00:59.870> a<00:00:59.989> device<00:01:00.260> here<00:01:00.470> I<00:01:00.500> like<00:01:00.710> to<00:01:00.739> call<00:01:00.950> the

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
over a device here I like to call the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.079 
over a device here I like to call the
toaster<00:01:03.250> just<00:01:04.250> because<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:04.610> put<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.850> drives

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
toaster just because you put the drives

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.890 
toaster just because you put the drives
in<00:01:05.269> like<00:01:05.510> a<00:01:05.540> toaster<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:07.420> what<00:01:08.420> this<00:01:08.540> is<00:01:08.750> is

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
in like a toaster and what this is is

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.760 
in like a toaster and what this is is
basically<00:01:09.050> a<00:01:09.350> SATA<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:10.280> USB<00:01:10.390> converter<00:01:11.770> you

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
basically a SATA to USB converter you

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.990 
basically a SATA to USB converter you
could<00:01:12.890> also<00:01:13.040> buy<00:01:13.220> cables<00:01:13.640> that<00:01:13.759> do<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:13.970> same

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
could also buy cables that do the same

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.130 
could also buy cables that do the same
thing<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:16.430> hard<00:01:16.580> drive<00:01:16.780> gets<00:01:17.780> pushed<00:01:17.990> in

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
thing and the hard drive gets pushed in

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.050 
thing and the hard drive gets pushed in
right<00:01:18.320> like<00:01:18.440> a<00:01:18.470> toaster<00:01:18.890> there's<00:01:19.790> an<00:01:19.940> on/off

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
right like a toaster there's an on/off

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.499 
right like a toaster there's an on/off
switch<00:01:20.290> switch<00:01:21.290> it<00:01:21.410> on<00:01:22.030> then<00:01:23.030> you<00:01:23.119> can<00:01:23.150> plug

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
switch switch it on then you can plug

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.580 
switch switch it on then you can plug
the<00:01:23.810> USB<00:01:24.020> cable<00:01:24.470> here<00:01:24.830> into<00:01:25.160> a<00:01:25.190> computer<00:01:26.590> you

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
the USB cable here into a computer you

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.900 
the USB cable here into a computer you
can<00:01:27.710> plug<00:01:27.860> it<00:01:27.950> into<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.130> Windows<00:01:28.399> machine<00:01:28.550> any

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
can plug it into a Windows machine any

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.310 
can plug it into a Windows machine any
machine<00:01:29.240> but<00:01:29.509> I'm<00:01:29.720> gonna<00:01:29.810> plug<00:01:30.050> it<00:01:30.140> into<00:01:30.259> a

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
machine but I'm gonna plug it into a

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.630 
machine but I'm gonna plug it into a
novice<00:01:30.649> machine<00:01:30.979> just<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.190> show<00:01:31.369> you<00:01:31.460> what<00:01:31.550> the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
novice machine just to show you what the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.690 
novice machine just to show you what the
file<00:01:31.789> system<00:01:32.180> local<00:01:32.420> site<00:01:32.600> this<00:01:33.229> is<00:01:33.410> a<00:01:33.440> USB<00:01:33.800> to

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
file system local site this is a USB to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.499 
file system local site this is a USB to
SATA<00:01:35.030> or<00:01:35.149> USB<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.720> IDE<00:01:36.580> cable<00:01:37.580> so<00:01:38.060> if<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.330> don't

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
SATA or USB to IDE cable so if you don't

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.820 
SATA or USB to IDE cable so if you don't
have<00:01:38.660> the<00:01:38.840> toaster<00:01:39.140> only<00:01:39.320> works<00:01:39.470> for<00:01:39.590> SATA

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
have the toaster only works for SATA

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.870 
have the toaster only works for SATA
mainly<00:01:40.250> but<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.090> could<00:01:41.210> use<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.420> IDE<00:01:41.690> cable

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
mainly but you could use the IDE cable

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.460 
mainly but you could use the IDE cable
now<00:01:43.880> switched<00:01:44.420> over<00:01:44.600> real<00:01:44.899> quick<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:45.440> a

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
now switched over real quick to a

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.230 
now switched over real quick to a
