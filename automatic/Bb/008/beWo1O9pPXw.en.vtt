oh<00:00:00.089> hello<00:00:00.659> there<00:00:01.050> you're<00:00:01.350> looking<00:00:01.650> at<00:00:01.770> a

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
oh hello there you're looking at a

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.970 
oh hello there you're looking at a
spaceman<00:00:02.580> effects<00:00:03.000> saturn<00:00:03.540> v<00:00:03.870> or<00:00:04.290> Saturn<00:00:04.710> V

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
spaceman effects saturn v or Saturn V

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.190 
spaceman effects saturn v or Saturn V
which<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.759> clearly<00:00:06.210> labeled<00:00:06.509> here<00:00:06.960> as<00:00:07.170> a

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
which is clearly labeled here as a

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.850 
which is clearly labeled here as a
harmonic<00:00:08.300> booster<00:00:09.300> so<00:00:10.170> it's<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.469> boost<00:00:10.679> pedal

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
harmonic booster so it's a boost pedal

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.490 
harmonic booster so it's a boost pedal
but<00:00:11.730> it's<00:00:11.849> got<00:00:12.030> some<00:00:12.240> harmonic<00:00:12.719> drive<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.349> it

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
but it's got some harmonic drive in it

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.150 
but it's got some harmonic drive in it
as<00:00:13.650> well

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
as well

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.790 
as well
according<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.790> spaceman<00:00:15.509> which<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.590> pretty

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
according to spaceman which is pretty

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.160 
according to spaceman which is pretty
cool<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.369> super<00:00:17.940> simple<00:00:18.270> layout<00:00:18.449> boost<00:00:18.930> here

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
cool so super simple layout boost here

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.779 
cool so super simple layout boost here
on<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.439> left<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.949> overall<00:00:20.220> level<00:00:20.640> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
on the left is the overall level the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.540 
on the left is the overall level the
pedal<00:00:21.090> there's<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.480> ton<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:22.140> headroom<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.920> ton<00:00:23.519> of

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
pedal there's a ton of headroom a ton of

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.550 
pedal there's a ton of headroom a ton of
extra<00:00:23.970> volume<00:00:24.330> can<00:00:24.510> be<00:00:24.539> added<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.109> your<00:00:25.199> signal

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
extra volume can be added to your signal

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.349 
extra volume can be added to your signal
I<00:00:25.619> think<00:00:25.890> boost<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.430> drive<00:00:26.609> combined<00:00:27.090> adds

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
I think boost and drive combined adds

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.689 
I think boost and drive combined adds
like<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.960> don't<00:00:28.740> remember<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.250> number<00:00:29.519> but

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
like I don't remember the number but

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.519 
like I don't remember the number but
it's<00:00:29.910> an<00:00:30.029> insane<00:00:30.359> amount<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.720> decibels<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
it's an insane amount of decibels and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.860 
it's an insane amount of decibels and
then<00:00:31.980> drive<00:00:32.250> right<00:00:32.460> here<00:00:32.669> on<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.969> right<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
then drive right here on the right the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.299 
then drive right here on the right the
two<00:00:34.020> are<00:00:34.170> pretty<00:00:34.320> interactive<00:00:34.649> which<00:00:35.130> you'll

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
two are pretty interactive which you'll

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.740 
two are pretty interactive which you'll
see<00:00:35.340> as<00:00:35.700> well<00:00:36.770> super<00:00:37.770> awesome<00:00:38.340> huge<00:00:38.850> LED

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
see as well super awesome huge LED

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.100 
see as well super awesome huge LED
that's<00:00:40.079> blue<00:00:40.410> yeah<00:00:41.420> it's<00:00:42.420> part<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.750> why<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.899> like

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
that's blue yeah it's part of why I like

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.540 
that's blue yeah it's part of why I like
this<00:00:43.290> one

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
this one

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.029 
this one
spaceman<00:00:45.270> makes<00:00:45.570> limited-run<00:00:46.140> pedals<00:00:46.800> in

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
spaceman makes limited-run pedals in

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.549 
spaceman makes limited-run pedals in
general<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.789> they<00:00:48.230> there's<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.320> couple

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
general and so they there's a couple

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.100 
general and so they there's a couple
different<00:00:49.820> colored<00:00:50.820> versions<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.809> lot<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
different colored versions of a lot of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.600 
different colored versions of a lot of
their<00:00:52.230> pedals<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> Saturn<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.160> no<00:00:53.280> exception

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
their pedals the Saturn is no exception

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.490 
their pedals the Saturn is no exception
I<00:00:53.940> think<00:00:54.059> there<00:00:54.329> might<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.510> more<00:00:54.629> combinations

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
I think there might be more combinations

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.139 
I think there might be more combinations
in<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> Saturn<00:00:56.160> than<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> other<00:00:56.579> stuff<00:00:56.879> but

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
in the Saturn than the other stuff but

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.479 
in the Saturn than the other stuff but
anyway<00:00:58.079> they<00:00:58.230> make<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> limited<00:00:58.890> number<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.340> all

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
anyway they make a limited number of all

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.369 
anyway they make a limited number of all
of<00:00:59.670> them<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.059> once<00:01:00.989> they're<00:01:01.170> gone<00:01:01.320> they're

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
of them and once they're gone they're

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.930 
of them and once they're gone they're
gone<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.770> they<00:01:02.039> won't<00:01:02.219> make<00:01:02.340> them<00:01:02.489> again<00:01:02.699> so

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
gone and they won't make them again so

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.030 
gone and they won't make them again so
that's<00:01:03.690> kind<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.140> cool<00:01:04.290> effect<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.890> you're

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
that's kind of a cool effect if you're

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.030 
that's kind of a cool effect if you're
into<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.970> little<00:01:06.510> bit<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.840> individuality<00:01:07.680> or

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
into a little bit of individuality or

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.300 
into a little bit of individuality or
limitedness<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:09.299> elite<00:01:10.200> Nisour<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.130> want

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
limitedness or elite Nisour if you want

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.600 
limitedness or elite Nisour if you want
to<00:01:11.400> put<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.020> terrible<00:01:13.020> spin<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.250> instead

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
to put the terrible spin on it instead

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.289 
to put the terrible spin on it instead
but<00:01:14.880> anyway<00:01:15.650> I'm<00:01:16.650> gonna<00:01:16.830> play<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.310> nash<00:01:17.549> t57

Telecaster into a morgen RCA 35 this is
clean<00:01:21.869> sound

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.630 

and<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> Saturn<00:01:25.950> setup<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.340> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
and this is the Saturn setup just to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:36.749 
and this is the Saturn setup just to
push<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> little<00:01:27.180> bit<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.960> stuff<00:01:28.229> at<00:01:28.440> noon

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.270 

very<00:01:37.759> responsive<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.450> touch<00:01:38.810> as<00:01:39.020> you<00:01:39.049> can<00:01:39.289> see

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.919 

the<00:01:43.280> more<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:43.549> dig<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.149> more<00:01:44.360> nastiness

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
the more you dig the more nastiness

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.779 
the more you dig the more nastiness
comes<00:01:45.350> out

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.309 

that's<00:01:49.789> adjusting<00:01:50.359> nothing<00:01:50.719> but<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.020> level

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
that's adjusting nothing but the level

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.889 
that's adjusting nothing but the level
of<00:01:51.409> your<00:01:51.499> playing<00:01:51.770> which<00:01:52.009> is<00:01:52.159> pretty<00:01:52.369> cool<00:01:52.899> so

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
of your playing which is pretty cool so

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.669 
of your playing which is pretty cool so
you<00:01:54.380> can<00:01:54.679> turn<00:01:55.569> well<00:01:56.569> we'll<00:01:56.990> start<00:01:57.229> here<00:01:57.439> just

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
you can turn well we'll start here just

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:08.469 
you can turn well we'll start here just
with<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.069> the<00:01:58.429> range<00:01:58.670> of<00:01:58.909> everything<00:02:07.000> I<00:02:08.000> can't

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
with the the range of everything I can't

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.359 
with the the range of everything I can't
even<00:02:08.599> go<00:02:08.899> up<00:02:09.049> any<00:02:09.229> further<00:02:09.470> than<00:02:09.799> that<00:02:09.830> cuz<00:02:10.190> it

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
even go up any further than that cuz it

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.059 
even go up any further than that cuz it
gets<00:02:10.580> crazy<00:02:11.360> up<00:02:11.690> there<00:02:11.720> with<00:02:12.379> the<00:02:12.500> drive<00:02:12.769> here

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
gets crazy up there with the drive here

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.289 
gets crazy up there with the drive here
anyway

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299

the strumming zand what have you so very
dynamic<00:02:44.540> very<00:02:44.750> responsive<00:02:45.910> you<00:02:46.910> can<00:02:47.210> turn<00:02:47.780> all

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
dynamic very responsive you can turn all

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.290

the<00:02:48.110> drive<00:02:48.350> off<00:02:48.560> all<00:02:48.920> together<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.730> then<00:02:49.940> I

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
the drive off all together and then I

00:02:50.300 --> 00:03:05.280 
the drive off all together and then I
don't<00:02:50.660> know<00:02:50.690> exactly<00:02:51.200> where<00:02:51.440> unity<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:52.130> there

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.390 

where<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.410> doesn't<00:03:06.650> really<00:03:06.950> color<00:03:07.190> your

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
where it doesn't really color your

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.070 
where it doesn't really color your
signal<00:03:07.730> at<00:03:07.850> all<00:03:07.970> at<00:03:08.270> least<00:03:08.330> not<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:08.900> can

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
signal at all at least not that I can

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.300 
signal at all at least not that I can
hear<00:03:09.320> too<00:03:09.470> much

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.210 

you

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.860 

so<00:03:18.220> put<00:03:18.580> it<00:03:18.700> there<00:03:18.909> and<00:03:19.150> just<00:03:19.209> be<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.510> slight

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
so put it there and just be a slight

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.570 
so put it there and just be a slight
boost<00:03:20.170> above<00:03:22.799> what<00:03:23.799> you're<00:03:24.010> already<00:03:24.280> getting

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
boost above what you're already getting

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.440 
boost above what you're already getting
which<00:03:25.510> is<00:03:25.690> definitely<00:03:26.140> cool<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:28.060> can<00:03:28.239> add

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
which is definitely cool you can add

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.229 
which is definitely cool you can add
just<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.989> tad<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.709> drive<00:03:30.040> into<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.549> for<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.000> little

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
just a tad of drive into it for a little

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.440 
just a tad of drive into it for a little
bit<00:03:31.480> of

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:54.110 

slight<00:03:35.410> boost<00:03:40.620> add<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.680> little<00:03:42.040> more<00:03:42.250> in<00:03:42.459> there

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:17.259 

you

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:37.750 

crank<00:04:18.269> it<00:04:18.360> up<00:04:18.510> cuz<00:04:18.750> why<00:04:18.900> not

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.700 

I've<00:04:38.540> personally<00:04:39.200> have<00:04:39.290> gotten<00:04:39.560> some

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
I've personally have gotten some

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.620 
I've personally have gotten some
interesting<00:04:40.220> results<00:04:40.430> when<00:04:40.880> combining<00:04:41.360> this

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
interesting results when combining this

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.780 
interesting results when combining this
with<00:04:42.110> other<00:04:42.290> pedals<00:04:42.710> especially<00:04:43.220> using<00:04:43.550> it<00:04:43.670> to

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
with other pedals especially using it to

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.130 
with other pedals especially using it to
push<00:04:44.030> other<00:04:44.330> OverDrive's

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
push other OverDrive's

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.070 
push other OverDrive's
certain<00:04:45.860> ones<00:04:46.070> it<00:04:46.610> just<00:04:46.880> maybe<00:04:47.420> thickens<00:04:47.930> it

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
certain ones it just maybe thickens it

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.330 
certain ones it just maybe thickens it
up<00:04:48.140> because<00:04:48.290> you<00:04:48.380> can<00:04:48.620> tell<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.950> drive<00:04:49.190> on

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
up because you can tell the drive on

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.950 
up because you can tell the drive on
this<00:04:49.490> pedal<00:04:49.820> is<00:04:49.880> pretty<00:04:50.120> thick<00:04:50.390> anyway<00:04:50.720> but

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
this pedal is pretty thick anyway but

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.660 
this pedal is pretty thick anyway but
I've<00:04:51.380> played<00:04:51.590> behind<00:04:51.830> some<00:04:52.220> where<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.490> just

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
I've played behind some where it just

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.730 
I've played behind some where it just
causes<00:04:53.000> them<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.390> scream<00:04:53.780> like<00:04:54.140> in<00:04:54.290> a<00:04:54.320> good<00:04:54.500> way

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
causes them to scream like in a good way

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.400 
causes them to scream like in a good way
so<00:04:55.460> it's<00:04:56.180> interesting<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.960> different

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
so it's interesting the different

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.170 
so it's interesting the different
combinations<00:04:57.980> you<00:04:58.130> can<00:04:58.310> make<00:04:58.490> with<00:04:58.670> it<00:04:58.700> or

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
combinations you can make with it or

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.390 
combinations you can make with it or
whatever<00:04:59.480> and<00:04:59.750> it<00:05:00.320> looks<00:05:00.530> cool<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:00.920> boot<00:05:01.100> so

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
whatever and it looks cool to boot so

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.340 
whatever and it looks cool to boot so
that's<00:05:01.790> something<00:05:02.270> for<00:05:02.300> some<00:05:02.630> people<00:05:02.990> it's

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
that's something for some people it's

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.810 
that's something for some people it's
something<00:05:03.530> for<00:05:03.830> me<00:05:03.950> but<00:05:04.280> anyway<00:05:04.580> there<00:05:04.790> you

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820
