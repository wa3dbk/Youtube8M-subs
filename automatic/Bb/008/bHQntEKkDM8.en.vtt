let's<00:01:32.960> do<00:01:33.080> this<00:01:33.260> braid<00:01:33.530> first

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.930 

right<00:01:44.350> in<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.650> back<00:01:44.830> I<00:01:45.070> actually<00:01:45.340> just<00:01:45.670> kind

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
right in the back I actually just kind

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.450 
right in the back I actually just kind
of<00:01:46.000> wrapped<00:01:46.300> and<00:01:46.600> sort<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:47.260> twisted<00:01:47.920> them<00:01:48.130> into

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
of wrapped and sort of twisted them into

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.850 
of wrapped and sort of twisted them into
a<00:01:48.490> bottle<00:01:49.120> shape<00:01:49.390> I<00:01:49.440> think<00:01:50.440> it's<00:01:50.590> kind<00:01:50.800> of

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
a bottle shape I think it's kind of

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.260 
a bottle shape I think it's kind of
weird<00:01:51.070> that<00:01:51.130> there<00:01:51.370> are<00:01:51.460> three<00:01:51.730> braids<00:01:52.030> it

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
weird that there are three braids it

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.700 
weird that there are three braids it
would<00:01:52.360> have<00:01:52.450> been<00:01:52.510> so<00:01:52.810> much<00:01:52.870> more<00:01:53.050> even<00:01:53.410> if

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
would have been so much more even if

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.460 
would have been so much more even if
there<00:01:53.860> have<00:01:53.980> been<00:01:54.040> four<00:01:54.510> I<00:01:55.510> did<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.080> best<00:01:56.110> I

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
there have been four I did the best I

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.830 
there have been four I did the best I
could<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:56.980> then<00:01:57.040> with<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.550> front<00:01:57.910> sections<00:01:58.510> I

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
could and then with the front sections I

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.960 
could and then with the front sections I
am<00:01:59.770> read<00:02:00.730> two<00:02:00.940> braids<00:02:01.270> going<00:02:01.960> backwards<00:02:02.410> and

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
am read two braids going backwards and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
than I thought that I would to make it

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.110 
than I thought that I would to make it
look<00:02:29.560> this<00:02:29.770> big<00:02:30.070> I<00:02:30.310> just<00:02:30.610> kind<00:02:30.820> of<00:02:30.880> took<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
look this big I just kind of took the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.710 
look this big I just kind of took the
brains<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:32.160> sort<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.250> started<00:02:34.180> off<00:02:34.300> with<00:02:34.540> like

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
brains and sort of started off with like

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.660 
brains and sort of started off with like
this<00:02:34.930> weird<00:02:35.170> circle<00:02:35.920> shape<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.400> then<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:36.550> just

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
this weird circle shape and then I just

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.310 
this weird circle shape and then I just
kept<00:02:36.970> wrapping<00:02:37.390> them<00:02:37.540> around<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.960> circle

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
kept wrapping them around the circle

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.870 
kept wrapping them around the circle
shape<00:02:38.350> making<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.130> bigger<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.430> bigger<00:02:39.760> and

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
shape making it bigger and bigger and

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.930 
shape making it bigger and bigger and
bigger<00:02:40.500> cuz<00:02:41.500> yeah<00:02:42.160> i<00:02:42.190> think<00:02:42.370> this<00:02:42.640> sort<00:02:42.850> of

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
bigger cuz yeah i think this sort of

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.610 
bigger cuz yeah i think this sort of
makes<00:02:43.180> my<00:02:43.330> hair<00:02:43.480> look<00:02:43.510> really<00:02:44.020> super<00:02:44.380> long

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
makes my hair look really super long

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.360 
makes my hair look really super long
when<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.490> isn't<00:02:45.910> actually<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:46.890> if<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.100> do

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
when it isn't actually and if you do

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.070 
when it isn't actually and if you do
have<00:02:48.670> really<00:02:49.060> long<00:02:49.239> hair<00:02:49.270> I<00:02:49.480> imagine<00:02:49.570> this

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
have really long hair I imagine this

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.900
