00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
pointy crash out which is at 64 the rate

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.700 
pointy crash out which is at 64 the rate

fair winters lie the impact is 67 so
that's<00:02:45.360> free<00:02:45.630> more<00:02:45.870> than<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.080> pie<00:02:46.260> crash<00:02:46.590> are

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
that's free more than the pie crash are

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.890 
that's free more than the pie crash are
not<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> lot<00:02:47.910> they're<00:02:48.180> not<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.540> lot<00:02:48.870> of

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
not a lot they're not a lot of

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.540 
not a lot they're not a lot of
difference<00:02:49.350> we<00:02:49.530> can<00:02:49.560> make<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.980> little<00:02:50.310> bit<00:02:50.460> of

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
crusher which is 11 and that's why i

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.120 
crusher which is 11 and that's why i
don't<00:03:00.060> think<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.480> free<00:03:00.780> more<00:03:01.260> impact<00:03:01.740> on<00:03:01.950> the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
don't think the free more impact on the

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.350 
don't think the free more impact on the
fair<00:03:02.310> winters<00:03:02.610> my<00:03:02.730> really<00:03:03.000> does<00:03:03.150> make<00:03:03.300> a

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
fair winters my really does make a

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.700 
fair winters my really does make a
difference<00:03:03.630> because<00:03:04.080> if<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.320> don't<00:03:04.440> get<00:03:04.590> as

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
difference because if you don't get as

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.110 
difference because if you don't get as
much<00:03:04.830> damage<00:03:05.100> as<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.370> would<00:03:05.670> with<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.910> fair

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
winters with the pointy crush on you can

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.220 
winters with the pointy crush on you can
easily<00:03:08.160> shoot<00:03:08.610> quick<00:03:08.970> after<00:03:09.210> and<00:03:09.660> get<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.960> key

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
easily shoot quick after and get a key

easily shoot quick after and get a key
words<00:03:10.530> with<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.800> fair<00:03:10.980> winters<00:03:11.250> lie<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.940> rate

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
words with the fair winters lie the rate

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.030 
words with the fair winters lie the rate
of<00:03:12.150> fire<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.450> at<00:03:12.750> five<00:03:12.990> so<00:03:13.230> it's<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.500> lot<00:03:13.800> slower

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
of fire is at five so it's a lot slower

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.850 
of fire is at five so it's a lot slower
now<00:03:14.490> in<00:03:14.880> terms<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.360> ranges<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.350> pie<00:03:16.500> crusher

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
now in terms of ranges the pie crusher

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.150 
now in terms of ranges the pie crusher
actually<00:03:17.190> has<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> range<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:18.140> 23<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.920> fair

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
actually has a range of 23 and the fair

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.860 
actually has a range of 23 and the fair
winters<00:03:20.459> has<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.670> range<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.150> twenty<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.780> the

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
winters has a range of twenty so the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.990 
winters has a range of twenty so the
range<00:03:22.050> is<00:03:22.170> automatically<00:03:22.740> better<00:03:22.860> on<00:03:23.280> the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
range is automatically better on the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.090 
range is automatically better on the
party<00:03:24.810> crasher<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.200> if<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.470> have<00:03:25.590> reinforced

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
party crasher and if you have reinforced

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.949 
party crasher and if you have reinforced
by<00:03:26.190> our<00:03:26.340> rifle<00:03:26.670> barrel<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.120> certain<00:03:27.480> perks<00:03:27.690> I

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
by our rifle barrel and certain perks I

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.570 
by our rifle barrel and certain perks I
think<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.500> fair<00:03:28.680> winters<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.250> pointy

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
think the fair winters and the pointy

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.580 
think the fair winters and the pointy
crasher<00:03:29.940> do<00:03:30.209> come<00:03:30.570> close<00:03:30.930> together<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.530> I

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
crasher do come close together and I

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.960 
crasher do come close together and I
think<00:03:31.770> they<00:03:31.860> actually<00:03:31.890> do<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.670> same

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
think they actually do have the same

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.750 
think they actually do have the same
range<00:03:33.270> and<00:03:33.540> with<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.590> pie<00:03:34.740> crash<00:03:35.100> are<00:03:35.370> the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
range and with the pie crash are the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.630 
range and with the pie crash are the
reload<00:03:36.180> speed<00:03:36.390> is<00:03:36.540> 29<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.410> only<00:03:38.070> fair<00:03:38.310> winters

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
reload speed is 29 and only fair winters

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.880 
reload speed is 29 and only fair winters
like<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.150> reload<00:03:39.480> speed<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:39.870> at<00:03:40.020> 23<00:03:40.620> so

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
like the reload speed is at 23 so

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.260 
like the reload speed is at 23 so
obviously<00:03:41.310> if<00:03:41.430> you're<00:03:41.490> going<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.700> be<00:03:41.790> reloaded

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
obviously if you're going to be reloaded

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.210 
obviously if you're going to be reloaded
there<00:03:42.420> isn't<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.690> lot<00:03:42.840> green<00:03:43.170> ammo<00:03:43.470> in<00:03:43.680> crucible

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
there isn't a lot green ammo in crucible

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.830 
there isn't a lot green ammo in crucible
or<00:03:44.250> special<00:03:44.670> armor<00:03:44.760> in<00:03:44.940> crucible<00:03:45.330> anymore<00:03:45.720> so

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
or special armor in crucible anymore so

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.150 
or special armor in crucible anymore so
you<00:03:45.930> don't<00:03:46.050> really<00:03:46.140> need<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.470> reload<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:46.830> lot

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
you don't really need to reload a lot

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.949 
you don't really need to reload a lot
but<00:03:47.700> if<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.880> do<00:03:48.000> need<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.240> reload<00:03:48.510> in<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.750> sticky

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
but if you do need to reload in a sticky

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.290 
but if you do need to reload in a sticky
situation<00:03:49.100> then<00:03:50.100> party<00:03:50.459> crasher<00:03:50.850> is<00:03:51.000> going<00:03:51.240> to

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
situation then party crasher is going to

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.810 
situation then party crasher is going to
be<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.570> better<00:03:51.840> option<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:53.010> terms<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:53.580> so

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
be the better option in terms of that so

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.820 
be the better option in terms of that so
I'm<00:03:54.150> going<00:03:54.330> to<00:03:54.360> an<00:03:54.480> image<00:03:54.720> on<00:03:54.840> screen<00:03:55.020> of<00:03:55.380> my

fair winters like just has a little bit

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.500 
fair winters like just has a little bit
more<00:04:05.100> impact<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:05.730> that<00:04:05.760> is<00:04:06.060> pretty<00:04:06.270> much<00:04:06.390> it

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
more impact and that is pretty much it

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.150 
more impact and that is pretty much it
but<00:04:06.660> that<00:04:06.930> has<00:04:07.110> been<00:04:07.380> pretty<00:04:07.590> much<00:04:07.770> it<00:04:07.980> in

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
but that has been pretty much it in

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.740 
but that has been pretty much it in
