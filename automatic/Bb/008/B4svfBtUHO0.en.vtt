00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
alright last night I was playing with

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.680 
alright last night I was playing with
the<00:00:06.120> new<00:00:07.109> exhaust<00:00:08.330> to<00:00:09.330> put<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.139> on<00:00:11.420> this<00:00:12.420> right

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
the new exhaust to put it on this right

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.910 
the new exhaust to put it on this right
here<00:00:13.280> the<00:00:14.280> cat<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.379> midpipe<00:00:16.379> or<00:00:16.680> whatever

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
here the cat and the midpipe or whatever

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.189 
here the cat and the midpipe or whatever
you<00:00:17.010> want<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.190> call<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.400> but<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.449> was<00:00:18.600> looking<00:00:19.020> in

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
you want to call it but I was looking in

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.590 
you want to call it but I was looking in
the<00:00:20.010> hole<00:00:20.240> from<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> axle<00:00:21.900> back<00:00:22.109> exhaust

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
the hole from the axle back exhaust

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.089 
the hole from the axle back exhaust
that's<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.720> only<00:00:24.930> place<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.410> unbolt<00:00:25.830> it

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
that's the only place you can unbolt it

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.300 
that's the only place you can unbolt it
other<00:00:26.609> than<00:00:27.029> from<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.539> header<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> need

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
other than from the header so I need

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.049 
other than from the header so I need
that<00:00:29.490> s<00:00:29.789> pipe<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.359> order<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.840> be<00:00:31.019> able<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.349> run

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
that s pipe in order to be able to run

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.639 
that s pipe in order to be able to run
this<00:00:33.059> full<00:00:33.329> exhaust<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> don't<00:00:34.559> even

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
this full exhaust and then I don't even

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.130 
this full exhaust and then I don't even
know<00:00:34.890> if<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.130> S<00:00:35.280> pipe<00:00:35.610> will<00:00:35.850> bolt<00:00:36.149> up<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
know if the S pipe will bolt up to the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.110 
know if the S pipe will bolt up to the
stock<00:00:37.410> header<00:00:37.710> because<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.790> probably

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
stock header because it's probably

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.380 
stock header because it's probably
flanged<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.410> these<00:00:40.770> aren't<00:00:41.040> flanged<00:00:41.790> they're

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
flanged and these aren't flanged they're

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.930 
flanged and these aren't flanged they're
just<00:00:42.690> flat<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:46.160> that's<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> problem<00:00:47.610> i<00:00:47.820> was

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
just flat and that's the problem i was

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.790 
just flat and that's the problem i was
running<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.809> when<00:00:49.110> i<00:00:49.200> was<00:00:49.350> trying<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
running in with when i was trying to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.990 
running in with when i was trying to
hook<00:00:50.010> up<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.899> exhaust<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:53.000> stock

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
hook up the exhaust this is the stock

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.619 
hook up the exhaust this is the stock
exhaust<00:00:54.239> right<00:00:54.899> there<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:56.030> this<00:00:57.030> part<00:00:57.420> is

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
exhaust right there and this part is

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.810 
exhaust right there and this part is
flanged<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.800> could<00:00:58.980> see<00:00:59.280> how<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.359> sinks<00:01:00.809> in

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
flanged if you could see how it sinks in

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.990 
flanged if you could see how it sinks in
because<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.969> other<00:01:03.120> part<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:05.000> attaches

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
because the other part that it attaches

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.690 
because the other part that it attaches
to<00:01:06.830> flanges<00:01:07.830> out<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:09.229> then<00:01:10.229> i<00:01:10.710> had<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.189> go<00:01:11.400> buy

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
to flanges out and then i had to go buy

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.940 
to flanges out and then i had to go buy
some<00:01:12.140> some<00:01:13.140> nut<00:01:14.360> funny<00:01:15.360> funny<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.229> because

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
some some nut funny funny but because

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.999 
some some nut funny funny but because
these<00:01:17.130> ones<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.520> welded<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.560> exhaust

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
these ones are welded on to the exhaust

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.170 
these ones are welded on to the exhaust
or<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.650> and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.790 

well<00:01:25.840> I<00:01:26.340> got<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:27.520> on<00:01:27.670> but<00:01:28.510> I<00:01:28.840> have<00:01:29.260> an<00:01:29.380> exhaust

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
well I got it on but I have an exhaust

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.380 
well I got it on but I have an exhaust
leak<00:01:30.930> small<00:01:31.930> one

give<00:04:37.870> you<00:04:37.990> an<00:04:38.110> idea<00:04:38.200> of<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.560> RPMs

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:57.969 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.629 

yeah<00:04:58.969> that's<00:04:59.719> it<00:04:59.990> oh<00:05:00.169> no<00:05:00.559> I<00:05:00.830> might<00:05:01.189> just<00:05:01.430> take

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
yeah that's it oh no I might just take

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.420 
yeah that's it oh no I might just take
it<00:05:01.849> off<00:05:02.259> there's<00:05:03.259> a<00:05:03.379> pain<00:05:03.620> in<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.770> ass<00:05:03.979> to<00:05:04.009> put

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
it off there's a pain in the ass to put

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.329 
it off there's a pain in the ass to put
it<00:05:04.520> on<00:05:05.349> but<00:05:06.349> um<00:05:08.349> yeah<00:05:09.349> I'm<00:05:09.770> thinking<00:05:10.129> I<00:05:10.189> might

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:10.339 
it on but um yeah I'm thinking I might

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.129

just<00:05:10.580> take<00:05:10.669> it<00:05:10.999> off<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:11.180> put<00:05:11.449> the<00:05:11.659> stock<00:05:11.930> one

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
just take it off and put the stock one

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.329 
just take it off and put the stock one
back<00:05:12.349> on<00:05:13.900> maybe<00:05:14.900> get<00:05:15.139> a<00:05:15.169> different<00:05:15.469> axle<00:05:16.129> back

00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:16.339 
back on maybe get a different axle back

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:20.159 
back on maybe get a different axle back
and<00:05:16.639> just<00:05:16.819> run<00:05:17.089> just<00:05:17.389> our<00:05:17.659> axle<00:05:18.379> back<00:05:18.589> exhaust

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
and just run just our axle back exhaust

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.900 
and just run just our axle back exhaust
