 Today I will tell you how to make a twig 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.610
 lilac sugar mastic without using 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.250
 for this no extra fixtures 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.160
 for making sprigs of lilac to us 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.600
 need the following ingredients we 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.720
 we will use sugar mastic 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.359
 flower two colors 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.269
 light lilac and dark we will 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.029
 use wire floss which 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.540
 used for floristics 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:37.489
 pliers ordinary scissors and such 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.200
 mastic tools 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:48.270
 cut into pieces floristic 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:50.090
 wire into small pieces somewhere 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.969
 two and a half centimeters 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.180
 so that our flowers are well kept on 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.920
 we twist the wire and the edge with nippers and 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.399
 we press to get this 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.890

 mastic carefully stretch your hands to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.330

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.330
 a small piece and roll it so 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.570
 pro blowed rem kolkhas 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.570
 like this 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.990
 and the resulting roller cut with scissors on 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:29.770
 small pieces never so they 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.960
 we were the same as lilac flowers 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.450
 they may be completely different all to 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:40.390
 size on every bit immediately 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.780
 turn in a circle and then give it to him 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.120
 cone like this every 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.270
 cone 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:53.290
 we cut from the wide part with scissors 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:57.310
 first in half and then each part 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:01.600
 four more noses get four 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:06.580
 petals like this with the tool 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.660
 for mastic reveal petals just 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.930
 how to dress a flower on the instrument and 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.360
 shoot this is what happens on soft

 match using kruglikova tap dance 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:24.459
 small diameter pull each 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.920
 petal of our flower neatly 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.950
 slowly press down 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.480
 draw a little give and we 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.310
 it turns out that there is such a flower of settlements and 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.530
 now every flower we dress on our 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.610
 prearranged wire 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.610
 pierces the center of a flower inside 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.459
 so we stretch the column 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:53.340
 so that it is not visible is going to 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:57.459
 this medium inflorescence of arbitrary shape 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.400
 connect them for three to five things and 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.320
 twist twist using three 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.819
 ribbons

 and prepared inflorescence collect sprig 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.879
 likewise random order 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.030
 we collect and twist with the help so 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.250
 a little bit 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:42.129
 smoothing and collecting in the same way 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:45.469
