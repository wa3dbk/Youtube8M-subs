00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
now you can shuffle the deck by riffle

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.930 
now you can shuffle the deck by riffle
shuffle<00:04:28.620> for<00:04:29.130> example<00:04:29.790> and<00:04:31.460> it's<00:04:32.460> only<00:04:32.729> you

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
shuffle for example and it's only you

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.080 
shuffle for example and it's only you
have<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.390> look<00:04:33.690> that<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:36.050> packet<00:04:37.050> over<00:04:38.090> the

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
have to look that the packet over the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.530 
have to look that the packet over the
last<00:04:39.330> time<00:04:39.630> I'm<00:04:39.960> not<00:04:40.700> disturbed<00:04:41.700> so<00:04:42.360> it's

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
last time I'm not disturbed so it's

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.490 
last time I'm not disturbed so it's
really<00:04:43.080> simple<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:44.070> simply<00:04:44.960> start<00:04:45.960> shuffling

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
really simple you simply start shuffling

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.830 
really simple you simply start shuffling
by<00:04:47.130> the<00:04:47.190> middle<00:04:47.640> and<00:04:49.520> everything<00:04:50.520> looks<00:04:51.360> fair

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
by the middle and everything looks fair

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.190 
by the middle and everything looks fair
to<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.350> spectator<00:04:52.890> if<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:54.240> like<00:04:54.510> you<00:04:54.750> can<00:04:54.990> do

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
to the spectator if you like you can do

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.810 
to the spectator if you like you can do
false<00:04:55.979> cut<00:04:57.350> for<00:04:58.350> example<00:04:58.380> there's<00:04:59.130> a<00:04:59.340> really

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
false cut for example there's a really

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.240 
false cut for example there's a really
simple<00:05:00.090> false<00:05:00.630> card<00:05:00.960> it's<00:05:01.380> it's<00:05:01.740> called<00:05:01.979> the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
simple false card it's it's called the

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.060 
simple false card it's it's called the
swing<00:05:02.550> cut<00:05:02.850> you<00:05:04.340> have<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:06.410> deck<00:05:07.410> in<00:05:07.650> this

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
swing cut you have the deck in this

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.890 
swing cut you have the deck in this
position<00:05:08.700> and<00:05:08.940> with<00:05:09.810> you

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.100 

index<00:05:14.900> finger<00:05:15.170> you<00:05:15.560> put<00:05:15.590> a<00:05:16.330> half<00:05:17.330> of<00:05:17.630> the<00:05:17.840> deck

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
index finger you put a half of the deck

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.320 
index finger you put a half of the deck
into<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:19.430> left<00:05:20.120> hand<00:05:20.830> do<00:05:21.830> this<00:05:22.130> move<00:05:22.430> like

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
into the left hand do this move like

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.760 
into the left hand do this move like
this<00:05:23.600> but<00:05:24.110> this<00:05:24.290> um<00:05:26.680> you<00:05:27.680> have<00:05:27.950> a<00:05:28.220> false<00:05:28.820> cut

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
this but this um you have a false cut

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.940 
this but this um you have a false cut
it's<00:05:30.770> looks<00:05:31.100> simple<00:05:31.640> but<00:05:32.200> check<00:05:33.200> it<00:05:33.320> out<00:05:33.470> the

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
it's looks simple but check it out the

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.580 
it's looks simple but check it out the
spectator<00:05:34.520> will<00:05:35.150> not<00:05:35.330> be<00:05:35.570> aware<00:05:35.840> that<00:05:36.140> it

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
spectator will not be aware that it

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.040 
spectator will not be aware that it
wasn't<00:05:37.070> a<00:05:37.480> real<00:05:38.480> cut<00:05:38.900> so<00:05:39.470> now<00:05:39.770> you<00:05:40.760> are<00:05:40.820> in<00:05:40.970> the

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
wasn't a real cut so now you are in the

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.640 
wasn't a real cut so now you are in the
position<00:05:42.050> as<00:05:42.860> before<00:05:43.220> and<00:05:43.760> a<00:05:44.540> spectator<00:05:45.230> can

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
position as before and a spectator can

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.150 
position as before and a spectator can
free<00:05:46.220> selected<00:05:46.850> one<00:05:47.270> card<00:05:47.630> for<00:05:48.140> example<00:05:48.290> this

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
free selected one card for example this

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.670 
free selected one card for example this
one<00:05:49.460> and<00:05:50.590> you<00:05:51.590> simply<00:05:52.160> cut<00:05:52.820> the<00:05:53.090> deck<00:05:53.500> put<00:05:54.500> it

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
on top and then put the cover the rest

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:06.030 
on top and then put the cover the rest
of<00:05:59.390> the<00:05:59.540> deck<00:06:00.310> on<00:06:01.310> top<00:06:01.760> so<00:06:03.580> everything<00:06:04.580> is<00:06:04.730> done

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
of the deck on top so everything is done

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.700 
of the deck on top so everything is done
