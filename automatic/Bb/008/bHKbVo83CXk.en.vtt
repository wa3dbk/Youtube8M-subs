00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
combos to it I figured out in about an

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.970 
combos to it I figured out in about an
hour<00:00:05.640> so<00:00:05.819> playing<00:00:06.509> here's<00:00:06.779> one<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.500> uses<00:00:07.740> the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
hour so playing here's one that uses the

hour so playing here's one that uses the
self-destruct<00:00:08.809> doesn't<00:00:09.809> have<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.929> be<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
self-destruct doesn't have to be in the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.610 
self-destruct doesn't have to be in the
corner<00:00:10.620> but<00:00:11.480> just<00:00:12.480> for<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.630> last<00:00:12.900> part<00:00:13.200> really

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620
