00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.270
 the first time that those good videos

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.470
 the school good talk asked me and 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.660
 I thought it would be like a super mania of 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.430
 explain them rather is that you already know 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.350
 everything I tell you is about things 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.030
 that I know why it was not a video 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.219
 about something that I have no idea and I do not know if 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.139
 it's really going to work for them so 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.780
 forgive my and in many of my videos 

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:43.819

 that can really help them then 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:51.580
 Today I'm going to tell you how at least I 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.580
 like what do I believe to do 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.860
 a good attitude of the school thing 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.530
 number one when I do not feel like going to 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.989
 the school always think the week is 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.360
 will happen very fast to you for more than 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.280
 want to negotiate school thinks that already 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.250

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.050
 is going to help things number 2 I'm sex 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.880
 you spend the best days or hours 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.800
 faster but sometimes it happens 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.780
 a lot slower than you think what 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.640
 important that you have to go out in 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.350
 the school for example if they leave the 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.270
 school you have an appointment with your test 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.160
 that motivates you from feeling that when you 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.960
 finish this you are going to have an appointment with your 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.750
 car or anything that really gets you 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.210

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.870

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.690

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.610
 all that every day renew yourself in the improvement 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.700
 when you get up and remove everything 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.620

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.110

 for myself I say I become half 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.740
 presentable but I do not get in the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.960
 mirror to think 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.270
 Kim Jong a government that does not arise 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.400
 so I recommend you do that 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.460

 number that I go that I think it is 4 does not 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.350
 be afraid to express yourself and be yourself 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.720
 if someone is saying something and you are not 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.060
 you agree express your opinion but 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.760
 do it in a kind way what he told me 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.280
 my dad always say I think that for 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.460
 that you can more or less express your point 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.340
 people do not feel thing 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.530
 do not let yourself be influenced by people if 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.880
 you put on an applique for yourself you say 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.100
 that you look like a supermodel 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.390
 take it do not let the comments 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.800
 of people affect you 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.790
 biden through profits that 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.350
 comments from people are 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.600
 belonging to beings that you look bad is 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.250
 I do not like it here, although it sounds very 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.170
 selfish you have to focus on yourself 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.540
 same if you want to have an attitude 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.340
 good but the class I'm sorry but the 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.530

 know mom or anything but for you to 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.730
 feel at ease is what I always 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.410
 I say things you do for yourself 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.420
 always to do things for you 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.460

 the most happens for other things number 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.230
 five for two things number six that I 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.690
 I do is to carry things that I like in my 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.300

 things that you do not like or do not leave 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.569
 to prove what you do not like 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.150

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.580

 that motivate you to have it in attitude is 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.800
 more do it in the short term if I take a day 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.560

 feel comfortable with this type of people 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.889
