00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
gear longer you're going to have a more

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.139 
gear longer you're going to have a more
quick<00:01:16.050> uptake<00:01:16.649> fuel<00:01:17.039> a<00:01:17.369> quicker<00:01:17.700> acceleration

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
quick uptake fuel a quicker acceleration

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.770 
quick uptake fuel a quicker acceleration
of<00:01:18.990> taking<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.680> throttle<00:01:20.130> response<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.970> this

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
of taking in throttle response and this

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.150 
of taking in throttle response and this
vehicle<00:01:22.289> has<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> great<00:01:23.130> sound<00:01:23.610> inside<00:01:24.450> for<00:01:25.080> a

smallest vehicle you can buy really has
a<00:01:33.750> nice<00:01:34.080> sound<00:01:34.440> it<00:01:34.800> makes<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.429> feel<00:01:35.580> like

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
a nice sound it makes you feel like

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.809 
a nice sound it makes you feel like
you've<00:01:35.940> got<00:01:36.090> some<00:01:36.300> power<00:01:36.539> under<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> hood<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
you've got some power under the hood and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.820 
you've got some power under the hood and
I<00:01:38.819> like<00:01:39.179> the<00:01:39.360> way<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.690> sport<00:01:39.959> mode<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
I like the way the sport mode in the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.580 
I like the way the sport mode in the
mountains<00:01:41.250> here<00:01:41.490> really<00:01:41.849> keeps<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.110> gear<00:01:43.410> in

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
mountains here really keeps the gear in

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.469 
mountains here really keeps the gear in
the<00:01:43.740> right<00:01:43.950> range<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> throttle<00:01:45.149> response

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
the right range to the throttle response

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.109 
the right range to the throttle response
so<00:01:46.140> see<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.709> up<00:01:47.069> shifting<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.940> down

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
so see it's up shifting and down

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.080 
so see it's up shifting and down
shifting<00:01:48.720> based<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:50.099> the<00:01:50.700> load

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
shifting based on the load

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.419 
shifting based on the load
on<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> engine<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.439> really<00:01:52.859> like<00:01:53.070> how<00:01:53.250> it's

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
on the engine and I really like how it's

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.010 
on the engine and I really like how it's
doing<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.000> don't<00:01:54.179> even<00:01:54.329> feel<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.899> need

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
doing that I don't even feel that I need

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.620 
doing that I don't even feel that I need
to<00:01:55.229> use<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.130> paddle<00:01:56.460> shifters<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.179> are<00:01:57.329> here

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
to use the paddle shifters that are here

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.480 
to use the paddle shifters that are here
on<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> other<00:01:58.109> side<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.770> wheel<00:01:59.009> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
on the other side of the wheel and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.219 
on the other side of the wheel and
that's<00:01:59.850> kind<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.299> nice<00:02:00.479> feature<00:02:00.509> although

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
