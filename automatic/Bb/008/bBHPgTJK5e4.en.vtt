 hello everyone in the wake of 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.359
 introductions of lucio songs 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.160
 Baptists that I have explained to you so far 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.599
 which I refer you to my youtube channel 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.370
 today I will try to explain you 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.370
 the introduction of a woman for a friend 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.260
 here's how it's done 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.840
 first I love the agreements and then we'll see 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.330
 the rhythmic first chord and mayan king is not 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.800
 that we all know so it's better if 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:47.360
 with key first annular string third 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.370
 second index string button 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.320
 second third string button 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.370
 here is this position we will see that then the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.350
 we will use both this fingering on the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.750
 ground then in seventh position and in 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.769
 fifth position 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.800
 so we said first agreement a 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.900
 network 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:12.290
 second agreement is practically made 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.810
 placing the index to the tenth fret and 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.560
 plays the first and second string while 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:22.330
 the middle to the eleventh key plays the 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.330
 second the third string 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.330
 third agreement we simply move 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.720
 of two back keys or a tone 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.360
 then eighth key with index first and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.030
 second rope helium 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.350
 ninth third string button then the first 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.810
 three agreements are the largest 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.130
 this thing 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.409
 this is it 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.560
 but here follows the same chipping 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:54.630
 of the king in seventh position ie the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.950
 better at the seventh key 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.219
 the ring finger on the eighth key 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.579
 on the seventh key of the third string first 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.579
 four agreements 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.310
 let's go back to king 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.170
 cisco is called with the same as 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:19.349
 chipping in fifth position then 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.799
 the middle to fifth position year the area 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.799
 sixth key of the fifth tax index 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.480
 we see the agreements in sequence 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:46.690
 the next deal we have to get it 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:50.290
 so the third key index first string e 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.760
 according north medium Empty Quarter 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.810
 third button with flattening pippo button 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.810
 fourth string 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.560
 all agreements followed 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.189
 then from what words of the king we have 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.470
 Already seen 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:29.090
 to finish the set on the seventh 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.090
 position and has kidnapped price 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.790
 after 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.390
 the agreement that explained 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.230
 seventh position and here after the 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.870
 the rhythmic the base are hard 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.900
 we just have to make it a little bit more 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:23.840
 so busy as a base you can 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.840
 starting this way on the agreement say 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.280
 pinnate to ternate 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.220
 all paper 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.420
 on the other agreements you can make a penalty 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.420
 alone 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.260
 then 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.169
 return to the king 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.030
 his work following agreement 2 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.030
 pinnate 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:03.430
 an app is born the picking 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:43.389

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:45.870
