00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:11.740
 the bear is back in switzerland now 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.690
 also in nature probably will 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.650
 you never see him 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.460
 The bears are naturally shy 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.560
 nevertheless there is a small one 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.780
 possibility that you have a bear 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.750
 could surprise him because he does not 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.120
 smell or hear you could therefore 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.520
 continue to roam and biking carefree 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.860
 Can or in the mountains for sure 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.760
 On the way you have only the following 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.760
 pay attention to the rules 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:43.530

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.899
 bushes or make noise if no way 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.420
 Passes for your dog always on the 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.420
 leash and did not read are leftovers 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:59.890
 do not provoke a bear show him 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.569
 that you do not want anything from him and do 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.870
 no photos for one either 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:07.630
 snapshot on facebook how to scream 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.450
 Throw stones or pursue the bear 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.290
 the bear feels that as an attack and 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.290
 would fight back 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.770
 in the alps has been in the last 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.049
 decades to not a single one 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.119
 assault registered 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.030
 Nevertheless, a tricky situation can not 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.030
 should be excluded completely 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.640
 Bear snorting or threatening 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.969
 stay calm even come up to you 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.709
 and go back slowly 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.380
 you show the bear that you give it to him 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.599
 do not want to do anything 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.939
 if he attacks anyway, lie down 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.729
 Slowly on the belly and do so 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.939
 Bear in mind that you are not a danger to him 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.739
 bears are then on 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.959
 most sensitive and can be irritated 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:57.179

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:00.329

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:03.450

 habitat show you do not need you 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.250
