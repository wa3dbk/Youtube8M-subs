00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.200
 partitions too and well we're going to 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.440
 be increased on the internet of 3 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.010
 fast let's go look at the features 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.720
 here visuals good here we already have what 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.720
 what is the launcher 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.090
 whatever 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.900
 here so they can open only then 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.590
 launcher as 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:48.690
 and block and maybe very fluid the truth 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.010
 very fluid with the partition script 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.660
 I want to say removed a description 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.910
 here below I will leave you together in link of 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.130
 download and the tutorials how to remove the 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.590
 partition so they do not ask me what 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.090
 when it starts and stays stuck to a 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.860
 white screen with the android logo 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.010
 that's because he has not removed the partition 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.350
 if they do not have the fairy partition and the 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.720
 you have protection to install it 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.820
 normally good I have an internal if 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.390

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.410
 who gave me yesterday a day 0 hours and 3 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.080
 minutes and just at the moment it turned me off 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.390
 the truth is that it is very hernÃ¡n 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.790

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.310

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.290
