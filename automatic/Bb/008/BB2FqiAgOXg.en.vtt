that I've done to the top to go along
with<00:00:18.859> the<00:00:19.039> lighting<00:00:19.550> system<00:00:19.939> that<00:00:19.970> I've<00:00:20.240> used

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
with the lighting system that I've used

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.950 
with the lighting system that I've used
if<00:00:21.320> you've<00:00:21.470> watched<00:00:21.710> my<00:00:21.859> previous<00:00:22.070> videos<00:00:22.960> and

you're interested in going with that

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.710 
you're interested in going with that
lighting<00:00:25.669> system<00:00:26.089> this<00:00:26.210> will<00:00:26.359> show<00:00:26.539> you<00:00:26.599> how

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
lighting system this will show you how

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.829 
lighting system this will show you how
to<00:00:26.810> modify<00:00:27.140> the<00:00:27.320> top<00:00:27.939> as<00:00:28.939> you<00:00:29.240> can<00:00:29.419> see<00:00:29.689> it's

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:29.839 
to modify the top as you can see it's

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.419 
to modify the top as you can see it's
pretty<00:00:30.199> pretty<00:00:30.470> simple<00:00:30.740> if<00:00:31.039> there's<00:00:31.249> not<00:00:31.369> a

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
pretty pretty simple if there's not a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.459 
pretty pretty simple if there's not a
whole<00:00:31.640> lot<00:00:31.849> to<00:00:31.880> it<00:00:32.289> I've<00:00:33.289> come<00:00:33.530> down<00:00:33.670> 7/8<00:00:34.670> and

whole lot to it I've come down 7/8 and
made<00:00:36.469> my<00:00:36.620> mark<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:37.850> then<00:00:38.449> I've<00:00:38.570> come<00:00:38.750> over<00:00:39.550> 3

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
made my mark and then I've come over 3

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.380 
made my mark and then I've come over 3
and<00:00:40.730> 1/8<00:00:41.410> and<00:00:42.410> made<00:00:42.680> my<00:00:42.859> mark<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:43.399> that's<00:00:43.760> what

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
and 1/8 and made my mark and that's what

I<00:00:44.420> went<00:00:44.719> with<00:00:44.870> all<00:00:45.109> the<00:00:45.230> way<00:00:45.350> around<00:00:45.649> to<00:00:47.050> cut

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
I went with all the way around to cut

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.840 
I went with all the way around to cut
out<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:48.320> front<00:00:48.469> of<00:00:48.710> it<00:00:49.660> then<00:00:50.660> on<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:50.930> back

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
out the front of it then on the back

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.810 
out the front of it then on the back
I've<00:00:52.850> came<00:00:53.120> across<00:00:53.390> two<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:53.989> quarter<00:00:57.820> and

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
I've came across two and a quarter and

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.799 
I've came across two and a quarter and
I've<00:00:58.940> come<00:00:59.149> down<00:00:59.179> two<00:01:00.129> inches<00:01:01.390> for<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.480> center

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
I've come down two inches for the center

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.200 
I've come down two inches for the center
of<00:01:02.929> my<00:01:03.079> hole

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
of my hole

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.010 
of my hole
and<00:01:05.449> I<00:01:06.200> actually<00:01:06.410> cut<00:01:06.740> out<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:06.890> hole<00:01:07.810> that<00:01:08.810> was

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
and I actually cut out the hole that was

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.160 
and I actually cut out the hole that was
big<00:01:09.350> enough<00:01:09.380> for<00:01:09.920> one<00:01:10.370> of<00:01:10.400> these<00:01:11.170> computer

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
big enough for one of these computer

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.130 
big enough for one of these computer
things<00:01:12.410> that<00:01:12.560> they<00:01:12.650> use<00:01:12.800> for<00:01:13.010> desks<00:01:13.990> this<00:01:14.990> is

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
things that they use for desks this is

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.890 
things that they use for desks this is
about<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.440> size<00:01:15.650> of<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:15.890> 50-cent<00:01:16.430> piece<00:01:16.900> so

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
about the size of a 50-cent piece so

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.150 
about the size of a 50-cent piece so
when<00:01:18.080> you<00:01:18.170> get<00:01:18.380> yours<00:01:18.620> you'll<00:01:18.890> have<00:01:19.040> to

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
when you get yours you'll have to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.340 
when you get yours you'll have to
measure<00:01:19.430> how<00:01:20.330> much<00:01:20.479> you<00:01:20.630> need<00:01:20.780> I<00:01:20.810> can't<00:01:21.200> give

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
measure how much you need I can't give

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.510 
measure how much you need I can't give
you<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:22.370> cut<00:01:23.200> for<00:01:24.200> mine<00:01:24.410> because<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:24.950> guys<00:01:25.310> may

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
you a cut for mine because you guys may

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.670 
you a cut for mine because you guys may
use<00:01:25.790> something<00:01:26.150> different<00:01:26.410> than<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:27.500> actual

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
use something different than the actual

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.670 
use something different than the actual
size<00:01:28.040> that<00:01:28.310> I've<00:01:28.400> went<00:01:28.640> with<00:01:29.320> so<00:01:30.320> basically

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
size that I've went with so basically

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.160 
size that I've went with so basically
you<00:01:30.920> have<00:01:31.070> to<00:01:31.160> cut<00:01:31.580> a<00:01:31.610> line<00:01:31.850> down<00:01:32.090> that'll<00:01:33.080> be

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
you have to cut a line down that'll be

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.530 
you have to cut a line down that'll be
used<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.680> get<00:01:34.070> your<00:01:34.250> wires<00:01:34.460> into<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:34.940> hole<00:01:35.210> and

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
used to get your wires into the hole and

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.600 
used to get your wires into the hole and
you'll<00:01:36.410> put<00:01:36.680> your<00:01:37.520> computer<00:01:37.910> clip<00:01:39.430> right<00:01:40.430> in

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
you'll put your computer clip right in

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.400 
you'll put your computer clip right in
there<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.090> it<00:01:41.630> looks<00:01:41.899> like<00:01:41.990> it's<00:01:42.259> almost

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
there and it looks like it's almost

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.170 
there and it looks like it's almost
factory<00:01:43.210> so<00:01:44.210> that's<00:01:44.360> all<00:01:44.509> I<00:01:44.540> did<00:01:44.660> for<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.020> hole

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
factory so that's all I did for the hole

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.870 
factory so that's all I did for the hole
and<00:01:47.180> once<00:01:47.330> you<00:01:47.420> get<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.660> wires<00:01:47.869> in<00:01:48.229> there<00:01:48.880> the

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
and once you get the wires in there the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.520 
and once you get the wires in there the
lighting<00:01:50.240> system<00:01:50.479> will<00:01:50.810> actually<00:01:50.960> sit<00:01:51.410> up

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
lighting system will actually sit up

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.800 
lighting system will actually sit up
here<00:01:51.830> like<00:01:52.790> this<00:01:54.460> right<00:01:55.460> in<00:01:55.490> that<00:01:55.700> that<00:01:56.330> K<00:01:56.600> that

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
here like this right in that that K that

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.330 
here like this right in that that K that
you<00:01:56.930> cut<00:01:57.110> out<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.680> reason<00:01:57.979> why<00:01:58.070> I<00:01:58.100> went

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
you cut out and the reason why I went

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.639 
you cut out and the reason why I went
this<00:01:58.520> high<00:01:58.550> is<00:01:59.149> you'll<00:01:59.960> notice<00:02:00.229> on<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.470> back

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
this high is you'll notice on the back

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.730 
this high is you'll notice on the back
it's<00:02:00.860> real<00:02:01.070> easy<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.960> turn<00:02:02.960> on<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.200> off<00:02:03.440> your

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
it's real easy to turn on and off your

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.760 
it's real easy to turn on and off your
light<00:02:04.509> without<00:02:05.509> hitting<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.110> grade<00:02:06.380> because

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
light without hitting the grade because

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.139 
light without hitting the grade because
if<00:02:07.009> you<00:02:07.100> have<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:07.250> too<00:02:07.490> low<00:02:07.729> you'll<00:02:08.030> be

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
if you have it too low you'll be

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.210 
if you have it too low you'll be
sticking<00:02:08.539> your<00:02:08.600> finger<00:02:08.929> down<00:02:09.050> in<00:02:09.290> here<00:02:09.530> trying

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
sticking your finger down in here trying

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.229 
sticking your finger down in here trying
to<00:02:10.280> turn<00:02:10.459> off<00:02:10.580> your<00:02:10.700> light<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.030> having<00:02:11.180> to

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
to turn off your light and having to

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.520 
to turn off your light and having to
move<00:02:11.330> your<00:02:11.510> lighting<00:02:11.750> system<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.200> didn't<00:02:12.410> like

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
move your lighting system I didn't like

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.860 
move your lighting system I didn't like
it<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:13.670> other<00:02:13.700> thing<00:02:13.880> I<00:02:14.120> liked<00:02:14.330> about<00:02:14.360> going

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
it the other thing I liked about going

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.720 
it the other thing I liked about going
with<00:02:15.049> this<00:02:15.260> is<00:02:15.560> it's<00:02:15.799> easy<00:02:15.950> for<00:02:16.190> me<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.310> flip<00:02:16.549> my

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
with this is it's easy for me to flip my

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.390 
with this is it's easy for me to flip my
light<00:02:16.910> off<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:18.200> be<00:02:18.410> able<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.709> feed<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.130> tank

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
light off and be able to feed the tank

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.880 
light off and be able to feed the tank
or<00:02:19.640> do<00:02:20.090> small<00:02:20.720> little<00:02:20.750> adjustments<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.799> the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
or do small little adjustments to the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.100 
or do small little adjustments to the
filtration<00:02:22.190> system<00:02:22.459> if<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:23.030> have<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.450> without

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
filtration system if I have to without

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.300 
filtration system if I have to without
taking<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.500> top<00:02:24.680> off<00:02:24.890> anymore<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:28.130> right

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
taking the top off anymore so that right

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.759 
taking the top off anymore so that right
there<00:02:28.549> I'll<00:02:28.700> get<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.239> guys<00:02:29.390> started<00:02:29.769> the

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
you see as far as wires go so I'm a very

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.370 
you see as far as wires go so I'm a very
very<00:02:37.040> clean<00:02:37.340> install<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.900> lighting<00:02:39.200> system

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
very clean install the lighting system

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.780 
very clean install the lighting system
works<00:02:39.739> really<00:02:40.010> really<00:02:40.130> well<00:02:42.459> go<00:02:43.459> ahead<00:02:43.489> and

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
works really really well go ahead and

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.400 
works really really well go ahead and
put<00:02:43.940> this<00:02:44.030> back<00:02:44.239> together<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.900> show<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.170> what

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
put this back together and show you what

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.880 
put this back together and show you what
it<00:02:45.500> looks<00:02:45.650> like<00:02:45.799> all<00:02:46.130> back<00:02:46.459> together<00:02:47.709> ok<00:02:48.709> guys

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
it looks like all back together ok guys

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.490 
it looks like all back together ok guys
here<00:02:49.190> we<00:02:49.310> are<00:02:49.340> with<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.850> back<00:02:50.720> on<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:50.989> aquarium

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
here we are with it back on the aquarium

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.190 
here we are with it back on the aquarium
and<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.680> just<00:02:51.890> wanted<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.220> show<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.959> wires

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
and I just wanted to show you the wires

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.680 
and I just wanted to show you the wires
and<00:02:54.590> what<00:02:54.739> it<00:02:54.860> looks<00:02:54.980> like<00:02:55.299> with<00:02:56.299> it<00:02:56.420> on<00:02:56.540> the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
and what it looks like with it on the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.680 
and what it looks like with it on the
tank<00:02:57.220> as<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.549> can<00:02:58.700> see<00:02:58.910> you<00:02:59.239> have<00:02:59.420> been<00:02:59.660> a

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
tank as you can see you have been a

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.160 
tank as you can see you have been a
gotten<00:03:00.620> rid<00:03:00.799> of<00:03:00.829> the<00:03:01.220> black<00:03:01.459> part<00:03:01.820> of<00:03:02.060> your<00:03:02.269> top

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
gotten rid of the black part of your top

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.650 
gotten rid of the black part of your top
so<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.650> still<00:03:03.950> covers<00:03:04.549> about<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.060> same<00:03:05.269> space

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
so it still covers about the same space

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.509 
so it still covers about the same space
the<00:03:05.989> only<00:03:06.049> difference<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:06.980> light<00:03:07.190> does

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
the only difference is the light does

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.030 
the only difference is the light does
overhang<00:03:08.209> a<00:03:08.360> little<00:03:08.600> bit<00:03:08.810> but<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.709> does<00:03:09.890> not

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
overhang a little bit but it does not

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.100 
overhang a little bit but it does not
take<00:03:10.340> up<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.670> viewing<00:03:11.090> area<00:03:11.420> for<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.870> see

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
take up the viewing area for you to see

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.710 
take up the viewing area for you to see
it<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:13.310> actually<00:03:13.489> looks<00:03:13.940> like<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.329> light

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
it and it actually looks like the light

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.289 
it and it actually looks like the light
was<00:03:15.049> made<00:03:15.079> to<00:03:15.680> go<00:03:15.829> on<00:03:16.040> this<00:03:16.280> system<00:03:16.850> that's<00:03:17.060> why

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
was made to go on this system that's why

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.159 
was made to go on this system that's why
we<00:03:17.450> really<00:03:17.810> really<00:03:18.079> like<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:19.810> it's<00:03:20.810> just<00:03:21.019> got

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
we really really like it it's just got

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.780 
we really really like it it's just got
the<00:03:21.290> two<00:03:21.440> wires<00:03:21.709> that<00:03:21.829> come<00:03:22.130> out<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.400> back<00:03:22.579> and

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
the two wires that come out the back and

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.699 
the two wires that come out the back and
go<00:03:23.180> directly<00:03:23.660> into<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.230> hole<00:03:24.410> with<00:03:24.560> the

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
go directly into the hole with the

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.500 
go directly into the hole with the
little<00:03:24.919> cap<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.549> just<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:26.000> absolutely

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
little cap and it just it absolutely

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.470 
little cap and it just it absolutely
looks<00:03:26.720> really<00:03:27.049> really<00:03:27.320> clean<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:29.180> lighting

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
looks really really clean the lighting

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.390 
looks really really clean the lighting
systems<00:03:29.870> working<00:03:30.109> for<00:03:30.440> us<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.829> seems<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:31.310> be

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
systems working for us it seems to be

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.940 
systems working for us it seems to be
producing<00:03:31.910> enough<00:03:32.209> light<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:33.230> I'll<00:03:33.650> go<00:03:33.769> back

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
producing enough light and I'll go back

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.800 
producing enough light and I'll go back
here<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.519> front<00:03:34.850> see<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.209> guys<00:03:35.359> can<00:03:35.600> see

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
here to the front see you guys can see

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.370 
here to the front see you guys can see
this<00:03:35.989> once<00:03:36.230> again<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.769> mean<00:03:37.730> just<00:03:38.000> just<00:03:38.989> look<00:03:39.199> at

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
this once again I mean just just look at

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.220 
this once again I mean just just look at
the<00:03:39.500> color<00:03:40.150> that<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.299> puts<00:03:41.540> off<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:41.930> tank

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
the color that it puts off in a tank

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.379 
the color that it puts off in a tank
just<00:03:42.470> absolutely<00:03:43.100> crystal-clear<00:03:43.639> you<00:03:44.209> don't

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
just absolutely crystal-clear you don't

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.319 
just absolutely crystal-clear you don't
see<00:03:44.600> any<00:03:44.810> shadows<00:03:45.430> from<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.579> live<00:03:46.790> rock<00:03:47.090> which

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
see any shadows from the live rock which

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.909 
see any shadows from the live rock which
is<00:03:47.359> very<00:03:47.660> very<00:03:47.870> important<00:03:48.380> to<00:03:48.410> me<00:03:48.590> because<00:03:48.709> I

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
is very very important to me because I

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.740 
is very very important to me because I
want<00:03:49.100> all<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.370> live<00:03:49.549> rock<00:03:49.820> to<00:03:50.000> be<00:03:50.120> lit<00:03:50.299> up<00:03:50.449> and

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
want all the live rock to be lit up and

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.949 
want all the live rock to be lit up and
it<00:03:51.500> just<00:03:51.769> you<00:03:52.070> can<00:03:52.250> see<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:52.820> blue<00:03:53.209> almost<00:03:53.630> on

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
it just you can see the blue almost on

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.780 
it just you can see the blue almost on
the<00:03:54.049> edges<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.739> tank<00:03:54.949> just<00:03:55.340> look<00:03:55.549> at<00:03:55.669> the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
the edges of the tank just look at the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.180 
the edges of the tank just look at the
blue<00:03:56.120> that<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.609> LEDs<00:03:58.690> are<00:03:59.690> lighting<00:04:00.109> up<00:04:00.260> those

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
blue that the LEDs are lighting up those

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.550 
blue that the LEDs are lighting up those
are<00:04:01.400> actually<00:04:01.790> try<00:04:02.180> LEDs<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:03.109> you're<00:04:03.260> getting

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
are actually try LEDs so you're getting

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.860 
are actually try LEDs so you're getting
six<00:04:03.949> LEDs<00:04:04.579> that<00:04:04.880> have<00:04:05.090> three<00:04:05.540> LEDs<00:04:06.230> per<00:04:06.889> LED<00:04:07.870> so

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
six LEDs that have three LEDs per LED so

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.110 
six LEDs that have three LEDs per LED so
you're<00:04:09.169> getting<00:04:09.530> a<00:04:09.709> lot<00:04:10.010> of<00:04:10.250> a<00:04:10.430> tenant<00:04:10.820> blue

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
you're getting a lot of a tenant blue

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.650 
you're getting a lot of a tenant blue
out<00:04:11.810> of<00:04:12.109> that<00:04:12.440> lighting<00:04:12.799> system<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.519> I<00:04:14.299> just

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
out of that lighting system and I just

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.420 
out of that lighting system and I just
think<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:14.900> guys<00:04:15.019> won't<00:04:15.320> go<00:04:15.470> wrong<00:04:15.739> it

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
think you guys won't go wrong it

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.210 
think you guys won't go wrong it
definitely<00:04:17.299> looks<00:04:17.480> like<00:04:17.540> a<00:04:17.799> lighting<00:04:18.799> system

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
definitely looks like a lighting system

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.189 
definitely looks like a lighting system
that<00:04:19.250> was<00:04:19.489> made<00:04:19.699> for<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.090> tank<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.720> I've

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
that was made for the tank and I've

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.990 
that was made for the tank and I've
already<00:04:21.680> gotten<00:04:21.859> a<00:04:22.010> lot<00:04:22.130> of<00:04:22.190> compliments<00:04:22.880> on

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
already gotten a lot of compliments on

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.930 
already gotten a lot of compliments on
it<00:04:23.210> and<00:04:23.410> as<00:04:24.410> far<00:04:24.440> as<00:04:24.740> modifications<00:04:25.699> go<00:04:25.910> I

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
it and as far as modifications go I

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.550 
it and as far as modifications go I
think<00:04:26.150> it's<00:04:26.480> definitely<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:27.020> cleanest<00:04:27.410> that

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
think it's definitely the cleanest that

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.610 
think it's definitely the cleanest that
I've<00:04:27.680> been<00:04:27.800> able<00:04:27.949> to<00:04:28.100> find<00:04:28.400> out<00:04:28.610> there<00:04:29.620> so

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
I've been able to find out there so

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.170 
I've been able to find out there so

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
please rate and comment let me know what

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.820 
please rate and comment let me know what
you<00:04:32.419> think<00:04:32.600> if<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:33.020> have<00:04:33.169> a<00:04:33.199> different<00:04:33.620> way<00:04:33.800> of

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
you think if you have a different way of

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.159 
you think if you have a different way of
doing<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.550> lighting<00:04:35.240> system<00:04:35.419> on<00:04:35.750> here<00:04:35.960> that's

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
doing a lighting system on here that's

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.870 
doing a lighting system on here that's
even<00:04:36.470> cleaner<00:04:36.770> than<00:04:36.860> this<00:04:37.280> I<00:04:37.580> would<00:04:37.760> be

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
even cleaner than this I would be

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.810 
even cleaner than this I would be
interesting<00:04:38.510> and<00:04:38.660> knowing<00:04:39.310> as<00:04:40.310> far<00:04:40.550> as<00:04:40.669> that

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
interesting and knowing as far as that

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.140 
interesting and knowing as far as that
goes<00:04:40.880> this<00:04:41.419> is<00:04:41.630> about<00:04:41.960> a<00:04:41.990> $50<00:04:42.590> light<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.639> LED

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
goes this is about a $50 light the LED

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.870 
goes this is about a $50 light the LED
is<00:04:44.419> probably<00:04:44.870> about<00:04:45.410> nine<00:04:45.889> ten<00:04:46.280> bucks<00:04:46.550> then

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
is probably about nine ten bucks then

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.129 
is probably about nine ten bucks then
you're<00:04:47.000> gonna<00:04:47.120> have<00:04:47.360> about<00:04:47.660> twenty<00:04:48.020> dollars

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
you're gonna have about twenty dollars

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.860 
you're gonna have about twenty dollars
for<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.590> adaptor<00:04:49.190> and<00:04:49.460> another<00:04:50.360> two<00:04:50.690> or<00:04:50.720> three

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
for the adaptor and another two or three

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.260 
for the adaptor and another two or three
dollars<00:04:51.500> for<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:52.370> connector<00:04:52.850> piece<00:04:53.030> to

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
dollars for the connector piece to

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.230 
dollars for the connector piece to
connect<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.810> lighting<00:04:54.169> to<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.380> adapter<00:04:55.240> so

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
connect the lighting to the adapter so

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.379 
connect the lighting to the adapter so
as<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:57.229> can<00:04:57.350> see<00:04:57.560> it's<00:04:57.770> not<00:04:58.130> too<00:04:58.460> expensive<00:04:59.000> of

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
as you can see it's not too expensive of

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.120 
as you can see it's not too expensive of
a<00:04:59.479> lighting<00:04:59.840> system<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.470> make<00:05:00.650> your<00:05:00.800> tank

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
a lighting system to make your tank

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.030 
a lighting system to make your tank
actually<00:05:01.430> just<00:05:02.000> glow<00:05:02.419> and<00:05:02.870> look<00:05:03.040> really
