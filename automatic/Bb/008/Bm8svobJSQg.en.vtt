00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.170

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.649

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.810
 come into politics 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.140
 when needed to find out a choir what was over today was stage over 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.450
 to put Putin he said for seven years but I thought it was striking he had 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.420
 have two ministers come together independently on the same day 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.930
 yes where mandela is friday not hopeful to know who yes that is true but me 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.350
 liked it so much Maartje van Weegen about which they have you 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.240
 and having it heard in the mls and I will show you this one 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.390
 first come to let those ministers and what makes you say then you have to look 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.360
 drama 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.010
 treatment of the river dikes 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.380
 that can continue even after the budget at that time 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.380
 is that 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.000
 when the willisstee left pulled yet showed up 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 also relieved to finally let them start 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.870
 wanting to be on time tomorrow may be that these people don't posted them 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.590
 hey, every year there is such a cute family 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.790
 if you want to be on time tomorrow, I better not look at something so blue 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.659
 that is typically feminine in politics 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:23.920
 a journalist that day 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.340
 although it depends on the matter 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.220
 look at a contractor understand nothing of this 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.750
 and so as a miner that morning 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.000
 it's you who darling done then he wasn't going to get stuck for years too 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.360
 seems like he has a battery that I have a plan 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.850
 like them that morning 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.390
 had done nothing bam had ended up in a traffic jam just like a typical one 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.520
 male previous nursery samples also look at the empire then 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.439
 please huh 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.439
 that has sony record 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.260
 something like a blood test slocombe on wenger you can pick up 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.240
 to have 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.670
 minister dalers 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.350
 had finally arrived 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.920
 they could start the sea ro negotiations with the civil service unions 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.020
 to be continued on 21 February 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:19.799
 that fight at the meeting table for the final round before the inter 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.729
 well-known union leader jaap van de scheur 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:25.359
 he will leave the battlefield 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:26.569
 look at the empire 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.060
 during an exclusive introduction to his overpainted successor and that is 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.049
 Hans van de Paal 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.130
 I am my rent 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.440
 well aware of the fact that it was going to be a little difficult for the man to be 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.399
 appeared 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.329
 to follow 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.079
 mandelson have had the barn in very large earnings 2 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.379
 in battle 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.559
 the social interests of officials 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:54.529
 I got there will also certainly not want to try the man was according to eyewitnesses 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:55.929
 goods 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:58.239
 and hoogerheide anp this against 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.000
 can promise that I will continue to pursue his policy 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.269
 Going out you should be seen as a test signal reached after days 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.109
 that one should not think there 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.259
 in general and after saying goodbye to a country without hesitation is 21 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.950
 March 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.420
 the city council is rapidly approaching elections 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:24.819
 last and tuesday at three o'clock exactly that band the party one 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.769
 have submitted a list of candidates 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.379
 in some municipalities this is associated with internal cover 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.649
 for instance 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:38.489
 8 if there are difficulties then they are certainly not our party 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:43.209
 we were well ahead of you with our list within tuesday afternoon but it is 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.469
 the vvd and 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.269
 in particular the chairman Mrs. Grootendorst arrived at five past three 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.399
 turn it on 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:55.129
 so the vvd will not participate which means that we have more voters here 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.249
 will draw March 21 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:58.710
 he looks at it 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.600
 for any case it is better especially the labor party when it comes down to me 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.230
 has been in itself for years, but now it is true that it almost always falls in Japan 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.300
 it must be in sixth place in our lessons 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.030
 we asked to make room for the a7 for this but also through and 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.949
 that is on some misunderstanding the start of the japan books dutch to a pastor 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.319
 because I have been living in this beautiful country for sixteen years 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:28.289
 I do not understand why it is wet on the chest because mattie down on the 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.009
 seventh place where sir further than the sixth place now says this reports the 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.360
 telegraaf this year is the first time in years again but in deventer 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.699
 This has turned out to be a year from when there was so much going on at my stand 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.430
 seventh place which led to protests involving a fact 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.900
 within the turkish community in germany 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.120
 own will say there 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.789
 holla are all again in the head 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.689
 We must not believe anything about it 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:57.279
 yes a little bit then i tried he said his country we have 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.430
 currently so 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.510
 have five years in the Netherlands and Belgium so that the vvd does not participate because 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:08.280
 He drove to help when we don't know if it says a fifth 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.039
 Place 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.509
 there they are they get in nile 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.509
 in sixth place and time 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.619
 and the day after Thursday, May 20, one time also came to look at the previous one 

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:22.990
 elections in terneuzen at the top in 21st place of no unless said 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.050
 The city is already quite a stream of headliner and a tiny bit on 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.610
 make a good impression 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.669
 after that it was from these people but that is it 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.789
 a while have been going on for a while and that is why the year is as simple as that 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.199
 a bath bench that he has a tail 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.880
 a quarter of all chosen 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.590
 he just took after the wk we put all bald back then until one 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.509
 instructions 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:51.490
 and then to strength I do normally that there is to own party where 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.330
 andrÃ© but now I am going to believe that we Dutch are still sitting around the table 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.750
 it is not necessary to sit at the table 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.080
 if you also wish me to look at it 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.139
 both 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.720
 sometimes longer with paper than today because the people from outside the eu 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:09.759
 had some to arrange to have the horses 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.999
 henceforth a number of times will have to come to the country 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:17.969
 then the old would also like to point out the many good works 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:23.169
 that happened in the past period, in particular this 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.229
 extended he follows project 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.699
 this thanks to our efforts 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:29.740
 to come 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.710
 finally this 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.260
 it will be kate tomorrow morning for the time of the year 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:41.039
 m as long as minister mowing her tunnels has not dug them 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:44.039
 many of you pay attention we have been in a traffic jam for a long time 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:48.049
 who wants to be on time tomorrow and not build the cold 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.939
 can do better but something very hot 

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:54.939
 this was just an evening view of the empire 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.580
 work 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.099
 aha
