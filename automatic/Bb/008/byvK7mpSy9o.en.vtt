00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.120
 friends of the network as you must 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.490
 know the technology advances and 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.620
 previously we used these disque 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.660
 to save information and jobs 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.580
 from college or university but the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.320
 today we are going to give you a second 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.800
 life from here from the network and that is 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.570
 let's make an original card or 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.210
 as you want to call it notebook 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.189
 to write down those important things 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.130
 what we are going to use to do it 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.000
 is of course all of us who are going to 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.890
 use a hollows and if you guys 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.990
 achieve a bit of colors or floppy 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.720
 can use some tempera or 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.960
 can use oil paint to 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:50.310
 that they have something like this we are going to use 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.740
 a paper either white blog or we can 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.650
 use the blog with wright and for 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.780
 of course some rings that with this 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.329
 you are going to hold 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.030
 notebook let's start the first step is 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.830
 with the paper and the one on the left mark the 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.930
 role of the way in which you so that 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.720
 you can get the sheet out of there 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.810
 his book subsequently take his scissors 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.070
 and they are going to cut it so that they 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.070
 stay well straight 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.409
 reassure him you can see here the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.450
 district has a little hole you give 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.060
 some perforation and what he did 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.520
 against in that I huequito and factory 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.920
 they're going to measure it with the paper like this 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.909
 always as long as they are left 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.850
 correct they will measure it if they mark it with 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.799
 a pen 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.040
 and the part of the holes and 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:53.860
 later with their drill they do 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.860
 the perforation of its leaves 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.730
 the following is true once painted 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.950
 the diskette with rings put the 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.050
 rings only in the holes is 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.700
 super easy and you have seen the truth is 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.590
 that a job that you can 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.150
 perform in their homes and they can 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.590
 give a second life in your label that 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.590
 I know that many must have something 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.600
 kept in their houses look it give you a 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.440
 second life and they will be able to elaborate a 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.440
 work as beautiful as 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:28.760
 reduce reuse and recycle 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.760
 and reuse and recycle thanks
