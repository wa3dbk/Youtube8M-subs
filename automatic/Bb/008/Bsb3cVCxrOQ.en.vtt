part this idea is me and adds some
replay<00:01:03.449> value<00:01:03.479> but<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.170> kind<00:01:04.440> of

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
replay value but it's kind of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.440 
replay value but it's kind of
superficial<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.309> all<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.670> revolutionary

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
superficial and all that revolutionary

but<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> game<00:01:07.229> use<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.649> system<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> good

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
but the game use of the system to a good

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.010 
but the game use of the system to a good
effect<00:01:08.670> giving<00:01:09.030> players<00:01:09.240> nothing<00:01:09.659> Sam<00:01:09.869> to
