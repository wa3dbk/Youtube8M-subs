00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.509
 and now the whole world even 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.610
 welcome to a video to have the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.160
 cyborg and dragon camouflage for 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.350
 playstation3 of custom games 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.910
 it is worth saying that we can not line 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.920
 but to say that in games 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.480
 personalized and the same so it has 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.780
 bothered to create the games 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.420
 Customized choose classes and anything goes 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.910
 in fact I randomly made letters 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.170
 made up to three custom games 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.580
 and so one tell you that those who 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.980
 you have added some of these 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.420
 several accounts I leave here so that 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.820
 you see and they also leave us in the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.109
 description tell you what you can catch 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.210
 the hence the departures 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.100
 personalized these not so good 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.749
 As they are caught, well let's give them 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.489
 to the triangle to look for friends 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:45.960
 that we have added and we look for 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.420
 some of the accounts that I have put 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.280
 in the description it is worth that they are mine 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.199
 true for you to know then we go 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.690
 to this same one we go to the player's channel 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.149
 and we search in personalized games 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.729
 the three that I created worth here is like 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.670
 cyborg and dragon and has been three goes 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.589
 slow we charge it and to keep it 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.420
 go here you edit these rules 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.650
 we give the square and we put the title 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.030
 we want and the description is worth 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.950
 and put a title and a description 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.570
 similar to mine I would appreciate it 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.020
 a lot is worth so that more people can 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.570
 find me and one of those that when 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.580
 we must wait and we come back and 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.580
 now we are looking to change game mode 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.170
 and we give to saved here here and here 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.880
 where we will have saved the games 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.040
 customized so you can take them 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.750
 always here before saving 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.450
 I recommend that you do one thing worth 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.400
 I recommend that first of all tell you that 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.750
 if you can leave your like in the 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.330
 Custom games you give to 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.390
 triangle and you give a like it's worth 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.670
 so we can get to 11 at about 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.990
 100 or if they are worth those that I have added and 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.450
 so good power so you can see in the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.170
 tv in most popular vouchers and so the people 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.880
 do not have me added so they can help me 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.860
 get out of there not with tv you can but 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.180
 no longer there too because if they appear 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.619
 my personalized games or those of 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.119
 another person then we can catch those of 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.100
 there is worth and good now let's see what 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.380
 that we can change we are going to edit the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.319
 rules of the game is for example from 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.510
 contract 2 death certificate 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.090
 and you can change everything except this 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.909
 you can not change this from taking us away 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.639
 You can change the time advantages 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.069
 tactics can change it all except 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.709
 the weapons because if you take away the weapons you 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.329
 will remove the camouflage that is 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.769
 and I recommend that you do not have what you have 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.409
 because it is that if it will not be removed as 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.719
 I'm saying I'm going to teach here all 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:37.870
 the classes are worth these say that I have 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:41.109
 done so to eye is not wanted to do anything 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.419
 It's worth it so I've done it as I wanted 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.760
 not so saying ok let's see the 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:47.680
 second, this is the best thing to say to you 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.840
 here is the teleportation trick 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.169
 to get out of the maps and also 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.909
 will be of the unlimited points worth the 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:57.129
 infinite points tell you that you are 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.930
 match in the second one is worth it because 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.909
 I do not know what teleport I think 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.129
 I put and well here you see we can 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.959
 change all the advantages also the 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.389
 wildcards everything we can not 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.329
 change you are the secondary ones worth 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.969
 the high school and everything and as you can see there 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.040
 are the six teams taking the 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.900
 flag is valid for you to see that you can 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.590
 do the trick of teleportation that 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.750
 I was 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.760
 and let's finish with the last one is 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.920
 domain the truth that I do not know if you're going to 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.739
 use a lot but accused him this way 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.950
 of game because you possibly want it 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.239
 and good for classes there worth 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.190
 tell you that you can change everything 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.470
 always but what you can not change 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.420
 are the main weapons the secondary 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.060
 remember you always worth back when 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.890
 this may have changed if you do not 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.940
 you want to change the guards already in the 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.120
 Custom items so that 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.840
 you know it's worth when we're already started 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.709
 the game if we want or if not as you see 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.910
 here I have put the game of 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.200
 teleportation voucher 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.450
 there we see that I'm going to take a class 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.709
 same and take the sniper's already 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.299
 has appeared off the map because 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.640
 I was on a team to do the 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.420
 teleportation tell you that he was in the 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.959
 team 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.000
 There are militias and mercenaries worth 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.620
 if you take on one of those teams you can 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.930
 do the trick of teleportation because 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.599
 As you can see, this port is located 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.299
 the two flags are to catch them 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.739
 as you can see there are the infinite points 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.239
 tell you that once you have died, no 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.470
 you can do the trick to get out 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.479
 of the maps as you have seen of 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.039
 dead you 're not going to start the game 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.009
 I should have put in that desire the 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:29.360
 I'm like that because I do not die and well, yes 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.530
 you want to see it in the trick of 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.350
 teleportation is worth it if you are interested 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.300
 I'll leave it in the description and good 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.150
 you see that the weapons are pretty pretty 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.530
 with this camouflage and tell you that he has 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.690
 put so volley up okay do not tell me 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.729
 you can put a class that has alarm 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.740
 this and this and this the gameplay 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.110
 search and destroy and this and this and this 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.460
 because I tell you that I have not created more 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.080
 things are worth if you want to believe them 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.990
 you and you pass to your friends 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.699
 ok because it is that the truth is quite 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.620
 complicated to make three games 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.570
 Customized a little radiant no 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.759
 so to speak but well I've done what 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.229
 that I could hope you enjoy the 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.090
 camouflages these for people who do not know 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.889
 allows you to buy these fields with the 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.780
 people do not directly let you buy 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.190
 the vouchers and so good then I hope 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.840
