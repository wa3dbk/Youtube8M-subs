00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.860
 I hope this video turns out to be definitive 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.540
 so that you know as in the lips thing 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.790
 that you keep asking me even though 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.800
 it's other videos before and I've 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.630
 Hung a mini tutorial on Instagram 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.340
 the fundamental reason why I 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.410
 The lips are like that because it's good 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.050
 I like that the lip remains 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.820
 Make-up all day then make 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.949
 years when I started to put on makeup myself 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.140
 I noticed that visibility when 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.680
 days when I ate or when you undo 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.970
 so I did not like that so 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.309
 investigate and look for ways that the 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.920
 road will be fixed and permanent almost all 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.100
 the day and only had to retouch what 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.809
 they were very very little then nothing 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.670
 very simple is a way to make up 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.109
 the super easy lip and what can you do 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.660
 in any place like me that I'm 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.430
 right now in good because on the street in 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.109
 the street so take note now what 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.340
 I'm wearing makeup and you're going to see all the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.340
 athens process 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.680
 The first thing I do is once I have 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:18.479
 the lip the clean lip is to catch a 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.479
 little bit of makeup 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.860
 and erase 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.290
 a little the contours 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.520
 It's worth any makeup base 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.360
 you ask me what is barbarian 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.730
 any one worth 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.320
 the twine and how you see keep us a 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.480
 little the contours are worth so that 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.480
 then the profiler looks nicer 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.200
 the second step we outline the lip here 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.360
 yes I tell you the one that I use the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.910
 armani number one because it's a tone 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.130
 very useful and with strips lightly 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.120
 brown but good here is independent 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.120
 which you want to use 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.009
 It helps a lot to put chicks 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.009
 process it 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.780
 what is important as you see is that 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.490
 the profiler is not very dark because 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.130
 if not then at the time of throwing 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.780
 powders will be a very marked profile 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.270
 and that we stayed natural for that reason 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.040
 I advise it to be very news you see the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.689
 result 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.459
 now you take a lipstick from 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.439
 pink color here yes I'm not going to 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.609
 give any one you have at home 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.609
 that is Russia 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.920
 I am a brush so that the bar is 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.840
 apply better but if you like 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.840
 directly from the lipstick of life 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.530
 now we take a kleenex 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.050
 we leave the louts 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.650
 that way all the excess lipstick 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.860
 he goes in he stays in the kleenex and the 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.720
 type of step is the super important and 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.820
 here I say the shadow that I use 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.430
 subject made to qualify the lip is 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:06.450
 is from bolivar the number 16 that is 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.710
 flame pink perth or be a true pink os 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.290
 I say this because it has cost me 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.180
 find it a lot of time 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.910
 At first, use a make-up product 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.130
 up store 'that they withdrew and I went crazy 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.780
 finding or looking for something that was 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.240
 similar and I found it in this 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.240
 shadow of bobby braun you take a little ball 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.489
 product 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.410
 and you apply on the vice lip are 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.470
 controlling the amount depends on the 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:41.270
 nuance that you want to give them 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.270
 Well, how are you picking tonality? 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.240
 easy and simple you already know questions 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.610
 doubts and questions although I think it is 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.540
 is going to be left with his berciano down 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.220
 in comments 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.220
 a strong kiss and thanks for being there
