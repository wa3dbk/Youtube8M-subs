00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.780
 hazelnuts 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.170
 they have but we have good 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.870
 expectations 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.760
 there is a tactic a strategy the group 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.960
 next door wants to surprise you actually 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.920
 He sent an ice cream from Roquefort that I should 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.920
 recognize was very rich 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.090
 I do not know that teamwork was 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.090
 A window 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.030
 here 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.400
 with dates with did evil is a 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.130
 luck of candy in this case 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.780
 transparent these are two flavors 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.460
 Lebanese really 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.450
 represent 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.450
 in favor of the Middle East 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.500
 That would be his tonic strategy 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.520
 we'll see in luck how he sees you 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.690
 all right 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.690
 long the cornada not 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.940
 well we can not do it 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.370
 to ask them anything 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.890
 just that you feel alone to elaborate 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.560
 that if the time does not come with your old 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.500
 and good is what then may be enough 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.280
 a first 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.280
 here 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:19.010
 we are with maximiliano macaroni the 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:21.590
 Latin American music champion but the 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.950
 dream of the whole dream of everything I think 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.780
 but of all cooks is to be able to put together a 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.910
 cornet or a glass and that you do not know 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.840
 breaks the first bust goes well the 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.840
 theme is the second 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.139
 let's see how current colate is a 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.680
 soup we're stirring now I do not 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.680
 like what is going on 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:48.500
 faster than him 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.500
 There are people who laugh but not 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.259
 to see how an ice cream is made like 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.259
 corresponds how they are served 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.919
 now the joy of champion 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.919
 the last 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.890
 here 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.670
 it is a subject to taste the water that takes 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:26.610
 Sleeping the tongue is not a boy 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.170
 three days ago they are testing and 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.720
 see that they have bits of bread 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:34.490
 apple bits to clean 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.490
 a little bit all the flavors of ice cream 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.080
 I learned how to put together ice cream I had fun 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.260
 trying and tasting we learned so much 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.690
 secrets and the truth 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.690
 I feel part of the curator of the work
