been out a while now and I just wanted

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.810 
been out a while now and I just wanted
to<00:00:20.699> do<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> short<00:00:21.240> video<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:22.400> showing<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
to do a short video here showing you the

to do a short video here showing you the
a<00:00:24.119> min<00:00:24.359> or<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:25.140> head<00:00:25.320> track<00:00:25.619> came<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.070> using

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
a min or the head track came in using

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.950 
a min or the head track came in using
the<00:00:26.670> oculus<00:00:27.000> rift<00:00:29.449> right<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.660> can<00:00:30.840> see

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the oculus rift right you can see

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.250 
the oculus rift right you can see
straight<00:00:31.140> away<00:00:31.550> how<00:00:32.660> accurate<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.840> tracking

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
straight away how accurate the tracking

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.190 
straight away how accurate the tracking
is<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> rift<00:00:35.540> for<00:00:36.540> me<00:00:36.660> personally<00:00:36.870> I

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
is with the rift for me personally I

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.600 
is with the rift for me personally I
find<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.590> more<00:00:37.680> precise<00:00:38.070> than<00:00:38.250> using<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
find it more precise than using the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.569 
find it more precise than using the
mouse<00:00:39.620> you<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.680> see<00:00:40.980> me<00:00:41.160> keeping<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
mouse you can see me keeping the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.580 
mouse you can see me keeping the
reticule<00:00:41.910> over<00:00:42.450> my<00:00:42.600> target<00:00:42.989> there<00:00:43.170> very

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
reticule over my target there very

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.000 
reticule over my target there very
easily<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:46.050> reason<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.379> prefer<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.829> over

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
easily and the reason I prefer this over

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.490 
easily and the reason I prefer this over
the<00:00:47.250> mouse<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.789> because<00:00:48.329> ship<00:00:48.780> controls<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the mouse is because ship controls and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.279 
the mouse is because ship controls and
aiming<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.070> completely<00:00:50.670> independent<00:00:51.289> there's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
aiming a completely independent there's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.250 
aiming a completely independent there's
no<00:00:52.469> link<00:00:52.710> once<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.760> other

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.439 

again<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.219> see<00:00:59.519> how<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> track<00:01:00.089> the<00:01:00.120> target

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
again you can see how I track the target

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.470 
again you can see how I track the target
there<00:01:00.839> i<00:01:01.109> watch<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.679> pass<00:01:01.890> over<00:01:02.250> me<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.609> can

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
there i watch you pass over me I can

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.210 
there i watch you pass over me I can
also<00:01:03.570> keep<00:01:03.839> my<00:01:03.989> gimbal<00:01:04.320> guns<00:01:04.559> aimed<00:01:04.890> at<00:01:05.070> it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
also keep my gimbal guns aimed at it

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:18.690 
also keep my gimbal guns aimed at it
again<00:01:05.899> initiated<00:01:12.409> scan<00:01:13.409> initiated

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.810 

now<00:01:19.270> i'm<00:01:19.600> using<00:01:19.659> an<00:01:20.110> xbox<00:01:20.560> control<00:01:21.039> pad<00:01:21.280> to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
now i'm using an xbox control pad to

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.819 
now i'm using an xbox control pad to
control<00:01:22.180> my<00:01:22.299> ship<00:01:22.570> that's<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.289> way<00:01:23.439> i<00:01:23.469> prefer

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
control my ship that's the way i prefer

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.399 
control my ship that's the way i prefer
to<00:01:23.979> fly<00:01:24.100> this<00:01:24.219> thing<00:01:24.369> actually<00:01:24.789> find<00:01:25.240> it<00:01:25.409> much

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
to fly this thing actually find it much

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:38.130 
to fly this thing actually find it much
easier<00:01:26.439> then<00:01:26.950> keyboard<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.610> mouse<00:01:37.140> all-star

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
easier then keyboard a mouse all-star

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.440 
easier then keyboard a mouse all-star
contacts

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.080 

I<00:01:42.509> only<00:01:43.439> used<00:01:43.710> my<00:01:43.950> gimbal<00:01:44.399> guns<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.000> this

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
I only used my gimbal guns here in this

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.740 
I only used my gimbal guns here in this
video<00:01:45.680> basically<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.979> show<00:01:47.219> how

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
video basically just to show how

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.069 
video basically just to show how
accurate<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:51.590> initiated

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
accurate it can be initiated

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.300 
accurate it can be initiated
there's<00:01:55.079> still<00:01:55.289> some<00:01:55.500> clip<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.009> going<00:01:56.159> on

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
there's still some clip and going on

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.039 
there's still some clip and going on
here<00:01:56.579> apparently<00:01:57.270> there's<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.479> way<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.600> remove

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
here apparently there's a way to remove

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.889 
here apparently there's a way to remove

through a config file Hank something I
still<00:02:21.530> have<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.800> do

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.710 

as<00:02:33.069> you<00:02:33.250> can<00:02:33.400> see<00:02:33.610> I'm<00:02:33.910> not<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.150> very<00:02:34.390> skilled

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
as you can see I'm not a very skilled

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.860 
as you can see I'm not a very skilled
pilot<00:02:35.610> but<00:02:36.610> hopefully<00:02:36.940> this<00:02:37.120> video<00:02:37.240> gives<00:02:37.720> you

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
pilot but hopefully this video gives you

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.410 
pilot but hopefully this video gives you
some<00:02:38.080> indication<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.770> just<00:02:38.800> how<00:02:39.069> accurate<00:02:39.880> the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
some indication of just how accurate the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.020 
some indication of just how accurate the
rift<00:02:40.690> can<00:02:40.900> be<00:02:41.050> when<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.350> comes<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.680> Amy

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
initiated I'm totally convinced in the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.530 
initiated I'm totally convinced in the
hands<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:50.770> skilled<00:02:51.069> pilot<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.910> rift<00:02:52.150> would

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
hands of a skilled pilot the rift would

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.800 
hands of a skilled pilot the rift would
be<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.720> huge<00:02:53.020> advantage<00:02:57.450> I'll<00:02:58.450> make<00:02:58.600> another

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
be a huge advantage I'll make another

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.210 
be a huge advantage I'll make another
video<00:02:59.050> like<00:02:59.319> this<00:02:59.500> when<00:02:59.739> I<00:02:59.770> bet<00:02:59.920> a<00:02:59.950> bit<00:03:00.130> more

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
video like this when I bet a bit more

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.610 
video like this when I bet a bit more
practice<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:01.090> I'll<00:03:01.630> come<00:03:01.840> back<00:03:01.870> on<00:03:02.019> we<00:03:02.440> can

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
practice and I'll come back on we can

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.699 
practice and I'll come back on we can
have<00:03:02.709> another<00:03:02.739> look<00:03:04.410> subsidy<00:03:05.410> an<00:03:05.530> aunt

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
have another look subsidy an aunt
