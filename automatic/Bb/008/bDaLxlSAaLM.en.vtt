prominent<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.420> see<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.500> we're<00:00:38.340> gonna

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
prominent you can see it so we're gonna

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.380 
prominent you can see it so we're gonna
go<00:00:39.410> one<00:00:40.410> two<00:00:41.280> three<00:00:41.960> four<00:00:42.980> five<00:00:43.980> six<00:00:44.700> seven

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
go one two three four five six seven

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.479 
go one two three four five six seven
eight<00:00:45.719> let's<00:00:46.559> try<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> we're<00:00:47.190> gonna<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.460> a

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
eight let's try that we're gonna do a

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.540 
eight let's try that we're gonna do a
whole<00:00:47.969> eight<00:00:48.180> count<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:49.200> knees<00:00:49.469> which<00:00:50.430> is

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
whole eight count of just knees which is

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.920 
whole eight count of just knees which is
your<00:00:50.700> leg<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.420> five<00:00:51.809> six<00:00:52.559> seven<00:00:53.399> eight<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.660> two

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
your leg so five six seven eight one two

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.150 
your leg so five six seven eight one two
three<00:00:55.579> four<00:00:56.579> five<00:00:57.210> six<00:00:57.719> seven<00:00:58.260> eight

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
three four five six seven eight

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.860 
three four five six seven eight
now<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.879> reverse<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.539> well<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
now you can reverse that as well and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.920 
now you can reverse that as well and
make<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.109> 16<00:01:01.500> counts<00:01:01.829> let's<00:01:02.460> try<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.930> five

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
make it 16 counts let's try that five

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.600 
make it 16 counts let's try that five
six<00:01:04.710> seven<00:01:05.670> eight<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.030> one<00:01:06.689> two<00:01:06.750> three<00:01:07.610> four

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
six seven eight and one two three four

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.039 
six seven eight and one two three four
five<00:01:09.240> six<00:01:09.840> seven<00:01:10.500> eight<00:01:11.040> back<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.820> two<00:01:12.450> three

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
five six seven eight back one two three

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.330 
five six seven eight back one two three
four<00:01:13.710> five<00:01:14.340> six<00:01:14.970> seven<00:01:15.750> eight<00:01:16.100> now<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.159> can

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
four five six seven eight now you can

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.219 
four five six seven eight now you can
take<00:01:17.460> those<00:01:17.640> multiple<00:01:18.210> speeds<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.570> well<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
take those multiple speeds as well you

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.499 
take those multiple speeds as well you
can<00:01:19.380> go<00:01:19.530> 1<00:01:20.310> 2<00:01:20.549> 3<00:01:20.580> 4<00:01:21.150> 5<00:01:21.390> 6<00:01:21.689> 7<00:01:21.930> 8<00:01:22.259> 1<00:01:22.470> 2<00:01:22.619> 3<00:01:22.770> 4<00:01:23.040> 5<00:01:23.520> 6<00:01:23.790> 7<00:01:24.030> 8

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
can go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.510 
can go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
it'll<00:01:25.080> be<00:01:25.170> clearly<00:01:25.500> seen<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.310> certain

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
it'll be clearly seen if it's a certain

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.789 
it'll be clearly seen if it's a certain
beat<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.330> kill<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.500> let's<00:01:28.680> try

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
beat you can really kill it so let's try

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.090 
beat you can really kill it so let's try
it<00:01:28.860> again

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
it again

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920 
it again
we're<00:01:29.790> gonna<00:01:29.880> first<00:01:30.240> speed<00:01:30.450> we're<00:01:30.600> gonna<00:01:30.750> take

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
we're gonna first speed we're gonna take

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.289 
we're gonna first speed we're gonna take
it<00:01:31.130> four<00:01:32.130> times<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.640> after<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.060> we're<00:01:33.210> gonna

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
it four times and after that we're gonna

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:43.130 
it four times and after that we're gonna
double<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.020> 5<00:01:35.009> 6<00:01:35.780> 7<00:01:36.780> 8<00:01:37.049> 1<00:01:37.710> 2<00:01:38.040> 3<00:01:38.430> 4<00:01:39.320> 5<00:01:40.320> 6<00:01:40.950> 7<00:01:41.549> 8<00:01:42.210> 1<00:01:42.509> 2
