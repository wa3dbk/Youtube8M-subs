here that you can pop this is something
that<00:00:13.290> our<00:00:13.500> designers<00:00:14.040> just<00:00:14.309> put<00:00:14.549> here<00:00:14.790> for<00:00:14.820> a

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
that our designers just put here for a

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.109 
that our designers just put here for a
fun<00:00:15.240> but<00:00:15.570> actually<00:00:16.410> it's<00:00:16.560> like<00:00:16.740> just<00:00:17.670> about<00:00:17.820> us

the pigs here but moving on to the game
itself<00:00:23.699> we<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.150> couple<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.570> episodes

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
itself we have a couple of episodes

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.130 
itself we have a couple of episodes
there<00:00:26.130> will<00:00:26.250> be<00:00:26.279> free<00:00:26.640> update<00:00:27.420> sphere<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
there will be free update sphere in the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.349 
there will be free update sphere in the
future<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.130> then<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:29.400> also<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.939> danger

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
future and then we also have a danger

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.170 
future and then we also have a danger
zone<00:00:30.449> which<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:31.890> hardcore<00:00:32.219> levels<00:00:32.820> for

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
zone which is like hardcore levels for

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.389 
zone which is like hardcore levels for
advanced<00:00:33.630> players<00:00:34.020> like<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.980> if<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.219> want

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the danger zone and what we have in

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.119 
the danger zone and what we have in
angry<00:00:39.930> birds<00:00:39.960> space<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:42.469> familiar<00:00:43.469> characters

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
angry birds space is familiar characters

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.270 
angry birds space is familiar characters
familiar<00:00:44.910> gameplay<00:00:45.390> elements<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.530> then<00:00:46.710> what

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
familiar gameplay elements but then what

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.279 
familiar gameplay elements but then what
we've<00:00:47.460> introduced<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.840> planet

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
we've introduced this is this planet

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.709 
we've introduced this is this planet
which<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.309> like<00:00:50.489> 360<00:00:51.210> degree

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
which so you have like 360 degree

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.779 
which so you have like 360 degree
gravity<00:00:52.230> fields<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.340> find<00:00:53.579> like

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
gravity fields and you can find like

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.880 
gravity fields and you can find like
different<00:00:54.480> solutions<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> puzzles<00:00:55.710> oh

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
different solutions to the puzzles oh

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.479 
different solutions to the puzzles oh
there<00:00:56.340> are<00:00:56.460> copied<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:56.940> right<00:00:57.180> there<00:00:57.420> but

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
there are copied up right there but

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.069 
there are copied up right there but
let's<00:00:59.489> try<00:00:59.640> again<00:00:59.820> I'm<00:01:00.300> gonna<00:01:00.570> try<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.899> from

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
let's try again I'm gonna try it from

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.280 
let's try again I'm gonna try it from
this<00:01:01.260> side<00:01:01.320> now<00:01:05.090> and<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:06.990> pigs

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
this side now and there you go all pigs

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
this side now and there you go all pigs
part<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:10.189> what<00:01:11.189> we're<00:01:11.369> doing<00:01:11.400> doing<00:01:12.060> with

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
part so so what we're doing doing with

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.460 
part so so what we're doing doing with
the<00:01:12.330> level<00:01:12.450> design<00:01:12.720> now<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.320> like

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the level design now is like

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.050 
the level design now is like
experimenting<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.400> these<00:01:14.700> different

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
experimenting with these different

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.210 
experimenting with these different
bodies<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.600> different<00:01:15.900> gravities<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.710> then

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
bodies and different gravities and then

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.609 
bodies and different gravities and then
we<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:17.850> 2d<00:01:18.360> 3d<00:01:18.720> stuff<00:01:19.049> here<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.380> we

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
we can have like 2d 3d stuff here and we

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.170 
we can have like 2d 3d stuff here and we
can<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.520> many<00:01:20.700> different

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
can if we can have like many different

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240 
can if we can have like many different
environments<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.680> really<00:01:22.830> really

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
environments and this is really really

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.960 
environments and this is really really
something<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.430> like

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
something like like a so we like

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.210 
something like like a so we like
teaching<00:01:27.450> people<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:28.229> new<00:01:28.530> style<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.979> clay

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
teaching people this new style of clay

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.700 
teaching people this new style of clay
like<00:01:29.490> okay<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.450> can't<00:01:30.689> escape<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.229> gravity

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
like okay you can't escape this gravity

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.800 
like okay you can't escape this gravity
field<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.130> go<00:01:32.250> past<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.729> building<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.630> you

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
field to go past this building but you

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.499 
field to go past this building but you
can<00:01:34.290> actually<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:35.340> go<00:01:35.579> round<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.420> other

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
can actually like go round it the other

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.990 
can actually like go round it the other
way<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.990> get<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.350> pigs<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:38.880> can

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
way and get to the pigs so so we can

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.760 
way and get to the pigs so so we can
have<00:01:39.180> different<00:01:39.570> puzzles<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.409> lots<00:01:40.650> of

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
have different puzzles with with lots of

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.130 
have different puzzles with with lots of
different<00:01:41.159> solutions<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:42.990> take

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
different solutions here and if we take

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.249 
different solutions here and if we take
a<00:01:43.200> quick<00:01:43.439> peek<00:01:43.680> at<00:01:43.890> them<00:01:44.270> at<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.600> at<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
a quick peek at them at the at the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.160 
a quick peek at them at the at the
danger<00:01:46.710> zone<00:01:46.740> levels<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:48.020> this<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.140> where<00:01:49.350> our

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
danger zone levels so this is where our

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.350 
danger zone levels so this is where our
level<00:01:50.650> designers<00:01:51.130> have<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.520> Liberty<00:01:52.119> to<00:01:52.150> go

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
level designers have the Liberty to go

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.320 
level designers have the Liberty to go
completely<00:01:52.869> crazy<00:01:53.170> so<00:01:53.979> for<00:01:54.159> example<00:01:54.250> here<00:01:54.549> you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
completely crazy so for example here you

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.940 
completely crazy so for example here you
can<00:01:55.479> see<00:01:55.630> see<00:01:56.080> what<00:01:56.229> you<00:01:56.350> can<00:01:56.500> do<00:01:56.619> with<00:01:56.830> the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
can see see what you can do with the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.100 
can see see what you can do with the
different<00:01:57.280> bodies<00:01:57.580> of<00:01:57.790> bodies<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.509> different

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
different bodies of bodies and different

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.609 
different bodies of bodies and different
gravity<00:01:59.500> fields<00:01:59.830> that<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.040> can<00:02:00.189> actually

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
gravity fields that you can actually

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.990 
gravity fields that you can actually
actually<00:02:02.619> like<00:02:02.770> have<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.280> have<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.850> really

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
actually like have to have the really

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.149 
actually like have to have the really
really<00:02:04.479> put<00:02:04.810> your<00:02:04.960> brain<00:02:05.290> to<00:02:05.320> work<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.890> figure

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
really put your brain to work to figure

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.229 
really put your brain to work to figure
out<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.930> solutions<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.020> these<00:02:08.200> ones<00:02:08.560> I<00:02:12.239> don't

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
out the solutions to these ones I don't

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.820 
out the solutions to these ones I don't
know<00:02:13.300> just<00:02:13.569> looking<00:02:13.840> at<00:02:13.989> this<00:02:14.170> makes<00:02:14.440> my<00:02:14.620> head

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
know just looking at this makes my head

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
know just looking at this makes my head
hurt<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.760> anyway<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:17.650> lot<00:02:18.519> of<00:02:18.640> new<00:02:18.819> things

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
hurt so anyway a lot of new things

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.750 
hurt so anyway a lot of new things
couple<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.780> new<00:02:19.900> characters<00:02:20.170> let<00:02:20.950> me<00:02:21.099> see<00:02:21.550> if<00:02:21.670> I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
couple of new characters let me see if I

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.380 
couple of new characters let me see if I
can<00:02:21.910> find<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:23.580> iceberg<00:02:24.580> iceberg<00:02:25.180> is<00:02:25.360> a

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
can find you the iceberg iceberg is a

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.050 
can find you the iceberg iceberg is a
fun<00:02:25.660> one<00:02:25.870> well<00:02:26.260> this<00:02:26.470> is<00:02:26.500> lays<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.920> bird<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:27.850> we

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
fun one well this is lays a bird so we

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.610 
fun one well this is lays a bird so we
used<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.299> have<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.510> yellow<00:02:28.630> bird<00:02:29.019> that<00:02:29.049> like

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
used to have the yellow bird that like

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.690 
used to have the yellow bird that like
dashes<00:02:30.069> through<00:02:30.100> things<00:02:30.549> so<00:02:31.269> with<00:02:31.420> laser<00:02:31.630> bird

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
dashes through things so with laser bird

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.910 
dashes through things so with laser bird
is<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.880> replacement<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.480> yellow<00:02:34.720> bird<00:02:34.989> you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
is the replacement of yellow bird you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.949 
is the replacement of yellow bird you
can<00:02:36.069> fire<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.370> out<00:02:36.640> there<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.120> then<00:02:37.239> just<00:02:37.480> have

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
can fire it out there and then just have

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.960 
can fire it out there and then just have
this<00:02:38.110> burst<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.860> can<00:02:39.010> direct<00:02:39.400> in<00:02:39.640> it's<00:02:39.760> like<00:02:39.880> a

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
this burst you can direct in it's like a

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.360 
this burst you can direct in it's like a
guided<00:02:40.330> missile<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:41.290> get<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.680> flashes<00:02:42.190> like

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
guided missile you get just flashes like

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.400 
guided missile you get just flashes like
wherever<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:42.910> want<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.230> the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
wherever you want and this is the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.920 
wherever you want and this is the
iceberg<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.030> ice<00:02:46.150> bird<00:02:46.450> will<00:02:46.660> freeze

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
iceberg so the ice bird will freeze

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.960 
iceberg so the ice bird will freeze
anything<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.519> touches<00:02:49.980> what's<00:02:50.980> up<00:02:51.160> and

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
anything that it touches what's up and

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.850 
anything that it touches what's up and
then<00:02:52.150> when<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:52.450> frozen<00:02:52.780> all<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.200> stuff<00:02:53.470> then

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
then when you frozen all the stuff then

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.520 
then when you frozen all the stuff then
you're<00:02:53.980> going<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.160> use<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.549> Bluebirds<00:02:55.530> to

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
you're going to use the Bluebirds to

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.360 
you're going to use the Bluebirds to
break<00:02:56.739> them<00:02:56.950> off

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.100 

that's<00:03:01.370> that's<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:01.910> quick<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.300> dirty<00:03:02.390> overview

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
that's that's a quick and dirty overview

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.900 
that's that's a quick and dirty overview
of<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.710> the<00:03:03.860> new<00:03:03.980> features<00:03:04.190> but<00:03:04.670> there's

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
of the of the new features but there's

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.700 
of the of the new features but there's
plenty<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.390> more<00:03:05.570> on<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.870> way<00:03:06.020> I<00:03:06.050> think<00:03:06.590> we

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
plenty of more on the way I think we

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.350 
plenty of more on the way I think we
have<00:03:06.740> a<00:03:06.860> kind<00:03:07.160> of<00:03:07.250> pretty<00:03:07.460> flat<00:03:07.730> package<00:03:08.000> here

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
have a kind of pretty flat package here

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.700 
have a kind of pretty flat package here
at<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.630> launch<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.080> with<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.260> lot<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.560> new

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
at the launch and with a lot of new

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.740 
at the launch and with a lot of new
