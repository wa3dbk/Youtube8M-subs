the<00:02:08.910> fuselage<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.720> began<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.619> wonder<00:02:10.800> hey<00:02:11.220> why

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
the fuselage I began to wonder hey why

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.130 
the fuselage I began to wonder hey why
won't<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.879> work<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.480> car

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
won't this work on a car

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.630 
won't this work on a car
I can<00:02:13.319> get<00:02:13.500> under<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.830> dash<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.430> can

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
I can get under the dash and I can

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.610 
I can get under the dash and I can
secure<00:02:15.270> loose<00:02:15.480> wiring<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.140> makes<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.470> very

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
secure loose wiring it makes it very

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.070 
secure loose wiring it makes it very
easy<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.100> release<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.819> when<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:17.970> need<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.300> but

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
easy to release it when I need to but

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.650 
easy to release it when I need to but
more<00:02:19.290> importantly<00:02:19.890> I'm<00:02:20.459> finding<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.510> an

more importantly I'm finding this is an

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.090 
more importantly I'm finding this is an
excellent<00:02:22.260> solution<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.709> some<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
excellent solution to some of the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.800 
excellent solution to some of the
problems<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.610> see<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.270> around<00:02:24.390> diesel

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
problems I see in and around diesel

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.320 
problems I see in and around diesel
engines<00:02:25.200> if<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.890> look<00:02:26.040> at<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.310> 300<00:02:26.819> D<00:02:27.000> here

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
engines if you look at this 300 D here

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.270 
engines if you look at this 300 D here
you<00:02:27.510> can<00:02:27.720> see<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.170> hydraulic<00:02:28.890> hose<00:02:29.069> is

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
you can see this hydraulic hose is

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.100 
you can see this hydraulic hose is
sitting<00:02:29.550> right<00:02:29.580> on<00:02:29.850> top<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.540> radiator<00:02:30.930> hose

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
sitting right on top the radiator hose

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.900 
sitting right on top the radiator hose
and<00:02:31.380> when<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.890> lift<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.280> hose

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
and when I lift the hose

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.660 
and when I lift the hose
I<00:02:32.940> can<00:02:33.480> see<00:02:33.690> chafing<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.740> started<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.610> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
I can see chafing that started on the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.270 
I can see chafing that started on the
hose<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:37.140> know<00:02:37.200> if<00:02:37.320> this<00:02:37.470> were<00:02:37.650> neglected

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
hose you know if this were neglected

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.370 
hose you know if this were neglected
that<00:02:38.490> could<00:02:39.180> cut<00:02:39.420> through<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.690> hose<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.230> it

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
that could cut through the hose and it

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.670 
that could cut through the hose and it
could<00:02:40.590> be<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.770> real<00:02:41.130> problem<00:02:41.370> down<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.820> road<00:02:42.680> so

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
could be a real problem down the road so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.610 
could be a real problem down the road so
the<00:02:43.920> good<00:02:44.130> ol<00:02:44.310> hook<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.030> loop<00:02:45.090> strap<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:46.410> can

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
the good ol hook and loop strap you can

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.510 
the good ol hook and loop strap you can
move<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.640> underneath<00:02:48.000> these<00:02:48.209> hoses<00:02:49.370> pull<00:02:50.370> it

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
move it underneath these hoses pull it

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.470 
move it underneath these hoses pull it
through<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:53.330> tighten<00:02:54.330> this<00:02:54.600> up<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:56.360> look<00:02:57.360> at

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
through and tighten this up and look at

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.979 
through and tighten this up and look at
how<00:02:57.630> how<00:02:58.080> secure<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.810> what's<00:03:00.810> nice

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
how how secure that is and what's nice

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.680 
how how secure that is and what's nice
about<00:03:01.050> it<00:03:01.560> as<00:03:01.680> opposed<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.250> zip<00:03:02.519> tie<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
about it as opposed to a zip tie in the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.720 
about it as opposed to a zip tie in the
future<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.380> release<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.190> very<00:03:05.459> quickly

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
future you can release that very quickly

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.420 
future you can release that very quickly
and<00:03:06.000> reuse<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.690> have<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.739> say<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:07.950> love<00:03:08.250> my

who put the Chuck somewhere or who lost

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.990 
who put the Chuck somewhere or who lost
my<00:03:29.970> Chuck<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.500> finally<00:03:31.829> got<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:32.370> frustrated

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
my Chuck so I finally got so frustrated

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.850 
my Chuck so I finally got so frustrated
you<00:03:33.150> know<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.269> had<00:03:33.630> tried<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:33.959> tie<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.440> on<00:03:34.650> with

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
you know I had tried to tie it on with

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.630 
you know I had tried to tie it on with
strain<00:03:35.220> but<00:03:36.120> that's<00:03:36.299> very<00:03:36.500> cumbersome<00:03:37.610> so<00:03:38.610> I

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
strain but that's very cumbersome so I

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.610 
strain but that's very cumbersome so I
came<00:03:38.760> up<00:03:39.000> with<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.360> idea<00:03:39.600> why<00:03:39.900> not<00:03:40.140> use<00:03:40.380> some

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
came up with the idea why not use some

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.449 
came up with the idea why not use some
velcro<00:03:40.829> so<00:03:41.340> we<00:03:41.459> put<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.730> little<00:03:41.850> velcro<00:03:42.620> on<00:03:43.620> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
velcro so we put a little velcro on the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.350 
velcro so we put a little velcro on the
key<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.739> some<00:03:46.739> hook<00:03:47.010> material<00:03:47.610> on<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.910> top<00:03:48.120> of

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
key and some hook material on the top of

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.020 
key and some hook material on the top of
the<00:03:48.450> press<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.140> look<00:03:49.290> at<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.760> that's<00:03:50.760> where

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
the press and look at that that's where
