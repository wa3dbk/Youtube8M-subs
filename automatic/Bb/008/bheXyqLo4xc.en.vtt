00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
going to be getting much we've got some

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.350 
going to be getting much we've got some
links<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.540> chassis<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.740> iphone<00:02:29.340> 6c<00:02:29.970> or

links of the chassis of the iphone 6c or
7c<00:02:31.050> or<00:02:31.500> whatever<00:02:31.800> it's<00:02:31.920> going<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.100> be<00:02:32.220> dubbed

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
7c or whatever it's going to be dubbed

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.770 
7c or whatever it's going to be dubbed
and<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.820> reason<00:02:33.060> why<00:02:33.150> we<00:02:33.270> call<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.570> way

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
and the reason why we call it that way

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.150 
and the reason why we call it that way
is<00:02:33.840> because<00:02:33.960> it<00:02:34.410> looks<00:02:34.560> pretty<00:02:34.650> much<00:02:34.800> like<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
is because it looks pretty much like the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.790 
is because it looks pretty much like the
iphone<00:02:35.460> 5c<00:02:35.910> all<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.480> have<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> more<00:02:37.530> speaker

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
iphone 5c all you have is a more speaker

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.710 
iphone 5c all you have is a more speaker
grills<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.330> two<00:02:39.480> tone<00:02:39.690> flash

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
grills and you have the two tone flash

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.420 
grills and you have the two tone flash
option<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.530> you'll<00:02:40.620> probably<00:02:40.830> even<00:02:41.100> get

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
option and you'll probably even get

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.910 
option and you'll probably even get
touch<00:02:41.670> ID<00:02:41.880> because<00:02:42.690> why<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.020> heck<00:02:43.320> it's

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
touch ID because why the heck it's

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.620 
touch ID because why the heck it's
probably<00:02:44.160> going<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.490> be<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.850> case<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:45.450> yeah

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
probably going to be that case but yeah

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.810
