you're<00:02:16.420> not<00:02:16.510> gonna<00:02:16.630> get<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.840> much<00:02:16.990> damage

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
you're not gonna get that much damage

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.780 
you're not gonna get that much damage
off<00:02:17.740> ago<00:02:18.040> but<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:21.250> damage<00:02:21.640> actually

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
off ago but that damage actually

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.000 
off ago but that damage actually
compounds<00:02:22.780> really<00:02:23.320> quickly<00:02:23.800> especially

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
compounds really quickly especially

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.920 
compounds really quickly especially
later<00:02:24.580> on<00:02:24.790> because<00:02:25.060> he<00:02:25.210> knows<00:02:25.390> he's<00:02:25.630> adding

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
later on because he knows he's adding

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.860 
later on because he knows he's adding
one<00:02:26.170> extra<00:02:26.530> perk<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.130> each<00:02:27.250> shot<00:02:27.520> later<00:02:28.510> on<00:02:28.720> he

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
one extra perk of each shot later on he

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.870 
one extra perk of each shot later on he
starts<00:02:29.110> doing<00:02:29.380> one<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:29.980> them<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.670> let's

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
starts doing one of them and let's

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.309 
starts doing one of them and let's
actually<00:02:31.000> see<00:02:31.270> how<00:02:31.390> low<00:02:31.600> I<00:02:31.630> can<00:02:31.840> get<00:02:31.990> with<00:02:32.170> just
