00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
wiggle at all while they would go a

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.840 
wiggle at all while they would go a
little<00:03:00.260> bit<00:03:00.470> if<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:00.650> really<00:03:01.190> try<00:03:01.490> and<00:03:01.520> know

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
of this one and down to the final since

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.190 
of this one and down to the final since
I'd<00:03:21.160> basically<00:03:22.160> each<00:03:22.580> light<00:03:23.030> has<00:03:23.570> a<00:03:23.930> wire

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
I'd basically each light has a wire

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.890 
I'd basically each light has a wire
coming<00:03:24.530> in<00:03:24.680> on<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.250> wire<00:03:25.489> going<00:03:25.850> out<00:03:26.030> sort<00:03:26.780> of

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
coming in on a wire going out sort of

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.290 
coming in on a wire going out sort of
like<00:03:27.020> holiday<00:03:27.530> lights<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.850> way<00:03:28.970> I<00:03:29.030> got<00:03:29.150> these

some people call them zip ties like rave
automatic<00:03:34.489> my<00:03:34.610> buddies<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.440> on<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.590> back<00:03:36.800> of

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
automatic my buddies and on the back of

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.460 
automatic my buddies and on the back of
all<00:03:37.220> these<00:03:37.340> pucks<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:38.570> metal<00:03:38.930> shaped<00:03:39.170> like<00:03:39.350> an

all these pucks the metal shaped like an

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.880 
all these pucks the metal shaped like an
X<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.330> can<00:03:41.450> just<00:03:41.480> loop<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.380> around<00:03:42.470> behind

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
X so you can just loop it around behind

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.590 
X so you can just loop it around behind
that<00:03:43.070> X<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.489> then<00:03:43.580> pull<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.820> secure<00:03:44.239> and<00:03:44.420> it'll

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
that X and then pull it secure and it'll

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.710 
that X and then pull it secure and it'll
be<00:03:45.410> flush<00:03:45.739> with<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.980> box<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:47.450> just<00:03:47.570> got<00:03:47.690> to

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
be flush with the box you just got to

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.680 
be flush with the box you just got to
drill<00:03:47.959> two<00:03:48.950> holes<00:03:48.980> one<00:03:49.580> for<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.090> cord<00:03:50.330> going<00:03:50.570> in

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
drill two holes one for a cord going in

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.870 
drill two holes one for a cord going in
and<00:03:50.810> one<00:03:50.900> for<00:03:51.049> a<00:03:51.110> court<00:03:51.380> going<00:03:51.530> out<00:03:51.799> the<00:03:52.670> holes

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
and one for a court going out the holes

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.460 
and one for a court going out the holes
are<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.090> bit<00:03:53.239> bigger<00:03:53.570> than<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.810> wire<00:03:54.019> because

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
are a bit bigger than the wire because

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.000 
are a bit bigger than the wire because
these<00:03:55.209> connectors<00:03:56.209> are<00:03:56.450> pretty<00:03:56.900> big<00:03:57.110> so<00:03:57.830> I<00:03:57.860> had

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
these connectors are pretty big so I had

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.120 
these connectors are pretty big so I had
to<00:03:58.040> make<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.820> holes<00:03:59.000> cut<00:03:59.239> pretty<00:03:59.390> large<00:04:00.130> it

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
to make the holes cut pretty large it

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.160 
to make the holes cut pretty large it
goes<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.430> single<00:04:01.730> wire<00:04:01.880> which<00:04:02.690> is<00:04:02.900> going

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
goes to a single wire which is going

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.380 
goes to a single wire which is going
down<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:03.680> tangled<00:04:04.070> left<00:04:04.250> on<00:04:04.489> their<00:04:04.730> stuff

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
down to that tangled left on their stuff

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.470 
down to that tangled left on their stuff
I<00:04:05.540> clean<00:04:06.049> up<00:04:06.910> basically<00:04:07.910> this<00:04:08.120> is<00:04:08.180> my<00:04:08.360> new

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
I clean up basically this is my new

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.370 
I clean up basically this is my new
spray<00:04:08.780> booth<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.709> plastic<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:11.810> has<00:04:12.170> some

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
spray booth the plastic it has some

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.220 
spray booth the plastic it has some
wiggle<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.829> it<00:04:12.980> fits<00:04:13.820> up<00:04:13.970> against<00:04:14.329> my<00:04:14.510> old

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
wiggle to it fits up against my old

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.370 
wiggle to it fits up against my old
setup<00:04:15.560> here<00:04:16.269> so<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.479> same<00:04:17.660> box<00:04:17.930> fan<00:04:18.200> in<00:04:18.320> the

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
setup here so the same box fan in the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.530 
setup here so the same box fan in the
window<00:04:18.500> that<00:04:18.940> this<00:04:19.940> is<00:04:20.060> your<00:04:20.180> first<00:04:20.359> time
