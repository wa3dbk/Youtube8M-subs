00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
to add so many staff we've grown by 50%

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.160 
to add so many staff we've grown by 50%
to<00:02:08.310> start<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.819> our<00:02:09.000> staff<00:02:09.300> over<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> last<00:02:09.899> few

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
to start in our staff over the last few

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.430 
to start in our staff over the last few
years<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.940> donut<00:02:12.239> economy<00:02:12.690> when<00:02:13.140> as

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
years and in the donut economy when as

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.170 
years and in the donut economy when as
soon<00:02:13.500> as<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.769> economy<00:02:13.860> went<00:02:14.310> down<00:02:14.489> we<00:02:14.819> went

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
soon as the economy went down we went

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.460 
soon as the economy went down we went
back<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.599> work<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.930> really<00:02:16.140> started

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
back to work and really started

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.440 
back to work and really started
reinvesting<00:02:17.069> in<00:02:17.159> the<00:02:17.250> company<00:02:17.640> because<00:02:18.330> we

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
reinvesting in the company because we

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.380 
reinvesting in the company because we
knew<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.690> wasn't<00:02:18.840> gonna<00:02:19.080> last<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:19.890> knew

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
knew it wasn't gonna last and we knew

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.420 
knew it wasn't gonna last and we knew
we<00:02:20.540> were<00:02:20.660> gonna<00:02:20.780> survive<00:02:21.050> we<00:02:21.500> had<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.800> be<00:02:21.980> ready

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
we were gonna survive we had to be ready

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.910 
we were gonna survive we had to be ready
so<00:02:23.300> we<00:02:23.420> started<00:02:23.750> investing<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.290> people<00:02:24.680> we

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
so we started investing in people we

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.460 
so we started investing in people we
invested<00:02:25.430> in<00:02:25.520> technology<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.630> when<00:02:27.230> things

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
invested in technology and when things

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.720 
invested in technology and when things
started<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.860> turn<00:02:27.890> around<00:02:28.160> we<00:02:28.580> were<00:02:28.760> reset<00:02:30.730> and

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
started to turn around we were reset and

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.850 
started to turn around we were reset and
the<00:02:31.910> company's<00:02:32.270> top<00:02:32.510> dermatologist<00:02:32.780> says<00:02:33.590> the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
the company's top dermatologist says the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.380 
the company's top dermatologist says the
best<00:02:34.070> thing<00:02:34.190> we<00:02:34.370> can<00:02:34.520> do<00:02:34.640> for<00:02:34.670> our<00:02:34.910> skin<00:02:35.240> is

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
best thing we can do for our skin is

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.330 
best thing we can do for our skin is
sunscreen<00:02:35.930> which<00:02:36.080> makes<00:02:36.290> sense<00:02:36.530> right<00:02:36.800> but<00:02:36.950> if

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
sunscreen which makes sense right but if

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.130 
sunscreen which makes sense right but if
you're<00:02:37.550> counting<00:02:38.060> on<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.270> SPF<00:02:38.750> in<00:02:39.020> your

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
you're counting on the SPF in your

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.230 
you're counting on the SPF in your
foundation<00:02:39.680> or<00:02:39.860> your<00:02:39.920> moisturizer<00:02:40.670> she<00:02:41.000> says

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
foundation or your moisturizer she says

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.700 
foundation or your moisturizer she says
think<00:02:41.960> again

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
think again

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.680 
think again
wearing<00:02:43.640> just<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.940> foundation<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.510> actually

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
wearing just a foundation is actually

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.900 
wearing just a foundation is actually
not<00:02:45.230> enough<00:02:45.560> because<00:02:45.830> usually<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.459> sunscreen

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
not enough because usually the sunscreen

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.640 
not enough because usually the sunscreen
number<00:02:47.330> isn't<00:02:47.510> high<00:02:47.780> enough<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.290> it

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
number isn't high enough and it

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.350 
number isn't high enough and it
typically<00:02:48.920> doesn't<00:02:49.190> have<00:02:49.400> both<00:02:49.580> UVA<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.150> UVB

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
typically doesn't have both UVA and UVB

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.300 
typically doesn't have both UVA and UVB
and<00:02:51.020> even<00:02:51.200> more<00:02:51.350> importantly<00:02:51.709> people<00:02:52.010> tend<00:02:52.250> to

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
and even more importantly people tend to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.610 
and even more importantly people tend to
not<00:02:52.490> apply<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:52.880> thick<00:02:53.630> enough<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.930> really<00:02:54.470> get

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
not apply it thick enough to really get

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.050 
not apply it thick enough to really get
the<00:02:54.770> full<00:02:54.980> benefit<00:02:55.430> from<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.700> number<00:02:55.940> that's

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
the full benefit from the number that's

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.750 
the full benefit from the number that's
even<00:02:56.450> registered<00:02:57.520> even<00:02:58.520> if<00:02:58.610> you're<00:02:58.730> just

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
even registered even if you're just

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.790 
even registered even if you're just
commuting<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.540> from<00:02:59.600> work<00:02:59.780> UVA<00:03:00.500> rays

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
commuting to and from work UVA rays

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.140 
commuting to and from work UVA rays
actually<00:03:01.190> go<00:03:01.310> through<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.550> window<00:03:01.790> glass<00:03:01.970> of

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
actually go through the window glass of

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.540 
actually go through the window glass of
the<00:03:02.239> car<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.410> UVA<00:03:03.709> rays<00:03:03.980> break<00:03:04.370> down

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
the car and so the UVA rays break down

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.220 
the car and so the UVA rays break down
the<00:03:04.640> collagen<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.209> guess<00:03:05.390> what<00:03:05.570> that<00:03:05.810> means

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
the collagen and guess what that means

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.260 
the collagen and guess what that means
aging<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:07.070> if<00:03:07.400> you<00:03:07.520> want<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.730> protect<00:03:08.030> yourself

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
aging so if you want to protect yourself

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.970 
aging so if you want to protect yourself
from<00:03:08.300> aging<00:03:08.750> it's<00:03:08.989> really<00:03:09.410> means<00:03:09.590> applying

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
from aging it's really means applying

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.820 
from aging it's really means applying
sunscreen<00:03:10.190> every<00:03:10.790> day
