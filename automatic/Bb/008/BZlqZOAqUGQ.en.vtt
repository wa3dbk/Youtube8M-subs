00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
take a look at another thing i really

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.630 
take a look at another thing i really
think<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.500> worth<00:00:28.680> mentioning<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.490> game

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
think is worth mentioning is this game

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.400 
think is worth mentioning is this game
really<00:00:29.789> shows<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.150> diversity<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.869> genres

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
really shows the diversity of genres

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.650 
really shows the diversity of genres
that<00:00:31.439> are<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> pc<00:00:32.250> platform<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.940> game<00:00:33.480> like

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that are on the pc platform a game like

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.080 
that are on the pc platform a game like
this<00:00:33.870> wouldn't<00:00:34.410> necessarily<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.790> my

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
this wouldn't necessarily be in my

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.240 
this wouldn't necessarily be in my
opinion<00:00:36.390> very<00:00:36.630> successful<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.320> on<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.710> console

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
opinion very successful on on a console

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.520 
opinion very successful on on a console
not<00:00:38.969> only<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.450> kind<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.840> third<00:00:40.079> person

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
not only is it kind of that third person

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.100 
not only is it kind of that third person
mode<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.100> know<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> RTS<00:00:41.940> type<00:00:42.480> camera<00:00:42.899> style

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
mode you know the RTS type camera style

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.170 
mode you know the RTS type camera style
that<00:00:43.379> really<00:00:44.040> doesn't<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> console

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that really doesn't do so on the console

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.850 
that really doesn't do so on the console
but<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.780> my<00:00:45.870> opinion<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.379> wouldn't<00:00:46.770> really

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
but in my opinion it wouldn't really

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.549 
but in my opinion it wouldn't really
attract<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.670> type<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.940> game<00:00:48.239> are<00:00:48.420> either<00:00:51.559> but

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
attract that type of game are either but

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.529 
attract that type of game are either but
