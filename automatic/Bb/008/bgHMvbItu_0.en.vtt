something like June 9th but I do have
the<00:00:14.099> engine<00:00:14.940> cover<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.360> fan<00:00:16.670> finished<00:00:17.670> and

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
the engine cover and fan finished and

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.779 
the engine cover and fan finished and
it's<00:00:18.090> temporarily<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:19.020> position<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:20.580> can<00:00:20.760> see

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
it's temporarily in position you can see

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.750 
it's temporarily in position you can see
where<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> battery<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.779> gonna<00:00:21.930> go<00:00:22.170> over<00:00:22.380> on

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
where the battery is gonna go over on

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.310 
where the battery is gonna go over on
the<00:00:23.760> right<00:00:23.970> side<00:00:24.000> rather<00:00:24.660> than<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.199> the

coming<00:00:43.170> out<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.469> back<00:00:43.680> over<00:00:44.250> here<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.850> don't

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
coming out the back over here I don't

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.400 
coming out the back over here I don't
know<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.079> very

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
know if you can see it this is very

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.479 
know if you can see it this is very
difficult<00:00:46.980> from<00:00:47.160> where<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.430> am<00:00:49.100> but<00:00:50.100> right<00:00:50.309> now

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
difficult from where I am but right now

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.700 
difficult from where I am but right now
we're<00:00:50.820> working<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.629> throttle<00:00:52.140> bodies<00:00:52.469> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
we're working on the throttle bodies to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.910 
we're working on the throttle bodies to
get<00:00:52.860> them<00:00:53.449> converted<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.570> mechanical<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:56.030> the

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
get them converted to mechanical and the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.020 
get them converted to mechanical and the
dashboard<00:00:58.920> I'm<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> try<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.460> zoom<00:00:59.760> in

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
dashboard I'm going to try to zoom in

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.790 
dashboard I'm going to try to zoom in
here<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.449> dashboard<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.140> put<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> bunch<00:01:01.649> of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
here to dashboard I put a bunch of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.020 
here to dashboard I put a bunch of
symbols<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.070> could<00:01:05.309> read<00:01:05.549> what<00:01:05.850> was

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
symbols on it so you could read what was

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.230 
symbols on it so you could read what was
going<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.750> each<00:01:06.780> gauge<00:01:07.229> which<00:01:07.939> which<00:01:08.939> one

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
going on with each gauge which which one

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.660 
going on with each gauge which which one
was<00:01:09.479> servicing<00:01:10.110> which<00:01:11.630> which<00:01:12.630> engine<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:14.960> I

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
was servicing which which engine and I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.399 
was servicing which which engine and I
guess<00:01:17.670> some<00:01:17.880> wiring<00:01:18.119> has<00:01:18.509> been<00:01:18.720> started<00:01:19.259> we

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
guess some wiring has been started we

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.260 
guess some wiring has been started we
have<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.560> computer<00:01:20.250> we're<00:01:20.400> running<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.970> 12

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
have the computer we're running a 12

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.749 
have the computer we're running a 12
cylinder<00:01:21.570> computer<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:23.729> we're<00:01:24.090> gonna<00:01:24.180> run

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
cylinder computer and we're gonna run

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.260 
cylinder computer and we're gonna run
one<00:01:26.759> piston<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.689> each<00:01:28.560> cylinder<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:30.060> each

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
one piston in each cylinder in each

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.200 
one piston in each cylinder in each
engine<00:01:30.570> at<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.799> same<00:01:32.070> time<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.729> opposite

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
engine at the same time on opposite

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.020 
engine at the same time on opposite
sides<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.720> engine<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.320> balance<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:35.790> we'll

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
sides of the engine for balance so we'll

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.240 
sides of the engine for balance so we'll
have<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:36.960> 12<00:01:37.259> cylinder<00:01:37.740> computer

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
have like in this 12 cylinder computer

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.249 
have like in this 12 cylinder computer
you'll<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.180> first<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.689> second<00:01:40.110> one

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
you'll have the first and second one

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.370 
you'll have the first and second one
firing<00:01:41.220> cylinder<00:01:42.090> one<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> front<00:01:42.899> engine

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
firing cylinder one in the front engine

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.240 
firing cylinder one in the front engine
and<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:44.189> will<00:01:44.340> fire<00:01:44.610> cylinder<00:01:45.299> two<00:01:45.509> or<00:01:46.250> six

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
and it will fire cylinder two or six

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.399 
and it will fire cylinder two or six
depending<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.240> how<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.780> set<00:01:48.899> up<00:01:49.170> we

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
depending on how I have it set up we

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.260 
depending on how I have it set up we
haven't<00:01:49.649> checked<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> yet<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.939> see<00:01:51.119> what

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
haven't checked it yet to see what

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.639 
haven't checked it yet to see what
cylinder<00:01:51.720> we're<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.229> we'll<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
cylinder we're on but we'll be on the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.859 
cylinder we're on but we'll be on the
opposite<00:01:53.159> side<00:01:53.460> we'll<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.909> firing<00:01:54.180> two<00:01:54.509> at<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
opposite side we'll be firing two at the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.749 
opposite side we'll be firing two at the
same<00:01:55.079> time<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:57.180> should<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:58.549> making<00:01:59.549> some

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
same time and it should be making some

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.679 
same time and it should be making some
very<00:01:59.939> nice<00:02:00.450> music<00:02:00.780> out<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.320> back<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.740> car

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
very nice music out the back of the car

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.389 
very nice music out the back of the car
the<00:02:03.689> next<00:02:03.930> video<00:02:04.170> will<00:02:04.439> be<00:02:04.469> hopefully<00:02:05.250> this

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
the next video will be hopefully this

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.930 
the next video will be hopefully this
car<00:02:05.640> running<00:02:07.250> its<00:02:08.250> way<00:02:08.399> behind<00:02:08.759> schedule
