that<00:02:18.940> it's<00:02:19.300> reflecting<00:02:19.900> what<00:02:20.020> we're<00:02:20.140> having

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
that it's reflecting what we're having

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.530 
that it's reflecting what we're having
to<00:02:20.470> do<00:02:20.560> in<00:02:20.680> reality<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.370> thus<00:02:22.210> were<00:02:22.360> more

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
to do in reality and thus were more

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.040 
to do in reality and thus were more
efficient<00:02:22.960> I<00:02:23.200> think<00:02:24.040> it's<00:02:24.130> great<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.690> last

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
efficient I think it's great the last

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.330 
efficient I think it's great the last
two<00:02:26.320> or<00:02:26.350> three<00:02:26.440> years<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.890> seems<00:02:27.070> like<00:02:27.190> we've

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
two or three years it seems like we've

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.040 
two or three years it seems like we've
