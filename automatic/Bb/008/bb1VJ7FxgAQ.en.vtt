00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
to do it takes in an extra second and

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.090 
to do it takes in an extra second and
often<00:02:53.060> you'll<00:02:53.209> find<00:02:53.510> things<00:02:53.810> like<00:02:53.930> oh<00:02:54.230> darling

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
but just do a quick scan takes a split

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.130 
but just do a quick scan takes a split
second<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.180> do<00:03:05.299> look<00:03:05.660> at<00:03:05.780> all<00:03:05.900> four<00:03:06.110> corners

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140
