00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 quite in this video here on the channel 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.100
 and catch the next episode 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.270
 We want to start again with the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.859
 next episode if you like it 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.940
 truck today with the thumb up there 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.170
 would be a great support 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.219
 further support in the video 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.380
 description possible know 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.370
 instagram twitter facebook rangers and 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.199
 of course Amazon 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.869
 we play in the first game today 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.770
 the fc schalke 04 1 2 borussia 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.289
 mönchengladbach why with schalke completely 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.609
 simply it was said max you like 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.470
 have something different against strikes 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.140
 agreed i said that mind there 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.150
 does not fit that way or me 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.520
 wonderfully, do not switch to lazio 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.350
 rome was moderately though and actually plays 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.840
 Schalk generally full what they train 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.149
 goes some recent months, especially in 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.649
 but it was good to her chaos club 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.780
 nothing is generally against the schwaig 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.180
 is only something against the current policy 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.530
 So I think that's the only one 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.059
 I think many fans behind 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.500
 I really do not have anything against Schalke 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.920
 that does not even celebrate at night or 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.480
 like this 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.890
 there are others who are clearly worse 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.640
 as the beginning with the first question for 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.739
 this episode 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.809
 and that comes from the max and that asks me 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.949
 namely what I like now after the abi 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.510
 I would like to do something now 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.829
 to do the school 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.729
 I will be air traffic controller at least 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.320
 that my plan I am from 12 to 14 times 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.610
 on the way again and try this 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.720
 to fulfill a dream let's see if it works 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.490
 of course, is not so easy but 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.290
 will see how the whole thing would run 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.110
 they will also learn what do you think 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.869
 transfers from poldi nani and rw p 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.979
 So Robin van Persie in the super 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.350
 league so to fenerbahce and 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.180
 galatasaray want to know Elias and sql 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.130
 and I have to say it has me 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.479
 surprised that nani goes there 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.100
 I'm not surprised that model 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.290
 thrive and if so like Peter 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.759
 really should be informed 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.860
 It may be that it is so 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.880
 not like that 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.950
 impress fans because there are really 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.850
 Great names for the league but it is 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.710
 Keep that up a bit again 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.479
 Cliché the old player somehow 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.770
 nothing more traveling there is something to go 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.659
 It's a pity because that's how it comes 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.579
 league not out of this 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.689
 drawer thinking out in itself is the 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.429
 Of course, super league not even that way 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.749
 interesting but let's see how they look 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.369
 develop I will definitely be 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.630
 In some cases look at what is 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.609
 currently a favorite song about which 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.020
 Are you celebrating what are you looking fabian and 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.630
 the relatively easy to answer the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.109
 ligna track most but mostly 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.090
 playback 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:04.099
 it continues with the job in the tv or 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.659
 youtube would be twice as good 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.219
 next marl and youtube it depends 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.690
 what I would do if I did 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.369
 the presenter of a own show would be the 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.129
 I would maybe do football 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.269
 even to do that to be honest because 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.500
 it's just awesome even more 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.660
 reach and so on and so forth 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.340
 it is usually only with sky 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.780
 to advertise that would like to know 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.340
 since the question of benjamin dietrich even 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.709
 not said if it does then it had 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.180
 now double belongs to sky advertise 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.769
 is a bit of a thing when it comes with 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.269
 the air traffic controller should work that is 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.370
 If I can fulfill my dream 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.690
 then I will not go to sky 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.400
 otherwise this is definitely the case 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.560
 an option that I have in the back of my head 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.000
 sport management would be sport in itself 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.129
 something with football in the journalism 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.329
 Best case in the direction of my goal 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.709
 She was going to school after school 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.480
 If that does not work now 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.440
 but also apply to sky during the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.400
 possibility he has that a bit 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.079
 what sports journalism and 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.750
 sports management partly to do there 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.459
 somehow something like sports marketing 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.049
 In any case, that would be in itself 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.489
 interesting , I have to say quite honestly 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.980
 because i would have liked it someday 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.180
 so okay now a new marcel is ripe too 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.900
 But you know what I mean 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.849
 one of them 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.230
 of the top commentators someday 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.459
 of course it's a long way off 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.709
 I'm definitely not on that 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.329
 level so far but I guess I 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.340
 have very good predisposition for it before 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.290
 all because I like talking that way 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.519
 possibly a possibility would be for 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.530
 my future when he my appeals 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.209
 should not work what stops 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.530
 you from the dance value of spanish to 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.880
 hamburger mainz end game from hanover 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.739
 wanted to know everything 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.329
 No, I am so happy that Hanover itself 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.799
 such a group not a blatant example 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.840
 has because I have never made 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.760
 This has never been this since not just here 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.049
 the folder has boxed that is me 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.370
 No shit what the reasons 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.889
 were or the type is simply a 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.269
 asshole place and I hate that clear 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.560
 is such a player must give the 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.819
 just really one here 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.160
 raushauen and so on and so on the 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.150
 let's say it will not be like this or 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.919
 take a break in between 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.419
 but the guy is already turning in each 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.160
 really by the game is already at 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.139
 leverkusen really almost every game 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.340
 turned off and leverkusener the best 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.629
 defensive of the league how is it about 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.459
 hamburg will not be there any types 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.550
 from just after this misfire would have been there 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.750
 I honestly wish 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.640
 men's bundesliga to use but comes 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.780
 Well he goes to hamburg in general that was 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.370
 another question i know that right now 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.320
 not even from the corporate policy of 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.030
 hamburg after so far this old that 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.410
 seems to be quite good but says 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.730
 heider, stuttgart is also more than happy 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.780
 that they are going on and why they are 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.610
 have brought I understand not so 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.690
 will almost us them too 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.340
 westermann can act 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.150
 that does not make any big for me now 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.500
 German only that soon 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.850
 unsympathetic is good 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.930
 He should now again no hectic 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.160
 in hamburg its what truth is now 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.700
 really not a player at all 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.010
 may suffer 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.940
 So, what would you like to do for 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.290
 a team will train the 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.180
 I would have chosen completely 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.410
 honest at manchester city or 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.520
 Hannover 69 may decide yet 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.500
 again the third, the three clubs are 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.700
 alma city because I have the money and 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.560
 because I'm in the best league in the world 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.910
 play real madrid because i'm at 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.950
 Perhaps best was in the world games 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.240
 and hannover 60 hearts fell so is 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.600
 Something like that in the direction would be there 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.050
 yes my wish is becoming more and more sarcastic 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.270
 also hare and city in england in 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.410
 Germany Hanover and in England 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.390
 spain and real like that would be my choice though 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.980
 I choose you he should rené 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.060
 ask why do I do so little marcel scorpion 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.170
 makes although clearly good colleagues 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.220
 yes we are also good colleagues completely 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.870
 just really not much together 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.400
 to do 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.320
 we would have diverged 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.490
 so beautiful marcel has in cologne in 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.840
 Cologne is meanwhile can and 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.000
 düsseldorf i know with every teacher 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.250
 yes, a friend at his side 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.110
 and lives to a very nice 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.669
 distance away does another 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.970
 category of videos has become 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.650
 specialized and therefore is easy 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.360
 too big to be with now 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.860
 Somehow here again from time to time 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.510
 Let's make video again but what 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.650
 we are no longer wanting it too 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.360
 not bad because it how you develop 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.300
 continue and we will always be 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.290
 so to speak, get along well then goes 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.120
 I'm getting a bit crowded 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.890
 convinced what he thinks of buschi tv and 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.630
 knows how his interviews do with 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.520
 reasonable sports office known 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.540
 athletes nowitzki has the garbage he has 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.700
 now the warehouse is more there 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.290
 he was before that but still great exactly 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.180
 I think finding the right one is cool 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.320
 I really like the reaction 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.460
 We just watched the videos 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.210
 again extreme case interview 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.410
 friends on mertesacker 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.510
 because that's one of my favorites 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.890
 soccer player is also why you're so was 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.020
 By the way, coins are there by the way 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.450
 I generally do not ask three more 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.919
 why you're whole 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.720
 in fukushima comes more often I have 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.680
 simply like to 2000 münster should the 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.880
 great and also 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.699
 That does not knock you on the table 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.620
 one more game gets going and I like it 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:07.060
 Do not stop for soon - short for 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.320
 a game so many calls excerpts because so 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.610
 I do not have much, and I am 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.910
 not working or something and so on 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.110
 multimillionaire somehow 20,000 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.460
 Buy millions of coins 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.900
 That's why I'm a bit there 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.460
 more economical I am also relative 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.080
 sparingly human why do not you have 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.970
 train like vettel or in the lions cup 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.550
 with at vettel I was asked and 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.289
 gripping and the lions club well 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.300
 I do not have any with Lyons meanwhile 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.830
 a lot more to do I had a good one 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.990
 relationship with him is meanwhile that 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.240
 rusty or whenever 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.400
 and therefore why did lyons break down 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.720
 do I have no reason 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.150
 have seen now somehow the 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.599
 yes the incentive seen with it 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.630
 do 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:44.949
 from therefore well exit clause in 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.479
 Career mode is the last question for 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:47.560
 By the way, this episode, what would you do 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:48.759
 One of them , I believe , is the career 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.139
 Mode will evolve the super 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.820
 and got out clause will therefore 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:52.840
 also what new something brought in 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.880
 I still could not be sure if that 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.900
 but we can just go to the 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.639
 career mode is happy and it can 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.900
 be sure that something comes in 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:00.310
 it gets even more realistic 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.110
 make that what we all are in 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.729
 Career mode quite like to have 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.930
 That 's what happened on this episode 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.970
 he does not have to be here right now 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.440
 a bit more like guessing the solo 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.610
 is over because I do not see anything anymore 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.720
 days has the task of the 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.389
 volunteers or cancel 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.010
 so I hope you like it 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:16.659
 when he read his thumb up there as we did 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.120
 who wants to become properly gladbach 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:20.710
 correctness of cha can be seen 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.570
 we find the comments we once found 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.949
 that was such a variation that one to the 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.849
 rarely sees and of course about the 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:26.199
 see teams in the next episode 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:27.729
 wanted and that as we said at 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:31.199
 then these next hours again bit 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:31.199
 beautiful day still hau 3
