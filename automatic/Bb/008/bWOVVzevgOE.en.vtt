00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.750 

this<00:00:06.560> is<00:00:06.680> an<00:00:06.740> example<00:00:07.100> for<00:00:07.400> a<00:00:07.460> single

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
this is an example for a single

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.940 
this is an example for a single
condensable<00:00:08.330> component<00:00:09.020> for<00:00:09.530> vapor<00:00:09.740> liquid

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
condensable component for vapor liquid

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.920 
condensable component for vapor liquid
equilibrium<00:00:10.190> in<00:00:10.730> this<00:00:10.820> case<00:00:11.059> we<00:00:11.270> have<00:00:11.510> liquid

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:11.930 
equilibrium in this case we have liquid

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.410 
equilibrium in this case we have liquid
water<00:00:11.980> in<00:00:12.980> equilibrium<00:00:13.610> with<00:00:13.850> water<00:00:14.180> vapor

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
water in equilibrium with water vapor

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.359 
water in equilibrium with water vapor
and<00:00:14.600> air<00:00:14.900> and<00:00:15.320> this<00:00:15.650> isn't<00:00:15.950> a<00:00:16.010> piston<00:00:16.340> cylinder

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
and air and this isn't a piston cylinder

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.560 
and air and this isn't a piston cylinder
type<00:00:17.270> system<00:00:17.840> so<00:00:18.710> we<00:00:18.830> start<00:00:19.039> with<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.190> drawing

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
type system so we start with the drawing

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.640 
type system so we start with the drawing
the<00:00:20.570> idea<00:00:20.810> is<00:00:20.900> that<00:00:20.990> we<00:00:21.080> have<00:00:21.170> a<00:00:21.199> piston<00:00:21.529> with

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
the idea is that we have a piston with

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.970 
the idea is that we have a piston with
weight<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.720> liquid<00:00:23.720> water<00:00:23.960> in<00:00:24.830> equilibrium

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
weight and liquid water in equilibrium

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.020 
weight and liquid water in equilibrium
with<00:00:25.490> water<00:00:25.730> vapor<00:00:25.940> and<00:00:26.270> air<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:28.730> total

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.030 
with water vapor and air the total

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.910 
with water vapor and air the total
pressure<00:00:29.560> defined<00:00:30.560> in<00:00:30.680> the<00:00:30.740> problem

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
pressure defined in the problem

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.330 
pressure defined in the problem
statement<00:00:31.190> is<00:00:31.370> 1.2<00:00:31.970> atmosphere<00:00:32.920> since<00:00:33.920> it<00:00:34.219> is

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
statement is 1.2 atmosphere since it is

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.639 
statement is 1.2 atmosphere since it is
a<00:00:34.370> piston<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.090> cylinder<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:36.079> we<00:00:36.469> don't

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
a piston and cylinder and we don't

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.529 
a piston and cylinder and we don't
change<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:37.190> weight<00:00:37.460> that<00:00:38.120> means<00:00:38.269> we<00:00:38.420> keep

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
change the weight that means we keep

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.319 
change the weight that means we keep
that<00:00:38.749> pressure<00:00:38.960> constant<00:00:39.710> we<00:00:40.399> are<00:00:40.519> also<00:00:40.730> going

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
that pressure constant we are also going

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.119 
that pressure constant we are also going
to<00:00:41.390> keep<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.780> temperature<00:00:42.379> constant<00:00:42.649> as

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
to keep the temperature constant as

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.139 
to keep the temperature constant as
specified<00:00:44.120> in<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:45.109> problem<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:46.670> question<00:00:47.030> is

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
specified in the problem the question is

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.309 
specified in the problem the question is
if<00:00:47.329> we<00:00:47.359> were<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:47.569> attach<00:00:47.839> some<00:00:48.079> kind<00:00:48.289> of

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:48.319 
if we were to attach some kind of

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.130 
if we were to attach some kind of
syringe<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.129> remove<00:00:49.909> some<00:00:49.940> of<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.569> air<00:00:50.749> but

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
syringe and remove some of the air but

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.319 
syringe and remove some of the air but
no<00:00:51.289> water<00:00:51.530> vapor<00:00:51.769> what<00:00:52.429> would<00:00:52.519> happen<00:00:52.879> in<00:00:53.089> this

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
no water vapor what would happen in this

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.630 
no water vapor what would happen in this
system<00:00:53.809> so<00:00:54.679> let's<00:00:54.890> look<00:00:55.039> at<00:00:55.190> this<00:00:55.370> from<00:00:55.519> the

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
system so let's look at this from the

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.149 
system so let's look at this from the
viewpoint<00:00:56.089> of<00:00:56.269> using<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.050> ideal<00:00:57.260> gas<00:00:57.499> law<00:00:57.559> and

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
viewpoint of using the ideal gas law and

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.579 
viewpoint of using the ideal gas law and
assuming<00:00:58.519> vapor<00:00:58.729> liquid<00:00:58.940> equilibrium<00:00:59.469> if<00:01:00.469> we

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
assuming vapor liquid equilibrium if we

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.290 
assuming vapor liquid equilibrium if we
keep<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.920> temperature<00:01:01.309> constant<00:01:01.339> then<00:01:02.120> it

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
keep the temperature constant then it

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.240 
keep the temperature constant then it
means<00:01:02.479> that<00:01:02.659> the<00:01:03.019> saturation<00:01:03.289> pressure<00:01:03.979> for

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
means that the saturation pressure for

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.730 
means that the saturation pressure for
water<00:01:04.430> would<00:01:05.059> not<00:01:05.239> change<00:01:05.570> since<00:01:06.049> it's<00:01:06.229> just<00:01:06.320> a

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
water would not change since it's just a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.530 
water would not change since it's just a
function<00:01:07.159> of<00:01:07.310> temperature<00:01:07.490> we<00:01:08.390> could

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
function of temperature we could

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.300 
function of temperature we could
calculate<00:01:08.720> that<00:01:09.229> using<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.920> Antoine

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
calculate that using the Antoine

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.850 
calculate that using the Antoine
equations<00:01:11.200> so<00:01:12.200> we<00:01:12.230> start<00:01:12.560> out<00:01:12.680> with<00:01:12.710> the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
equations so we start out with the

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.040 
equations so we start out with the
pressure<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.310> water<00:01:13.460> must<00:01:14.000> be<00:01:14.180> at<00:01:14.390> peace<00:01:14.750> at

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
pressure the water must be at peace at

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.680 
pressure the water must be at peace at
because<00:01:15.920> we're<00:01:16.190> at<00:01:16.460> vapor<00:01:17.420> liquid

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
because we're at vapor liquid

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.590 
because we're at vapor liquid
equilibrium<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.650> there's<00:01:18.890> no<00:01:19.130> air<00:01:19.400> in<00:01:19.880> the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
equilibrium and there's no air in the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.490 
equilibrium and there's no air in the
water<00:01:21.250> when<00:01:22.250> we<00:01:22.430> remove<00:01:22.910> some<00:01:23.270> of<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.570> air<00:01:23.660> we

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
water when we remove some of the air we

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.550 
water when we remove some of the air we
decrease<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.130> gas<00:01:25.490> phase<00:01:25.820> volume<00:01:26.410> but<00:01:27.410> we're

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
decrease the gas phase volume but we're

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.970 
decrease the gas phase volume but we're
keeping<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:28.130> total<00:01:28.460> pressure<00:01:28.940> constant<00:01:29.690> and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
keeping the total pressure constant and

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.260 
keeping the total pressure constant and
the<00:01:30.980> total<00:01:31.280> pressure<00:01:31.460> is<00:01:31.760> the<00:01:31.880> pressure<00:01:31.910> of

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
the total pressure is the pressure of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.490 
the total pressure is the pressure of
the<00:01:32.330> air<00:01:32.480> and<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.320> pressure<00:01:33.590> of<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.280> water

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
the air and the pressure of the water

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.900 
the air and the pressure of the water
now<00:01:36.500> we<00:01:36.560> know<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.920> total<00:01:37.070> pressure<00:01:37.520> is<00:01:37.730> 1.2

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
now we know the total pressure is 1.2

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.670 
now we know the total pressure is 1.2
atmospheres<00:01:38.720> but<00:01:38.810> we<00:01:38.990> don't<00:01:39.140> really<00:01:39.350> know<00:01:39.500> the

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
atmospheres but we don't really know the

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.320 
atmospheres but we don't really know the
values<00:01:40.070> of<00:01:40.190> these<00:01:40.280> other<00:01:40.520> numbers<00:01:40.700> but<00:01:41.090> we<00:01:41.210> can

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
values of these other numbers but we can

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330 
values of these other numbers but we can
pick<00:01:41.420> reasonable<00:01:41.990> amounts<00:01:42.440> based<00:01:42.650> on<00:01:42.950> their

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
pick reasonable amounts based on their

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.160 
pick reasonable amounts based on their
temperatures<00:01:43.880> since<00:01:44.420> we<00:01:44.600> know<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.810> partial

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
temperatures since we know the partial

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.660 
temperatures since we know the partial
pressure<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.470> water<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.740> just<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.070> saturation

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
pressure of water is just the saturation

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.730 
pressure of water is just the saturation
pressure<00:01:46.940> will<00:01:47.720> choose<00:01:47.870> 0.1<00:01:48.260> atmosphere

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
pressure will choose 0.1 atmosphere

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.710 
pressure will choose 0.1 atmosphere
since<00:01:48.920> that's<00:01:49.130> pretty<00:01:49.340> reasonable<00:01:49.720> this

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
since that's pretty reasonable this

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.260 
since that's pretty reasonable this
won't<00:01:51.050> change<00:01:51.440> so<00:01:51.680> that<00:01:51.860> means<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:52.970> the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
won't change so that means that the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.990 
won't change so that means that the
partial<00:01:53.540> pressure<00:01:53.810> of<00:01:53.930> air<00:01:54.050> won't<00:01:54.230> change<00:01:55.000> so

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
partial pressure of air won't change so

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.280 
partial pressure of air won't change so
if<00:01:56.060> we<00:01:56.150> start<00:01:56.360> at<00:01:56.420> one<00:01:56.540> point<00:01:56.660> one<00:01:56.870> atmospheres

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
if we start at one point one atmospheres

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.870 
if we start at one point one atmospheres
then<00:01:57.530> we'll<00:01:57.680> finish<00:01:58.130> at<00:01:58.310> one<00:01:58.460> point<00:01:58.730> one

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
then we'll finish at one point one

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.570 
then we'll finish at one point one
atmospheres<00:01:59.710> so<00:02:00.710> what<00:02:00.890> does<00:02:01.010> this<00:02:01.100> mean<00:02:01.280> if<00:02:01.460> we

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
atmospheres so what does this mean if we

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.670 
atmospheres so what does this mean if we
remove<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.120> water<00:02:02.360> well<00:02:03.140> we<00:02:03.260> can<00:02:03.380> take<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.530> look

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
remove the water well we can take a look

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.700 
remove the water well we can take a look
at<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:03.860> ideal<00:02:04.070> gas<00:02:04.130> law<00:02:04.280> for<00:02:04.670> air<00:02:05.650> for<00:02:06.650> the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
at the ideal gas law for air for the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.350 
at the ideal gas law for air for the
ideal<00:02:06.920> gas<00:02:07.220> law<00:02:07.280> for<00:02:07.790> this<00:02:07.909> air<00:02:08.090> it's<00:02:08.300> just

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
ideal gas law for this air it's just

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.550 
ideal gas law for this air it's just
going<00:02:08.569> to<00:02:08.659> be<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.899> pressure<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.349> the<00:02:09.440> air

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
going to be the pressure of the air

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.470 
going to be the pressure of the air
times<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.039> volume<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.640> that's<00:02:11.000> going<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.300> be

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
times the volume and that's going to be

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.449 
times the volume and that's going to be
equal<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.290> moles<00:02:12.500> gas<00:02:13.010> constant

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
equal to the moles gas constant

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.650 
equal to the moles gas constant
temperature<00:02:13.850> we<00:02:13.880> know<00:02:14.060> temperature<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.569> gas

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
temperature we know temperature and gas

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.170 
temperature we know temperature and gas
constant<00:02:15.170> constant<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:16.580> case<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.090> the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
constant constant in this case and the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.360 
constant constant in this case and the
pressure<00:02:17.390> is<00:02:17.600> one<00:02:17.750> point<00:02:17.990> one<00:02:18.140> atmosphere

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
pressure is one point one atmosphere

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.850 
pressure is one point one atmosphere
so<00:02:19.940> if<00:02:20.090> we're<00:02:20.269> decreasing<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.140> moles<00:02:21.349> of<00:02:21.560> air

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
so if we're decreasing the moles of air

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.390 
so if we're decreasing the moles of air
since<00:02:22.220> we're<00:02:23.000> moving<00:02:23.209> them<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.980> means<00:02:25.190> that

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
since we're moving them that means that

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.320 
since we're moving them that means that
the<00:02:25.519> volume<00:02:25.730> must<00:02:26.209> also<00:02:26.920> decrease<00:02:28.330> removed

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
the volume must also decrease removed

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.470 
the volume must also decrease removed
half<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.690> air<00:02:29.840> which<00:02:30.200> means<00:02:30.440> that<00:02:30.709> we'll<00:02:31.480> have

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
half the air which means that we'll have

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.930 
half the air which means that we'll have
half<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.319> initial<00:02:33.950> volume<00:02:34.099> that<00:02:34.400> we<00:02:34.550> did<00:02:34.730> in

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
half the initial volume that we did in

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.809 
half the initial volume that we did in
the<00:02:35.030> container<00:02:36.010> we<00:02:37.010> can<00:02:37.040> also<00:02:37.280> write<00:02:37.640> the

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
the container we can also write the

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.759 
the container we can also write the
partial<00:02:38.090> pressure<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.660> water<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:39.319> terms<00:02:39.590> of

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
partial pressure of water in terms of

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.460 
partial pressure of water in terms of
the<00:02:39.860> ideal<00:02:40.069> gas<00:02:40.280> law<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.750> we<00:02:41.870> can<00:02:41.989> say<00:02:42.140> that<00:02:42.349> the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
the ideal gas law so we can say that the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.170 
the ideal gas law so we can say that the
partial<00:02:42.830> pressure<00:02:43.099> of<00:02:43.190> water<00:02:43.250> times<00:02:44.000> the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
volume of the container it's going to be

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.210 
volume of the container it's going to be
the<00:02:45.980> moles<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.670> water<00:02:47.799> times<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:48.980> gas

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
the moles of water times the gas

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.449 
the moles of water times the gas
constant<00:02:49.870> times<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.290> temperature<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:52.220> again

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
constant times the temperature and again

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.100 
constant times the temperature and again
we<00:02:52.610> know<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:53.150> temperature<00:02:53.569> and<00:02:53.989> gas

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
we know that the temperature and gas

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.580 
we know that the temperature and gas
constant<00:02:54.620> are<00:02:54.890> constant<00:02:55.610> this<00:02:55.670> case<00:02:55.989> and<00:02:56.989> we

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
constant are constant this case and we

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.960 
constant are constant this case and we
know<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.950> pressure<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.310> water<00:02:58.579> is<00:02:58.940> just

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
know that the pressure of water is just

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.520 
know that the pressure of water is just
the<00:02:59.299> saturation<00:02:59.750> pressure<00:03:00.170> which<00:03:00.410> is

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
the saturation pressure which is

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.050 
the saturation pressure which is
constant<00:03:01.069> as<00:03:01.190> a<00:03:01.280> function<00:03:01.310> of<00:03:01.790> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
constant as a function of the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.589 
constant as a function of the
temperature<00:03:02.299> so<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.470> volume<00:03:03.920> decreases<00:03:04.599> we

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
temperature so the volume decreases we

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.600 
temperature so the volume decreases we
are<00:03:05.840> also<00:03:06.140> going<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:06.560> decrease<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:07.190> moles<00:03:07.430> of

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
are also going to decrease the moles of

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.880 
are also going to decrease the moles of
water<00:03:07.910> in<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.269> vapor<00:03:08.390> phase<00:03:09.730> moles<00:03:10.730> of<00:03:11.180> water

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
water in the vapor phase moles of water

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.860 
water in the vapor phase moles of water
it's<00:03:12.890> just<00:03:13.099> gonna<00:03:13.280> be<00:03:13.519> half<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.299> initial

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
it's just gonna be half of the initial

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.280 
it's just gonna be half of the initial
moles<00:03:15.049> that<00:03:15.260> we<00:03:15.470> had<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.340> start<00:03:16.610> with<00:03:17.170> so<00:03:18.170> we're

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
moles that we had to start with so we're

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.110 
moles that we had to start with so we're
going<00:03:18.379> to<00:03:18.440> conclude<00:03:18.860> that<00:03:19.190> if<00:03:19.310> we<00:03:19.459> just<00:03:19.790> remove

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
going to conclude that if we just remove

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.449 
going to conclude that if we just remove
air<00:03:20.360> from<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.629> gas<00:03:20.810> phase<00:03:21.040> then<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.069> water

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
air from the gas phase then the water

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.000 
air from the gas phase then the water
must<00:03:22.730> condense<00:03:23.329> because<00:03:24.049> we<00:03:24.200> can't<00:03:24.440> have<00:03:24.650> a

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
must condense because we can't have a

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.940 
must condense because we can't have a

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
saturation pressure of water and since

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.390 
saturation pressure of water and since
we<00:03:30.139> have<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.500> volume<00:03:30.799> available<00:03:30.889> for<00:03:31.340> the

we have the volume available for the
water<00:03:31.549> we<00:03:31.880> must<00:03:32.000> also<00:03:32.239> have<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.510> number<00:03:32.810> of

water we must also have the number of
