00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.670
 then, as you can see, it's a make 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.490
 up tutorial where I used to do it 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.230
 more a brand a single brand that is 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.880
 call freedon make up 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.420
 a few days ago I was contacted 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.640
 from the beauty cloud.com site and they have me 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.680
 asked if he would like to receive to try 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.739
 preview these products of this 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.100
 brand that has just come out brand new 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.909
 just launched is called freedom mica 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.039
 freedom and cap 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:44.129
 now the trail of makeup revolution 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.829
 very low prices with the promise of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.850
 a professional brawl 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.460
 I have received this palette 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.889
 lots of colors and I have to say that I do 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.960
 like them they are very pigmented though 

00:00:55.889 --> 00:01:00.769
 a little though true seventh for the price that 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.209
 I think it costs 6 pounds 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.769
 then I received this palette for 

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:07.920
 redraw eyebrows that 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.439
 pretty much very similar to that 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.670
 by mika rivolution right in the packaging 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.829
 and these are eight colors inside 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.950
 and the palette opened with a small che 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:22.829
 the viewfinder is a tweezer but I don't 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.530
 sold this lipstick that also in the 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.909
 packaging is the same as make-up 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.259
 revolution and inside there is precisely the 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.929
 very very creamy lipstick 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.880
 maybe a little too much because it risks 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.920
 go tickets neither but also 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.219
 fairly pigmented l'oms between mega 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.079
 pigmented but recently pigmented 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.299
 the only thing is that it is very creamy and 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.359
 then ready to go then legislative 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.600
 the product here is actually more 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:54.689
 satisfied is this browser palette 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.049
 if you see it inside practically there 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.789
 are three colors are darker or better 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.000
 the one actually clear this case 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:06.230
 just to do the touring 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.170
 because the browser is not too orange 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.700
 and I use this very light color 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.450
 to do her lighting then for 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.980
 illuminate the area under the eye and me 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.820
 really like this was the 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.830
 council 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.930
 I must say that the products on average me 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.180
 I liked some certainly do not talk about mac 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.340
 we are not talking about a quality of those 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.170
 levels but for the price they have 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.650
 because many products are around 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.360
 around a pound then a pound 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.280
 pounds for example expensive I think it is 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.800
 it should be read that it costs 6 pounds so 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.970
 however we are talking about a very brand 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.290
 cheap I have to say that he has me 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.850
 satisfied everyone below 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.800
 I leave you now the realization of the 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.450
 trick and we'll see each other 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.370
 video as always I start my make up 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.260
 applying a primer over the whole 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.430
 mobile eyelid and also under the rhyme 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.470
 lower eye 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.940
 in this case used that of 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:05.000
 let the last moments be me 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:07.549
 I like very much then I take mine 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.040
 palette freedom mica I mix between 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.110
 a fuchsia and a brown this because 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.450
 I wanted a color that wasn't too much 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.519
 lit up like fuchsia and giving itself a little 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.330
 the brown seen that lipstick that I will go 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.330
 to apply later 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.349
 blend the contours with a brush 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.470
 clean then do a mix between a mormon 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.569
 clear and a very dark and I go to 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.940
 create my transition color 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.849
 keeping the color more intense towards 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.410
 the upper eyelid and a little more tenuous 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.410
 towards the eyebrow arch 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.970
 in the outer corner instead to create 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.910
 a look a little more sexy ex po more 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.300
 deep opted for a very purple lot 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.620
 dark almost black and then I go to blend it 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.620
 with a clean brush 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.750
 and then I go over the color on the eyelid 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.740
 mobile because with all this fading is 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.740
 gone a little to fade 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.270
 I'm going to apply it even under the rhyme 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.880
 lower eye creating this 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.220
 line to the inner corner that is 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.570
 very easy to make and is much more 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.570
 simple to do that to say 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.699
 in the internal rim of the eye I lay the 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.650
 black pencil or this other use of 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.870
 tip and I love it because 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.389
 very soft and in step with a 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.870
 brush and I go to lightly blend the 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.870
 color 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.360
 in the inner corner instead I extend a 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.360
 silver as a light point 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.659
 but 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.460
 for this place thought that you liner 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.620
 could not miss what I do one 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.710
 line not too thin to say the 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.640
 true as I like it quite thick and 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.640
 beautiful black 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.720
 to give the idea of ​​a look again 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.870
 more sexy I'm going to recreate my corner 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:48.150
 internal always with the e the udur giving it 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:50.160
 I apply this cat 's eyelashes 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.720
 fake and so much mascara either 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.260
 on the upper lashes than on that one 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.260
 lower 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:14.250
 clean up the area below the eye 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.940
 I clear my eyes and light them with a 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.940
 corrector 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.520
 at this point of drawing le 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:31.520
 eyebrows and use this kit 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.680
 freedom make up and I also used it 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.250
 same small brush that came out in the 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:41.410
 palette is not very comfortable but you can 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.410
 quietly use 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.110
 fixed the concealer under the eyes with 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:01.870
 the lightest color of this palette 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.990
 that I find it perfect to illuminate the 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:07.680
 area and then heats a complexion with the 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.680
 darker color 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.860
 what here 

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:28.139
 this is mine at the illuminant 

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:30.029
 loyal mary lou manager of the 

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:32.279
 I have to be sincere ballet 

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:35.029
 using no other illuminating though 

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:35.029
 not this one 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.880
 God 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.650
 I finish the nook with the lipstick too 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.229
 this makes a makeup the color me 

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:57.150
 really like the only problem is that 

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:59.350
 extremely creamy and can be annoying 

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:02.080
 because when it was ending in 

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:04.090
 fine lines or lips but apart 

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.340
 this is very comfortable and for the 

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.800
 price he has I can only promote it 

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.479
 the look is finished I hope there is 

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.110
 liked it and we see each other next 

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:13.110
 video
