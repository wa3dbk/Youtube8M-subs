gallon<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.680> water<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.310> believe<00:02:07.229> maybe<00:02:08.229> that's

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
gallon of water I believe maybe that's

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.160 
gallon of water I believe maybe that's
that's<00:02:08.950> /<00:02:09.280> 10<00:02:09.820> gallons<00:02:10.270> I'm<00:02:10.750> not<00:02:10.929> I'm<00:02:11.140> not

that's / 10 gallons I'm not I'm not
quite<00:02:11.500> sure<00:02:11.530> but<00:02:12.100> i<00:02:12.930> think<00:02:13.930> it's<00:02:14.290> i<00:02:14.590> think<00:02:14.680> it's

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
quite sure but i think it's i think it's

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
quite sure but i think it's i think it's
per<00:02:15.160> gallon<00:02:15.550> so<00:02:17.070> what<00:02:18.070> I'm<00:02:18.220> probably<00:02:18.580> going<00:02:18.820> to

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
per gallon so what I'm probably going to

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.540 
per gallon so what I'm probably going to
end<00:02:18.940> up<00:02:19.120> doing<00:02:19.320> here<00:02:20.320> it's<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.980> nine<00:02:21.160> gallon

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
that would give them too much flow I

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.750 
that would give them too much flow I
want<00:03:16.299> I<00:03:16.600> want<00:03:16.989> an<00:03:17.290> area<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:17.680> high<00:03:17.769> flow<00:03:18.250> medium

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760

flow and low flow kind of going going

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.270 
flow and low flow kind of going going
down<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.269> slope<00:03:22.600> of<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:24.070> side<00:03:24.220> of

down the the slope of the the side of
the<00:03:24.519> live<00:03:24.730> rock<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.330> if<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:26.049> need<00:03:26.260> more<00:03:26.440> flow

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
the live rock and if I need more flow

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.039 
the live rock and if I need more flow
i'll<00:03:27.040> get<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.430> powerhead<00:03:27.940> but<00:03:28.299> i'm<00:03:28.420> hoping<00:03:28.630> i

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
i'll get a powerhead but i'm hoping i

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.920 
i'll get a powerhead but i'm hoping i
can<00:03:29.440> get<00:03:29.709> away<00:03:29.830> without<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.580> I<00:03:30.760> might<00:03:31.720> need

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
can get away without it I might need

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.740 
can get away without it I might need
another<00:03:32.530> lighting<00:03:33.160> fixture<00:03:33.640> but<00:03:34.299> i'm<00:03:34.570> hoping

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
another lighting fixture but i'm hoping

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.009 
another lighting fixture but i'm hoping
again<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:35.830> i<00:03:35.890> can<00:03:36.040> get<00:03:36.160> away<00:03:36.250> without<00:03:36.489> it

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
again that i can get away without it

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.820 
again that i can get away without it
this<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.410> what<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.630> top<00:03:40.630> lid<00:03:40.989> looks<00:03:41.620> like

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
this is what the top lid looks like

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.660 
this is what the top lid looks like
after<00:03:42.390> 24<00:03:43.390> hours<00:03:43.420> in<00:03:43.900> operation<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:44.830> I<00:03:45.070> mean<00:03:45.549> it

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
after 24 hours in operation so I mean it

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.280 
after 24 hours in operation so I mean it
is<00:03:45.790> working<00:03:46.090> it's<00:03:46.420> keeping<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.900> lot<00:03:47.079> of<00:03:47.200> the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
is working it's keeping a lot of the

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.490 
is working it's keeping a lot of the
condensate<00:03:48.070> in<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:49.269> aquarium<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:49.930> as<00:03:50.380> you

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
condensate in the aquarium and as you

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.470 
condensate in the aquarium and as you
can<00:03:50.650> see<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.920> little<00:03:51.040> clips<00:03:51.940> here<00:03:52.150> are<00:03:52.239> doing

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
can see the little clips here are doing

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.990 
can see the little clips here are doing
a<00:03:52.540> good<00:03:52.720> job<00:03:52.780> at<00:03:53.260> keeping<00:03:53.430> keeping<00:03:54.430> this<00:03:54.700> top

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
a good job at keeping keeping this top

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.340 
a good job at keeping keeping this top
on<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:56.739> aquarium<00:03:57.190> itself<00:03:57.519> but<00:03:57.790> one<00:03:58.780> one<00:03:59.170> thing

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
on the aquarium itself but one one thing

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.319 
on the aquarium itself but one one thing
that<00:03:59.470> I'd<00:03:59.560> like<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.769> note<00:04:00.070> here<00:04:00.459> is<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:01.120> the

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
that I'd like to note here is the the

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.100 
that I'd like to note here is the the
extra<00:04:01.600> cord<00:04:02.049> from<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.709> heater<00:04:03.100> is<00:04:03.660> is<00:04:04.660> enough

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
extra cord from the heater is is enough

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.000 
extra cord from the heater is is enough
to<00:04:05.320> kind<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.709> offset<00:04:06.329> this<00:04:07.329> this<00:04:08.320> top<00:04:08.620> this

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
to kind of offset this this top this

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.280 
to kind of offset this this top this
glass<00:04:09.280> top<00:04:09.780> because<00:04:10.780> there<00:04:10.989> isn't<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.260> whole

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
glass top because there isn't a whole

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.600 
glass top because there isn't a whole
lot<00:04:11.440> of<00:04:11.590> space<00:04:11.980> provided<00:04:12.820> by<00:04:13.150> these<00:04:13.209> clips

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
lot of space provided by these clips

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.770 
lot of space provided by these clips
the<00:04:15.150> whole<00:04:15.330> thing<00:04:15.600> kind<00:04:16.170> of<00:04:16.549> shakes<00:04:17.780> because

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
the whole thing kind of shakes because

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.259 
the whole thing kind of shakes because
it's<00:04:19.079> all<00:04:19.230> resting<00:04:19.769> on<00:04:19.950> on<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.549> cord<00:04:21.090> the

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
it's all resting on on the cord the

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.780 
it's all resting on on the cord the
extra<00:04:21.570> cord<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.109> wasn't<00:04:22.440> accounted<00:04:23.070> for<00:04:23.520> in

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
extra cord that wasn't accounted for in

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.020 
extra cord that wasn't accounted for in
the<00:04:23.850> in<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.600> design<00:04:25.020> at<00:04:25.170> the<00:04:25.260> top<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:26.520> you

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
the in the design at the top and you

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.430 
the in the design at the top and you
know<00:04:27.120> one<00:04:27.330> way<00:04:27.480> that<00:04:27.630> maybe<00:04:27.780> fix<00:04:28.080> that<00:04:28.290> is

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
know one way that maybe fix that is

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.060 
know one way that maybe fix that is
pulling<00:04:29.130> this<00:04:29.310> this<00:04:29.880> cut<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.860> quarter<00:04:31.860> of<00:04:31.980> an

inch to a half inch back to allow some
extra<00:04:35.130> cords<00:04:35.790> to<00:04:35.940> kind<00:04:36.120> of<00:04:36.470> fit<00:04:37.470> through<00:04:37.800> here

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
extra cords to kind of fit through here

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.260 
extra cords to kind of fit through here
in<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.640> corner<00:04:39.060> but<00:04:39.980> overall<00:04:41.120> I'm<00:04:42.120> really

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
in that corner but overall I'm really

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.300 
in that corner but overall I'm really
happy<00:04:42.630> with<00:04:42.900> this<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:46.350> next<00:04:46.470> update<00:04:46.770> from

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
happy with this and the next update from

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.120 
happy with this and the next update from
this<00:04:47.580> tank<00:04:47.880> will<00:04:48.360> probably<00:04:48.840> be<00:04:49.020> in<00:04:49.320> a<00:04:49.830> week<00:04:49.980> or

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
this tank will probably be in a week or

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.070
