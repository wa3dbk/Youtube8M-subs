00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
played one one for two in a really

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.350 
played one one for two in a really
really<00:00:21.830> long<00:00:21.980> time<00:00:22.250> so<00:00:22.430> I<00:00:22.460> have<00:00:22.610> no<00:00:22.849> idea<00:00:23.150> how<00:00:23.329> I

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
really long time so I have no idea how I

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.390 
really long time so I have no idea how I
will<00:00:23.630> do<00:00:23.779> and<00:00:24.020> my<00:00:24.500> sensitivity<00:00:24.919> feel<00:00:25.250> is

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
will do and my sensitivity feel is

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.580 
will do and my sensitivity feel is
really<00:00:26.239> really<00:00:26.480> slow<00:00:26.840> right<00:00:27.020> now<00:00:27.050> so<00:00:27.380> I<00:00:27.439> don't

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
really really slow right now so I don't

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.319 
really really slow right now so I don't
know<00:00:27.649> if<00:00:27.739> I<00:00:28.279> should<00:00:28.309> bump<00:00:28.880> it<00:00:28.969> up<00:00:29.029> or<00:00:29.180> anything

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:29.329 
know if I should bump it up or anything

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.100 
know if I should bump it up or anything
like<00:00:29.509> that<00:00:29.570> but<00:00:30.439> let's<00:00:30.980> just<00:00:31.160> see<00:00:31.399> how<00:00:31.520> we<00:00:31.579> do

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
like that but let's just see how we do

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.440 
like that but let's just see how we do
and<00:00:33.110> yet<00:00:33.829> my<00:00:34.010> sensitivity<00:00:34.430> is<00:00:34.700> like<00:00:35.090> really

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
and yet my sensitivity is like really

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.279 
and yet my sensitivity is like really
really<00:00:35.690> slow<00:00:36.040> it's<00:00:37.040> just<00:00:40.960> like<00:00:41.960> this<00:00:42.079> claim

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289
