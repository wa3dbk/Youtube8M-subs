00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
have person all the way by PhD flopper

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.789 
have person all the way by PhD flopper
and<00:00:52.760> he<00:00:53.239> has<00:00:53.360> to<00:00:53.479> call<00:00:53.720> it<00:00:53.900> as<00:00:54.080> you're<00:00:54.350> on<00:00:54.530> that

exact area and you're gonna be stuck to

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.780 
exact area and you're gonna be stuck to
the<00:00:57.350> side<00:00:57.559> of<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:57.860> make<00:00:58.460> sure<00:00:58.580> you<00:00:58.670> have

the side of it make sure you have
jugging<00:00:59.119> out<00:00:59.210> or<00:00:59.330> flopper<00:00:59.570> because<00:00:59.989> you're

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
jugging out or flopper because you're

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.930 
jugging out or flopper because you're
eventually<00:01:00.470> got<00:01:00.799> the<00:01:00.920> fall<00:01:01.159> like<00:01:01.430> I<00:01:01.549> just<00:01:01.760> did

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
eventually got the fall like I just did

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.560 
eventually got the fall like I just did
and<00:01:03.070> this<00:01:04.070> is<00:01:04.250> basically<00:01:04.940> your<00:01:05.210> outside<00:01:05.449> the

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
and this is basically your outside the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.740 
and this is basically your outside the
mat<00:01:05.690> for<00:01:05.840> me<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.020> can<00:01:06.110> go<00:01:06.200> wherever<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:06.440> want

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.760 
most of you have no known or heard about
the<00:01:16.580> nodes<00:01:16.880> like<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.930> secret<00:01:18.290> Easter<00:01:18.439> eggs

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
the nodes like the secret Easter eggs

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.609 
the nodes like the secret Easter eggs
I'd<00:01:18.950> have<00:01:19.040> been<00:01:19.159> all<00:01:19.189> in<00:01:19.700> this<00:01:20.299> map<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:21.500> the

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
I'd have been all in this map and the

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.020 
I'd have been all in this map and the
ones<00:01:21.770> with<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:21.950> death<00:01:22.130> machines<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:22.909> all<00:01:23.000> the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
ones with the death machines and all the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.200 
ones with the death machines and all the
other<00:01:23.240> good<00:01:23.689> shit<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:24.939> supposedly<00:01:25.939> there<00:01:26.179> is

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
other good shit and supposedly there is

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.510 
other good shit and supposedly there is
a<00:01:26.600> theory<00:01:27.289> that<00:01:27.530> there<00:01:27.710> is<00:01:27.799> a<00:01:27.829> fourth<00:01:28.159> lunar

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
a theory that there is a fourth lunar

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.300 
a theory that there is a fourth lunar
lander<00:01:28.820> outside<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:29.479> map<00:01:29.689> in<00:01:30.049> this<00:01:30.859> area

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
lander outside the map in this area

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.859 
lander outside the map in this area
which<00:01:31.460> I'm<00:01:31.609> walking<00:01:31.939> through<00:01:32.060> right<00:01:32.270> now<00:01:32.450> in

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
which I'm walking through right now in

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.929 
which I'm walking through right now in
that<00:01:33.079> building<00:01:33.439> but<00:01:34.429> I'm<00:01:34.520> gonna<00:01:34.640> prove<00:01:34.759> to<00:01:34.850> you

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
that building but I'm gonna prove to you

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.849 
that building but I'm gonna prove to you
right<00:01:35.090> now<00:01:35.179> that<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.509> is<00:01:35.630> indeed<00:01:35.929> not<00:01:36.409> true

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
right now that that is indeed not true

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.510 
right now that that is indeed not true
so<00:01:37.520> as<00:01:38.320> you<00:01:39.320> can<00:01:39.439> see<00:01:39.499> as<00:01:39.740> I'm<00:01:39.890> slowly<00:01:40.280> walking

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
so as you can see as I'm slowly walking

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.550 
so as you can see as I'm slowly walking
my<00:01:40.700> way<00:01:40.729> over<00:01:41.329> here<00:01:41.539> kind<00:01:42.170> of<00:01:42.259> get<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.409> little

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
my way over here kind of get a little

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.569 
my way over here kind of get a little
stuck<00:01:42.710> about<00:01:42.920> my<00:01:43.039> head<00:01:43.189> trying<00:01:43.429> to<00:01:43.490> figure

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
stuck about my head trying to figure

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.279 
stuck about my head trying to figure
what<00:01:43.729> it<00:01:43.909> go<00:01:44.259> but<00:01:45.999> if<00:01:46.999> you<00:01:47.539> actually<00:01:47.899> look<00:01:48.049> when

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
what it go but if you actually look when

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.080 
what it go but if you actually look when
I<00:01:48.350> fall<00:01:48.560> down<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:48.950> room<00:01:49.310> or<00:01:49.759> this<00:01:49.999> whole

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
I fall down the room or this whole

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.090 
I fall down the room or this whole
building<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:50.659> solid<00:01:51.319> you<00:01:51.380> can<00:01:51.499> walk<00:01:51.710> on<00:01:51.859> it<00:01:51.920> but

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
building is solid you can walk on it but

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.849 
building is solid you can walk on it but
there's<00:01:52.249> nothing<00:01:52.340> inside<00:01:52.759> of<00:01:52.819> it<00:01:53.499> if<00:01:54.499> I<00:01:54.679> go

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
there's nothing inside of it if I go

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.279 
there's nothing inside of it if I go
around<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:55.520> building<00:01:55.700> from<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.210> side<00:01:56.420> you

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
around the building from the side you

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.630 
around the building from the side you
can<00:01:57.439> obviously<00:01:58.039> see<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:58.310> there's

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
can obviously see that there's

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.919 
can obviously see that there's
absolutely<00:01:59.060> nothing<00:01:59.329> there<00:01:59.630> it's<00:01:59.840> just

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
absolutely nothing there it's just

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.719 
absolutely nothing there it's just
Hollow<00:02:00.200> I'm<00:02:00.890> not<00:02:01.009> Hollow<00:02:01.189> but<00:02:01.429> it's<00:02:01.609> like<00:02:01.700> a

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
Hollow I'm not Hollow but it's like a

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.219 
Hollow I'm not Hollow but it's like a
bear<00:02:01.969> invisible<00:02:02.450> barrier<00:02:02.719> there<00:02:02.929> and<00:02:03.139> you

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
bear invisible barrier there and you

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.819 
bear invisible barrier there and you
cannot<00:02:03.590> get<00:02:03.799> through<00:02:04.780> so<00:02:05.780> basically<00:02:06.109> um<00:02:06.350> this

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
cannot get through so basically um this

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.100 
cannot get through so basically um this
is<00:02:06.920> me<00:02:07.069> just<00:02:07.249> exploring<00:02:07.759> around<00:02:07.850> looking<00:02:08.660> see

is me just exploring around looking see
what's<00:02:09.259> up<00:02:09.410> for<00:02:11.980> most<00:02:12.980> people<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.250> have<00:02:13.400> not

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
anything the zombies play unlike in

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.580 
anything the zombies play unlike in
other<00:02:44.670> maps<00:02:44.970> they<00:02:45.210> don't<00:02:45.780> die<00:02:46.140> like<00:02:46.440> they

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
other maps they don't die like they

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.930 
other maps they don't die like they
don't<00:02:46.800> bleed<00:02:46.980> out<00:02:47.130> when<00:02:47.370> they<00:02:47.490> die<00:02:47.670> they<00:02:47.910> just

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
don't bleed out when they die they just

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.970 
don't bleed out when they die they just
respawn<00:02:48.600> again<00:02:48.630> when<00:02:49.380> they<00:02:49.500> believe<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.830> just

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
respawn again when they believe to just

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.890 
respawn again when they believe to just
respawn<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:51.000> basically<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.330> round<00:02:51.510> goes<00:02:51.720> on

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
respawn so basically the round goes on

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.780 
respawn so basically the round goes on
forever<00:02:52.080> which<00:02:52.680> basically<00:02:53.040> which<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.400> really

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
forever which basically which is really

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.730 
forever which basically which is really
good<00:02:53.940> by<00:02:54.090> them<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.450> now<00:02:54.750> nobody<00:02:55.110> can<00:02:55.200> overnight

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
good by them so now nobody can overnight

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.850 
good by them so now nobody can overnight
