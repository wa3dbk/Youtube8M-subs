vinegar<00:00:16.619> also<00:00:17.130> tastes<00:00:17.609> most<00:00:18.240> excellent<00:00:19.230> when

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
vinegar also tastes most excellent when

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.710

paired with olive oil on my salad and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.439 
paired with olive oil on my salad and
how<00:00:22.650> many<00:00:22.859> cleaning<00:00:23.189> products<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:24.029> actually

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
how many cleaning products can actually

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.050 
how many cleaning products can actually
say<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.140> guess<00:00:26.099> cleaning<00:00:26.519> products<00:00:26.849> can't

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
say that I guess cleaning products can't

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.509 
say that I guess cleaning products can't
say<00:00:27.210> anything<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:27.900> did<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.830> know<00:00:29.070> that

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
which has double the cleaning power when

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.250 
which has double the cleaning power when
compared<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> regular<00:00:36.450> vinegar

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
compared to regular vinegar

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260 
compared to regular vinegar
most<00:00:37.649> people<00:00:38.100> call<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.520> full<00:00:39.000> strength

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
most people call it full strength

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.200 
most people call it full strength
vinegar<00:00:39.840> or<00:00:40.500> double<00:00:41.219> strength<00:00:41.489> vinegar<00:00:41.969> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
vinegar or double strength vinegar and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.209 
vinegar or double strength vinegar and
that<00:00:42.660> all<00:00:42.809> depends<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> percentages<00:00:44.160> of

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
that all depends on the percentages of

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.979 
that all depends on the percentages of
acidic<00:00:44.700> acid<00:00:44.850> which<00:00:45.210> we'll<00:00:45.390> touch<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.899> a

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
acidic acid which we'll touch on in a

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:46.400 
acidic acid which we'll touch on in a
minute

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
minute

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.700

but<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> call<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.430> lovingly<00:00:47.870> super<00:00:48.870> vinegar<00:00:49.469> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
but I call it lovingly super vinegar and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.479 
but I call it lovingly super vinegar and
that's<00:00:50.280> why<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.550> made<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.180> little<00:00:51.660> kit<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.230> it

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
that's why I made this little kit for it

that's why I made this little kit for it
it's<00:00:53.489> cute<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.890> guess<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.010> don't<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.370> very

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
it's cute and guess I don't get out very

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.900 
it's cute and guess I don't get out very
often<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.530> super<00:00:58.800> vinegar<00:00:59.280> well

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
acidic acid and that's the stuff

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.609 
acidic acid and that's the stuff
responsible<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.119> all<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.720> cleaning<00:01:18.960> aspects
