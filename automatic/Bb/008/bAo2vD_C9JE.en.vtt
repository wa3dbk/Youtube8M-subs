I<00:01:13.750> recommend<00:01:14.590> just<00:01:14.770> watching<00:01:15.070> your<00:01:15.160> debuff<00:01:19.860> as

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
I recommend just watching your debuff as

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.100 
I recommend just watching your debuff as
you<00:01:21.070> can<00:01:21.250> see<00:01:21.520> I'm<00:01:22.210> not<00:01:22.479> staying<00:01:22.840> in<00:01:23.020> the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
you can see I'm not staying in the

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.270 
you can see I'm not staying in the
middle<00:01:23.350> I'm<00:01:23.729> watching<00:01:25.110> what<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.350> UI<00:01:27.130> is

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
middle I'm watching what the UI is

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.040 
middle I'm watching what the UI is
saying<00:01:27.760> it's<00:01:28.030> saying<00:01:28.240> he's<00:01:28.450> turning<00:01:28.780> left

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
saying it's saying he's turning left

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.230 
saying it's saying he's turning left
he's<00:01:29.290> going<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.560> turn<00:01:29.740> right<00:01:30.010> and<00:01:30.250> I'm<00:01:31.030> just

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
he's going to turn right and I'm just

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.499 
he's going to turn right and I'm just
keeping<00:01:31.540> moving<00:01:31.690> side<00:01:32.619> by<00:01:32.800> side<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.420> he

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
keeping moving side by side so he

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:46.200 
keeping moving side by side so he
doesn't<00:01:34.660> actually<00:01:34.930> flip<00:01:35.350> me<00:01:35.500> off

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.460 

and<00:01:47.210> while<00:01:47.330> I'm<00:01:47.420> doing<00:01:47.450> this<00:01:47.810> I'm<00:01:48.049> just<00:01:48.260> going

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
and while I'm doing this I'm just going

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.859 
and while I'm doing this I'm just going
side<00:01:48.710> by<00:01:48.740> side<00:01:49.190> by<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.490> plate<00:01:49.880> where<00:01:50.720> I'm
