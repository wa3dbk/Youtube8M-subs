00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.969
 heat a lot of heat and a great atmosphere 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.680
 this was the first thing they found 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.810
 all the drivers in the championship of 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.400

 and not only the pilots but also the 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.199
 More than 500 spectators who have passed 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.939
 throughout the weekend for this 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.329
 small - scale replica circuit 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.329
 the community 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.270
 raw 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.540
 but there was not only heat too much 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.940
 emotion and is that this competition has not 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.309
 left no one indifferent 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.649
 mechanical boxes custom trucks 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.989
 sponsors important cars that 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.119
 reach speeds in 30 of up to 150 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.970
 kilometers per hour the show 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.490
 it was served 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.190
 the competition was divided in two days 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.590
 independent Saturday and Sunday with a 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.100
 classification and one race every day by 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.100
 category 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.530
 one of the most shocking charges was the 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.600
 corresponding to the category of alevín 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.030
 it's Sunday when kids were competing 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.619
 between 7 and 10 years old children who 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.570
 they reached speeds of 80 kilometers 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.909
 per hour the grill was formed by 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.680
 32 pilots among which shone 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.540
 kilian mayer who got the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.770
 victory on Sunday after being second on 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.909
 Saturday 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.909
 came out third and measured with the first 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.370
 we have gone well when they were missing 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.770
 five laps we have been fighting and 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.299
 I get the position 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.299
 be in formula 1 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.070
 also brilliant was the performance of 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.050
 one of the girls who competed in this 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.960
 championship in the category of cadets 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.850
 marta garcía, 11 , made a double 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.440
 imposed with authority to 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.180
 rivals the likes of eliseo martínez 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.600
 the current leader of the competition 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.530
 in cadet in desire 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.040
 It's pretty hard because 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.920
 there are many pilots a lot of traffic is bad 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.750
 for very very hot engines 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.660
 much one to me he has always liked me 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.840
 more has brought me a very good feeling 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.840
 Y 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.430
 I love the speed to try 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.430
 reach the highest 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.800
 Sunday ended with the races in 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.890

 premiered with karts with change 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.180
 manual in this new category the great 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.400
 winner was josé luís sierra who 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.409
 imposed in the two races 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.540
 many still have a long 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.549
 way to go through many races that 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.860
 win but the fact is that these 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.470
 young people promise and a lot to get what 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.599
 highest possible and why not be some 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.209

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:23.129
