know
the<00:02:08.729> way<00:02:08.850> I<00:02:08.880> designed<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.570> one<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.740> looks

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
the way I designed this one it looks

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.220 
the way I designed this one it looks
just<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:12.090> close<00:02:12.480> as<00:02:13.370> yak<00:02:14.370> attack<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.840> from<00:02:16.140> a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
just as close as yak attack so from a

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.690 
just as close as yak attack so from a
distance<00:02:16.380> as<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.800> see<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:16.980> illuminates<00:02:17.550> from

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
distance as you see I illuminates from

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.620 
distance as you see I illuminates from
the<00:02:17.790> light<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.780> very<00:02:19.110> visible<00:02:19.430> now<00:02:20.430> if<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.480> can

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
the light is very visible now if you can

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.910 
the light is very visible now if you can
find<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:22.020> flat<00:02:22.290> LED<00:02:22.830> flashlight<00:02:23.520> that's<00:02:23.910> like

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
find a flat LED flashlight that's like

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.810 
find a flat LED flashlight that's like
with<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.040> little<00:02:26.220> button<00:02:26.460> on<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.610> side

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
with the little button on the side

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
with the little button on the side
that's<00:02:27.210> perfect

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
that's perfect

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.780 
that's perfect
that's<00:02:28.050> ultimately<00:02:28.230> perfect<00:02:28.890> but<00:02:29.580> if<00:02:29.670> you

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
that's ultimately perfect but if you

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.690 
that's ultimately perfect but if you
can't<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.980> got<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.310> one<00:02:32.430> with<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
can't and you got the one with the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.190 
can't and you got the one with the
button<00:02:33.000> at<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.150> bottom<00:02:33.300> this<00:02:33.810> one<00:02:33.990> that's<00:02:34.110> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
button at the bottom this one that's the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.480 
button at the bottom this one that's the

you<00:02:35.640> know<00:02:36.240> you're<00:02:36.360> cooking<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.020> what<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.170> did

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
you know you're cooking on so what I did

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.220 
you know you're cooking on so what I did
was<00:02:37.730> this<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.970> pop<00:02:39.210> off<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.600> could<00:02:39.960> pull<00:02:40.140> this

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
was this can pop off I could pull this

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.290 
was this can pop off I could pull this
whole<00:02:40.380> thing<00:02:40.440> out<00:02:40.800> if<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:40.980> want<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.370> but<00:02:42.000> since<00:02:42.180> I

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
whole thing out if I want to but since I

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.760 
whole thing out if I want to but since I
don't<00:02:42.360> want<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.630> do<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.140> fits<00:02:43.470> his

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
don't want to do that it fits his

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.320 
don't want to do that it fits his
snugger<00:02:44.070> fits<00:02:44.340> pretty<00:02:44.520> much<00:02:44.790> inside<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
snugger fits pretty much inside the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.240 
snugger fits pretty much inside the
coupling<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:46.230> what<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.380> did<00:02:46.470> was<00:02:46.650> are<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:46.890> hit<00:02:47.130> it

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
coupling so what I did was are I hit it

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.720 
coupling so what I did was are I hit it
on<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.450> power<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.870> on<00:02:49.160> but<00:02:50.160> if<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.459> want<00:02:50.670> to

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730

maybe<00:03:15.120> like<00:03:15.360> five<00:03:15.630> or<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:15.989> five<00:03:16.470> bucks<00:03:16.500> or<00:03:16.830> so

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
maybe like five or so five bucks or so

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.430

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.360 
the coupling $0.33 the hose adapter a
dollars<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.250> change<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:25.440> ride<00:03:25.650> the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
dollars and change and the ride the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.870 
dollars and change and the ride the
fiberglass<00:03:26.700> ride<00:03:27.180> was<00:03:27.750> like<00:03:27.780> maybe<00:03:28.880> maybe

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
fiberglass ride was like maybe maybe

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.940 
fiberglass ride was like maybe maybe
like<00:03:30.060> three<00:03:30.360> bucks<00:03:30.600> I<00:03:30.810> think<00:03:31.050> under<00:03:31.739> four

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
like three bucks I think under four

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.670 
like three bucks I think under four
bucks<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.370> most<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:33.090> this<00:03:33.900> was<00:03:34.769> about<00:03:35.540> six<00:03:36.680> so

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
bucks the most and this was about six so

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.970 
bucks the most and this was about six so
you<00:03:37.709> maybe<00:03:37.950> spin<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:39.050> maybe<00:03:40.050> within<00:03:40.290> 20<00:03:40.739> bucks

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
you maybe spin in maybe within 20 bucks

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.400 
you maybe spin in maybe within 20 bucks
you<00:03:41.280> know<00:03:41.519> maybe<00:03:41.880> less<00:03:42.170> you<00:03:43.170> know<00:03:43.260> it's

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
you know maybe less you know it's

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.259 
you know maybe less you know it's
nothing<00:03:43.500> wrong<00:03:43.769> with<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.070> like<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.430> said<00:03:44.489> it's

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
nothing wrong with it like I said it's

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.110 
nothing wrong with it like I said it's
got<00:03:45.390> good<00:03:45.600> detail<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.200> doesn't<00:03:46.230> look<00:03:47.120> rigged

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
got good detail it doesn't look rigged

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.360 
got good detail it doesn't look rigged
up<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:48.900> know<00:03:49.050> it<00:03:49.200> looks<00:03:49.380> just<00:03:49.560> as<00:03:49.739> neat<00:03:50.220> as
