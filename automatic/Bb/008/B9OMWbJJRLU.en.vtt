00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.209 
I hit the target at least I was worried
that<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.329> would<00:00:57.480> go<00:00:57.600> off<00:00:57.870> broadly<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.949> some

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
that that would go off broadly and some

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.010 
that that would go off broadly and some
of<00:00:59.340> these<00:00:59.520> two<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.059> hit<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> correct<00:01:00.809> target

just<00:02:05.380> completely<00:02:06.070> outclassed<00:02:06.250> always<00:02:08.940> that's

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
just completely outclassed always that's

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.930 
just completely outclassed always that's
pretty<00:02:10.149> outstanding<00:02:11.459> Michael<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.610> gotta<00:02:12.790> say

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
pretty outstanding Michael I gotta say

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.940 
pretty outstanding Michael I gotta say
this<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.239> my<00:02:13.390> proudest<00:02:13.900> shot<00:02:14.170> of<00:02:14.440> all<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.800> them

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
this is my proudest shot of all of them

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.630 
this is my proudest shot of all of them
uh<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:17.530> looks<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:17.860> you<00:02:18.010> seem<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.340> just<00:02:18.520> be

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
uh it looks like you seem to just be

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.550 
uh it looks like you seem to just be
grouping<00:02:19.030> all<00:02:19.180> yours<00:02:19.420> together<00:02:19.690> like<00:02:20.320> these

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
grouping all yours together like these

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.289 
grouping all yours together like these
two<00:02:20.799> are<00:02:20.950> like<00:02:21.130> pretty<00:02:21.430> much<00:02:21.519> as<00:02:21.790> close<00:02:22.120> as

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
two are like pretty much as close as

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.370 
two are like pretty much as close as
they<00:02:22.390> could<00:02:22.450> be<00:02:22.630> without<00:02:22.810> splitting<00:02:23.170> the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
they could be without splitting the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.580 
they could be without splitting the
arrow<00:02:23.590> yeah<00:02:24.130> pretty<00:02:24.790> close<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.630> guess<00:02:26.440> that

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
arrow yeah pretty close so I guess that

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.690 
arrow yeah pretty close so I guess that
makes<00:02:26.709> me<00:02:26.799> a<00:02:26.890> better<00:02:27.040> shot<00:02:29.580> apparently<00:02:30.580> it's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
makes me a better shot apparently it's

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.039
