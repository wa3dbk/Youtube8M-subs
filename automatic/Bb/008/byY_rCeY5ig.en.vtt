00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
hey so I real quick from this morning

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.440 
hey so I real quick from this morning
because<00:00:05.490> I'm<00:00:05.819> going<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.120> be<00:00:06.180> late<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.420> work

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
because I'm going to be late to work

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
because I'm going to be late to work
otherwise<00:00:07.460> last<00:00:08.460> week<00:00:08.730> play<00:00:09.420> around<00:00:10.460> and

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.710 

that's<00:00:16.730> to<00:00:17.730> demonstrate<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:19.260> realize<00:00:19.770> that

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
that's to demonstrate and realize that

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:47.200 
that's to demonstrate and realize that
each

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.709 

so<00:00:48.100> in<00:00:49.100> theory<00:00:49.430> what<00:00:49.910> they<00:00:50.059> should<00:00:50.239> go<00:00:50.420> with<00:00:50.570> me

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
so in theory what they should go with me

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.150 
so in theory what they should go with me
to<00:00:51.020> is<00:00:51.379> doing<00:00:53.050> basically<00:00:54.050> an<00:00:54.320> atomic<00:00:54.739> mountain

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
to is doing basically an atomic mountain

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.330 
to is doing basically an atomic mountain
that<00:00:55.790> goes<00:00:56.180> all<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.540> way<00:00:56.690> around<00:00:56.809> body<00:00:57.340> in

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
that goes all the way around body in

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.360 
that goes all the way around body in
other<00:00:58.550> words<00:00:58.760> being<00:00:59.570> able<00:00:59.840> to<00:00:59.960> draw<00:01:00.199> how<00:01:00.410> cute

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
other words being able to draw how cute

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
other words being able to draw how cute
all<00:01:02.239> right<00:01:04.239> next<00:01:05.239> step<00:01:05.479> this<00:01:06.259> is<00:01:07.149> that<00:01:08.149> this<00:01:08.330> is

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
all right next step this is that this is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.690 
all right next step this is that this is
something<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:09.380> fear<00:01:09.740> as<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.159> while<00:01:10.340> ago<00:01:10.369> but

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
something that fear as the while ago but

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.670 
something that fear as the while ago but
I<00:01:11.149> never<00:01:11.210> a<00:01:11.630> sure<00:01:12.050> that<00:01:12.229> around<00:01:12.970> doing<00:01:14.530> so<00:01:15.530> we

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
I never a sure that around doing so we

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.920 
I never a sure that around doing so we
all<00:01:15.800> know<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.009> tricolor<00:01:16.460> like<00:01:16.640> right<00:01:17.030> now<00:01:17.899> my

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
all know the tricolor like right now my

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.930 
all know the tricolor like right now my
thumb's<00:01:18.350> attorney<00:01:18.740> with<00:01:18.950> it<00:01:19.869> not<00:01:20.869> as<00:01:21.910> easy<00:01:22.910> as

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
thumb's attorney with it not as easy as

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.680 
thumb's attorney with it not as easy as
it<00:01:23.000> boggles<00:01:23.630> might<00:01:23.810> see<00:01:25.450> turns<00:01:26.450> out<00:01:26.690> that<00:01:28.330> so<00:01:29.330> I

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
it boggles might see turns out that so I

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.510 
it boggles might see turns out that so I
thought<00:01:30.229> in<00:01:30.410> turning<00:01:30.830> I<00:01:31.009> would<00:01:31.280> have<00:01:31.399> to

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
thought in turning I would have to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.880 
thought in turning I would have to
switch<00:01:31.789> which<00:01:31.970> hands<00:01:32.210> do<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:34.090> trifle<00:01:35.090> motion

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
switch which hands do the trifle motion

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.919 
switch which hands do the trifle motion
it<00:01:36.890> actually<00:01:37.130> turns<00:01:37.610> out<00:01:37.820> that<00:01:38.119> it's<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.690> same

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
it actually turns out that it's the same

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:47.859 
it actually turns out that it's the same
hand<00:01:40.360> your<00:01:41.360> various<00:01:41.750> compost<00:01:42.740> calculus<00:01:46.869> but

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
hand your various compost calculus but

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.230 
hand your various compost calculus but
yeah<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.229> like<00:01:48.950> this<00:01:49.159> because<00:01:49.460> it's<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:50.000> chance

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
yeah I like this because it's a chance

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.830

from<00:02:04.969> that<00:02:05.829> this<00:02:06.829> weekend<00:02:07.420> at<00:02:08.860> Plato<00:02:09.860> Plato

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
from that this weekend at Plato Plato

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:17.050 
from that this weekend at Plato Plato
once<00:02:11.269> again<00:02:11.480> my<00:02:11.780> friend<00:02:11.959> Lucas

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:27.589 

this<00:02:20.060> version<00:02:21.060> try<00:02:21.599> foil<00:02:26.030> flower<00:02:27.030> hybrid

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
this version try foil flower hybrid

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.839 
this version try foil flower hybrid
which<00:02:28.049> is<00:02:30.109> its<00:02:31.109> you<00:02:31.260> put<00:02:31.590> by<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.579> same

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
which is its you put by the same

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.470 
which is its you put by the same
direction<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:35.280> think<00:02:35.819> they<00:02:35.909> check<00:02:36.120> their<00:02:36.239> guns

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
direction I think they check their guns

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.360 
direction I think they check their guns
well<00:02:37.019> make<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.260> came<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.769> same<00:02:37.920> times<00:02:38.189> as

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
well make it came to the same times as

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.619 
well make it came to the same times as
long<00:02:38.519> as<00:02:38.670> one<00:02:38.879> person's<00:02:39.239> best<00:02:39.389> together<00:02:39.810> but

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
long as one person's best together but

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.089 
long as one person's best together but
yeah<00:02:42.629> so<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.290> motion<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.799> hands<00:02:43.980> are

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
yeah so the motion of the hands are

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.720 
yeah so the motion of the hands are
going<00:02:44.129> through<00:02:44.519> is<00:02:45.049> a<00:02:46.069> split<00:02:47.069> time<00:02:47.280> butterfly

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
going through is a split time butterfly

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:59.539 
going through is a split time butterfly
and<00:02:53.719> results<00:02:54.719> like<00:02:55.049> this<00:02:56.389> now<00:02:58.280> look<00:02:59.280> around

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
and results like this now look around

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.649 
and results like this now look around
them<00:02:59.760> like<00:03:00.199> they<00:03:01.199> realize<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.919> also<00:03:02.659> do

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
them like they realize that you also do

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:12.080 
them like they realize that you also do
a<00:03:06.049> same<00:03:07.049> time<00:03:07.260> since<00:03:09.349> right<00:03:10.349> of<00:03:10.590> course<00:03:11.090> you

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
a same time since right of course you

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.689 
a same time since right of course you
not<00:03:12.359> it's<00:03:12.629> too<00:03:13.319> distracting<00:03:13.639> yourself<00:03:15.199> near

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:16.699 
not it's too distracting yourself near

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:26.140 
not it's too distracting yourself near
there<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:22.430> something<00:03:23.430> stuff<00:03:23.759> there<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.269> I
