really have VR but kind of did if you
just<00:00:48.930> Facebook<00:00:49.440> thing<00:00:49.560> else<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.130> anyway<00:00:50.340> if

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
just Facebook thing else but anyway if

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.850 
just Facebook thing else but anyway if
you<00:00:50.700> make<00:00:51.270> severe<00:00:51.600> determines<00:00:52.200> your<00:00:52.290> skill<00:00:52.560> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
you make severe determines your skill it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.200 
you make severe determines your skill it
stands<00:00:53.400> for<00:00:53.580> first<00:00:53.850> races<00:00:54.330> first<00:00:55.110> ratings<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
stands for first races first ratings and

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.880 
stands for first races first ratings and
the<00:00:57.210> more<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.540> win<00:00:57.720> the<00:00:57.750> more<00:00:58.140> fear<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.680> get

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the more you win the more fear you get

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.920 
the more you win the more fear you get
obvious<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.360> you<00:01:00.420> versus<00:01:00.780> people

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
obvious and you know you versus people

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.140 
obvious and you know you versus people
with<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> similar<00:01:01.620> V<00:01:01.770> or<00:01:01.920> whatever<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:02.940> now

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
with the similar V or whatever but now

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.030 
with the similar V or whatever but now
America's<00:01:03.690> own<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.110> seems<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.890> just

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
America's own it seems like it just

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.429 
America's own it seems like it just
depends<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:06.500> actual<00:01:07.670> actual<00:01:08.670> skill<00:01:09.110> no<00:01:10.110> sorry

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
depends on actual actual skill no sorry

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.340 
depends on actual actual skill no sorry
how<00:01:10.829> many<00:01:11.070> races<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.600> while

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
how many races that you have while

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.140 
how many races that you have while
playing<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.159> me<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.700> doesn't<00:01:14.759> seem

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
playing and to me that just doesn't seem

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.149 
playing and to me that just doesn't seem
fair<00:01:15.329> for<00:01:15.570> those<00:01:15.720> who<00:01:16.440> are<00:01:16.620> playing<00:01:16.800> Mario

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
fair for those who are playing Mario

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.790 
fair for those who are playing Mario
Kart<00:01:17.190> lots<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.060> still<00:01:18.390> fail<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.380> Iraq

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
Kart lots and still fail and Iraq

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.320 
Kart lots and still fail and Iraq
against<00:01:20.070> people<00:01:20.550> who<00:01:21.030> were<00:01:21.210> obviously

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
against people who were obviously

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.710 
against people who were obviously
professionals<00:01:22.260> and<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:23.270> know<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.420> seems

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
professionals and I know it just seems

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.420 
professionals and I know it just seems
like<00:01:24.780> an<00:01:24.960> unfair<00:01:25.290> rating<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.860> their<00:01:25.980> notion

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
like an unfair rating and their notion

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.149 
like an unfair rating and their notion
based<00:01:27.240> judgment<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.140> VR<00:01:28.560> because<00:01:29.010> in

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
based judgment on your VR because in

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.010 
based judgment on your VR because in
theory<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.970> only<00:01:30.210> time<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.540> actually<00:01:30.570> lose

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
theory the only time you actually lose

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.260 
theory the only time you actually lose
VR<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.680> race<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.460> come<00:01:32.640> last<00:01:32.850> which

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
VR in a race is if you come last which

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.490 
VR in a race is if you come last which
to<00:01:33.510> me<00:01:33.659> seems<00:01:34.320> unfair<00:01:35.010> because<00:01:36.290> you're<00:01:37.290> just

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
to me seems unfair because you're just

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.160 
to me seems unfair because you're just
gonna<00:01:37.650> keep<00:01:37.860> getting<00:01:38.010> VR<00:01:38.370> as<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.750> higher<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
gonna keep getting VR as a higher up the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.570 
gonna keep getting VR as a higher up the
ORS<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.740> me<00:01:40.860> they're<00:01:41.010> just<00:01:41.100> useless

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
ORS and to me they're just useless

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.890 
ORS and to me they're just useless
so<00:01:43.610> resolution<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.820> put<00:01:45.150> people<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.540> random

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
so resolution just put people in random

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.980 
so resolution just put people in random
games<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.380> random<00:01:46.770> people<00:01:47.000> because<00:01:48.000> then<00:01:48.510> it

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
games of random people because then it

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.140 
games of random people because then it
makes<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.590> whole<00:01:49.770> lot<00:01:49.799> easier<00:01:50.090> than<00:01:51.090> having

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
makes it a whole lot easier than having

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.219 
makes it a whole lot easier than having
people<00:01:51.780> play<00:01:52.770> against<00:01:53.280> other<00:01:53.460> people<00:01:54.030> who<00:01:54.780> you

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
people play against other people who you

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.969 
people play against other people who you
know<00:01:56.360> clearly<00:01:57.360> have<00:01:57.570> advantage<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.530> terms<00:01:58.740> of

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
know clearly have advantage in terms of

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.500 
know clearly have advantage in terms of
skill<00:01:59.369> and<00:02:00.090> knowledge<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> tracks

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
skill and knowledge of the tracks

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.390 
skill and knowledge of the tracks
because<00:02:03.510> to<00:02:03.750> me<00:02:03.900> if<00:02:04.020> some<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.470> I'm<00:02:04.950> really<00:02:05.130> good

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
because to me if some I I'm really good

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.509 
because to me if some I I'm really good
kind<00:02:05.580> of<00:02:05.700> thing<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.090> other<00:02:06.600> than<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.020> video

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:07.519 
kind of thing but other than this video

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:10.789 
kind of thing but other than this video
if<00:02:08.519> I<00:02:08.819> were<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.179> play<00:02:09.360> against<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.530> know<00:02:10.619> cuz

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
if I were to play against you know cuz

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.559 
if I were to play against you know cuz
just<00:02:11.099> just<00:02:11.370> because<00:02:11.459> my<00:02:11.700> VR<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.090> shouldn't<00:02:12.450> have

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
just just because my VR I shouldn't have
