00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 I'm Lucas Fg Tec, and I'm talking to people. 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.040
 You're bringing more here. 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.509
 You this time we are with 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.590
 launch here of the culture first 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.940
 hand and your cabinet and tx model that bx 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.370
 environment intended for those who are 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.260
 to assemble a powerful machine occupying 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.820
 little space there, that 's it 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.100
 starting from the front here 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.300
 you can see that she's in the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.859
 graphite color 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.390
 It is ideal here for those who want to 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.730
 Example mounting a machine and the large 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.480
 room as a media center to use for 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.939
 games 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.090
 Finally is it combines well with 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.460
 anything and does not draw much attention 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.030
 agent finds its connections 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.570
 OK 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.090
 are two usb 3.0 and both looks and 2 there 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.340
 Here a competitor for power Here 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.230
 the side of the machine're the cabinet that 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.239
 occupies both sides of the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.520
 these caps are the same they are a 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.890
 sheik heart cover here helping 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.600
 enough in the ambient ventilation comes 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.120
 with two screws on each side cover 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.700
 but we already left one to celebrate 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.659
 half a century when you know the lateral 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.979
 right 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.229
 the power to start the assembly 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:17.130
 of parts and such 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:19.619
 with this piece here with this protect the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.460
 Most components here and for 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.020
 do some facilities here ago 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.729
 she will work with paralyzed 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.439
 four bolts here we took to 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.329
 easy to show that here as 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.650
 It was as you can see here she has 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.560
 support for 2nd notebook hd or ssds 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.680
 that you'd rather put anyway is a 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.649
 2.5 hard drive and here goes a 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.899
 of 3.5 is a normal hd 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.630
 or you can also choose to take 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.560
 Let's say this cage here, huh? 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.420
 you can see that the screws here 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.409
 removed here and do the installation 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.810
 here from one color up to 240 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.249
 fuller as you guys prefer it here in the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.530
 sharing the cabinet to make the 

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:10.810
 mount it you may come across that 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.190
 right behind we already have a little necklace 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.379
 eight by eight 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.870
 there's no wedding here from us 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.250
 took half well stuck in the final note 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.720
 It's good to have a little 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.879
 camera angle gets a little better 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.410
 explanation to you guys you can see 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.730
 these cables here are the guys to do 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.099
 front panel ligament 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.319
 this is the head of 3.0 is the audio and 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.700
 this is the rest of the panel and here the 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.349
 people find a main one 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.060
 Unlike the case the source or not 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.280
 connected directly here it comes through 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.959
 because it is plugged in 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.150
 from the source to show here is so you 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.170
 they connect the source with it not like 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.640
 sources that are compatible with this 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.379
 own cabinet provided 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.910
 on her site 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.340
 some font models that are not 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.250
 compatible due to the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.660
 ok this part here casually this 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.060
 source we took a about 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.650
 150 m to the right color it is not compatible 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.530
 with the cabinet but in the same 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.750
 people are going to show that the 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.190
 the size she is in the cabinet 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.630
 even recommending the use of 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.790
 modular fonts to enter this 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.410
 cabinet is not complicated enough 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.079
 that pile of wire to hide 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.389
 everything else then the assembly of it will be 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.900
 made to the belt commented it down 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:22.750
 obviously the cable installation does not 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:28.260
 popular in the car there because it 's a bit 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:31.269
 complicated but that 's basically it here 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.530
 It will stay that way in the cabinet okay 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.319
 You can see that it fit 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.299
 perfectly she has a limiter over there 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.120
 the size of the source, or if they 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.340
 install some source a r 1,000 per 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.669
 example some sources a bit more 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.340
 slightly larger in size no longer has the 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.389
 is it fits video cards of 35 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.880
 centimeters 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.200
 I'll get it out here for a knock. 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.630
 different with this cable 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.459
 we have here a full schedule 961 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.139
 the gigabyte game that she has around 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.139
 more or less 31 32 centimeters 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:08.889
 so you can see that it's a 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.720
 video card too large and it fit 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.600
 in the cabinet still a baita 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.670
 space here รณ space basically in the canopy 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.660
 entire 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.600
 really nice because he's a 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.739
 very compact cabinet and is very 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.120
 difficult for us to come to mind that 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.860
 size that is compatible with 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.750
 video card as big here as 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.550
 you can see a drawing the campaign is 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.920
 installed here ok it has 2 two stalls 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.810
 expansion likely today 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.460
 you were a new video card is 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.440
 It is quite probable that these two vacancies 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.150
 be already occupied by plaque lots 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.250
 good video and the installation of 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.290
 covers here is that cabinet he has 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.450
 ability to do the installation 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.720
 two clubs here on the way out on the 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:54.140
 Up here are two clubs of 120 plus one 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.960
 optional in front of 88 and two more 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.150
 here down to 120 remembering that 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.760
 some ford models they already have the 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.080
 Watch out then we'll 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.990
 least sees no need for installation 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.120
 of crack below and correcting this club 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.290
 that has behind it is not from 8 to 19 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.290
 Let's have a look at the message from 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.710
 culture is a very different model than 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.710
 meet 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.290
 so this is it folks if you do not 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.450
 like the video leaves online here at 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.920
 down a comment with some suggestion 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.180
 something is in the national 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.570
 keep following us 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.380
 Thanks and see you next time and now I'm going to 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.380
 cool land home
