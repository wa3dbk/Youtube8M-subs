these<00:02:25.099> on<00:02:25.250> DMX<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.790> can't<00:02:26.000> share<00:02:26.209> them<00:02:26.360> with

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
these on DMX you can't share them with

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.670 
these on DMX you can't share them with
the<00:02:26.629> other<00:02:26.750> two<00:02:26.959> lights<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.379> I<00:02:27.440> just

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
the other two lights that I just

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.130 
the other two lights that I just
mentioned<00:02:27.920> but<00:02:28.790> anyhow<00:02:29.030> on<00:02:29.239> DMX<00:02:29.720> right<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:29.959> mean

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
mentioned but anyhow on DMX right I mean

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.180 
mentioned but anyhow on DMX right I mean
you<00:02:30.260> got<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:30.590> many<00:02:30.709> different<00:02:31.069> options

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
you got so many different options

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.869 
you got so many different options
because<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.150> have<00:02:32.420> your<00:02:32.810> masks<00:02:33.769> or<00:02:33.920> your<00:02:34.099> RGBW

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
because you have your masks or your RGBW

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.390 
because you have your masks or your RGBW
or<00:02:35.510> channels<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.410> have<00:02:36.440> your<00:02:36.680> dimmer<00:02:36.950> you

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
or channels you have your dimmer you

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.830 
or channels you have your dimmer you
have<00:02:37.519> your<00:02:37.700> strobe<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.330> strobe<00:02:38.569> on<00:02:38.690> this

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
have your strobe and the strobe on this

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.110 
have your strobe and the strobe on this
is<00:02:38.989> really<00:02:39.230> cool<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:40.069> also<00:02:40.280> have<00:02:40.640> where<00:02:40.970> you

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
is really cool you also have where you

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.910 
is really cool you also have where you
can<00:02:41.299> actually<00:02:41.480> select<00:02:41.900> your<00:02:42.200> color<00:02:42.380> macros

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
can actually select your color macros

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.740 
can actually select your color macros
and<00:02:43.069> then<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.489> DMX<00:02:43.880> channel<00:02:44.239> that<00:02:44.390> tells<00:02:44.630> it

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
and then a DMX channel that tells it

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.720 
and then a DMX channel that tells it
where<00:02:44.930> those<00:02:45.200> color<00:02:45.410> macros<00:02:45.860> are<00:02:46.040> static

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
where those color macros are static

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.580 
where those color macros are static
color<00:02:46.880> macros<00:02:47.299> fading<00:02:47.930> color<00:02:48.140> macros

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
color macros fading color macros

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.420 
color macros fading color macros
changing<00:02:49.430> color<00:02:49.670> macros<00:02:50.150> or<00:02:50.299> sound<00:02:51.260> active<00:02:51.890> so

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
changing color macros or sound active so

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.559 
changing color macros or sound active so
again<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.730> lot<00:02:52.880> of<00:02:52.940> different<00:02:53.239> ways<00:02:53.269> you<00:02:53.390> can

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
again a lot of different ways you can

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.750 
again a lot of different ways you can
control<00:02:53.959> set<00:02:54.200> color<00:02:54.440> macros<00:02:54.890> I'll<00:02:55.400> use<00:02:55.640> the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
control set color macros I'll use the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.430 
control set color macros I'll use the
color<00:02:55.910> macros<00:02:56.329> on<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:56.630> one<00:02:56.840> I<00:02:56.870> actually<00:02:57.049> made

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
color macros on this one I actually made

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.949 
color macros on this one I actually made
on<00:02:57.620> my<00:02:57.849> DMX<00:02:58.849> software<00:02:59.269> I<00:02:59.420> just<00:02:59.569> want<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.840> make

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
on my DMX software I just want to make

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.979 
on my DMX software I just want to make
it<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.200> bunch<00:03:00.349> of<00:03:00.530> scenes<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:01.069> different

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
it a bunch of scenes of different

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.900 
it a bunch of scenes of different
patterns<00:03:02.989> of<00:03:03.170> colors<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.829> then<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.280> select<00:03:04.610> a

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
patterns of colors and then I select a

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.460 
patterns of colors and then I select a
dimmer<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.269> I<00:03:05.360> can<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.660> know<00:03:05.780> how<00:03:06.170> bright<00:03:06.410> I

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
dimmer and I can you know how bright I

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.559 
dimmer and I can you know how bright I
want<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.129> thence<00:03:07.549> how<00:03:07.819> fast<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.269> want<00:03:08.480> to

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
want it and thence how fast I want to

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.360 
want it and thence how fast I want to
strobe<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.140> this<00:03:09.590> will<00:03:09.799> even<00:03:09.980> like<00:03:10.220> let's

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
strobe it and this will even like let's

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.009 
strobe it and this will even like let's
see<00:03:10.459> make<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.700> really<00:03:11.030> cool<00:03:11.269> pattern<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.870> you

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
see make a really cool pattern of you

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.379 
see make a really cool pattern of you
know<00:03:12.139> changing<00:03:12.889> or<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:13.910> know<00:03:14.030> changing

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
know changing or you know changing

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.599 
know changing or you know changing
colors<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:15.200> can<00:03:15.319> strobe<00:03:15.680> it<00:03:15.859> and<00:03:16.010> then<00:03:16.430> have

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
colors you can strobe it and then have

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.910 
colors you can strobe it and then have
those<00:03:16.910> changing<00:03:17.329> color<00:03:17.510> strobe<00:03:17.870> or<00:03:18.109> you<00:03:18.769> can

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
those changing color strobe or you can

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.160 
those changing color strobe or you can
also<00:03:19.100> have<00:03:19.760> select<00:03:20.450> your<00:03:20.540> shows<00:03:20.780> from<00:03:20.930> here

also have select your shows from here
you<00:03:21.560> got<00:03:21.709> your<00:03:21.859> regular<00:03:22.220> color<00:03:22.519> macros<00:03:23.090> you

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
you got your regular color macros you

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.629 
you got your regular color macros you
also<00:03:23.900> have<00:03:24.139> your<00:03:24.410> sound<00:03:24.709> active<00:03:25.100> modes<00:03:25.370> and

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
also have your sound active modes and

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:30.099 
also have your sound active modes and
you<00:03:26.329> can<00:03:26.540> dial<00:03:27.440> in<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.739> RGB<00:03:28.459> values<00:03:29.000> or<00:03:29.269> RGBW

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
you can dial in the RGB values or RGBW

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.500 
you can dial in the RGB values or RGBW
values<00:03:30.799> of<00:03:31.130> a<00:03:31.370> specific<00:03:31.819> color<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:32.239> you<00:03:32.359> can

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
values of a specific color so you can

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.530 
values of a specific color so you can
use<00:03:32.690> these<00:03:32.810> for<00:03:33.019> a<00:03:33.079> very<00:03:33.260> versatile<00:03:33.859> up<00:03:34.160> light

use these for a very versatile up light
one<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.750> things<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.109> I<00:03:36.230> did<00:03:36.500> not<00:03:36.530> know

about this light that I did not see in

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.800 
about this light that I did not see in
the<00:03:39.049> press<00:03:39.260> release<00:03:39.500> but<00:03:39.920> then<00:03:40.489> again<00:03:40.609> I<00:03:41.030> may

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810

here<00:03:49.540> little<00:03:50.540> diode<00:03:51.139> for<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.889> remote<00:03:52.220> control

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
here little diode for the remote control

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.759 
here little diode for the remote control
now<00:03:53.359> why<00:03:53.630> is<00:03:53.690> that<00:03:53.840> exciting<00:03:54.290> because<00:03:54.590> the

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
now why is that exciting because the

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.259 
now why is that exciting because the
first<00:03:54.980> one<00:03:55.099> I<00:03:55.220> cop<00:03:55.430> these<00:03:55.609> are<00:03:55.730> my<00:03:55.819> god<00:03:56.030> this

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
first one I cop these are my god this

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.599 
first one I cop these are my god this
would<00:03:56.419> be<00:03:56.480> great<00:03:56.630> again<00:03:57.139> for<00:03:57.799> also<00:03:58.220> really
