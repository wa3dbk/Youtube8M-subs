00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600 

I<00:00:00.230> decided<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.439> do<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.620> little<00:00:01.860> experiment<00:00:02.490> to

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
I decided to do a little experiment to

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.640 
I decided to do a little experiment to
see<00:00:02.909> how<00:00:02.939> well<00:00:03.330> aerating<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.049> roots<00:00:04.259> would

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
see how well aerating the roots would

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.160 
see how well aerating the roots would

rafts<00:00:07.379> have<00:00:07.649> no<00:00:07.830> bubblers<00:00:08.250> with<00:00:08.639> just<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.120> bit

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
rafts have no bubblers with just a bit

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.459 
rafts have no bubblers with just a bit
of<00:00:09.420> splashing<00:00:09.630> from<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.200> media<00:00:10.469> beds<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:12.469> left

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
of splashing from the media beds I left

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.680 
of splashing from the media beds I left
one<00:00:13.710> bed<00:00:13.980> without<00:00:14.160> air<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.059> other<00:00:15.210> bed<00:00:15.480> I

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
one bed without air in the other bed I

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.200 
one bed without air in the other bed I
had<00:00:15.839> added<00:00:16.080> two<00:00:16.410> air<00:00:16.590> stones<00:00:19.820> then<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.939> placed

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
had added two air stones then I placed

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.080 
had added two air stones then I placed
two<00:00:21.330> identical<00:00:21.960> sets<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.410> plants<00:00:22.769> with<00:00:22.949> 15<00:00:23.460> 2

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
two identical sets of plants with 15 2

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.189 
two identical sets of plants with 15 2
week<00:00:24.269> old<00:00:24.449> seedlings<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.230> each<00:00:25.439> bed<00:00:28.640> and

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
week old seedlings in each bed and

00:00:30.199 --> 00:01:03.979 
week old seedlings in each bed and
waited

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.590 

I<00:01:04.430> knew<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.580> aerated<00:01:06.030> plants<00:01:06.360> would<00:01:06.450> do

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
I knew the aerated plants would do

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.359 
I knew the aerated plants would do
better<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.320> was<00:01:07.440> a<00:01:07.500> bit<00:01:07.650> surprised<00:01:08.040> how

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
better but I was a bit surprised how

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.330 
better but I was a bit surprised how
much<00:01:08.520> better<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:09.000> did<00:01:09.560> first<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.799> harvested

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
much better they did first I harvested

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.640 
much better they did first I harvested
the<00:01:11.490> non<00:01:11.670> aerated<00:01:12.210> plants<00:01:12.570> looking<00:01:13.409> at<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
the non aerated plants looking at the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.410 
the non aerated plants looking at the
roots<00:01:13.890> they<00:01:14.159> look<00:01:14.340> good<00:01:14.550> for<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.909> plant<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.240> this

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
roots they look good for a plant of this

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.440 
roots they look good for a plant of this
size<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.950> plants<00:01:17.340> also<00:01:17.550> look<00:01:17.850> good<00:01:18.030> but

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
size the plants also look good but

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.290 
size the plants also look good but
harvesting<00:01:18.960> them<00:01:19.170> yields<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:19.740> 207<00:01:20.610> grams<00:01:20.880> or

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
harvesting them yields just 207 grams or

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.740 
harvesting them yields just 207 grams or
thirteen<00:01:21.750> point<00:01:22.020> eight<00:01:22.200> grams<00:01:22.259> each

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.230 

moving<00:01:29.500> on<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:30.010> aerated<00:01:30.460> plants<00:01:30.820> the

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
moving on to the aerated plants the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.370 
moving on to the aerated plants the
roots<00:01:31.450> look<00:01:31.690> much<00:01:31.990> better

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
roots look much better

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.670 
roots look much better
and<00:01:32.590> obviously<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.430> plants<00:01:33.790> are<00:01:33.910> far<00:01:34.120> larger

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
and obviously the plants are far larger

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.570 
and obviously the plants are far larger

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
these 15 plants weigh 1592 grams or 106

these 15 plants weigh 1592 grams or 106
grams<00:01:39.760> each<00:01:44.940> this<00:01:45.940> experiment<00:01:46.600> ran<00:01:46.780> for<00:01:46.960> 27

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
grams each this experiment ran for 27

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.800 
grams each this experiment ran for 27
days<00:01:47.680> plus<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.310> 14<00:01:48.700> days<00:01:48.910> prior<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.330> get<00:01:49.720> the

days plus the 14 days prior to get the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.690 
days plus the 14 days prior to get the
seedlings<00:01:50.229> started<00:01:50.710> which<00:01:51.040> makes<00:01:51.310> them<00:01:51.490> just

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
seedlings started which makes them just

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.450 
seedlings started which makes them just
shy<00:01:51.880> of<00:01:51.910> 6<00:01:52.360> weeks<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.900> weight<00:01:53.800> of<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.100> aerated

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
shy of 6 weeks the weight of the aerated

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.540 
shy of 6 weeks the weight of the aerated
plants<00:01:54.910> was<00:01:55.500> 7.7<00:01:56.500> times<00:01:56.680> heavier<00:01:57.190> than<00:01:57.400> the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
plants was 7.7 times heavier than the

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.969 
plants was 7.7 times heavier than the
non<00:01:57.820> aerated<00:01:58.360> ones<00:01:58.540> I<00:01:58.840> think<00:01:59.350> it's<00:01:59.680> time<00:01:59.950> to

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
non aerated ones I think it's time to

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.100 
non aerated ones I think it's time to
make<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.340> change<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.880> my<00:02:01.119> system<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.810> may<00:02:04.990> have

make a change to my system you may have

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.450 
make a change to my system you may have
noticed<00:02:05.440> that<00:02:05.560> our<00:02:05.710> raft<00:02:06.009> beds<00:02:06.220> are<00:02:06.430> all

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
noticed that our raft beds are all

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.600 
noticed that our raft beds are all
numbered<00:02:06.970> we<00:02:07.630> use<00:02:07.869> track<00:02:08.229> my<00:02:08.410> plants<00:02:08.830> calm<00:02:09.250> to
