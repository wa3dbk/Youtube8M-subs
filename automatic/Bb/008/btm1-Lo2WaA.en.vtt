sortable which is real nice you check

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.700

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
show okay this is someone you've got a

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.930 
show okay this is someone you've got a
lot<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.819> hands<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:32.250> can<00:03:32.400> actually<00:03:32.760> turn

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
lot of hands on so you can actually turn

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.210 
lot of hands on so you can actually turn
off<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.690> labels<00:03:34.079> so<00:03:34.319> it'll<00:03:34.650> look<00:03:34.739> like<00:03:34.950> this

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
off the labels so it'll look like this

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.150 
off the labels so it'll look like this
but<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.549> find<00:03:35.970> when<00:03:36.450> there's<00:03:37.019> only<00:03:37.139> in<00:03:37.470> this

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
but I find when there's only in this

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.960 
but I find when there's only in this
particular<00:03:38.819> type<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.950> setting<00:03:40.950> it's<00:03:41.700> better

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
particular type of setting it's better

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.240 
particular type of setting it's better
just<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.299> have<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.540> labels<00:03:42.870> up<00:03:43.069> finally<00:03:44.069> else

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
just to have the labels up finally else

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.640 
just to have the labels up finally else
we'll<00:03:44.370> have<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.549> performance<00:03:45.060> here<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:46.590> I

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
we'll have the performance here and I

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.460 
we'll have the performance here and I
just<00:03:46.680> have<00:03:47.100> everything<00:03:47.310> high<00:03:47.579> high<00:03:48.470> the

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470

so we'll play this hand ACA and isolate
the<00:06:45.420> limping<00:06:47.930> we'll<00:06:48.930> see<00:06:49.110> if<00:06:49.170> we<00:06:49.230> can't<00:06:49.410> take

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
the limping we'll see if we can't take

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.150 
the limping we'll see if we can't take
it<00:06:49.710> down<00:06:49.860> otherwise<00:06:51.590> might<00:06:52.590> have<00:06:52.620> crippled<00:06:53.070> my

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
it down otherwise might have crippled my

00:06:53.160 --> 00:07:02.030 
it down otherwise might have crippled my
bankroll<00:06:53.550> here<00:06:53.730> by<00:06:53.880> losing<00:06:54.180> a<00:06:54.240> tenth<00:07:01.040> actually

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.040 
bankroll here by losing a tenth actually

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.360

flop<00:07:02.280> top<00:07:02.520> pair<00:07:02.760> top<00:07:02.790> kicker<00:07:02.970> but<00:07:03.690> not<00:07:04.290> a<00:07:04.830> great

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
flop top pair top kicker but not a great

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.760 
flop top pair top kicker but not a great
situation<00:07:06.020> so<00:07:07.020> we're<00:07:07.140> just<00:07:07.170> better<00:07:07.410> at<00:07:07.560> it<00:07:07.680> and

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770
