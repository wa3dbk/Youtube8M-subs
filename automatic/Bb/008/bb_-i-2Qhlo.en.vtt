00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.850
 my name is Roman 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.670
 limited volt contingent in 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:21.449
 southeastern part of the Russian-speaking 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:25.500
 thank you know we should not for all that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.180
 what we are now experiencing with the Crimea 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.000
 must fall into some kind of euphoria and 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.390
 must always come from reality in 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.030
 Than on these realities well firstly it is necessary 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.050
 Just say all the same all the same 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.290
 national technical composition of Crimea 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.760
 different from the south-east of Ukraine and here 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.989
 these territories I just about it 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.180
 said were transferred to the composition of Ukraine 20 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.480
 in the mid 20s and then here until 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.079
 until the year 54 when the Crimea has already passed 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.770
 given for some reason to Ukraine for technical 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.210
 composition there is about well about 50 to 50 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.449
 and I already said that the decision 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.449
 final about 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.830
 about the return of the Crimea to the Russian 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.870
 Federation was accepted only by 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.610
 referendum results when I saw 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.070
 results when see almost everything 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.930
 population for repeating us choosing even 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.420
 there was no other solution 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.150
 couldn't what situation we are here 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.760
 for sure we do nâ€™t know but we know for sure 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.890
 what we have to do to help 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.140
 these people protect their rights and 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.110
 determine your own destiny 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.950
 we will fight for it 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.509
 I remind you that the Council of the Federation of Russia 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.850
 granted the president the right 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.750
 use the armed forces in Ukraine 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.670
 I really hope that I do not have to 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.490
 exercise this right and that 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.680
 politics by diplomatic means to us 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.660
 manage to solve all sharp if say 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.720
 today's acute problems in 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.720
 Ukraine
