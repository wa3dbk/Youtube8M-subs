00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.159
 on the toyota beach 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.279
 the club 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.570
 just as nice to the civil court 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.080
 everyone makes the loss 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.870
 a simple one 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.870
 let you be a member 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.140
 with the discussion 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.940
 it's a little bit 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.160
 suu kyi 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.680
 take those things out 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.570
 and it shows 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.280
 that actually there 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.560
 how can to 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.180
 so much music is on such a small dash 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.180
 and how does it happen? 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.480
 suzuka park 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.619
 in michael jackson 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.619
 is on the issue 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.100
 so I have to live with all members of the boyzone 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.260
 according to a newspaper has given up today has found a new way 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.250
 To earn money 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.750
 the choice for 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.320
 you look at the music industry sol 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.200
 also beautiful 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.290
 that is interesting and certainly interesting 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.930
 he is going to apply 4 but we also do that according to 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.810
 to make music 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.960
 just as sweet the own all along as there is a lot of playing time 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.770
 it has been going on for him for a year and a half 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.310
 I'm going to copy them hot just like a vacation for money 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.840
 according to but that is not allowed 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.910
 then it is not allowed then it is not allowed 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.650
 a fuel cell 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.410
 and how are you going to do that 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.410
 change that 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.319
 hell yes 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.389
 Yes Yes 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.129
 good luck to answer no 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.370
 yes and no music mayday 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.370
 Yes really 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.340
 it could be seen at the parents' house at grandfather's and grandmother's attic 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.919
 the long playing plate 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.659
 the music used to be listened to with the help of these things 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.309
 but thirty years ago then that changed 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.139
 against rcd 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:37.899
 machines and sony 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.999
 A year later the first CD players appeared in the stores 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.559
 they were incredibly expensive 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:47.229
 only after the minister has made a start and the first race appears in the store 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.069
 everyone could pay a bit for the cd player 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:57.319
 compared to those along many places on this cd they have a huge number of advantages 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.159
 smaller 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.779
 pay more attention and the quality is better preserved, but how exactly 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:06.010
 works that did is here in the building everything from and that's why we go there 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.139
 take a look now 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.989
 but underlined handy is that we know now 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.539
 but now about the operation 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:16.929
 next to me p sits the spelling employed at a major and the manufacturer paul on 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.279
 to eat 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:20.239
 letter a great wall street 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.589
 ma to start the cd became digital 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.119
 I first have to tell the army about that 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:28.219
 digital actually means 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.959
 I don't like the CD just like shelter for mclaren 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.239
 it is coded first 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.029
 a bargain 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.179
 he stands 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:42.369
 he was very mean that the translation is now a kind of computer language 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.149
 as you might have had mountains of computers with just now 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.029
 the goal is for that reason too 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:52.089
 in fact there are only new and open connections 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:54.349
 it is a player with a computer screen 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.339
 and they make the music out of it 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:00.339
 I've never had a cross-section of vd's support here 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:02.510
 increase very far 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.950
 This is indeed a plastic protective layer that is very thin 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.609
 aluminum days 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.609
 in need of a new challenge 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:16.269
 van persie in the forefront bull and then that's not a point that is a 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.169
 shrinkage 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.299
 and that there are several and one of their baby 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.710
 how you read 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.580
 the cd player is such a cd 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.689
 that is a very good question 6 it is the central point of RVV playing 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:30.659
 life 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.370
 jesus wife 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.370
 who goes through the presikhaaf one 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.689
 last year k
