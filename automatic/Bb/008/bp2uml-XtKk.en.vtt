to<00:05:44.200> remove<00:05:44.560> which<00:05:44.800> is<00:05:45.010> virtually<00:05:45.880> nothing

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
to remove which is virtually nothing

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.040 
to remove which is virtually nothing
because<00:05:47.080> my<00:05:47.230> system<00:05:47.590> is<00:05:47.680> very<00:05:47.830> clean<00:05:48.870> but<00:05:49.870> if

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
because my system is very clean but if

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.010 
because my system is very clean but if
you<00:05:50.140> haven't<00:05:50.290> cleaned<00:05:50.530> it<00:05:50.710> in<00:05:50.770> a<00:05:50.860> while

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
you haven't cleaned it in a while

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.480 
you haven't cleaned it in a while
often<00:05:53.020> the<00:05:53.230> ccleaner<00:05:53.770> will<00:05:54.100> find<00:05:55.170> a<00:05:56.370> lot<00:05:57.370> of

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
often the ccleaner will find a lot of

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.480 
often the ccleaner will find a lot of
files<00:05:57.790> to<00:05:58.180> clean<00:05:58.870> that<00:05:59.200> your<00:05:59.490> operating

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
files to clean that your operating

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.180 
files to clean that your operating
system<00:06:01.090> hard<00:06:01.360> this<00:06:01.600> cleaner<00:06:01.960> missed<00:06:02.410> so

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
system hard this cleaner missed so

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.620 
system hard this cleaner missed so
that's<00:06:03.400> why<00:06:03.640> I<00:06:03.670> recommend<00:06:04.000> doing<00:06:04.840> both<00:06:06.630> then

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
that's why I recommend doing both then

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.810 
that's why I recommend doing both then
from<00:06:08.050> this<00:06:08.230> point<00:06:08.500> on<00:06:08.800> you<00:06:09.010> could<00:06:09.190> just<00:06:09.520> use

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
from this point on you could just use

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.060 
from this point on you could just use
the<00:06:10.000> C<00:06:10.240> cleaner<00:06:10.570> on<00:06:10.810> a<00:06:10.840> weekly<00:06:11.260> basis<00:06:11.800> or<00:06:12.010> even

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
the C cleaner on a weekly basis or even

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.880 
the C cleaner on a weekly basis or even
a<00:06:12.400> bi-weekly<00:06:13.120> or<00:06:13.270> monthly<00:06:13.510> depending<00:06:14.440> on<00:06:14.710> how

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
a bi-weekly or monthly depending on how

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.210 
a bi-weekly or monthly depending on how
much<00:06:15.630> you<00:06:16.630> know<00:06:16.720> how<00:06:16.750> much<00:06:17.260> time<00:06:17.620> you<00:06:17.770> spend<00:06:18.070> on

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
much you know how much time you spend on

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.300 
much you know how much time you spend on
your<00:06:18.250> computer<00:06:18.910> and<00:06:19.560> that<00:06:20.560> will<00:06:20.890> generally

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
your computer and that will generally

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.000 
your computer and that will generally
keep<00:06:21.490> your<00:06:21.640> system<00:06:21.970> clean<00:06:22.740> then<00:06:23.740> you<00:06:23.770> could

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
keep your system clean then you could

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.010 
keep your system clean then you could
clean<00:06:24.220> your<00:06:24.250> hard<00:06:24.550> disk<00:06:24.880> maybe<00:06:25.390> once<00:06:25.810> a<00:06:25.990> month

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020

maintenance<00:06:28.960> step<00:06:29.500> but<00:06:30.460> basically<00:06:30.970> this<00:06:31.090> will

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
maintenance step but basically this will

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.140 
maintenance step but basically this will
