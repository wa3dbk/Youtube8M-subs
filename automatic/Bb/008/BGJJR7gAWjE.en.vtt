pretty big potential have the baby

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.310 
pretty big potential have the baby
mid-race<00:00:17.760> given<00:00:18.180> how<00:00:18.270> far<00:00:18.539> along<00:00:18.630> she<00:00:18.779> wasn't

mid-race given how far along she wasn't
her<00:00:19.380> pregnancy<00:00:19.949> now<00:00:20.100> if<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.250> woman's<00:00:20.520> willing

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
her pregnancy now if a woman's willing

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
to run a race 39 weeks pregnant I

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.170 
to run a race 39 weeks pregnant I
imagine<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.340> she<00:00:23.460> did<00:00:23.670> have<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.970> baby

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
imagine if she did have the baby

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.519 
imagine if she did have the baby
mid-race<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.960> probably<00:00:25.230> would<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.470> just

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
mid-race you probably would have just

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.019 
mid-race you probably would have just
carried<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.279> finish<00:00:26.490> line<00:00:26.760> she

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
carried it to the finish line she

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.980 
carried it to the finish line she
probably<00:00:27.240> should<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.510> carried<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> backpack

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
probably should have carried a backpack

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.990 
probably should have carried a backpack
with<00:00:28.470> towels<00:00:28.740> water<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> blanket<00:00:29.939> to

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
person behind her if her water broke she

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.790 
person behind her if her water broke she
probably<00:00:33.600> should<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:33.899> ran<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> slippery

that far i think part of the reason is i

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.420 
that far i think part of the reason is i
tend<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> get<00:00:46.230> bored<00:00:46.289> easily<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.340> an

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
elliptical at home and I'm on it three

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.600 
elliptical at home and I'm on it three
times<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.200> week<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.710> usually<00:00:50.100> watch<00:00:50.219> TV

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
while I'm doing it I guess just being

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.630 
while I'm doing it I guess just being
alone<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.440> my<00:00:52.590> thoughts<00:00:52.620> doesn't<00:00:53.250> work<00:00:53.370> for

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.860 
alone with my thoughts doesn't work for
me<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.030> probably<00:00:54.149> better<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.600> society

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
me and it's probably better for society

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.900 
me and it's probably better for society
as<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> whole<00:00:55.410> if<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.010> remain<00:00:56.280> distracted

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
as a whole if I just remain distracted

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.340
