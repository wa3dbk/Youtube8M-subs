00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.510 
without any difficulty there's sharper
knives<00:04:36.880> out<00:04:37.120> there<00:04:37.419> but<00:04:37.660> this<00:04:38.500> one<00:04:38.530> does<00:04:39.130> most

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
knives out there but this one does most

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.600 
knives out there but this one does most
of<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.729> tasks<00:04:40.150> i<00:04:40.270> need<00:04:40.479> it<00:04:40.600> to<00:04:41.610> another

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
of the tasks i need it to another

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.710 
of the tasks i need it to another
feature<00:04:42.970> I<00:04:43.150> like<00:04:43.240> is<00:04:43.660> that<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:45.010> clip<00:04:45.490> is<00:04:45.720> it's

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
feature I like is that the clip is it's

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.950 
feature I like is that the clip is it's
ambidextrous<00:04:47.530> so<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:47.830> have<00:04:48.539> screws<00:04:49.539> there

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
ambidextrous so you have screws there

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.490 
ambidextrous so you have screws there
screws<00:04:50.620> there<00:04:51.100> and<00:04:51.810> screws<00:04:52.810> there<00:04:53.050> and<00:04:53.229> screws

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
screws there and screws there and screws

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.050 
screws there and screws there and screws
there<00:04:53.680> so<00:04:53.860> you<00:04:53.950> can<00:04:54.039> carry<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.400> either<00:04:54.520> tip<00:04:54.850> up

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
there so you can carry it either tip up

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.840 
there so you can carry it either tip up
or<00:04:55.300> tip<00:04:55.539> down<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:56.650> either<00:04:57.160> side<00:04:57.520> that<00:04:57.550> you

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
or tip down and either side that you

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:05.159 
or tip down and either side that you
like<00:04:59.520> some<00:05:00.520> criticisms<00:05:01.229> I<00:05:03.120> mean<00:05:04.120> for<00:05:04.510> for

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
like some criticisms I mean for for

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.770 
like some criticisms I mean for for
between<00:05:06.039> 50<00:05:06.460> and<00:05:06.490> 60<00:05:06.850> bucks<00:05:07.180> it's<00:05:07.479> hard<00:05:07.660> to

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
between 50 and 60 bucks it's hard to

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.440 
between 50 and 60 bucks it's hard to
come<00:05:07.960> up<00:05:07.990> with<00:05:08.110> a<00:05:08.260> huge<00:05:08.680> amount<00:05:09.010> of<00:05:09.450> criticisms

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
come up with a huge amount of criticisms

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.240 
come up with a huge amount of criticisms
that<00:05:10.539> would<00:05:10.780> really<00:05:10.960> be<00:05:11.080> fair<00:05:11.530> for<00:05:11.560> this<00:05:12.010> knife

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
that would really be fair for this knife

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.810 
that would really be fair for this knife
I<00:05:13.200> think<00:05:14.200> the<00:05:14.500> steel<00:05:14.770> holds<00:05:15.220> an<00:05:15.310> edge<00:05:15.460> pretty

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
I think the steel holds an edge pretty

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.790 
I think the steel holds an edge pretty
well<00:05:16.030> I<00:05:16.300> do<00:05:16.479> have<00:05:16.690> to<00:05:16.840> touch<00:05:17.020> it<00:05:17.050> up<00:05:17.320> every<00:05:17.590> once

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
well I do have to touch it up every once

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.640 
well I do have to touch it up every once
in<00:05:17.950> a<00:05:18.010> while<00:05:18.160> but<00:05:18.400> i<00:05:18.460> use<00:05:19.419> my<00:05:19.720> knives<00:05:19.960> a<00:05:20.139> lot<00:05:20.289> so

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
in a while but i use my knives a lot so

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.760 
in a while but i use my knives a lot so
I<00:05:21.660> think<00:05:22.660> the<00:05:22.930> steel<00:05:23.139> is<00:05:23.320> pretty<00:05:23.560> good

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
I think the steel is pretty good

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:32.149 
I think the steel is pretty good

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.829 
particular knife but on other knives
under<00:05:44.459> hard<00:05:44.729> use<00:05:45.349> or<00:05:46.349> harder<00:05:47.339> use<00:05:47.699> I've<00:05:48.509> seen

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:48.839 
under hard use or harder use I've seen

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.230 
under hard use or harder use I've seen
these<00:05:49.229> lock<00:05:49.800> backs<00:05:50.129> positioned<00:05:50.789> on<00:05:50.909> the<00:05:50.939> back

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
these lock backs positioned on the back

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.109 
these lock backs positioned on the back
of<00:05:51.270> the<00:05:51.479> blade<00:05:51.689> actually<00:05:51.990> break<00:05:52.499> and<00:05:52.879> my<00:05:53.879> dad

00:05:54.109 --> 00:05:54.119 
of the blade actually break and my dad

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:56.419 
of the blade actually break and my dad
had<00:05:54.419> knife<00:05:55.110> actually<00:05:55.589> closed<00:05:55.919> on<00:05:56.159> him<00:05:56.309> when<00:05:56.399> he

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:56.429 
had knife actually closed on him when he

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:59.179 
had knife actually closed on him when he
was<00:05:56.580> using<00:05:56.849> it<00:05:57.119> and<00:05:57.180> they<00:05:57.270> cut<00:05:57.479> his<00:05:57.599> hand<00:05:57.899> up<00:05:58.189> I

00:05:59.179 --> 00:05:59.189 
was using it and they cut his hand up I

was using it and they cut his hand up I
think<00:05:59.879> they've<00:06:00.029> solved<00:06:00.419> that<00:06:00.569> problem

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:00.779 
think they've solved that problem

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.290 
think they've solved that problem
they've<00:06:01.169> got<00:06:01.349> a<00:06:01.379> little<00:06:01.619> cut<00:06:01.919> out<00:06:02.069> there<00:06:02.369> and<00:06:02.909> I

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:07.409 
the lock mechanism on this knife over a

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:13.820 
the lock mechanism on this knife over a
year<00:06:07.649> of<00:06:07.740> use<00:06:10.909> another<00:06:11.909> criticism<00:06:12.589> if<00:06:13.589> you

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
year of use another criticism if you

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.469 
year of use another criticism if you
want<00:06:14.039> to<00:06:14.129> get<00:06:14.249> picky<00:06:14.639> is<00:06:15.259> it's<00:06:16.259> just<00:06:16.379> not<00:06:16.709> a

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
want to get picky is it's just not a

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.969 
want to get picky is it's just not a
super-strong<00:06:18.479> knife<00:06:18.899> again<00:06:19.379> this<00:06:19.559> is<00:06:19.740> what<00:06:19.949> I

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
super-strong knife again this is what I

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.609 
super-strong knife again this is what I
would<00:06:20.099> consider<00:06:20.309> a<00:06:20.610> light<00:06:20.969> use<00:06:21.269> knife<00:06:21.569> but<00:06:21.959> if

00:06:22.609 --> 00:06:22.619 
would consider a light use knife but if

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:27.049 
would consider a light use knife but if
you<00:06:22.830> look<00:06:24.259> watch<00:06:25.259> that<00:06:25.589> scale<00:06:26.039> bend<00:06:26.399> when<00:06:26.939> you

00:06:27.049 --> 00:06:27.059 
you look watch that scale bend when you

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:28.850 
you look watch that scale bend when you
when<00:06:27.360> you<00:06:27.389> put<00:06:27.629> any<00:06:27.749> kind<00:06:27.959> of<00:06:28.080> lateral<00:06:28.469> tension

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
when you put any kind of lateral tension

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.540 
when you put any kind of lateral tension
on<00:06:28.979> the<00:06:29.099> knife<00:06:30.949> fortunately<00:06:31.949> I've<00:06:32.099> got<00:06:32.339> other

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
on the knife fortunately I've got other

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.689 
on the knife fortunately I've got other
knives<00:06:32.849> that<00:06:33.149> I<00:06:33.589> put<00:06:34.589> into<00:06:34.740> heavier<00:06:35.099> use<00:06:35.430> like

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
knives that I put into heavier use like

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.689 
knives that I put into heavier use like
that<00:06:36.259> so<00:06:37.259> overall<00:06:37.649> I'd<00:06:37.889> say<00:06:37.919> this<00:06:38.219> pretty<00:06:38.519> good

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
that so overall I'd say this pretty good

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.719 
that so overall I'd say this pretty good
knife<00:06:38.879> for<00:06:39.240> the<00:06:39.330> money<00:06:39.539> I<00:06:39.749> think<00:06:40.669> over<00:06:41.669> the

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
knife for the money I think over the

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:43.249 
knife for the money I think over the
course<00:06:41.789> of<00:06:42.149> this<00:06:42.269> next<00:06:42.539> year<00:06:42.869> I'm<00:06:43.019> going<00:06:43.139> to

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 
course of this next year I'm going to

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:47.769 
course of this next year I'm going to
try<00:06:43.439> some<00:06:43.740> heavier<00:06:44.099> use<00:06:44.490> folders<00:06:45.389> out<00:06:46.699> again

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:47.779 
try some heavier use folders out again

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:51.170 
try some heavier use folders out again
light<00:06:48.779> duty<00:06:49.259> light<00:06:49.879> you'll<00:06:50.879> break<00:06:51.119> it

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
light duty light you'll break it

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.619

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:07.189 
things about that striker sng i'm going

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:09.579 
things about that striker sng i'm going
to<00:07:07.249> try<00:07:07.399> that<00:07:07.699> and<00:07:08.300> the<00:07:08.989> other<00:07:09.020> one<00:07:09.349> I'm<00:07:09.469> going

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:09.589 
to try that and the other one I'm going

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:16.239 
to try that and the other one I'm going
to<00:07:09.679> try<00:07:09.919> is<00:07:10.509> zero<00:07:11.509> tolerance<00:07:12.489> 301<00:07:14.979> again<00:07:15.979> we're

00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:16.249 
to try is zero tolerance 301 again we're

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:17.769 
to try is zero tolerance 301 again we're
good<00:07:16.429> things<00:07:16.669> about<00:07:16.819> that<00:07:16.969> and<00:07:17.479> I've<00:07:17.569> been<00:07:17.749> a

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:17.779 
good things about that and I've been a

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:27.089 
good things about that and I've been a
fan<00:07:18.050> of<00:07:18.110> Kershaw<00:07:19.149> especially<00:07:20.149> can<00:07:20.479> I<00:07:20.599> cause

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:27.099 

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:29.859 

that<00:07:28.099> I<00:07:28.189> probably<00:07:28.489> still<00:07:28.939> carry<00:07:29.239> all<00:07:29.479> the<00:07:29.629> time

00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:29.869 
that I probably still carry all the time

00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:32.350 
that I probably still carry all the time
but<00:07:30.139> I<00:07:30.800> worry<00:07:31.189> about<00:07:31.459> losing<00:07:31.699> that<00:07:32.149> one

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 
but I worry about losing that one

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.749 
but I worry about losing that one
because<00:07:32.619> replacing<00:07:33.619> it<00:07:34.039> would<00:07:34.189> be<00:07:34.369> next<00:07:34.580> to

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:34.759 
because replacing it would be next to

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:38.709 
because replacing it would be next to
impossible<00:07:34.879> at<00:07:35.539> this<00:07:35.659> point<00:07:36.069> so<00:07:37.449> that's<00:07:38.449> it

00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:38.719 
impossible at this point so that's it

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:42.939 
impossible at this point so that's it
and<00:07:39.279> I'll<00:07:40.279> see<00:07:40.519> you<00:07:40.610> next<00:07:40.639> year
