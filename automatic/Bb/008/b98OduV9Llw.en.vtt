00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.290
 bleak to slow 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:26.360
 good goalkeepers today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:28.710
 how to put the game in 2014 you want 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.160
 the playstation in the slot of the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.160
 right 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.480
 the pendrive has to be in format 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.970
 fast 32 and we take this in data from 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.530
 saved games that the profile puts and 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.970
 we take it we give to copy 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.970
 we copy it on the pendrive 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.079
 and we copy it on the pendrive 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.040
 then we're going to the pendrive 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.770
 Well, here we are on the computer 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.380
 here my piece of fund more money is of 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.110
 last model ay morenos guatafÃ¡n there 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.930
 Big as good here I leave the 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.390
 file that I have left here that you have 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.320
 the program and above I have left you the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.970
 pileup this one 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.590
 what is the game is worth because if it is not 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.140
 one hundred percent does not work, it's worth here 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.020
 You see that the 2014 version will 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.870
 we give open files it serves as much as 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.920
 playstation 3 like for xbox is worth but 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.910
 each one has a file type 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.100
 different 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.320
 we hope it charges 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.210
 and look for the file that I'll ra 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.689
 the game because normally if not 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.060
 transferred to one hundred percent is not worth 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:49.070
 we look for the file that scratches points up 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.590
 in my case I have it on the desk what 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.750
 we put there we are going to open we take of 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.130
 rage we give to open 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.350
 we select below if we want to 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.729
 xbox playstation3 each what 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.729
 have hope that opens up vale 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.470
 and we are waiting for him to carry a 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.590
 100% departure has to take a 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.120
 little in charge is not 80.4 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.430
 hundred that you are indicating but in 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.840
 reality is one hundred percent worth it because 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.900
 what we have done is the games 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.480
 secondary the rest is all the same 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.430
 well there we are waiting for this that 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.000
 he stays he has to download the hundred 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.000
 one hundred of the game 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.090
 good while I was loading myself 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.570
 I'm explaining what I was banned from 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.850
 gta 5 until May 25 for using hack 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.830
 and mod but good the problem none 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.220
 I'm going back on the 25th and we're going to continue there 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.470
 giving cane and good by bringing tricks 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.780
 daily or trying to bring it daily 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.220
 because you know that the people then the 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.020
 people like me have life 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.220
 there are other youtube that do not have lives 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.440
 social activities are carried out all day in the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.270
 computer but I have life I have I have 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.740
 my partners and I have my things to do 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.260
 and I can not stop these days that he 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.970
 already or not 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.459
 but good hope we have to charge 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.880
 the protagonists are loading the 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.130
 three of these 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.830
 the opposite of fast camera 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.260
 to finish loading 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.680
 and good here you have then you have the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.160
 garage you have missions you have little things 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.660
 new that the 2014 version brings here 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.100
 change from this you put the money that 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.950
 you want the protagonists you put 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.210
 the skills to the maximum you look at 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.710
 missions to see what is there 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:51.200
 to change what you want is worth 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.940
 I'm going to get in the garage and here 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.410
 I'm going to select the car that gives me the 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.860
 wins that here are all the cars that 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.080
 you can look at it in the list perfectly 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.910
 here you have it you can take the car that 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.720
 you want and now I'm indicating how 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.720
 handle this 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.489
 I'll see to see how I fuck to see me 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.489
 lame 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:18.669
 that we have this we give to those of the 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.949
 shade cross to the maximum and it will put 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.199
 the car everything to the maximum the shielding everything 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.970
 the maximum is worth and then we take another 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.740
 car so the antivirus has skipped me 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.600
 problem can we another car we can 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.120
 catch up to four and always in the 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.280
 garage we know which one is worth but all 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.759
 the maximum is already saved and then 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.800
 we give to know file vale and here below the 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:43.490
 left you are seeing on the screen 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.080
 the gta 5 cow 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.860
 and that's where you keep looking for the 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.530
 file that is from today and good 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.410
 Well, after modifying it, it 's just 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.490
 change to the one on the pendrive 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.470
 but rush files that is in the 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.180
 pendrive and you're already playing it 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.790
 now we will go to the play 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.830
 in agreement 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:07.230
 wait for it to finish is all save it 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:11.849
 that will close program 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:14.120
 and this we have there is a little bit of status 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.030
 coming out a little 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.610
 I will also leave the file at 80.4 for 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.470
 cent for if our 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.250
 game you do not have the game last I 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:28.220
 I will leave 80% of mine there so that 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.470
 I know I have no problem 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.479
 It is not a game that wants to spend 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.990
 game because I do not use the program or 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.430
 I wait to play the game I drowned 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.290
 there is a little bit of waiting to play the game 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.800
 for this the good thing now we are going to go 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.800
 to the play 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.259
 there are people who again where is the 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:48.139
 file we have to look for in what 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:50.930
 folder is and now we have to already 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:53.960
 it was play that we 're going now to sinde was 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.370
 virus and I'm where you come back if you're with 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.930
 the mouse and well here we are again 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.909
 the play we go to tools 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.229
 saved data 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.000
 we look for the pendrive that we will have 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.340
 You are looking at the dates above 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.980
 game I have a starting point and 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:12.010
 that we put it in the usb device 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:15.030
 and we give him to copy the game that would be 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.030
 in my case it would be this vale 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.750
 well we give to and this is the other one that 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.090
 I'm not worth anything because from the 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.080
 principle is not worth anything so what 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.330
 we put there 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.479
 and this we give to copy will tell us what 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.020
 we replace with the departure of others 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:33.449
 so they tie 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.930
 you want to subscribe about writing them if 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.069
 we give it to you like this and until you finish 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.460
 will come sure you want to overwrite 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.900
 the data if the data is to try 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.380
 copy are saved data from another 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.520
 user that 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:52.130
