 you have called because if in one 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:22.160
 rather difficult situation right 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:28.760
 that is, that is, we live with 250 euros per 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:31.480
 month because he still disabled at 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.480
 hundred percent 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.800
 let's say there are fools in the whole sense 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.010
 put black on white 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.380

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.410
 but I ca n't run work here not 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.280
 last year he worked in one 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.379
 cooperative is a more lonely job 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.140
 fired I was fired yes 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.479
 because the company of 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.160
 torino who did the cleaning in 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.320
 schools lost the contract then 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.260
 left at home 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.229
 lessinia locci also doesn't work I don't 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.229
 I'm busy 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.550
 we are seven eight months because unfortunately 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.070
 all 2000 house for the inconvenience of 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.520
 illness not supposed to be at home that 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.950
 for them 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.580
 we create problem which disease I am in 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.700
 peritoneal dialysis and deprived of this 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.259
 difficulty entering the problem 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:44.520
 job I am registered I receive 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:49.830
 social ligament all the district has 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.450
 cried for so problem is just for 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.300
 the companies that saw radials of 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.399
 people have fired for them 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.990
 discomfort because unfortunately there are no gifts 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.840
 made four hours without three quarters 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.240
 hence for them it creates a problem 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.009
 the license for this reason of this 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.660
 reason I signed up officially 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:17.610
 placement that pass eight months that 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.150
 so you have 250 euros coming 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.150
 from what 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.910
 what is worse from the unpublished in 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.270
 how many cups contributions so that you 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.920
 they gave Italian to these revolts 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:37.080
 Social services social Elias 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.200
 preparing the problem they know not 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.140
 we make the little girl spend it 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.709
 things you spend and so on 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.920
 we own the three months that the crisis 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.709
 social social service because then not 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.030
 it's not even my social mind because 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.090
 my social worker 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.400
 the questions made them their flaws are 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.610
 moves as you have to move the problem is 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.269
 just according to me it starts from higher up 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.209
 in the sense that the three months that it continues to 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.670
 say that these funds are blocked 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.830
 budget I do not know if regional I do not know if it is 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.380
 I did not understand a budget but not 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.530
 they can make people live in this 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.870
 been you would expect a subsidy from 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.690
 social services look more silvio 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.870
 as for the child because a 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:32.040
 own subsidy for the girl of 250 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.640
 euro which can be variable in the sense 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.799
 that generally maximum 300 and 1980 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.430
 so then I tried with them though 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.890
 we take 250 euros which I still don't 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.560
 it is or many but they helped me because me 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.260
 every day I move with my daughter 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.769
 by bus because where the there went 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.840
 osasco paper there are no middle schools 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.780
 and therefore it is not 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.690
 mine then I move every day 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.420
 with her I pay 3 euros one way ticket 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:07.910
 and 3 euros ticket on the way back then 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:13.370
 you count in all of me since October 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:17.810
 until now we are at the 13th of March 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.449
 all tickets are 450 euros 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.940
 in the sense all in a way of looking 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:26.690
 see your son with your friends at 12 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.630
 years to the facts yesterday and I can't 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.450
 think about letting her especially live in 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:36.080
 this way because i am an adult i am 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.120
 I can also adapt but having a child 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.340
 of this age some go to the middle school that 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.460
 sees other comrades who must give up 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.580
 to this of the things that are things that 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.770
 one should have in the sense that if we 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.120
 let's just look at them 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.280
 they talk about btp with a job should 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.630
 having them normally, that is, things that 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:02.479
 more Italians should have a right 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.800
 are the main things in the 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.360
 constitution that work is a thing but 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.460
 it's not there but where it is 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.760
 where are the institutions you are 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.490

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.680
 cooperative agencies from all over 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.039

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.780

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.410
 that I have no problem moving 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.770
 because I move that bus from one 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.560
 life 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.419
 there was no driving license so I did 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.610

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.219

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:23.120
 the network machine never had the 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.560
 car to tell why he worked 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.050
 please allow a small one 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.740
 utilitarian but unfortunately they are ours 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.870
 at home and no longer able to 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.819
 insurance the car remained free 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.069
 insurance in a public place 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:40.219
 one morning my strength arrived 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:44.089
 order telling me that the car does not 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:48.310
 could stay without depriving simulation and 

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:48.310
 i feel weighed character takes away 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.120
 then it is only inhabited we live in Osasco 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:03.370
 case from the municipality to say they put themselves 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.050
 agreed with the deputy mayor of 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.080
 pinerolo has agreed with the 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:11.170
 osasco mayor to have this house 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:14.050
 I had to fight that too 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:16.030
 that even here, however, I did it for 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.550
 luck because I had an eviction 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.970
 in the English house I don't know what we'll have 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:25.630
 so I will close the spiked dog then I will 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:27.160
 I had to force for a week a 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.350
 back and forth I went to the 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.850
 common in the beginning when they are given 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.520
 the home office was answered to me 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:36.820
 we can do nothing because it just falls 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.010
 not and there is none when then a rival 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.290
 extremis then begins to make the gesture 

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:44.020
 glaring then people would give you to 

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:47.170
 that done so I started on 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:49.650
 Town window is in front of the office 

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:53.320
 home so don't pay rent 

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:58.000
 we pay little rent we pay 40 euros 

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:59.980
 of hiring also though that unfortunately if 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.510
 there never is no way to pay 

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.510
 not even 240 euros
