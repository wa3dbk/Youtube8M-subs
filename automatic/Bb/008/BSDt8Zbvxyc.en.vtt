00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.219
 to me 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.250
 What's up with kids here in general? 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.160
 I bring a trick to the call of duty 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.680
 whites 2 for the rise map and it's a 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.570
 Trick the truth that I discovered it by trying 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.640
 I do not know if someone else has discovered it 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.380
 but well I already know that when I say 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.390
 that discovered something means that I have 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.280
 done without looking anywhere 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.840
 another thing is that someone in the world of 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.020
 These people that we are have discovered 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.700
 that's another thing but good is here you see 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.010
 that we have the advisors we have here 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.690
 the playmore there is where it is not in the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.170
 roof where the dragons and others are 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.360
 then you would have to place the trap and 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.740
 Now you see how he placed it and so on but 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.900
 is for you to know where we are 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.260
 you see exactly that you have to place the 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.630
 trap there on that wall at the door of 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.019
 the left of seen where it was and 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.850
 You have to hurry the way I do 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.650
 it's a video you can repeat it 50,000 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.689
 times to see how I do it that is very 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.240
 easy once the trap is charged 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.130
 you have to jump, leave you in the middle of the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.500
 wall you have to catch again and 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.210
 point to where I point myself equal 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.720
 as I do then the trap is 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.520
 it's up there 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.830
 you have to jump to again in that 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.590
 moment and leave it right up in the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.480
 roof you see will leave us rooftops 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.120
 impossible to receive any touch gives us 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.640
 nobody but I also say that you can not 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.680
 get out of there once there is not be a 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.510
 putada but good as the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.040
 trap you have to hit a small jump 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.110
 with the X and not jump again 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.090
 because there is a barrier in the sky that 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.340
 is the opposite of when you leave the 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.860
 map if you jump many times here you 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.630
 you die, we go backwards, otherwise you jump 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.940
 you die here it's just the other way around if you jump 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.470
 many times you die too we can 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.970
 let him chase us because once 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.040
 you can no longer lift and you 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.900
 you're super bad it 's better to be like that 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.630
 although there the image seems to be 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.280
 hooked on I'm really standing 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.119
 to know what would happen if I ducked out 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.039
 of the character all you can upload 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.690
 another person plus another tail more and you 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.170
 can get there to watch the other part 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.360
 from the roof 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.890
 with this trick we do not do that 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.360
 Zombie accumulation does not accumulate 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.640
 all in the same place but they do 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.270
 around us what is the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.220
 roof you can see up there you can 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.050
 pass through the tower of eriste 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.640
 lake go down the slope in the turn 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.709
 Once you pass through here you find 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.569
 we believed and in the elevator here in the 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.190
 elevators this both round and round 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.530
 again to a circuit they do like 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.090
 kind of circuit 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.650
 sometimes here right where I'm focusing 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.600
 here where we sometimes saw sometimes 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.190
 sometimes it is hooked some and if it remains 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.470
 blocked so I do not expect anything that has 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.980
 liked this trick so handsome to me has 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.590
 charmed

 ledis alarcÃ³n subscribe or subscribe yes 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.240
 you are not here and see you in the next 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.240
 video 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.720
 very well
