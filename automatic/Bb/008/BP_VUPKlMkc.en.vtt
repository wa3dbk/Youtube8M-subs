00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.499 
off so that's where you gotta learn
quickly<00:01:38.220> because<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.240> make<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
quickly because you can make the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.450 
quickly because you can make the
mistakes<00:01:39.840> once<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.290> twice<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.280> don't

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
mistakes once or twice but you don't

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.280

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
want to do it too often so scheduling i

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.600 
want to do it too often so scheduling i
think<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.590> vital<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:43.920> every<00:01:44.189> tennis<00:01:44.430> player

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
with 73 match wins is is that possible

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.080 
with 73 match wins is is that possible

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
to do that again this year or is that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.080 
to do that again this year or is that
not<00:01:51.659> necessarily<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.500> goal<00:01:52.979> at<00:01:53.250> 33<00:01:53.729> years<00:01:53.970> of

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
not necessarily a goal at 33 years of

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.359 
not necessarily a goal at 33 years of
age<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.509> mean<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> goal<00:01:54.990> wasn't<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.219> guy

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
age I mean the goal wasn't to be the guy

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.039 
age I mean the goal wasn't to be the guy
who<00:01:56.430> won<00:01:56.729> most<00:01:56.909> matches<00:01:57.180> i<00:01:57.479> think<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.990> year

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
who won most matches i think this year
