00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.200 
yep I have three of them man
stop<00:05:14.500> it<00:05:14.710> one<00:05:14.950> that's<00:05:15.250> all<00:05:15.400> I<00:05:15.430> could<00:05:15.550> say<00:05:15.730> oh

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
stop it one that's all I could say oh

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.290 
stop it one that's all I could say oh
did<00:05:16.930> he<00:05:16.960> have<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:17.380> Kumar<00:05:18.220> oil<00:05:18.730> a<00:05:18.910> little

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
did he have and Kumar oil a little

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:26.760 
did he have and Kumar oil a little
dopamine<00:05:23.760> it<00:05:24.760> all<00:05:25.270> says<00:05:25.530> theobromine<00:05:26.530> in

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
dopamine it all says theobromine in

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.920 
dopamine it all says theobromine in
there<00:05:26.920> here's<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.430> thing<00:05:27.670> beta<00:05:28.660> 2<00:05:28.900> receptors

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
there here's the thing beta 2 receptors

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.040 
there here's the thing beta 2 receptors
just<00:05:30.120> looking<00:05:31.120> at<00:05:31.210> what<00:05:31.330> it<00:05:31.420> does<00:05:31.540> increases

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
just looking at what it does increases

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.920 
just looking at what it does increases
blood<00:05:32.200> flow<00:05:32.320> reduces<00:05:33.160> muscle<00:05:34.090> protein<00:05:34.630> usage

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
blood flow reduces muscle protein usage

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.050 
blood flow reduces muscle protein usage
which<00:05:35.110> is<00:05:35.230> catabolic<00:05:35.650> effects<00:05:36.190> increases

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
which is catabolic effects increases

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.210 
which is catabolic effects increases
protein<00:05:37.450> synthesis<00:05:37.900> and<00:05:38.140> increases<00:05:38.650> adipose

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
protein synthesis and increases adipose

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.540 
protein synthesis and increases adipose
utilization<00:05:40.680> then<00:05:41.680> you<00:05:41.770> got<00:05:41.890> three<00:05:42.250> three

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
utilization then you got three three

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.970 
utilization then you got three three
diagonal<00:05:43.060> methane<00:05:43.480> which<00:05:43.870> also<00:05:44.170> takes<00:05:44.770> down

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
diagonal methane which also takes down

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.850 
diagonal methane which also takes down
estrogen<00:05:45.640> this<00:05:46.630> is<00:05:46.810> one<00:05:47.050> thing<00:05:47.200> I<00:05:47.290> did<00:05:47.530> use<00:05:47.710> an

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
estrogen this is one thing I did use an

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.910 
estrogen this is one thing I did use an
Astra<00:05:48.160> Court<00:05:48.400> I<00:05:48.520> love<00:05:48.910> it<00:05:49.060> and<00:05:49.240> what<00:05:49.540> it's<00:05:49.690> a

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
Astra Court I love it and what it's a

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.140 
Astra Court I love it and what it's a
standardized<00:05:50.920> I<00:05:51.130> really<00:05:51.580> like<00:05:51.760> it

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
standardized I really like it

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.390 
standardized I really like it

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
one increase these gap gaba which is

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.030 
one increase these gap gaba which is
neurotransmitter<00:06:04.870> and<00:06:05.110> increasing<00:06:05.710> levels

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
neurotransmitter and increasing levels

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.680

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
feel good theanine is a great compound

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000 
feel good theanine is a great compound
now<00:06:10.120> I<00:06:10.150> like<00:06:10.510> this<00:06:10.720> this<00:06:11.020> is<00:06:11.200> one<00:06:11.440> that<00:06:11.800> I

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
now I like this this is one that I

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.710 
now I like this this is one that I
haven't<00:06:12.250> opened<00:06:12.400> it<00:06:12.640> yet<00:06:12.700> and<00:06:13.060> I'm<00:06:13.540> pretty

I<00:06:20.020> believe<00:06:20.320> in<00:06:20.410> these<00:06:20.500> compounds<00:06:20.980> I<00:06:21.190> always

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
I believe in these compounds I always

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.980 
I believe in these compounds I always
have<00:06:21.640> core<00:06:22.270> heart<00:06:22.480> is<00:06:22.630> something<00:06:22.810> to<00:06:22.930> look

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
have core heart is something to look

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.480 
have core heart is something to look
into<00:06:23.350> and<00:06:23.590> with<00:06:23.710> ducks<00:06:23.950> permission<00:06:24.370> I'd<00:06:24.460> like

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
into and with ducks permission I'd like

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.490 
into and with ducks permission I'd like
to<00:06:24.640> stack<00:06:24.940> this<00:06:25.150> other<00:06:25.480> fat<00:06:25.840> burners

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
to stack this other fat burners

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.810 
to stack this other fat burners
because<00:06:26.770> I<00:06:26.860> think<00:06:26.920> that<00:06:27.160> people<00:06:27.520> are<00:06:27.550> losing

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
because I think that people are losing

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.920 
because I think that people are losing
out<00:06:28.030> when<00:06:28.180> they<00:06:28.240> don't<00:06:28.360> look<00:06:28.540> into<00:06:28.810> these

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
out when they don't look into these

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.670 
out when they don't look into these
pathways<00:06:29.290> do<00:06:30.190> fat<00:06:30.460> loss<00:06:30.670> now<00:06:31.470> these<00:06:32.470> are

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
pathways do fat loss now these are
