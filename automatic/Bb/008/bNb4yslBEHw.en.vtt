earrings the technique is very simple
and<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.460> use<00:00:17.850> only<00:00:18.060> few<00:00:18.359> parts<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:19.020> let's<00:00:19.050> take

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
and we use only few parts so let's take

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.410 
and we use only few parts so let's take
a<00:00:19.590> look<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.039> material<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.580> used<00:00:20.820> these<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
a look to the material I used these the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.750 
a look to the material I used these the
materials<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:22.199> used<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.710> only<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.279> hearing

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
materials are used for only one hearing

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.720 
materials are used for only one hearing
so<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.180> need<00:00:24.689> wise<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.650> get<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> couple<00:00:26.279> we<00:00:26.580> need

so<00:00:50.190> let's<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.460> started

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.510 

first<00:01:00.079> of<00:01:00.260> all<00:01:00.380> we<00:01:00.590> have<00:01:00.829> to<00:01:00.950> double<00:01:01.160> their

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
first of all we have to double their

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.910 
first of all we have to double their
sweat<00:01:01.790> lace<00:01:02.059> shaping<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.870> wings<00:01:03.170> of<00:01:03.620> the

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
sweat lace shaping the wings of the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.790 
sweat lace shaping the wings of the
dragonfly<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:04.909> make<00:01:05.150> two<00:01:05.479> loops<00:01:05.780> of<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.590> same

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
dragonfly so make two loops of the same

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.790 
dragonfly so make two loops of the same
side<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.490> then<00:01:08.119> others<00:01:08.630> two<00:01:09.020> smaller<00:01:09.440> in

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
side and then others two smaller in

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.280 
side and then others two smaller in
order<00:01:10.010> to<00:01:10.280> get<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.640> four<00:01:10.909> wings<00:01:11.180> that<00:01:11.810> are<00:01:12.050> the

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
order to get the four wings that are the

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:22.610 
order to get the four wings that are the
feature<00:01:12.530> of<00:01:12.920> dragonflies

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.260 

the<00:01:23.620> next<00:01:23.860> step<00:01:24.040> is<00:01:24.250> to<00:01:24.490> pass<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.730> needle

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
the next step is to pass a needle

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.450 
the next step is to pass a needle
through<00:01:25.600> over<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.960> center<00:01:26.410> of<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.770> laces<00:01:27.190> in

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
through over the center of the laces in

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.640 
through over the center of the laces in
order<00:01:27.760> to<00:01:27.910> get<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.330> stock<00:01:28.660> and<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.170> open<00:01:29.530> the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
order to get the stock and to open the

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.160 
order to get the stock and to open the
way<00:01:29.830> that<00:01:30.160> will<00:01:30.490> allow<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.360> pass<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.140> eye

way that will allow you to pass the eye

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.960 
way that will allow you to pass the eye
pin<00:01:32.620> through<00:01:32.980> it<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:36.250> prepare<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.730> IP

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
pin through it so prepare the IP

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.690 
pin through it so prepare the IP
