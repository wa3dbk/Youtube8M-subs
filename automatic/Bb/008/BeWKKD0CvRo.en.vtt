working<00:00:38.760> water<00:00:39.590> is<00:00:40.590> back<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.160> forth<00:00:42.170> just

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
working water is back and forth just

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.860 
working water is back and forth just
like<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.430> see<00:00:44.640> how<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.629> white

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
like so and you see how the the white

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.450 
like so and you see how the the white
mixture<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> colors<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.219> put

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
mixture with the colors that you put

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.970 
mixture with the colors that you put
underneath<00:00:47.840> creates<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.989> real<00:00:49.260> smooth<00:00:49.559> effect

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
underneath creates a real smooth effect

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.650 
underneath creates a real smooth effect
and<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.460> little<00:00:50.760> bit<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.910> blood<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.300> create<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
and a little bit of blood to create a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.380 
and a little bit of blood to create a
river<00:00:53.360> just<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.640> now<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.820> my<00:00:56.940> strategy

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
river just like so now with my strategy

I have it right here so it doesn't go on
to<00:01:00.420> our<00:01:00.539> planet<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> pic<00:01:01.649> doesn't<00:01:02.010> spill

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
to our planet so the pic doesn't spill

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.210 
to our planet so the pic doesn't spill
over<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.399> our<00:01:02.579> planet<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.619> make<00:01:04.949> sure<00:01:04.979> you

there the colors upwards it is going to

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.340 
there the colors upwards it is going to
create<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:27.920> cliff<00:01:28.250> effect<00:01:28.810> if<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.050> colors

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
create a cliff effect if the colors

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.110 
create a cliff effect if the colors
begin<00:01:30.620> to<00:01:30.740> dry<00:01:30.920> on<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:31.220> go<00:01:31.670> ahead<00:01:31.730> and<00:01:31.940> spray<00:01:32.090> a
