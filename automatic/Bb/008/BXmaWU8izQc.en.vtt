to<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.710> in<00:03:30.710> English<00:03:31.130> you'll<00:03:31.340> probably<00:03:31.610> be

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
to and in English you'll probably be

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.840

change<00:03:33.020> speed<00:03:33.560> or<00:03:34.190> something<00:03:34.490> like<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:34.640> and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
change speed or something like that and

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.660 
change speed or something like that and
then<00:03:37.850> just<00:03:38.090> put<00:03:38.360> it<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.660> if<00:03:39.020> you<00:03:39.170> wanted<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.670> used
