 tv sport.es were present

 the competitors had to compose 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.240
 with a temperature once and the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.610
 presence of the wind a happy cocktail for 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.960
 our Canadian skaters had 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.980
 of life is essential in the

 South series that will have 20 years of existence

 so it's interesting 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.089
 certain traditions and we quebec 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.199
 holds at least one per year and in 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.400
 last three years leaves the 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.949
 third year parade we say the 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.360
 first for us is elise forget 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.739
 the 16th then the conditions are 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.650
 generally very good at the weather level 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.220
 doubt the ice too and the stake for 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.720
 athletes 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.360
 it's a post at the end of the line on 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.799
 the national development team 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.720
 among the elite skaters we 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.170
 find two of us who command 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.700
 that running at home is 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.939
 always fun raced here before 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.920
 his will and his friends you relied 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:28.409
 skating it's a competition 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.409
 Saturday preparation against again and 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.150
 always fun to skate at home is 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.220
 a little cold today but I want 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.450
 to say is that a home and then there I am 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.520
 ready I still take a lot of 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.320
 pride to perform at home even though this 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.060
 pole competition is particularly 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.399
 important i want guys brushes 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:53.570
 neither party made the trip so I 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:55.579
 can from his first year as a 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.350
 skater I have seniors these two 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.580
 seasons higher set them in turn 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.990
 on the plane experience precisely the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.490
 world championship by distances at the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.020
 year end their confession given and to 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.330
 sochi it's just the experience 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.250
 to be the bo of your installations but 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.840
 how much when mothers in the world cc 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.819
 it's clear that to be regularly 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.920
 in the first five it takes 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.780
 experience it does not happen magically 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.390
 does not happen at the first time who is who 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.090
 is in bins this circuit 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.560
 so it's really something that I 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.480
 wish so much this year of experience 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.120
 has returned from world-class racing 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.150
 to me then position myself for the better 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.150
 haves 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.420
 for the native levis coach the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.430
 goals seem attainable which is 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.049
 stabilizing at 1000 m from 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.580
 make a second very good distance 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.440
 for him then for me 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.780
 goals for him this season this 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.940
 would be to perform well at the champion's 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.810
 sprint world that's going to be held at 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.810
 health that city 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.810
 I would like a lot of finesse in 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.820
 first ten home visits are 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.190
 a little bit more a fiction but for 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.080
 me it's a given first ten to his 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.600
 first year senior I would be very 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.430
 pleased for his part as long as being in 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.830
 the bubbles even if christmas depending on 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.860
 the appropriate original laroquais had 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.710
 socialist request for gifts I 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.370
 progress is a year pre 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.380
 Olympic 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.720
 we want to reach the best children 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.860
 what we can but completely what 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.780
 does that mean it would mean a 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.090
 best personal brand 500 miles 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.410
 biomill world have put the match because 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.800
 it is attainable 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.850
 it's 508 I'll have to live well 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.240
 from their work on my contribution 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.620
 improve it if i canada by this game 42 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.620
 get off some staff 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.450
 otherwise being in the boxes of 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.610
 the city for several years it's up to 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.470
 say the construction of a covered ring 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.570
 we took advantage of this competition 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.580
 to take a look at 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.330
 examples that could be a reality 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.310
 One day 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.320
 in fact it 's second graders 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.720
 lunar cycle is Laval last winter 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.190
 they launched the teacher's 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.020
 responsible for the department where the old 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.120
 project inside a course that 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.490
 was a conceptualization project 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.560
 architectural of a covered ring 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.530
 so it's not related to the project 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.489
 Official contest contest codirige with 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.230
 the city of quebec 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.850
 it is rather a university project 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.950
 but what's interesting is that 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.900
 it was really inside a race 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.460
 and she concludes from a course and there we have 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.170
 thought of a national event in 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.760
 a few months would you be interested and 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.530
 since time there is one of the four 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.450
 projects it's displayed here exposed 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.790
 here who have won an international award 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.390
 at level 2 students in 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.280
 architecture 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.630
 so it's interesting it's a dream 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.140
 since his guard our project is 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.140
 always a 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.130
 there is always a positive side to 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.160
 all so train in the cold gives a 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.060
 advantage 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.920
 personally we get it gives us a 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.380
 advantage because we know the focus 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.970
 one and then we have it too 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.580
 today laurent to the 500 miles that 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.260
 I finished first second boxing at 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.640
 a little silly but we finished first 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.320
 second by a good walk it's 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.840
 true we see that we have a gap a of 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.670
 better adapt to these conditions their 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.870
 your colleagues from the west have to say 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.280
 lord it 's machine villains 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.180
 of war these guys to be performer 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.220
 like that even in the cold 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.510
 hu said understand not understand them 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.570
 not why we can train euros 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.570
 but when it is to stay in Quebec 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.840
 for and sports well to stay at 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.460
 oneself in one's and the company then one 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.550
 try to get the most out of 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.930
 possible good season to our skaters the 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.270
 region will once again be well 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.270
 represented by several athletes
