it's just got a really really good taste
to<00:02:31.210> it<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:32.110> just<00:02:32.350> gives<00:02:32.730> your<00:02:33.730> food<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.450> lot

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
to it and it just gives your food a lot

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.240 
to it and it just gives your food a lot
more<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:35.140> complex<00:02:35.620> flavor<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.780> then<00:02:38.250> you

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
more of a complex flavor and then you

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
more of a complex flavor and then you
can<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:40.270> course<00:02:40.330> also<00:02:40.900> add<00:02:41.680> onions<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.970> if

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
can of course also add onions to it if

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.050 
can of course also add onions to it if
you're<00:02:43.810> going<00:02:44.020> to<00:02:44.110> make<00:02:44.410> your<00:02:45.130> veggies<00:02:45.640> like<00:02:45.880> i

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
you're going to make your veggies like i

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.880 
you're going to make your veggies like i
do<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.300> i<00:02:47.080> just<00:02:47.890> put<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.130> little<00:02:48.190> bit<00:02:48.490> in<00:02:48.610> there

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
do and i just put a little bit in there

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.920 
do and i just put a little bit in there
so<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:50.920> just<00:02:51.580> gives<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.540> little<00:02:52.660> more

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
so that just gives it a little more

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.960 
so that just gives it a little more
texture<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.620> depth<00:02:53.860> for<00:02:54.250> me<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:56.010> also<00:02:57.010> last

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
texture and depth for me and also last

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.650 
texture and depth for me and also last
but<00:02:58.150> not<00:02:58.360> believe<00:02:59.850> lemon<00:03:00.850> juice<00:03:01.120> that's<00:03:01.390> about

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
but not believe lemon juice that's about

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.150 
but not believe lemon juice that's about
a<00:03:01.690> quarter<00:03:01.990> of<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.950> lemon<00:03:02.980> juice<00:03:03.520> and<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.920> this

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
a quarter of a lemon juice and and this

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.790 
a quarter of a lemon juice and and this
might<00:03:06.459> be<00:03:06.670> before<00:03:07.480> some<00:03:07.690> of<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:07.959> don't<00:03:08.590> really
