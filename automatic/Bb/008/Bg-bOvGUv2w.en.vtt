00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello everyone already commented a new 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.400
 Comment Orlando on this opportunity 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.109
 I will give you my first impressions on 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.880
 the movie walking with i'm assault 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.559
 also known as walking with 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.360
 dinosaurs which is partially 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.820
 based on the documentary series of the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.619
 bbc with the same name as curiosity 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.820
 this film had a different dub 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.680
 for chile that for the rest of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.480
 Latin America with a complete change in 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.490
 the casting including the well-known actor 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.380
 jorge zabaleta about the story 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.359
 it tells us the life of patxi a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.070
 patxi dinosaur from 70 million years ago 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.869
 years that happens to be the smallest and 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.759
 weak in his litter to be the leader of 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.590
 the whole herd the visual effects 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.120
 they are very well achieved by doing that in 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.129
 occasions it is very difficult to distinguish 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.090
 between the shots in real locations and 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.739
 the generated elements 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.050
 computationally since in truth 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.730
 they look like real animals however in 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.620
 contrast with the visual level we 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.600
 We faced with a very low level 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.219
 script and is that originally this 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.930
 movie was designed as a film 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.309
 dialogue with a narrator only as a 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.559
 additional support to drive the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.239
 history however later it 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.129
 decided to put voices on the characters 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.719
 with the aim of creating a greater 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.670
 connection with younger viewers 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.500
 age and if they could have the area at 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.330
 respect but the average viewer 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.050
 this resulted in a mockery plot 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.940
 help pÃ©rez 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.080
 and full of elements already used up 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.000
 reach 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.710
 ironically, the way in which the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.060
 dialogues were applied made 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.950
 several of the scenes lost their 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.180
 impact so we could say that 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.070
 the decision was actually 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.840
 counterproductive since it absorbed great 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.060
 part of the positive aspects of 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.890
 films in short like whitten 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.840
 forces an acceptable movie for 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.700
 that small children see especially 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.200
 If we are interested in dinosaurs but 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.790
 not recommended for the public that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.870
 is looking for an entertaining story and 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.430
 innovative 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.290
 I am random rodrigo and that has been my 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.290
 Comment on this until soon
