away<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.009> then<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.490> also<00:01:38.640> got<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.939> make<00:01:39.119> sure

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
away and then you also got to make sure

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.510 
away and then you also got to make sure
you're<00:01:39.450> running<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.900> best<00:01:40.650> class<00:01:40.950> setup<00:01:40.979> for

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
you're running the best class setup for

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.889 
you're running the best class setup for
the<00:01:41.579> DNA<00:01:41.850> bomb<00:01:42.210> i'll<00:01:42.390> leave<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> link<00:01:42.689> in

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
the DNA bomb i'll leave a link in

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.330 
the DNA bomb i'll leave a link in
description<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.040> see<00:01:44.310> i

description for that as you can see i

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.520 
description for that as you can see i
got<00:01:44.670> them<00:01:44.850> system<00:01:45.240> hacked<00:01:45.450> right<00:01:45.689> now<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.439> i

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
got them system hacked right now and i

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.490 
got them system hacked right now and i
got<00:01:46.710> my<00:01:46.829> UAV<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.579> support<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:49.380> know

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
got my UAV on support so that you know

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.590 
got my UAV on support so that you know
in<00:01:49.710> case<00:01:49.890> if<00:01:50.100> i<00:01:50.220> die<00:01:50.280> i<00:01:50.820> still<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.420> those

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
in case if i die i still have those

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.929 
in case if i die i still have those
points<00:01:52.049> going<00:01:52.259> towards<00:01:52.619> my<00:01:52.740> UAV<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.640> help<00:01:53.790> me

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
points going towards my UAV to help me

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.899 
points going towards my UAV to help me
get<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.439> sort<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.530> some<00:01:55.860> kind<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.159> momentum<00:01:56.430> so

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
get on sort of some kind of momentum so

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.850 
get on sort of some kind of momentum so
see<00:01:57.540> how<00:01:57.719> i'm<00:01:57.930> aiming<00:01:58.259> down<00:01:58.439> those<00:01:58.619> stairs

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
see how i'm aiming down those stairs

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.530 
see how i'm aiming down those stairs
sometimes<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.579> come<00:01:59.850> down<00:01:59.880> here<00:02:00.360> and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
sometimes I like to come down here and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.889 
sometimes I like to come down here and
if<00:02:01.409> they're<00:02:01.649> not<00:02:01.740> coming<00:02:02.070> from<00:02:02.189> those<00:02:02.399> stairs

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
if they're not coming from those stairs

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.389 
if they're not coming from those stairs
directly<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.140> my<00:02:04.290> right<00:02:04.530> then<00:02:05.130> they're

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
directly to my right then they're

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.399 
directly to my right then they're
probably<00:02:05.430> coming<00:02:05.880> from<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.540> left<00:02:06.570> side<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.170> a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
probably coming from the left side of a

probably coming from the left side of a
now<00:02:08.239> when<00:02:09.239> you're<00:02:09.360> doing<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.750> strategy<00:02:10.259> you

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
now when you're doing this strategy you

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.220 
now when you're doing this strategy you
want<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.099> make<00:02:11.250> sure<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.550> you're<00:02:11.940> not

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
want to make sure that you're not

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.360 
want to make sure that you're not
posing<00:02:13.620> yourself<00:02:13.950> too<00:02:14.099> much<00:02:14.129> because

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
posing yourself too much because

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.250 
posing yourself too much because
sometimes<00:02:14.760> they'll<00:02:14.940> be<00:02:15.030> snipers<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.599> as<00:02:16.110> you

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
sometimes they'll be snipers and as you

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.690 
sometimes they'll be snipers and as you
see<00:02:16.409> here<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.620> just<00:02:16.680> dropped<00:02:17.129> down<00:02:17.310> from<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
see here I just dropped down from the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.550 
see here I just dropped down from the
roof<00:02:17.879> because<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.299> saw<00:02:18.599> an<00:02:18.750> opportunity<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.470> get

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
roof because I saw an opportunity to get

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.559 
roof because I saw an opportunity to get
some<00:02:19.769> more<00:02:19.890> kills<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.790> know<00:02:20.909> I<00:02:20.940> saw<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.299> bee

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
some more kills you know I saw the bee

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.089 
some more kills you know I saw the bee
flag<00:02:21.840> was<00:02:22.019> being<00:02:22.230> illuminated<00:02:22.530> with

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
flag was being illuminated with

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.699 
flag was being illuminated with
luminarias<00:02:23.879> so<00:02:24.659> I<00:02:24.720> come<00:02:24.959> down<00:02:25.170> there<00:02:25.349> now<00:02:25.500> look

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
luminarias so I come down there now look

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.500 
luminarias so I come down there now look
how<00:02:25.830> like<00:02:26.340> they<00:02:26.580> seriously<00:02:26.909> just<00:02:27.180> spawned

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
how like they seriously just spawned

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.050 
how like they seriously just spawned
from<00:02:27.690> like<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.920> many<00:02:29.129> points<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:29.730> map<00:02:29.910> and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
from like so many points on this map and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.670 
from like so many points on this map and
then<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.239> come<00:02:30.390> back<00:02:30.450> up<00:02:30.780> here<00:02:30.810> just<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.379> confuse

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
then I come back up here just to confuse

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.110 
then I come back up here just to confuse
them<00:02:31.860> even<00:02:32.099> more<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.489> that's<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.819> end<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
them even more and that's the end of the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.809 
them even more and that's the end of the
first<00:02:33.330> round<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:34.349> that's<00:02:34.590> basically<00:02:34.950> what<00:02:35.610> you

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
first round so that's basically what you

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.479 
first round so that's basically what you
do<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:37.260> side<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> map<00:02:37.890> now<00:02:38.099> I'm<00:02:38.310> going

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
do on that side of the map now I'm going

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.089 
do on that side of the map now I'm going
to<00:02:38.549> show<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.819> what<00:02:39.569> i<00:02:39.599> do<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.230> other<00:02:40.860> side

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
to show you what i do on the other side

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.080 
to show you what i do on the other side
of<00:02:41.129> the<00:02:41.250> map<00:02:41.400> because<00:02:41.640> we're<00:02:41.819> gonna<00:02:41.940> be

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
of the map because we're gonna be

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.430 
of the map because we're gonna be
starting<00:02:42.299> from<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.599> different<00:02:42.930> point<00:02:43.079> of<00:02:43.349> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
starting from a different point of the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.710 
starting from a different point of the
map<00:02:43.650> alright<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:44.879> here<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.299> are<00:02:45.450> we're

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
map alright so here we are we're

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.170 
map alright so here we are we're
starting<00:02:46.110> off<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.500> flag<00:02:46.950> now<00:02:47.760> what<00:02:48.150> I

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
starting off on the a flag now what I

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.910 
starting off on the a flag now what I
typically<00:02:48.599> like<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.870> do<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.590> course<00:02:49.739> i'm

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
typically like to do is of course i'm

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.589 
typically like to do is of course i'm
going<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.099> hop<00:02:50.250> on<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.489> flag<00:02:50.730> because<00:02:51.120> i<00:02:51.329> want

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
going to hop on the flag because i want

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.630 
going to hop on the flag because i want
to<00:02:51.660> get<00:02:51.750> those<00:02:51.989> points<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.709> go<00:02:53.099> towards<00:02:53.489> my

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
to get those points to go towards my

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.690 
to get those points to go towards my
streaks<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.390> i<00:02:54.739> usually<00:02:55.739> just<00:02:56.010> typically<00:02:56.579> i

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
streaks so i usually just typically i

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.849 
streaks so i usually just typically i
run<00:02:57.120> straight<00:02:57.510> down<00:02:57.810> here<00:02:58.349> I<00:02:58.500> should<00:02:58.709> be<00:02:58.739> going

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
run straight down here I should be going

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.759 
run straight down here I should be going
down<00:02:59.250> here<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.700> ability<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.720> then<00:03:01.349> the

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
down here the I ability and then the

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.259 
down here the I ability and then the
threat<00:03:02.099> detection<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.609> already<00:03:02.819> helping<00:03:03.000> me

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
threat detection is already helping me

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.819 
threat detection is already helping me
out<00:03:03.299> I<00:03:03.420> see<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:03.840> guy<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.230> I'm<00:03:04.319> ready<00:03:04.500> pre

aiming and firing now you want to be

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.009 
aiming and firing now you want to be
very<00:03:08.160> careful<00:03:08.879> when<00:03:09.269> you're<00:03:09.390> patrolling<00:03:09.660> this

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
very careful when you're patrolling this

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.240 
very careful when you're patrolling this
building<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.470> that's<00:03:10.620> usually<00:03:10.980> what<00:03:11.129> I<00:03:11.160> do

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
building and that's usually what I do

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.099 
building and that's usually what I do
look<00:03:11.519> at<00:03:11.640> this<00:03:11.700> guy<00:03:11.849> he<00:03:12.060> dropped<00:03:12.299> down<00:03:12.450> he's

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
look at this guy he dropped down he's

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.770 
look at this guy he dropped down he's
not<00:03:13.260> going<00:03:13.560> anywhere<00:03:13.790> see<00:03:14.790> see<00:03:15.209> how<00:03:15.359> much<00:03:15.599> the

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
not going anywhere see see how much the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.750 
not going anywhere see see how much the
threat<00:03:15.989> detection<00:03:16.349> really<00:03:16.859> helps<00:03:17.160> but<00:03:17.459> even

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
threat detection really helps but even

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.879 
threat detection really helps but even
if<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.120> enemies<00:03:18.599> are<00:03:18.630> using<00:03:19.260> low<00:03:19.410> profile

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
if the enemies are using low profile

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.670 
if the enemies are using low profile
this<00:03:20.609> is<00:03:20.819> still<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.180> good<00:03:21.480> strategy<00:03:21.720> Oh<00:03:22.290> Who<00:03:22.650> I

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
this is still a good strategy Oh Who I

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.979 
this is still a good strategy Oh Who I
got<00:03:23.069> really<00:03:23.459> lucky<00:03:23.849> right<00:03:24.239> there<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.810> guy

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989

so what you want to do is you want to
try<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.389> confuse<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.870> enemy<00:03:33.989> as<00:03:34.260> much<00:03:34.440> as

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
try and confuse the enemy as much as

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.589 
try and confuse the enemy as much as
possible<00:03:34.739> right<00:03:35.609> here<00:03:35.790> on<00:03:35.910> being<00:03:36.180> really

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
possible right here on being really

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.629 
possible right here on being really
stealthy<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.260> they<00:03:37.739> spawn<00:03:38.069> in<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.280> corners

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
stealthy and they spawn in the corners

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.190 
stealthy and they spawn in the corners
over<00:03:38.760> there<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.239> then<00:03:39.359> also<00:03:39.599> they<00:03:39.870> come<00:03:40.079> out

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
over there and then also they come out

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.629 
over there and then also they come out
through<00:03:40.349> the<00:03:40.470> gates<00:03:40.650> right<00:03:41.010> there<00:03:41.370> where<00:03:41.579> I'm

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
through the gates right there where I'm

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.640 
through the gates right there where I'm
pointed<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.630> gotta<00:03:42.840> be<00:03:43.109> aware<00:03:43.230> of<00:03:43.470> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
pointed so you gotta be aware of the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.349 
pointed so you gotta be aware of the
spawns<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.400> why<00:03:44.519> knowing<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.030> spawns

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
spawns this is why knowing the spawns

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.750 
spawns this is why knowing the spawns
will<00:03:45.660> help<00:03:45.870> improve<00:03:46.139> your<00:03:46.530> game<00:03:46.709> so<00:03:47.099> much<00:03:47.370> and

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
then I'm also looking at the mini-map

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.379 
then I'm also looking at the mini-map
and<00:03:49.799> that's<00:03:50.250> how<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.400> know<00:03:50.549> like<00:03:51.000> where<00:03:51.180> enemies

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
and that's how I know like where enemies

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.420 
and that's how I know like where enemies
are<00:03:51.720> sometimes<00:03:51.959> because<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:52.950> know<00:03:53.040> maybe<00:03:53.340> I

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
are sometimes because you know maybe I

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.400 
are sometimes because you know maybe I
see<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.790> teammate<00:03:54.299> die<00:03:54.510> on<00:03:54.690> my<00:03:54.840> mini<00:03:54.989> map<00:03:55.230> that's

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
see a teammate die on my mini map that's

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.500 
see a teammate die on my mini map that's
nearby<00:03:55.650> then<00:03:56.099> you<00:03:56.760> know<00:03:56.879> that<00:03:57.060> should<00:03:57.329> tell

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
nearby then you know that should tell

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.270 
nearby then you know that should tell
you<00:03:57.569> that<00:03:57.720> hey<00:03:58.019> there's<00:03:58.680> an<00:03:58.829> enemy<00:03:59.099> in<00:03:59.129> your

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
body got to check them out look at it

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.849 
body got to check them out look at it
that's<00:04:00.510> where<00:04:00.720> they<00:04:00.870> spawn<00:04:01.230> right<00:04:01.530> there<00:04:01.769> in

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
that's where they spawn right there in

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.289 
that's where they spawn right there in
that<00:04:01.919> corner<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.549> then<00:04:02.970> where<00:04:03.090> I'm<00:04:03.209> getting

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
that corner and then where I'm getting

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.940 
that corner and then where I'm getting
shot<00:04:03.660> they've<00:04:03.870> obviously<00:04:04.019> spawned<00:04:04.650> below

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
shot they've obviously spawned below

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.860 
shot they've obviously spawned below
there<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:05.459> I'm<00:04:05.970> going<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.269> play<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.629> cool<00:04:06.660> play

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
so this is the the point of the game

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.710 
so this is the the point of the game
where<00:04:11.069> you<00:04:11.639> want<00:04:11.849> to<00:04:11.940> try<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.269> calm<00:04:12.480> your

checking every single point of entry in

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.130 
checking every single point of entry in
this<00:04:20.970> building<00:04:21.359> that's<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.630> most<00:04:21.780> important

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
this building that's the most important

know playing a little bit cool so this

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.370 
know playing a little bit cool so this
is<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.210> part<00:05:19.390> where<00:05:19.420> i<00:05:19.510> got<00:05:19.630> confuse<00:05:19.960> like<00:05:20.200> why

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
is the part where i got confuse like why

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.140 
is the part where i got confuse like why
are<00:05:20.440> they<00:05:20.590> spawning<00:05:20.950> a<00:05:21.250> right<00:05:21.520> now<00:05:21.700> like<00:05:21.970> no

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
are they spawning a right now like no

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.820 
are they spawning a right now like no
none<00:05:22.450> of<00:05:22.570> my<00:05:22.660> teammates<00:05:22.870> are<00:05:23.080> really<00:05:23.380> on<00:05:23.530> see

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
none of my teammates are really on see

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.940 
none of my teammates are really on see
so<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.460> come<00:05:24.760> over<00:05:24.790> here<00:05:25.120> to<00:05:25.150> a<00:05:25.270> and<00:05:25.690> I<00:05:26.470> failed<00:05:26.800> to

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
so I come over here to a and I failed to

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.030 
so I come over here to a and I failed to
jump<00:05:27.280> that<00:05:27.400> one<00:05:27.670> and<00:05:27.940> i<00:05:28.660> think<00:05:29.170> i<00:05:29.470> think<00:05:29.800> the

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
jump that one and i think i think the

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.100 
jump that one and i think i think the
spawns<00:05:30.310> flip<00:05:30.580> again<00:05:30.850> so<00:05:31.150> we're<00:05:31.540> probably<00:05:31.720> but

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
spawns flip again so we're probably but

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.360 
spawns flip again so we're probably but
i<00:05:32.140> think<00:05:32.230> we're<00:05:32.470> gonna<00:05:32.560> go<00:05:32.710> back<00:05:32.830> to<00:05:32.890> seee<00:05:33.160> up

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
i think we're gonna go back to seee up

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.370 
i think we're gonna go back to seee up
so<00:05:33.970> whenever<00:05:34.150> you<00:05:34.330> see<00:05:34.360> a<00:05:34.510> flag<00:05:34.810> illuminate

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
so whenever you see a flag illuminate

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.200 
so whenever you see a flag illuminate
like<00:05:35.410> that<00:05:35.770> that<00:05:36.040> should<00:05:36.310> let<00:05:36.580> you<00:05:36.730> know<00:05:36.940> that

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
like that that should let you know that

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.030 
like that that should let you know that
hey<00:05:37.390> there<00:05:37.690> are<00:05:37.990> enemies<00:05:38.440> that<00:05:38.710> are<00:05:38.770> on<00:05:38.920> the

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
hey there are enemies that are on the

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.070 
hey there are enemies that are on the
flag<00:05:39.250> let's<00:05:39.580> go<00:05:39.700> ahead<00:05:39.850> and<00:05:40.000> you<00:05:40.840> know<00:05:40.930> take

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
flag let's go ahead and you know take

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.580 
flag let's go ahead and you know take
advantage<00:05:41.440> of<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:41.590> situation<00:05:41.800> now<00:05:42.900> you<00:05:43.900> don't

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.470 
advantage of the situation now you don't
really<00:05:44.860> want<00:05:45.160> to<00:05:45.190> go<00:05:45.310> to<00:05:45.640> balls<00:05:45.970> deep<00:05:46.180> into
