00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
take this and I'm going to cut a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.760 
take this and I'm going to cut a
triangle<00:01:44.869> right<00:01:46.150> here<00:01:47.150> so<00:01:47.360> that<00:01:47.509> my<00:01:47.690> head<00:01:47.960> can

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
triangle right here so that my head can

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:57.800 
triangle right here so that my head can
go<00:01:48.800> through<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.990> triangle<00:01:50.990> right<00:01:51.770> here

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.340

then you just have like this opening and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.450 
then you just have like this opening and
this<00:02:02.350> is<00:02:02.590> where<00:02:02.770> your<00:02:02.859> heads<00:02:03.039> going<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.310> go

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
this is where your heads going to go

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.359 
this is where your heads going to go
that's<00:02:03.909> your<00:02:04.179> shirt<00:02:04.469> looks<00:02:05.469> really<00:02:05.799> small<00:02:06.130> but
