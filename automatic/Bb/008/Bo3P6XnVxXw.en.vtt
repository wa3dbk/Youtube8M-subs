00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
alright so I don't really know what kind

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.620 
alright so I don't really know what kind
of<00:01:44.460> thing<00:01:44.670> they're<00:01:44.820> trying<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.210> with<00:01:45.360> moma

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
of thing they're trying to do with moma

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.789 
of thing they're trying to do with moma
here<00:01:45.780> i<00:01:45.810> guess<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.229> they're<00:01:46.409> going<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> try

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
here i guess that they're going to try

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.289 
here i guess that they're going to try
and<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.040> her<00:01:47.159> use<00:01:47.369> some<00:01:47.579> sort<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.820> technology

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
and have her use some sort of technology

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.870 
and have her use some sort of technology
to<00:01:48.560> fight<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.829> help<00:01:50.189> fight<00:01:50.460> against<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
to fight or help fight against the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.730 
to fight or help fight against the
freezer<00:01:51.149> soldiers<00:01:51.600> that's<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.259> farthest

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
freezer soldiers that's the farthest

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.170 
freezer soldiers that's the farthest
that<00:01:52.860> i<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:53.250> obviously<00:01:53.460> cuz<00:01:53.790> moma<00:01:54.000> is

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
that i can think obviously cuz moma is

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.550 
that i can think obviously cuz moma is
obviously<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.659> gonna<00:01:54.780> go<00:01:54.930> super<00:01:55.200> saiyan<00:01:55.350> and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
obviously not gonna go super saiyan and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.380 
obviously not gonna go super saiyan and
fight<00:01:55.710> because<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.070> know<00:01:56.130> John<00:01:56.490> saying<00:01:56.820> but

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
fight because you know John saying but

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
two more which is Venezuela and chili or

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.780 
two more which is Venezuela and chili or
chill<00:02:16.590> whatever<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.099> want<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.340> call<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.549> and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
chill whatever you want to call it and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.599 
chill whatever you want to call it and
the<00:02:18.599> first<00:02:18.989> one<00:02:19.230> for<00:02:19.439> Venezuela<00:02:19.829> is<00:02:20.099> june

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
the first one for Venezuela is june

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.720 
the first one for Venezuela is june
fifth<00:02:20.879> 2015<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.810> for<00:02:22.590> chili<00:02:22.829> it's<00:02:23.069> April

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
fifth 2015 and for chili it's April

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.729 
fifth 2015 and for chili it's April
sixteenth<00:02:24.090> 2015<00:02:24.810> which<00:02:24.989> is<00:02:25.109> kind<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.379> weird<00:02:25.560> I

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
sixteenth 2015 which is kind of weird I

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.259 
sixteenth 2015 which is kind of weird I
guess<00:02:25.950> that's<00:02:26.189> because<00:02:26.310> Japan<00:02:27.120> is

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
guess that's because Japan is

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.449 
guess that's because Japan is
technically<00:02:27.569> ahead<00:02:28.319> so<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.709> guess<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.069> they

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
technically ahead so I guess that they

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.740 
technically ahead so I guess that they
would<00:02:29.640> actually<00:02:29.790> have<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> different<00:02:30.540> time

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
would actually have a different time

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.270 
would actually have a different time
zone<00:02:31.019> so<00:02:31.200> that's<00:02:31.349> why<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:31.560> April<00:02:31.950> sixteenth

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
zone so that's why it's April sixteenth

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.039 
zone so that's why it's April sixteenth
because<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:32.939> Japan<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:33.420> comes<00:02:33.569> out<00:02:33.659> April

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
because in Japan it comes out April

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.379 
because in Japan it comes out April
eighteenth<00:02:34.439> of<00:02:34.560> 2015<00:02:35.129> and<00:02:35.370> yeah<00:02:36.269> that's

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
eighteenth of 2015 and yeah that's

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.520 
eighteenth of 2015 and yeah that's
really<00:02:36.659> all<00:02:36.780> i<00:02:36.810> gotta<00:02:36.959> say<00:02:37.019> for<00:02:37.230> today<00:02:37.379> guys
