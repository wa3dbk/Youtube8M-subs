00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.830 

I'm<00:00:56.200> going<00:00:56.530> to<00:00:56.590> take<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.800> power<00:00:57.010> off<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:58.660> the

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
I'm going to take the power off just the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.350 
I'm going to take the power off just the
looper<00:00:59.170> and<00:00:59.940> then<00:01:00.940> you<00:01:01.030> can<00:01:01.239> see<00:01:01.450> that

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.660 

still<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.540> signal<00:01:07.259> goes<00:01:07.530> right<00:01:08.040> through<00:01:08.310> it

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.840 

it<00:01:12.240> also<00:01:12.450> has<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.020> hundred<00:01:13.560> percent<00:01:14.189> clickless

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it also has a hundred percent clickless

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.390 
it also has a hundred percent clickless
soft<00:01:15.810> touch<00:01:16.110> really<00:01:16.740> switches

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
soft touch really switches

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.719 
soft touch really switches
ok<00:01:18.270> they<00:01:18.869> will<00:01:19.049> not<00:01:19.259> pop<00:01:19.590> they<00:01:20.040> will<00:01:20.280> not<00:01:20.460> make

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
ok they will not pop they will not make

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.670 
ok they will not pop they will not make
noise<00:01:20.939> they<00:01:21.000> will<00:01:21.450> not<00:01:21.570> click<00:01:21.899> make<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
noise they will not click make the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.219 
noise they will not click make the
clicking<00:01:23.100> noise<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> cool<00:01:24.869> thing<00:01:25.140> about

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
clicking noise and the cool thing about

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.380 
clicking noise and the cool thing about
this<00:01:25.530> they<00:01:25.830> are<00:01:25.890> rated<00:01:26.220> at<00:01:26.580> about<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> million

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
this they are rated at about a million

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.560 
this they are rated at about a million
cycles<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.680> pretty<00:01:29.130> much<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.570> a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
cycles so you pretty much have a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.170 
cycles so you pretty much have a
lifetime<00:01:31.440> switch<00:01:31.920> which<00:01:32.280> also<00:01:32.549> makes<00:01:32.940> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
lifetime switch which also makes the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.510 
lifetime switch which also makes the
looper<00:01:33.649> pretty<00:01:34.649> much<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> lifetime<00:01:35.610> looper<00:01:37.490> yes

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
looper pretty much a lifetime looper yes

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.969 
looper pretty much a lifetime looper yes
there's<00:01:38.909> no<00:01:39.090> popping<00:01:39.659> there's<00:01:40.380> no<00:01:40.530> delay

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
there's no popping there's no delay

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.450 
there's no popping there's no delay
while<00:01:41.369> switching<00:01:41.729> as<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.240> can

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.180 

if<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:49.240> switch<00:01:49.480> it<00:01:49.660> to<00:01:49.740> program<00:01:50.740> mode<00:01:50.980> or

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
if you switch it to program mode or

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.010 
if you switch it to program mode or
preset<00:01:51.640> mode<00:01:51.910> just<00:01:52.150> like<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.600> touch<00:01:52.810> of<00:01:52.990> that

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
preset mode just like the touch of that

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:03.140 
preset mode just like the touch of that
button<00:01:53.400> have<00:01:54.400> different<00:01:55.000> patches

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:11.920 

not<00:02:04.150> delay<00:02:05.080> in<00:02:05.290> switching<00:02:05.650> patches<00:02:06.250> either

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.229

and it goes right back to wherever you
left<00:05:39.360> it<00:05:39.630> let's<00:05:39.900> say<00:05:40.080> you<00:05:40.140> are<00:05:40.470> in<00:05:40.650> normal<00:05:41.070> mode

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
and you have these three things on turn

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:55.830 
and you have these three things on turn
it<00:05:49.380> off<00:05:49.530> and<00:05:49.920> then<00:05:51.350> it<00:05:52.350> goes<00:05:52.530> right<00:05:52.770> back<00:05:52.920> to<00:05:53.160> it

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.210 

we<00:05:56.500> can<00:05:56.680> also<00:05:56.950> have<00:05:57.639> any<00:05:58.030> loop<00:05:59.220> change

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
we can also have any loop change

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.629 
we can also have any loop change
channels<00:06:01.060> or<00:06:01.300> any<00:06:01.780> feature<00:06:02.260> in<00:06:02.620> your<00:06:02.650> amp<00:06:03.040> for
