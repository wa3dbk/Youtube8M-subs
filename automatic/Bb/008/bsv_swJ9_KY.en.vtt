situation the paracord is probably a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.500 
situation the paracord is probably a
better<00:03:03.620> choice<00:03:04.150> because<00:03:05.150> you're<00:03:05.300> going<00:03:05.420> to

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
better choice because you're going to

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.780 
better choice because you're going to
have<00:03:05.600> some<00:03:05.780> paracord<00:03:06.200> with<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:06.710> and<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:07.760> a

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
have some paracord with you and it is a

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770
