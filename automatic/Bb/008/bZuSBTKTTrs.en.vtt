00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:03.249 
which of these rackmount tuners is right

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:11.699 
which of these rackmount tuners is right
for<00:00:03.459> you<00:00:03.610> watch<00:00:04.390> and<00:00:04.720> decide<00:00:10.049> the<00:00:11.049> size<00:00:11.349> really

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:11.709 
for you watch and decide the size really

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.489 
for you watch and decide the size really
matter<00:00:12.009> if<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:13.360> does<00:00:13.570> then<00:00:14.019> behringer

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:14.499 
matter if it does then behringer

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.109 
matter if it does then behringer
definitely<00:00:14.950> has<00:00:15.099> an<00:00:15.249> advantage<00:00:15.549> over<00:00:15.759> cork

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
definitely has an advantage over cork

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.210 
definitely has an advantage over cork
when<00:00:16.299> it<00:00:16.390> comes<00:00:16.570> to<00:00:16.720> product<00:00:17.109> packaging<00:00:20.220> now

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
when it comes to product packaging now

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.679 
when it comes to product packaging now
there's<00:00:21.460> a<00:00:21.519> reason<00:00:21.939> the<00:00:22.060> cork<00:00:22.300> tuner

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
there's a reason the cork tuner

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.269 
there's a reason the cork tuner
packaging<00:00:23.199> is<00:00:23.349> much<00:00:23.650> smaller<00:00:23.980> than<00:00:24.189> the

packaging is much smaller than the
behringer<00:00:24.699> packaging<00:00:25.240> and<00:00:25.439> that's<00:00:26.439> because

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
behringer packaging and that's because

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.239 
behringer packaging and that's because
the<00:00:27.460> cork<00:00:27.910> tuner<00:00:28.599> is<00:00:28.810> extremely<00:00:29.499> small<00:00:29.800> for<00:00:30.220> a

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:26.590 

the<00:04:19.830> behringer<00:04:20.280> has<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.489> fine-tuning<00:04:21.330> feature

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.090 

this<00:04:27.600> fine-tuning<00:04:28.170> feature<00:04:28.380> is<00:04:28.560> great<00:04:28.740> for

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
this fine-tuning feature is great for

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.590 
this fine-tuning feature is great for
adjusting<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.640> intonation<00:04:30.030> on<00:04:30.540> your<00:04:30.720> guitar

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.180 

the<00:04:36.600> Korg<00:04:36.900> has<00:04:37.170> three<00:04:37.500> different<00:04:37.680> tuning

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
the Korg has three different tuning

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.770 
the Korg has three different tuning
displays<00:04:38.580> we<00:04:39.060> have<00:04:39.090> regular<00:04:39.920> strobe<00:04:40.920> and<00:04:41.780> half

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
displays we have regular strobe and half

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.830 
displays we have regular strobe and half
strobe<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:46.070> now<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.130> test<00:04:47.550> can<00:04:48.180> both<00:04:48.390> tuners

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
strobe and now the test can both tuners

00:04:48.840 --> 00:05:08.080 
strobe and now the test can both tuners
effectively<00:04:49.590> tune<00:04:49.830> an<00:04:50.010> electric<00:04:50.460> guitar

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.310 

both<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.270> cork<00:05:09.540> and<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.930> behringer

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
both the cork and the behringer

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.930 
both the cork and the behringer
performed<00:05:10.800> well<00:05:10.979> but<00:05:11.430> when<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:11.669> comes<00:05:11.820> to

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
performed well but when it comes to

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.610 
performed well but when it comes to
tuning<00:05:12.240> a<00:05:12.300> bass<00:05:12.509> that's<00:05:13.050> a<00:05:13.199> totally<00:05:13.590> different

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
tuning a bass that's a totally different

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.469 
tuning a bass that's a totally different
story<00:05:16.250> in<00:05:17.250> this<00:05:17.490> example<00:05:17.850> you<00:05:18.060> can<00:05:18.090> see<00:05:18.240> the

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
story in this example you can see the

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.540 
story in this example you can see the
behringer<00:05:18.870> has<00:05:19.050> difficulty<00:05:19.650> in<00:05:19.830> recognizing

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
behringer has difficulty in recognizing

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.150 
behringer has difficulty in recognizing
the<00:05:20.669> low<00:05:20.880> E<00:05:20.910> on<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.479> bass<00:05:21.630> guitar<00:05:21.889> however<00:05:22.889> all

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
the low E on the bass guitar however all

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:37.380 
the low E on the bass guitar however all
the<00:05:23.310> other<00:05:23.460> notes<00:05:23.699> no<00:05:24.389> problem

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.210 

just<00:05:38.390> for<00:05:38.540> fun<00:05:38.660> I<00:05:38.720> thought<00:05:39.020> I'd<00:05:39.170> compare<00:05:39.620> the

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
just for fun I thought I'd compare the

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.190 
just for fun I thought I'd compare the
Korg<00:05:40.490> tuner<00:05:40.790> against<00:05:41.210> the<00:05:41.300> very<00:05:41.600> accurate

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
Korg tuner against the very accurate

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:51.610 
Korg tuner against the very accurate
Peterson<00:05:42.860> strobe<00:05:43.220> tuner<00:05:50.350> surprisingly<00:05:51.350> the

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
Peterson strobe tuner surprisingly the

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.410 
Peterson strobe tuner surprisingly the
Korg<00:05:51.860> tuner<00:05:52.160> held<00:05:52.400> its<00:05:52.550> own<00:05:52.670> against<00:05:53.330> the

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
Korg tuner held its own against the

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.730 
Korg tuner held its own against the
Peterson<00:05:53.780> tuner

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.860 

so<00:06:00.740> which<00:06:00.920> tuner<00:06:01.250> is<00:06:01.370> right<00:06:01.640> for<00:06:01.940> you<00:06:02.120> well

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
so which tuner is right for you well

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.810 
so which tuner is right for you well
that<00:06:03.110> all<00:06:03.230> depends<00:06:03.560> on<00:06:03.710> which<00:06:03.950> features<00:06:04.430> are

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
that all depends on which features are

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.840 
that all depends on which features are
right<00:06:05.600> for<00:06:05.810> you
