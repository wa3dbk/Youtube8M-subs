00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
to rearrange the way the tie rod mounts

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.230 
to rearrange the way the tie rod mounts
they<00:00:25.949> show<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.519> put<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.789> tie<00:00:26.970> rod

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
they show you to put the tie rod

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.950 
they show you to put the tie rod
underneath<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.140> knuckle<00:00:28.580> arm<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.840> go

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
underneath the knuckle arm but it can go

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.680 
underneath the knuckle arm but it can go
on<00:00:31.140> top<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.769> then<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.640> top<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.540> this

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
on top and then on top of that on this

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.270 
on top and then on top of that on this
side<00:00:35.000> you<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.210> put<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.630> drag<00:00:36.960> link<00:00:37.200> over<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
side you can put the drag link over the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.340 
side you can put the drag link over the
spring<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:40.550> they<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:42.059> nice<00:00:42.660> bend<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
spring and they have a nice bend in the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.420 
spring and they have a nice bend in the
drag<00:00:43.590> link<00:00:43.829> already<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:46.320> works<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:47.070> fine

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
drag link already and it works just fine

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.180 
drag link already and it works just fine
it<00:00:47.700> misses<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.059> spring<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:49.860> out<00:00:50.039> of

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
it misses the spring and it's up out of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.880 
it misses the spring and it's up out of
the<00:00:50.250> way<00:00:50.399> now<00:00:50.989> that's<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.140> handy<00:00:52.440> thing<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.710> can

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the way now that's a handy thing you can

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.319 
the way now that's a handy thing you can
do<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.610> tube<00:00:54.230> now<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.620> next<00:00:55.860> thing<00:00:56.010> is

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
do on the tube now the next thing is

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.240 
do on the tube now the next thing is
they<00:00:57.329> show<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.930> believe<00:00:58.530> three<00:00:58.829> different<00:00:59.129> ways

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
they show I believe three different ways

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.360 
they show I believe three different ways
to<00:00:59.520> assemble<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> springs<00:01:00.710> but<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.739> suggest<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
to assemble the springs but I suggest a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.640 
to assemble the springs but I suggest a
different<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.080> use<00:01:04.260> your<00:01:04.290> long

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
different one that is you use your long

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.880 
different one that is you use your long
spring<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.909> use<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.619> you<00:01:07.619> put

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
spring that you have to use and you put

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.550 
spring that you have to use and you put
the<00:01:08.159> shortest<00:01:08.760> leaf<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.860> top<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.220> that's<00:01:12.060> all

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
the shortest leaf on top and that's all

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.080 
the shortest leaf on top and that's all
don't<00:01:13.560> use<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.979> middle-sized<00:01:14.430> leaf<00:01:14.729> at<00:01:14.939> all

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
don't use the middle-sized leaf at all

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.940 
don't use the middle-sized leaf at all
don't<00:01:15.780> use<00:01:16.049> any<00:01:16.850> of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.659> electrical<00:01:19.350> ties<00:01:19.619> or

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
don't use any of the electrical ties or

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.990 
don't use any of the electrical ties or
anything<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:21.590> it's<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.250> stiff<00:01:23.670> enough<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
anything and it's just a stiff enough to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.580 
anything and it's just a stiff enough to
prevent<00:01:25.220> excessive<00:01:26.220> twisting<00:01:26.880> under<00:01:27.210> torque

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
prevent excessive twisting under torque

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.219 
prevent excessive twisting under torque
but<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.799> soft<00:01:29.100> enough<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.729> give<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.509> all

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
but it's soft enough to give you all

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.080 
but it's soft enough to give you all
kinds<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.860> articulation<00:01:33.140> see<00:01:35.090> good

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
kinds of articulation see good

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.060 
kinds of articulation see good
articulation<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:37.170> look<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> videos<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
articulation you look on the videos a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.580 
articulation you look on the videos a
lot<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.340> guys<00:01:38.610> they<00:01:38.970> build<00:01:39.780> their<00:01:39.960> spring<00:01:40.320> so

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
lot of guys they build their spring so

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.620 
lot of guys they build their spring so
stiff<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.670> every<00:01:41.880> time<00:01:42.060> they<00:01:42.210> go<00:01:42.390> over

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
stiff that every time they go over

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.289 
stiff that every time they go over
uneven<00:01:43.110> terrain<00:01:43.920> they've<00:01:44.340> got<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> tire

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
uneven terrain they've got a tire

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.130 
uneven terrain they've got a tire
sticking<00:01:45.780> up<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> air<00:01:47.750> all<00:01:48.750> right<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
sticking up in the air all right the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.100 
sticking up in the air all right the
next<00:01:49.290> thing<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:50.030> forward<00:01:51.030> battery<00:01:51.479> now<00:01:52.049> you

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
next thing is forward battery now you

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.460 
next thing is forward battery now you
see<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:53.270> haven't<00:01:54.270> put<00:01:54.509> my<00:01:54.540> battery<00:01:55.020> forward

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
see I I haven't put my battery forward

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.550 
see I I haven't put my battery forward
but<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.729> about<00:01:57.210> eight<00:01:57.450> ounces<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:58.049> lead

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
but I do have about eight ounces of lead

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.420 
but I do have about eight ounces of lead
in<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.369> radio<00:02:00.090> box<00:02:00.799> I'd<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.219> move<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
in the radio box I'd like to move the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.020 
in the radio box I'd like to move the
battery<00:02:02.729> forward<00:02:03.270> later<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:04.380> first<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:05.070> want

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
battery forward later but first I want

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.760 
battery forward later but first I want
to<00:02:06.240> move<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:07.380> servo<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.129> frame<00:02:08.520> mounted

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
to move the servo to a frame mounted

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.710 
to move the servo to a frame mounted
bracket<00:02:10.770> which<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.160> available<00:02:11.510> but<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.629> have

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
bracket which is available but you have

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.840 
bracket which is available but you have
to<00:02:12.840> order<00:02:12.989> from<00:02:13.260> Korea

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.880 

so<00:02:17.850> anyhow<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.450> also<00:02:18.750> run<00:02:19.110> three<00:02:19.440> ounces<00:02:19.830> of

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
so anyhow I also run three ounces of

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.590 
so anyhow I also run three ounces of
lead<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.490> each<00:02:20.610> wheel<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:23.850> all<00:02:24.060> up<00:02:24.300> weight

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
lead in each wheel and the all up weight

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.300 
lead in each wheel and the all up weight
of<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.260> truck<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:27.290> seven<00:02:28.290> pounds<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:28.980> five

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
of this truck is seven pounds and five

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.150 
of this truck is seven pounds and five
ounces<00:02:29.580> right<00:02:29.880> now<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:31.260> crawls<00:02:31.560> great<00:02:31.980> at

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
ounces right now and it crawls great at

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
wonderful upgrade the next thing is the

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.630 
wonderful upgrade the next thing is the
most<00:03:26.430> important<00:03:27.000> probably<00:03:27.240> are<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.750> tires

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
most important probably are the tires

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.970 
most important probably are the tires
the<00:03:29.640> stock<00:03:29.880> tires<00:03:30.180> just<00:03:30.630> didn't<00:03:30.930> do<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.080> they

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
the stock tires just didn't do it they

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.620 
the stock tires just didn't do it they
just<00:03:32.250> aren't<00:03:32.430> sticky<00:03:32.880> enough<00:03:33.030> for<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.390> rocks

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
just aren't sticky enough for the rocks

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.020 
just aren't sticky enough for the rocks
these<00:03:33.990> are<00:03:34.170> flat<00:03:34.410> irons<00:03:34.860> which<00:03:35.520> is<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.730> little

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
these are flat irons which is a little

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.750 
these are flat irons which is a little
bit<00:03:36.150> old-school<00:03:36.450> now<00:03:36.900> but<00:03:37.650> they<00:03:38.280> work<00:03:38.490> ten

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
bit old-school now but they work ten

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.310 
bit old-school now but they work ten
times<00:03:38.790> better<00:03:39.270> than<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.690> stock<00:03:39.870> tires<00:03:42.320> when

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
times better than the stock tires when

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.550 
times better than the stock tires when
you<00:03:43.470> pick<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.190> motor<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:44.910> would<00:03:45.750> suggest<00:03:45.930> going

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
you pick a motor I would suggest going

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.550 
you pick a motor I would suggest going
to<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.860> high<00:03:47.130> turn<00:03:47.430> motor<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:48.540> is<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.750> 60<00:03:49.320> turn

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
to a high turn motor this is a 60 turn

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.140 
to a high turn motor this is a 60 turn
that's<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.580> little<00:03:50.760> extreme<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:52.050> think<00:03:53.040> 45<00:03:53.430> or<00:03:53.820> 55

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
that's a little extreme I think 45 or 55

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.750 
that's a little extreme I think 45 or 55
would<00:03:54.540> be<00:03:54.660> very<00:03:54.870> good<00:03:55.110> if<00:03:55.550> you<00:03:56.550> run<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> 21<00:03:57.690> or<00:03:57.740> 27

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
would be very good if you run a 21 or 27

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.910 
would be very good if you run a 21 or 27
turn<00:03:59.760> motor<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.420> you're<00:04:00.990> just<00:04:01.230> out<00:04:01.410> crawling

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
turn motor and you're just out crawling

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.970 
turn motor and you're just out crawling
slow<00:04:02.220> you're<00:04:02.459> going<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.670> find<00:04:03.000> your<00:04:03.690> motor

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
slow you're going to find your motor

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.910 
slow you're going to find your motor
heating<00:04:04.980> up<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:06.980> when<00:04:07.980> they<00:04:08.100> run<00:04:08.340> hot<00:04:09.920> that

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
heating up and when they run hot that

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.350 
heating up and when they run hot that
means<00:04:11.220> your<00:04:11.459> battery<00:04:11.820> is<00:04:11.880> not<00:04:12.000> going<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.209> last

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
means your battery is not going to last

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.510 
means your battery is not going to last
as<00:04:12.570> long<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.370> have<00:04:14.580> shorter<00:04:14.940> runtime<00:04:16.520> for

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
as long so you have shorter runtime for

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.610 
as long so you have shorter runtime for
an<00:04:17.609> ESC<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.180> really<00:04:18.600> recommend<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.950> axial<00:04:20.790> ESC

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
an ESC I really recommend the axial ESC

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.460 
an ESC I really recommend the axial ESC
that<00:04:22.620> comes<00:04:22.860> with<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.250> scx10

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
that comes with the scx10

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.060 
that comes with the scx10
I<00:04:25.280> see<00:04:25.880> them<00:04:26.030> on<00:04:26.180> eBay<00:04:26.570> I<00:04:26.810> got<00:04:26.990> one<00:04:27.200> for<00:04:27.500> around

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
I see them on eBay I got one for around

nice about it is that you can plug it

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.750 
nice about it is that you can plug it

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
you really really need an ESC with a

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
drag break let's see now

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.020 
drag break let's see now
and<00:04:48.730> the<00:04:49.730> last<00:04:50.180> thing<00:04:50.390> I'd<00:04:50.540> like<00:04:50.690> to<00:04:50.750> add<00:04:51.170> is

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
and the last thing I'd like to add is

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.660 
and the last thing I'd like to add is
this<00:04:53.030> transmission<00:04:53.840> doesn't<00:04:54.200> have<00:04:54.440> a<00:04:54.740> slipper

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
this transmission doesn't have a slipper

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.040 
this transmission doesn't have a slipper
clutch<00:04:56.080> so<00:04:57.080> there's<00:04:57.350> no<00:04:57.530> safety<00:04:58.040> fuse<00:04:58.340> and

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
clutch so there's no safety fuse and

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.590 
clutch so there's no safety fuse and
something's<00:05:00.050> got<00:05:00.230> to<00:05:00.290> give<00:05:00.620> when<00:05:00.890> you<00:05:00.950> get<00:05:01.280> a

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
something's got to give when you get a

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.990 
something's got to give when you get a
tire<00:05:02.600> in<00:05:02.870> a<00:05:02.930> crevice<00:05:03.350> and<00:05:04.130> what<00:05:04.310> gives<00:05:04.670> are

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
tire in a crevice and what gives are

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.450 
tire in a crevice and what gives are
these<00:05:05.240> plastic<00:05:05.660> u<00:05:06.650> joints<00:05:07.130> on<00:05:07.250> these
