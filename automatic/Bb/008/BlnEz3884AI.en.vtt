00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:27.326
 My son 

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:30.309
 the day you were born 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.183
 the dense forests of Lordaeron whispered the name 

00:00:37.465 --> 00:00:38.713
 ARTHAS 

00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:25.402
 My child 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.456
 I watched with pride as you became a weapon 

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:34.879
 of righteousness. 

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:43.828
 Remember if 

00:01:44.058 --> 00:01:47.445
 our lineage has always governed wisely 

00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:49.212
 and strength 

00:01:52.103 --> 00:01:55.194
 and I know you will show restraint 

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:58.226
 by exercising his great power 

00:02:50.153 --> 00:02:52.470
 But the true victory, my son, 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.932
 is touching the hearts of his people. 

00:03:04.924 --> 00:03:06.341
 I tell you this, 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.246
 When my days come to an end 

00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:12.668
 you 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.750
 must be 

00:03:13.896 --> 00:03:14.500
 KING!
