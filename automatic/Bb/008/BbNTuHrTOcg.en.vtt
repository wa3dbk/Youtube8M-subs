straight<00:02:10.049> on<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.550> grass<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.240> then<00:02:12.450> put

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
straight on to the grass and then put

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.590 
straight on to the grass and then put
your<00:02:13.260> pots<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:13.950> top<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.370> them

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
your pots on top of them

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.440 
your pots on top of them
these<00:02:15.440> will<00:02:15.740> biodegrade<00:02:16.010> but<00:02:16.970> they<00:02:17.270> also

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
these will biodegrade but they also

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.450 
these will biodegrade but they also
allow<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.930> water<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.620> go<00:02:18.800> through

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
allow the water to go through

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.760 
allow the water to go through
there's<00:02:20.210> no<00:02:20.360> point<00:02:20.630> putting<00:02:20.780> them<00:02:21.050> on<00:02:21.170> plastic

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
there's no point putting them on plastic

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.190 
there's no point putting them on plastic
because<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.700> water<00:02:22.910> can't<00:02:23.360> seep<00:02:23.690> through<00:02:24.170> the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
because the water can't seep through the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.650 
because the water can't seep through the
plastic<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.010> then<00:02:25.700> they<00:02:26.000> get<00:02:26.180> all<00:02:26.330> clogged<00:02:26.630> II

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
plastic and then they get all clogged II

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.290 
plastic and then they get all clogged II
and<00:02:26.930> horrible<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:28.070> all<00:02:28.370> I'm<00:02:28.550> going<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.820> do<00:02:29.030> is

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
and horrible so all I'm going to do is

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.930 
and horrible so all I'm going to do is
place<00:02:29.780> these<00:02:30.080> all<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.160> way<00:02:31.190> along<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.760> bed

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
place these all the way along the bed

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.020 
place these all the way along the bed
making<00:02:32.720> sure<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.740> you<00:02:33.920> overlap<00:02:34.580> them<00:02:34.610> ever

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
making sure that you overlap them ever

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.400 
making sure that you overlap them ever
so<00:02:35.300> slightly<00:02:35.690> one<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.470> other<00:02:38.170> all<00:02:39.170> you

at the moment is just lay a selection

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.710 
at the moment is just lay a selection
out<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:30.890> some<00:03:31.490> I'm<00:03:31.730> going<00:03:31.910> to<00:03:31.970> put<00:03:32.180> too<00:03:32.450> high

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
out and some I'm going to put too high

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.840 
out and some I'm going to put too high
which<00:03:32.990> I<00:03:33.170> put<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.560> potatoes<00:03:34.070> in<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:34.460> the<00:03:34.610> rest

which I put the potatoes in and the rest

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.450 
which I put the potatoes in and the rest
I'll<00:03:35.120> just<00:03:35.360> leave<00:03:35.600> as<00:03:35.870> one<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.440> all<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.310> need

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.480 
I'll just leave as one and all you need
to<00:03:37.490> do<00:03:37.820> then<00:03:38.060> is<00:03:38.420> just<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.930> fill<00:03:39.260> them<00:03:39.530> with<00:03:39.770> a

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
to do then is just to fill them with a

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.170 
to do then is just to fill them with a
mixture<00:03:40.850> of<00:03:41.120> soil<00:03:41.650> horse<00:03:42.650> manure<00:03:43.280> you<00:03:43.670> leave

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
mixture of soil horse manure you leave

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.960 
mixture of soil horse manure you leave
it<00:03:44.780> depends<00:03:45.260> how<00:03:45.410> good<00:03:45.470> quality<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.340> soil<00:03:46.670> is

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
it depends how good quality the soil is

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.030 
it depends how good quality the soil is
now<00:03:47.540> this<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:48.220> it's<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.370> bit<00:03:49.550> naff<00:03:50.240> really

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
now this is it's a bit naff really

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.460 
now this is it's a bit naff really
frankly<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.540> there's<00:03:53.540> lots<00:03:53.720> of<00:03:53.840> bits<00:03:54.110> in<00:03:54.320> it

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
frankly and there's lots of bits in it

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.710 
frankly and there's lots of bits in it
but<00:03:55.010> I'm<00:03:55.220> gonna<00:03:55.460> put<00:03:55.700> some<00:03:55.880> leaves<00:03:56.180> with<00:03:56.540> it

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
but I'm gonna put some leaves with it

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.020 
but I'm gonna put some leaves with it
and<00:03:56.960> hopefully<00:03:57.620> over<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.950> winter<00:03:58.430> it'll

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
and hopefully over the winter it'll

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.390 
and hopefully over the winter it'll
start<00:03:59.780> to<00:03:59.840> look<00:04:00.050> a<00:04:00.170> little<00:04:00.260> bit<00:04:00.530> better<00:04:00.740> if

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
start to look a little bit better if

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
possible the contents will settle so you

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.670 
possible the contents will settle so you
may<00:05:21.940> well<00:05:22.180> find<00:05:22.210> in<00:05:22.660> about<00:05:22.930> a<00:05:22.960> month's<00:05:23.440> time

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
may well find in about a month's time

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.980 
may well find in about a month's time
that<00:05:24.310> you<00:05:24.430> might<00:05:24.610> have<00:05:24.819> to<00:05:25.030> top<00:05:25.270> it<00:05:25.449> up<00:05:25.630> again

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
that you might have to top it up again

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.490 
that you might have to top it up again
just<00:05:26.710> with<00:05:26.919> soil<00:05:27.430> or<00:05:27.610> manure<00:05:27.970> or<00:05:28.240> leaves<00:05:28.509> and<00:05:29.470> I

think that you've know that will be good

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.520 
think that you've know that will be good
for<00:05:32.289> the<00:05:32.650> soil<00:05:32.860> well<00:05:33.849> that's<00:05:34.300> about<00:05:34.599> it<00:05:34.659> really

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
for the soil well that's about it really

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.120 
for the soil well that's about it really
those<00:05:36.220> tires<00:05:36.520> will<00:05:36.970> sit<00:05:37.240> there<00:05:37.449> and<00:05:37.509> the<00:05:38.319> all

any<00:05:39.370> sort<00:05:39.880> of<00:05:39.940> bugs<00:05:40.539> in<00:05:40.870> and<00:05:41.349> the<00:05:42.099> soil<00:05:42.370> will

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
any sort of bugs in and the soil will

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.939 
any sort of bugs in and the soil will
break<00:05:43.300> down<00:05:43.330> over<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.020> winter<00:05:44.470> because<00:05:44.800> it

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
break down over the winter because it

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:46.890 
break down over the winter because it
