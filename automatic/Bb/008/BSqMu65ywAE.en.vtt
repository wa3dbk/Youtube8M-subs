00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
 the tendency to razac whose focus 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.629
 today for a brand new 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.270
 video there so it will be for 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.760
 the opening of packs 51 credit 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.830
 here is an a5 already there I think I 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.250
 will open 10 I 'll go on another 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.410
 account 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.210
 we still feed 5 so I think so 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.710
 I hope to have very very very heavy 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.539
 in my goal it would still be 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.150
 to shock why not two tops this 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.470
 in one college it would it would 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 nice because I have not managed to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.289
 do it again and that I see 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.480
 a lot of everything and all that gives me 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.099
 I want to succeed because I have 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.330
 a celina star shape do not even have 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.410
 that but I would like to have outright 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.030
 others are even easter 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.590
 so that would be heatstroke and 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.149
 all this so for your credits his 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.129
 brands and bone instead credits 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.290
 you've seen it's sure you 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.480
 fifa.com was a good discount 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.450
 8% with the quadra zac one starts with 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.160
 the first pack went to 50 because in the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.260
 skis from there and are we going to have 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.329
 blue jeans no in this case we did not 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.510
 of blue players on weiden flowers and 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.550
 navas 83 as a better note to 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.510
 buildings in the second pack we have 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.609
 left the cutscene 86 but here you go 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.660
 gives me a player and the arsenal he 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.670
 could have given me two players 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.140
 of arsenal sanchez walcott I think of them 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.000
 especially but well at least we open the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.900
 third pack already the ja skip always 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.010
 not always blue maybe at the end 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.610
 in his services 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.490
 pedro again you what is this pack bt 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.930
 the fourth pack has already we will leave 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.390
 of matic year a blue card when 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.090
 even but no on the kitsch musset but 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.979
 it's anything guys 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.290
 seriously already last pack to 54 on 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.659
 that's where we go skip now 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.130
 go why not van persie 88 yeah 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.700
 but it's not enough against benzema 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.079
 also in duplicate 85 well it's not 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.150
 Too bad this pack but it's not 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.340
 this is another step that there is no 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.689
 blue card no karting form does not open 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.189
 thankfully I would still have 5 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.780
 on our equal account I find of 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.890
 next for the next account but hey 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.079
 that I come back anyway date a 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.420
 card touch bousval is still 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.299
 the man if stephan el shaarawy when 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.680
 even with rakitic koscielny matuidi and 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.840
 griezmann as good players 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.040
 side of our table but that's his end 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.020
 but whenever there is a little bit 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.510
 but these people cost 40 Qaeda has when 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.850
 even slipped 27,500 credit to which there are 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.820
 so it's good I'm on xbox I see 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.980
 there we will open four donation packs 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.320
 valley is to feed 4l in total of 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.910
 dippach to 54 but these parties I hope 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.470
 we will have people, why not 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.610
 people finally give all you 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.190
 want to still like this 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.920
 would be his part to the first pack team 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.980
 of the clan's mother duplicate but I 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.570
 no tons necessarily yes barbeau 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.489
 this is the only player I did not 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.220
 oddly so much there we open the 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.870
 second pack on xbox we will let the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.160
 cinematic please go from 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.230
 blue but no mario gomez but no but 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.730
 it's not true otherwise it's what it is 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.560
 not that I put everything on sale fast 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.050
 I am told that there are more than two 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.270
 young cat open packs 8 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.220
 here is still no blue and a new 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.920
 here muller better player was going 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.489
 seriously it's not possible it's 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.709
 a joke 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.900
 act revenge opens the last 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.280
 I really hope to garbage so much 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.720
 subject completed the skite now go 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.320
 please and but no it's not 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.030
 it's not my pope no to the lodges and even 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.000
 not in June at 4 in general our 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.450
 better grades 79 and could s' are a 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.190
 that two yeah it hurts that my 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.720
 sales quickly we will try a 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.780
 last pack positively positive because 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.450
 that it was possible it is beautiful and 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.600
 if it will make it to the 11th rank crazy but there it 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.880
 we need a good blue to finally 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.590
 second a shape it's nice but 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.540
 this is not the crazy thing it's not 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.950
 the crazy thing is not that's it 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.549
 long been that I dreamed of having 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.320
 still 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.780
 so to make a little walcott or 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.760
 something like that david luiz and 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.100
 makes general leaps but to see the 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.100
 pac all in all a little disappointed 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:56.099
 boots but no but no 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.140
 but already the fucking bronze easter 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.019
 in fact here I had a new account 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.970
 there and I see you the bronze pack of 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.319
 shit that has obligatorily open end 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.980
 for not having to open it but 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.200
 I rent green like that and there is 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.090
 a stock of in one of rock 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.370
 but no, but it's a joke more 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.510
 he can leave ah yeah yeah I know 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.650
 not actually former guardians in any 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.049
 English bronze case 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.880
 Well, it's not a pack of 100 to 50 cases. 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.320
 guy but it's a mourning anyway 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.630
 bronze rate so filmed anyway 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.740
 you show it i'm i'm pretty 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.240
 surprised because I was not expecting the 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.190
 all the french is too much of 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.930
 shit this rare player convoy there of a 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.370
 coup I do not tell myself that in the end he goes there 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.190
 besides a small lot that hides there 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.750
 it's nice going down that's good 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.610
 come to the club you go well it's gone 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.410
 my opinion I hope this account is going to be 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.990
 lucky enough all the same these parties 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.630
 first skip pack so best player 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.180
 boateng 86th general is not bad of the 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.740
 everything with marcelo also marcelo it's 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.630
 not bad 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.370
 koscielny same clichy back a very good 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.050
 not that it's nice that's it 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.220
 this is the second step 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.550
 will leave the kinematics if you 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.340
 please have no piquÃ© mach irano 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.530
 okay it does not seem to me that mr biya 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.960
 handanovic also so three players from 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.050
 shit end 3 way 3 people who are going 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.840
 in against fast what to go to the bottom we 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.210
 background ps that's it you enjoy it a 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.910
 new fashion this in this because at 54 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.240
 this is charlie austin dolph at paco 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.650
 make good way 100000 credit anyway 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.300
 good I do not know if he will leave but in 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.750
 Anyway here it's first todd 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.490
 pleasure 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.020
 he will stay us from easter to open to 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.150
 hilla we're good guys go if you 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.620
 pay two in the pack go for 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.750
 the matic murder have still not 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.520
 Toulalan gerrard vidy 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.230
 players who have no part in jackson 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.760
 martinez street and hot here they go 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.020
 not leave alone to pay for the latter 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.430
 not that I'm going to script and I 'm not going 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.310
 to watch that is to say that we will skip 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.770
 now I do not look at it 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.930
 go all the way right anyway I go 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.360
 think it's good I get up to there is no 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.310
 no blues no there are no blues and 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.080
 bass and shit pack this one yeah 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.520
 there is nothing that will resell damage 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.080
 here are the mates I really hope that 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.770
 this video you liked so I opened 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.540
 Easter 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.940
 well, rather, we'll go back to 15 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.080
 easter devices to 50000 credit I hope 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.520
 really that will have you more if you 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.580
 really like this lifestyle from where 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.260
 plays a lot of easter at 54 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.290
 maybe if one day there are packs 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.520
 at 5 yielded per rack one can feed through 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.110
 against but I will try to demerder myself 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.430
 for daddy will try to open it 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.070
 10 stuff like that 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.900
 that's it if you love bam been the most of 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.300
 like even though necessarily in this 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.250
 video I can not get you out of the 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.200
 luck every time because I had 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.480
 intox second form and a few small 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.240
 good players but let it be said on 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.890

 you're a little luckier than me 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:45.180
 for these facs there anyway and so we 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.110
 will probably find himself for 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.729
 a few days for new packs 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.320
