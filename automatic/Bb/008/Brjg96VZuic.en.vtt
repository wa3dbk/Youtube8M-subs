00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.729 

here's<00:00:01.400> a<00:00:01.489> question<00:00:01.759> that<00:00:01.969> arises<00:00:02.600> every<00:00:03.439> once

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:03.739 
here's a question that arises every once

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:05.680 
here's a question that arises every once
in<00:00:03.919> a<00:00:04.040> while<00:00:04.280> and<00:00:04.640> that<00:00:04.700> is<00:00:05.240> should<00:00:05.660> you

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
in a while and that is should you

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.440 
in a while and that is should you
replace<00:00:06.170> the<00:00:06.410> entire<00:00:06.800> fence<00:00:07.190> a<00:00:07.520> section<00:00:08.300> of

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
replace the entire fence a section of

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.140 
replace the entire fence a section of
the<00:00:08.570> fence<00:00:08.870> or<00:00:09.110> the<00:00:09.340> posts<00:00:10.340> that<00:00:10.730> are<00:00:10.790> holding

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
the fence or the posts that are holding

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.500 
the fence or the posts that are holding
up<00:00:11.480> the<00:00:11.510> fence<00:00:11.900> and<00:00:12.170> by<00:00:13.070> all<00:00:13.340> means<00:00:13.940> if<00:00:14.240> the

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
up the fence and by all means if the

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.299 
up the fence and by all means if the
rest<00:00:14.840> of<00:00:15.110> the<00:00:15.260> fence<00:00:15.559> is<00:00:15.769> in<00:00:15.800> pretty<00:00:16.219> good

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
rest of the fence is in pretty good

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.140 
rest of the fence is in pretty good
shape<00:00:16.519> and<00:00:17.089> by<00:00:18.079> this<00:00:18.140> I<00:00:18.710> mean<00:00:18.740> there<00:00:19.519> isn't<00:00:19.759> a

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
shape and by this I mean there isn't a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.890 
shape and by this I mean there isn't a
lot<00:00:20.329> of<00:00:20.359> termite<00:00:20.869> damage<00:00:20.900> or<00:00:22.659> certain<00:00:23.659> pieces

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
lot of termite damage or certain pieces

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.229 
lot of termite damage or certain pieces
of<00:00:24.109> the<00:00:24.529> fencing<00:00:24.980> just<00:00:25.220> need<00:00:25.400> to<00:00:25.579> be<00:00:25.730> replaced

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:26.239 
of the fencing just need to be replaced

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.359 
of the fencing just need to be replaced
and<00:00:26.720> you<00:00:27.050> will<00:00:27.349> be<00:00:27.560> up<00:00:27.589> and<00:00:27.919> running<00:00:27.980> again

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
and you will be up and running again

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.040 
and you will be up and running again
then<00:00:28.640> it<00:00:28.730> really<00:00:28.909> doesn't<00:00:29.179> make<00:00:29.419> any<00:00:29.479> sense<00:00:29.899> to

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
then it really doesn't make any sense to

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.490 
then it really doesn't make any sense to
replace<00:00:30.589> the<00:00:30.829> entire<00:00:31.130> fence<00:00:31.960> yet<00:00:32.960> I<00:00:33.230> see

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
replace the entire fence yet I see

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.200 
replace the entire fence yet I see
plenty<00:00:33.739> of<00:00:33.890> homeowners<00:00:34.489> they<00:00:34.670> just<00:00:34.879> go<00:00:35.030> right

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
plenty of homeowners they just go right

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.939 
plenty of homeowners they just go right
in<00:00:35.390> there<00:00:35.539> and<00:00:35.600> replace<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.260> replace

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
in there and replace the replace

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.369 
in there and replace the replace
everything<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:37.789> they<00:00:37.850> figure<00:00:38.120> that<00:00:38.379> they

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
everything and they figure that they

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.139 
everything and they figure that they
need<00:00:39.679> a<00:00:39.710> new<00:00:40.010> fence<00:00:40.309> because<00:00:40.730> it's<00:00:40.910> leaning

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
need a new fence because it's leaning

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.509 
need a new fence because it's leaning
and<00:00:41.510> that<00:00:41.690> isn't<00:00:42.230> going<00:00:42.500> to<00:00:42.620> be<00:00:42.739> the<00:00:42.920> case<00:00:43.129> now

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
and that isn't going to be the case now

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.479 
and that isn't going to be the case now
for<00:00:43.760> instance<00:00:43.910> here<00:00:44.510> we<00:00:44.719> have<00:00:44.989> a<00:00:45.379> post<00:00:46.160> where

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
for instance here we have a post where

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.549 
for instance here we have a post where
you<00:00:46.640> can<00:00:46.820> see<00:00:47.059> this<00:00:47.300> one<00:00:47.570> here<00:00:47.780> is<00:00:47.929> leaning<00:00:48.410> the

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
you can see this one here is leaning the

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.979 
you can see this one here is leaning the
most<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.850> again<00:00:50.030> all<00:00:50.269> you<00:00:50.329> need<00:00:50.570> to<00:00:50.660> do<00:00:50.809> to

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
most and again all you need to do to

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.650 
most and again all you need to do to
check<00:00:51.230> and<00:00:51.410> see<00:00:51.620> if<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.280> fence<00:00:52.609> is<00:00:52.879> damaged<00:00:53.480> if

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
check and see if the fence is damaged if

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.630 
check and see if the fence is damaged if
the<00:00:53.690> post<00:00:54.019> is<00:00:54.230> no<00:00:54.410> longer<00:00:54.679> working<00:00:55.160> is<00:00:55.309> grab

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
the post is no longer working is grab

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.790 
the post is no longer working is grab
the<00:00:55.879> post<00:00:56.179> and<00:00:56.480> if<00:00:56.719> you<00:00:56.870> can<00:00:57.079> wiggle<00:00:57.320> it<00:00:57.589> with

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
the post and if you can wiggle it with

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.479 
the post and if you can wiggle it with
very<00:00:58.039> little<00:00:58.280> effort<00:00:59.109> or<00:01:00.109> you<00:01:00.469> see<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.039> post

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
very little effort or you see the post

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.080 
very little effort or you see the post
moving<00:01:02.269> but<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.530> concrete<00:01:04.280> or<00:01:04.550> the<00:01:04.850> the

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
moving but the concrete or the the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.140 
moving but the concrete or the the
footing<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:06.290> post<00:01:06.680> is<00:01:07.010> setting<00:01:07.430> in<00:01:07.640> or

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
footing that the post is setting in or

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.180 
footing that the post is setting in or
the<00:01:08.450> soil<00:01:08.720> nothing's<00:01:09.260> moving<00:01:09.530> in<00:01:09.800> the<00:01:09.920> soil

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
the soil nothing's moving in the soil

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.060 
the soil nothing's moving in the soil
then<00:01:11.120> there<00:01:11.660> is<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:11.840> very<00:01:12.290> good<00:01:12.560> chance<00:01:12.860> that

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
then there is a very good chance that

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.970 
then there is a very good chance that
the<00:01:13.730> bottom<00:01:14.270> of<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.720> post<00:01:14.990> has<00:01:15.320> rotted<00:01:15.680> out

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
the bottom of the post has rotted out

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.260 
the bottom of the post has rotted out
and<00:01:16.430> is<00:01:17.120> no<00:01:17.390> longer<00:01:17.930> supporting<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.650> fence

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
and is no longer supporting the fence

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.020 
and is no longer supporting the fence
now<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:20.330> can<00:01:20.900> also<00:01:21.140> see<00:01:21.800> that<00:01:21.830> these<00:01:22.640> other

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
now you can also see that these other

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
now you can also see that these other
posts<00:01:23.600> might<00:01:24.080> be<00:01:24.470> damaged<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.900> should<00:01:26.900> be

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
posts might be damaged and should be

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.810 
posts might be damaged and should be
checked<00:01:27.380> out<00:01:27.530> also<00:01:27.860> but<00:01:28.250> realistically

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
checked out also but realistically

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.420 
checked out also but realistically
looking<00:01:29.300> at<00:01:29.450> this<00:01:29.600> fence<00:01:29.980> you<00:01:30.980> could<00:01:31.160> replace

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
looking at this fence you could replace

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.520 
looking at this fence you could replace
three<00:01:31.820> posts<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.960> I<00:01:32.990> would<00:01:33.080> imagine<00:01:33.170> each

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
three posts and I would imagine each

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.000 
three posts and I would imagine each
post<00:01:34.160> is<00:01:34.430> about<00:01:34.870> $15<00:01:35.870> each<00:01:36.080> let's<00:01:36.440> say<00:01:36.620> 10<00:01:36.890> to

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
post is about $15 each let's say 10 to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.040 
post is about $15 each let's say 10 to
$15<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:39.850> you've<00:01:40.850> got<00:01:41.120> the<00:01:41.330> fence<00:01:41.540> repaired

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
$15 and you've got the fence repaired

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.660 
$15 and you've got the fence repaired
the<00:01:42.230> fence<00:01:42.440> is<00:01:42.590> gonna<00:01:42.800> be<00:01:42.950> good<00:01:43.130> for<00:01:43.400> another

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
the fence is gonna be good for another

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.930 
the fence is gonna be good for another
what<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.870> don't<00:01:45.710> even<00:01:45.860> want<00:01:46.010> to<00:01:46.070> say<00:01:46.280> five<00:01:46.580> years

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
what I don't even want to say five years

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.550 
what I don't even want to say five years
I've<00:01:47.120> seen<00:01:47.300> these<00:01:47.480> posts<00:01:47.840> rot<00:01:47.990> out<00:01:48.200> in<00:01:48.350> two

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
I've seen these posts rot out in two

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.110 
I've seen these posts rot out in two
years<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:48.980> if<00:01:49.220> they're<00:01:49.370> done<00:01:49.580> right<00:01:49.790> hopefully

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
years so if they're done right hopefully

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.610 
years so if they're done right hopefully
and<00:01:50.720> they're<00:01:51.290> not<00:01:51.730> watering<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:53.000> fence<00:01:53.620> and

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
and they're not watering the fence and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.280 
and they're not watering the fence and
there's<00:01:54.920> not<00:01:55.070> an<00:01:55.250> abundance<00:01:55.760> of<00:01:56.110> moisture<00:01:57.110> in

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
there's not an abundance of moisture in

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.650 
there's not an abundance of moisture in
the<00:01:57.710> area<00:01:58.130> then<00:01:58.430> this<00:01:58.730> should<00:01:58.970> last<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.480> little

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
the area then this should last a little
