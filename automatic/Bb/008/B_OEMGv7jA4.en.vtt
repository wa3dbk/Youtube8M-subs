thumb behind the cap over there and as

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:59.409 
thumb behind the cap over there and as
I'm<00:02:52.370> idea<00:02:53.239> literally<00:02:53.870> force<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.439> up<00:02:58.419> which

00:02:59.409 --> 00:02:59.419 
I'm idea literally force it up which

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.939 
I'm idea literally force it up which
works<00:02:59.840> for<00:03:00.079> me<00:03:00.169> I'm<00:03:00.319> not<00:03:00.409> sure<00:03:01.510> if<00:03:02.709> you<00:03:03.709> know

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:03.949 
works for me I'm not sure if you know

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.009 
works for me I'm not sure if you know
the<00:03:04.069> gripper<00:03:04.400> capo<00:03:05.090> would<00:03:05.269> work<00:03:05.480> like<00:03:05.989> that

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
the gripper capo would work like that

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.360 
the gripper capo would work like that
because<00:03:06.469> I'm<00:03:06.560> not<00:03:06.590> sure<00:03:06.859> how<00:03:06.949> much<00:03:07.099> pressure

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
because I'm not sure how much pressure

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.300 
because I'm not sure how much pressure
it<00:03:07.549> applies<00:03:07.849> what<00:03:08.569> I<00:03:08.599> do<00:03:08.719> to<00:03:09.019> do<00:03:09.199> that<00:03:09.230> is<00:03:09.650> I

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
it applies what I do to do that is I

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.099 
it applies what I do to do that is I
make<00:03:10.849> sure<00:03:11.030> that<00:03:11.269> I've<00:03:11.419> got<00:03:11.569> its<00:03:11.750> little

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
make sure that I've got its little

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.039 
make sure that I've got its little
pressure<00:03:12.799> or<00:03:13.400> as<00:03:14.060> little<00:03:14.299> force<00:03:14.629> on<00:03:14.930> the

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
pressure or as little force on the

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.550 
pressure or as little force on the
strings<00:03:15.349> as<00:03:15.560> possible<00:03:16.719> obviously<00:03:17.719> sparing

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
strings as possible obviously sparing

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.879 
strings as possible obviously sparing
the<00:03:19.090> fret<00:03:20.090> buzz<00:03:20.329> but<00:03:20.840> if<00:03:20.989> you<00:03:21.169> if<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:21.709> don't

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
the fret buzz but if you if you don't

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.800 
the fret buzz but if you if you don't
apply<00:03:22.069> it<00:03:22.189> enough<00:03:22.489> pressure<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:23.389> get<00:03:23.509> fret

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
apply it enough pressure you get fret

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.550 
apply it enough pressure you get fret
buzz<00:03:24.159> so<00:03:25.159> literally<00:03:25.759> as<00:03:26.000> as<00:03:26.509> minimum<00:03:27.109> amount

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
buzz so literally as as minimum amount

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.089 
buzz so literally as as minimum amount
of<00:03:27.739> pressure<00:03:28.009> as<00:03:28.189> I<00:03:28.280> can<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:29.389> be<00:03:29.780> able<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:30.099> fret

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
of pressure as I can to be able to fret

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.050 
of pressure as I can to be able to fret
the<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.930> cap<00:03:33.139> over<00:03:33.349> there<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.829> so<00:03:34.669> therefore

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
the the cap over there and so therefore

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.420 
the the cap over there and so therefore

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
them to my mind it won't make a great

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.879 
them to my mind it won't make a great
deal<00:05:30.290> of<00:05:30.410> difference<00:05:32.080> so<00:05:33.080> that's<00:05:33.290> that<00:05:33.500> I<00:05:33.560> hope

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
deal of difference so that's that I hope

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.770 
deal of difference so that's that I hope
that<00:05:34.100> helped<00:05:34.340> you<00:05:34.400> out<00:05:34.460> because<00:05:34.880> like<00:05:35.630> I<00:05:35.660> said

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
I mean I've never seen that done in a

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.620 
I mean I've never seen that done in a
song<00:05:39.020> where<00:05:39.380> a<00:05:39.680> couple<00:05:39.950> gets<00:05:40.280> moved<00:05:40.630> but

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
song where a couple gets moved but

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.210 
song where a couple gets moved but
somehow<00:05:42.320> it<00:05:42.560> does<00:05:42.710> it<00:05:42.919> so<00:05:44.050> after<00:05:45.050> after<00:05:45.919> the

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
somehow it does it so after after the

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.830 
somehow it does it so after after the
key<00:05:46.370> change<00:05:46.700> what<00:05:47.030> you<00:05:47.120> do<00:05:47.270> then<00:05:47.419> you<00:05:47.600> just

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
key change what you do then you just

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.200 
key change what you do then you just
carry<00:05:48.050> on<00:05:48.200> like<00:05:48.350> he<00:05:48.440> did<00:05:48.590> before<00:05:49.090> into<00:05:50.090> the

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.620 

burn<00:06:00.080> in<00:06:00.260> mind<00:06:00.410> obviously<00:06:00.590> the<00:06:01.450> fingers<00:06:02.450> and

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
burn in mind obviously the fingers and

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.360 
burn in mind obviously the fingers and

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
will be different it might be bit

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.500
