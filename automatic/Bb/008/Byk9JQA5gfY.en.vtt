those updates and I could see what
things<00:01:40.950> are<00:01:41.040> gonna<00:01:41.130> look<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.409> also

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
things are gonna look like so I can also

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.850 
tap down here and get my forecast by day
looks<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.329> we've<00:01:48.750> got<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.990> little<00:01:49.200> maybe<00:01:49.560> some

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
looks like we've got a little maybe some

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.620 
looks like we've got a little maybe some
rain<00:01:50.070> ahead<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.460> us<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.060> then<00:01:51.180> some<00:01:51.360> clouds

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
rain ahead of us and then some clouds

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.749 
rain ahead of us and then some clouds
and<00:01:52.049> some<00:01:52.619> more<00:01:52.770> rain<00:01:52.979> which<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.280> great

and some more rain which is great

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.330 
and some more rain which is great
because<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.180> haven't<00:01:54.299> had<00:01:54.450> much<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:56.310> can

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
because we haven't had much so we can

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.580 
because we haven't had much so we can
also<00:01:56.579> go<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.030> view<00:01:57.149> our<00:01:57.299> satellite<00:01:57.869> view<00:01:58.110> it

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
also go and view our satellite view it

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.170 
also go and view our satellite view it
takes<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.890> second<00:01:59.219> for<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.579> download<00:02:00.060> an

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
takes a second for this to download an

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.690 
takes a second for this to download an
update<00:02:00.360> depending<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.229> your<00:02:01.700> wireless

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
update depending on your wireless

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.929 
update depending on your wireless
network<00:02:02.759> or<00:02:03.329> your<00:02:03.479> 3G<00:02:03.810> or<00:02:04.020> 4G<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:05.490> might<00:02:05.700> take<00:02:05.909> a

second for this to update and then of

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.760 
second for this to update and then of
course<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.879> hit<00:02:09.239> play<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.840> toggle

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
course you can hit play and toggle

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.860 
course you can hit play and toggle
through<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.310> see<00:02:11.580> how<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.760> works<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.450> of

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
through and see how that works so of

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.180 
through and see how that works so of
course<00:02:13.020> we're<00:02:13.290> pretty<00:02:13.470> clear<00:02:13.739> sky

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
course we're pretty clear sky

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.590 
course we're pretty clear sky
right<00:02:14.340> now<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:14.820> you're<00:02:14.940> not<00:02:15.030> seeing<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.420> whole

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
right now so you're not seeing a whole

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.840 
right now so you're not seeing a whole
lot<00:02:15.630> but<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.710> just<00:02:16.860> continues<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.490> play

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
lot but it just continues to play

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.090 
lot but it just continues to play
through<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.510> loop<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.830> can<00:02:20.070> view

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
through and loop that so that I can view

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.520 
through and loop that so that I can view
and<00:02:20.490> see<00:02:20.840> what's<00:02:21.840> going<00:02:22.140> on<00:02:22.260> out<00:02:22.500> there

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
and see what's going on out there

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.320 
and see what's going on out there
perhaps<00:02:23.040> next<00:02:23.460> week<00:02:23.610> when<00:02:23.850> all<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.060> rain

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
perhaps next week when all that rain

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.640 
perhaps next week when all that rain
comes<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.870> will<00:02:25.020> become<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> little<00:02:25.440> bit<00:02:25.590> more

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
comes this will become a little bit more

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.400 
comes this will become a little bit more
interesting<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.940> we<00:02:27.270> also<00:02:27.420> have<00:02:27.780> any<00:02:27.960> videos

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
interesting so we also have any videos

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.070 
interesting so we also have any videos
that<00:02:28.440> were<00:02:28.740> captured<00:02:29.870> typically<00:02:30.870> these<00:02:31.020> are

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
that were captured typically these are

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.980 
that were captured typically these are

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
and then the real feel which is kind of

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.700 
and then the real feel which is kind of
what<00:04:54.360> its<00:04:54.599> gonna<00:04:54.780> feel<00:04:54.900> like<00:04:55.349> when<00:04:55.560> you're

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
what its gonna feel like when you're

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.279 
what its gonna feel like when you're
outside<00:04:56.300> which<00:04:57.300> is<00:04:57.330> pretty<00:04:57.629> close<00:04:57.990> but

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
outside which is pretty close but

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.110 
outside which is pretty close but
sometimes<00:04:58.800> that<00:04:59.039> can<00:04:59.159> be<00:04:59.220> a<00:04:59.340> difference<00:04:59.849> you

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
sometimes that can be a difference you

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.600 
sometimes that can be a difference you
know<00:05:00.240> it's<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.870> could<00:05:01.110> say<00:05:01.319> it's<00:05:01.620> 70<00:05:02.190> outside

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
know it's it could say it's 70 outside

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.059 
know it's it could say it's 70 outside
but<00:05:02.819> it<00:05:02.909> actually<00:05:03.330> feels<00:05:03.630> you<00:05:04.020> know<00:05:04.139> 60<00:05:04.860> or

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:05.069 
but it actually feels you know 60 or

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.249
