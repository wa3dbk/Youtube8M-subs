00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.660
 well hello dear friends with you i 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.899
 same today in honor of the release of the new 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.690
 parts wafin matte under the heading of the senor 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.670
 You will cover a wave of memories my 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.339
 memory 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.079
 let's start in order in general series 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.089
 wolfenstein is one of the most 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.199
 longest-running games in the world 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:57.170
 it takes its origin from 1981 when 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.750
 There was a game of casale be in einstein on 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.440
 first look like a certain pakman with 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.930
 firearms 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.659
 well do not underestimate the cash 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.760
 feinstein we are all very much obliged to this game 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.400
 because it is she who is behind 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.250
 parents of the shooter genre and without 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.170
 principle possible and there would be no those games 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.619
 which we used to hang out in the evenings 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.030
 At home , the game developed the company Miusov 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.320
 yours then in 1984 he would come out 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.200
 wrote in feinstein 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.750
 and honestly I did not play the clutch and not in 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.490
 My other acquaintance series Feinstein 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.710
 started after i first 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.840
 played wolfenstein 3d released in 1992 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.390
 year the game was developed by 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.880
 ubisoft in and damn it 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.860
 who doesn't know these guys because they 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.550
 gave us such masterpieces as doom and 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.510
 quake 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.060
 I learned a lot about wolfenstein 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.710
 3d so to speak the founder of the genre 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.990
 first person shooter 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.490
 although if you delve into the source then 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.670
 it follows that the first shooter from the first 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.799
 faces can be more than considered a hover tank 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.510
 3d 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.209
 gameplay concept hasn't changed much 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.580
 our tasks are also all run from 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.379
 one on thai fortress and on your 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.790
 ways again many armed 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.420
 guards and 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.420
 doggie 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.490
 in the canons of old school games at the end 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.160
 each episode 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.950
 you are waiting for a fight with the boss for the first time I 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.760
 honored to play wolfenstein in 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.050
 2003 and at that time I was very 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.440
 impressionable for the sake of his age 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.050
 It was an incredible experience and was extremely 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.050
 impressed with the dynamics and atmosphere of the game and 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.330
 they were passionate about games and don't want to say 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.440
 what exactly is this game followed by my 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.180
 love of video games 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.460
 but she definitely influenced it then 2001 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.730
 year there was a new part called 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.800
 After all, he bales the glory of feinstein and immediately 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.430
 after i played enough wolfenstein 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.370
 3d 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.070
 I immediately began to master 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.680
 new creation aide soft in and here me 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.080
 waited even more surprise because 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.300
 literature Kosovo wolfenstein was already 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.240
 truly three-dimensional graphics 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.700
 and it was then that I felt all the power and 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.310
 brutality shooter I will not 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.100
 compare wolfenstein with other games 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.330
 similar genres such as call of duty or 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.160
 example battlefield 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.440
 because here is not touching 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.070
 the plot worked here is all by 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.750
 manly 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:36.120
 brutal and cruel and now in 2003 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.490
 the new part was developed by the company 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.410
 splash damage 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.110
 wolfenstein and us center and again 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.060
 underwent a slight change slightly 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.580
 more new weapons and more 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.160
 worked multiplayer by the way in 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.710
 I even played multiplayer once and didn't 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.840
 I was impressed because at that time I was not 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.630
 I prepared according to such bullying 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.680
 relation to me but still very cartoon 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.950
 inspiring in 2009 after quite a bit 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.230
 break out a game called 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.110
 just wolfenstein and immediately say that this 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.300
 part did not please me despite 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.000
 the fact that we are still playing blaskowitz 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.830
 what is the main character of the series 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.859
 in the new part many are missing 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.320
 elements of the previous game developed all 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.990
 the same software ade unfortunately 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.940
 wolfenstein we no longer smell here and 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.060
 from that classic castle left 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.770
 only name 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.169
 for unknown reasons, the developers 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.389
 replaced the good old weapons and it was 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.479
 stuffed supernatural cannons and 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:42.280
 enemies and to be honest I already was 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:45.080
 despaired and a series of sex in my eyes and in 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.169
 2013 when a new one was announced 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.050
 Part of the day you are a I was practically 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.120
 don't give a damn but still with time I am more 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.360
 looked at the new creation in detail 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.449
 do not go court in a Swedish company 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.270
 machines games their surprise publishes the game already 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.939
 not activision it changed bethesda 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.789
 softworks looking at diaries 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:09.889
 developers and stream in me woke up 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.529
 hope and I saw before me 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.659
 classic old school action in the new 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:17.270
 guise can not say with certainty 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:19.219
 that the new part will succeed but 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.699
 I hope that the developers do not 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:23.150
 let you down and present us for real 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.090
 quality product 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.669
 well, we will know it very soon and I 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.009
 naturally look at the game and show you 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.009
 I was with you john m Well I'll see you
