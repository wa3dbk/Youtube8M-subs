 used car it can 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.680
 compare with the cat in the bag never 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.819
 you know how many more cars will drive 3 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:09.480
 years and 3 months went over the engine 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.460
 whether or not the car was in an accident and which

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.300
 almost perfect condition 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.470
 and 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.380
 as a rule, even if an expert 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.240
 finds that car 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.349
 repainted what they wanted repainted 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.619
 I here and we can explain this easily 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.380
 car there in Moscow St. Petersburg 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.410
 megalopolis where you scratched and fear 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.870
 insurance repainted then 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.059
 man people practicing okulovka 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:35.769
 They say that the car 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.019
 repainted there is because snbo 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.110
 Casco insured and had the opportunity 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.850
 just getting free then repaint 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.589
 strip tony why not and so he was 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.629
 I scratched her a little bit and crushed though 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.199
 really could block the reasons for that 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.000
 that the car was in perlyubskomu allow 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.040
 in the car flip the car up to the glare and 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.429
 construction machines 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.179
 they are sold on the car market and 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.639
 ad sellers really sellers you about 

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:00.909
 this will never tell the tour to listen and 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.420
 beautiful legend that the car only 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.660
 what from germany 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.660
 the girl was the mistress 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.400
 would not want to play 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.240
 this is why many of us prefer 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.700
 buy used cars in showrooms 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.360
 the first 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.750
 there the car was checked from all sides she 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.530
 legally purely secondly she is in working 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.230
 able to run and twisted as sellers 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.230
 honestly say that was in bavaria or not 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.560
 we decided to find out 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.880
 can you trust the salon trader 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.860
 we will conduct an experiment we will reward 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.939
 far from new victories motorists 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.570
 personally checked construction 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.109
 and then we will come there under the guise of buyers 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.300
 and try to buy the same car 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.290
 let's see what they tell us 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.170
 typical sellers in the past life 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.650
 Anatolievna Titov former driver of ours 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.310

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.909
 now drives foreign cars of 2030 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:57.490
 release 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.780
 wants to change it to a new one 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.679
 I have it 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.449
 in a cafe in satisfactory 

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:04.449
 state you said because you were 

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:07.609
 collisions both thieves back door changed 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.829
 Sown was on the bottom of the threshold but did everything well 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.329
 how would react 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.109
 good connections 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.889
 outside official dial up good connections good 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:18.099
 cheese makers 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.269
 we know the exact mileage of the car and 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.960
 his car history has been in an accident 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.760
 That is, it is possible that some 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.820
 damage may affect work 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.869
 car further 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:30.799
 Of course, no one will say that the scale 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.309
 strong because they sell by 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:33.839
 average market value 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:35.119
 animal makes no sense 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.819
 car mileage of 156 thousand kilometers is 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.039
 does that mean with the suspension cars 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.390
 not all right 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.220
 plus the battle of Borodino for 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.959
 him, but now let's go on it my colleagues 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.439
 jelly beauty 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.439
 Ipo swallows were selling it more expensive 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.280
 we helped the car published it for 200 thousand 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:56.909
 rubles in commission 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.120
 we came to the same salon next 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.779
 day under the guise of buyers with 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:01.909
 hidden camera 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.739
 see for how much they sell ours 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.760
 car and what sellers say a 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.829

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.919
 look the same nightingales the same 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.449
 sellers but the car is not ours anymore 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:13.759
 inexplicable happened to her 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.589
 metamorphosis so was about 300 and 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:18.149
 communicate and make friends and 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:19.739
 expect 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.029
 our cars for one night are wonderful 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:23.549
 manner under repair and 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.009
 lost almost 50 thousand kilometers 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.669
 it immediately affected the price to us 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.669
 offer a car for 300 thousand rubles 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:35.320
 what is the mileage 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.320
 638 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.919
 what to look for chooses a used 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.219
 car and what problems you can 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:51.739

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.109
 used cars 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.569
 can determine, to the nearest kilometer 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.279
 vehicle mileage without even looking at the counter 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:09.299
 one hundred percent sentences a 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.269
 some 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.269

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.660
 the truth is that they understand the expert with 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.639
 Christina will go around a few points 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.979
 sales were cars and help her find 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.979

 I liked that this car ford fiesta 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.719
 looks almost like the new price is acceptable 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:46.270
 small mileage 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.270
 dollars not everyone 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.000
 there are two problems after all firstly 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.210
 seizes the alarm in the second dollar 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.169
 paid a little on st in principle and that 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.169
 the other is not deadly but his side 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.939
 but our expert doubts 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.569
 broken alarm plus 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.129
 misted headlights from a bad sign rather 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:12.169
 all this cars drowned so 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.439
 call those cars which 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.649
 either fell into the water or visited the zone 

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:18.589
 natural disaster 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.629
 problems usually start with the electrician 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:22.169
 that is, there may be windows 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.329
 spontaneously indulge 

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:24.560
 rise there he 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.690
 there if the car is difficult technically with 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.110
 climate control with some other things 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.700
 the main problems here are just not to him 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.220
 electrics but they can be serious 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.710
 the car may eventually stop percent 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.559
 to wind up 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:38.150
 2 and if the car headlights for the fall 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.610
 the cabin smells damp bolts and 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.000
 only then already covered with rust 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000

 such a machine 2 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:04.039

 he shifts the entire amount of ice thickness 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.159
 however we don't like

 so-called shifters the most 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:15.789

 Year of release 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.949
 you look at the date of issue of glasses 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:10.930

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.360

 our expert 

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:27.599
 ask the seller to allow us

 groups 

00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:42.959
 moments that can be in perspective 

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:44.739
 only need to pay attention to

 automaton tends to break 

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:56.860
 very often from oranges cut 

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.399

 check the operation of the air conditioner when 

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:05.949
 good luck airbags 

00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:08.109
 pillows should not be collected immediately 

00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:10.539
 after a few seconds if it goes out 

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:13.329
 before and does not go out at all means pillows 

00:08:13.329 --> 00:08:15.729
 No, and the car most likely was already in 

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:16.229
 an accident
