misconception<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.930> if<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.800> love<00:02:37.950> yourself

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
misconception that if you love yourself

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.070 
misconception that if you love yourself
you're<00:02:38.459> conceited<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.390> know<00:02:39.510> like<00:02:39.840> you

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
you're conceited and you know like you

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
can't do that and you have to kind of

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.460 
can't do that and you have to kind of
put<00:02:42.030> yourself<00:02:42.120> down<00:02:42.360> in<00:02:42.750> order<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.020> be<00:02:43.140> humble

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
put yourself down in order to be humble

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
but I thought something really not the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.479

case<00:02:45.570> at<00:02:45.780> all<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.930> think<00:02:46.100> loving<00:02:47.100> yourself<00:02:47.190> has

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
case at all I think loving yourself has

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.190 
case at all I think loving yourself has
to<00:02:47.580> come<00:02:47.730> from<00:02:47.850> within<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.420> then<00:02:48.959> other
