 resources that were present in the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.139
 version of the application which is a 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.020
 version is that it has a limited list of 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.670
 users who can download it despite this 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.740
 I posted a story on my site 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.539
 where users were informed that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.400

 being able to download this beta version there 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.059
 which has a limited list of users and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.370
 which receives updates first with 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.320
 new features after these features 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.750
 will implement in the public version with 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.739
 happened now so let's get to know the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.739
 updates from this update 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.020
 staff and all around beauty'm here 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.210
 like nokia lumia 930 because I'm here 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.400
 with the whatsapp application that was 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.290
 yesterday in the windows phone store 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.120
 bringing various improvements and various 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.930
 resources that I will demonstrate here for 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.430
 you 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.190
 previously demonstrated 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.950
 some of these features in the beta version of 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.440
 application that currently has a list 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.390
 limited number of users who can download 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.220
 but now the resources have been 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.110
 implemented in the public version and I 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.600
 show you have been small now 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.729
 resources that will however be nice 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.530
 because it will make the experience of 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.840
 use the best application to 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.810
 people there then initially here 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.880
 accessing application settings 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.920
 Note that the settings menu 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.790
 You can turn off notifications and 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.330
 activate vibrations and in addition to being able to change 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.880
 the ringtone of the application I do not 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.140
 I liked it because it was only the limited 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.110
 stocks here wanted to put a touch 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.240
 mine that I could create and define as 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.920
 touch also we have here the pre 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.550
 view of messages 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.500
 included in the previous update but the 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.700
 treatment here is new now in this 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.860
 version 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.869
 so you can disable or disable 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.330
 those blue tics , right? 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.730
 finally anyway you can notice that 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.320
 various notification settings 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.070
 related notifications in the 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.760
 application coming back here in conversations 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.830
 calls we can define here with what 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.690
 there are others here in the attack and 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.989
 so-called woman settings can 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.630
 activate the low data consumption so that 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.010
 use and does not problem within 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.620
 a conversation here for example we can 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.390
 mark several messages to pay 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.670
 copying or forwarding to the other is 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.620
 contact now finally we have one in 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.500
 mogi mirim and I think it is pronounced 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.959
 excited of the heart that for example you 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.209
 You can send a simple heart here that 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.080
 insert in the conversation it will stay 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.680
 cheered up 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.730
 look that 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.060
 the beating heart and a beating heart 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.299
 Very cool, I liked it even though in the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.680
 conversations we can notice some tones here 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:13.700
 of different skin for the monks 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.099
 look at that I can set the pretÃ£o 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.200
 black jack I can not show 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.849
 now for you but it's when some new 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.430
 contact you do not have on your list 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.439
 contacts is talking to you for the first time. 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.359
 options appear here for you. 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:31.829
 block to add the contacts and finally 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.060
 basically these resources were 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.950
 implemented there 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.629
 recently in the beta version of the baptized 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.569
 Well you may notice that the application 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:42.329
 now it's very complex to perform call 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.639
 free and many more resources but 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.549
 with a galley is never satisfied 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:50.480
 the request here the request is now 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.950
 of an interface adapted windows mobile 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.230
 and beyond 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.030
 I also wanted to and could block 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.409
 groups because recently the galley 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.729
 lied not even several groups but I did not 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.379
 I like group can not participate in 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:04.290
 no kind of group i wish i could 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.840
 block the groups and there is also a 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.699
 feature to call the search within the 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.220
 talk word search 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:12.900
 this feature is also being quite 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.760
 requested and this is what people liked 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.760
 of favorite online video and until the next
