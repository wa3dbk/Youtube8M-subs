00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.830

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.019
 naxos terrain and at the national 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.000
 my current abode a 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.750
 current exhibition this preparatory in 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.550
 Munich in march at 14 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.780
 theme is seen is already first 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.120
 around hands 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.700
 but there is certainly still in the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.620
 somehow turn next week 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.360
 So I'll definitely be the last one 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.469
 year again reflect the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.620
 Exhibition was quite eventful 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.620
 even so flattened by the whole 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.620
 to travel 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.940
 motive especially the wall goes in 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:15.080
 These colored hands are in advance 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.200
 this overlay and are two 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.160
 symbolic fist and hold this 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.780
 victory sign hands are so once 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.360
 unique because they are themselves 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.370
 turn off and are on the other side 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.400
 she has a universal every one of them anyway 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.800
 We had agreed to communication 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.040
 can kick things or just create things 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.040
 can 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.200
 the favorite motive of new york 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.310
 the walls are of temporal and of 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.340
 in size faster than that 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.980
 The canvas is beautiful on the big side 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.490
 once redeemed you are completely cannstatt 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.490
 dance 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.080
 at work it is so you go 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:53.739
 groupon most klodt sledge with him 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.780
 then always fine so the current brand 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.930
 are actually a very good one 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.310
 Supplements straight at small 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.310
 Canvas work 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.370
 na super work with clear lacquer matt 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.160
 or disease again so contrasts 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.650
 and who is out additional effect 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.780
 that clear varnish old colors again 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.820
 once stronger, protects and stops 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.920
 represent more intense and 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.990
 lets radiate 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.180
 I think when light on color 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.420
 meets down in different 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.030
 Angling then changes that so enormously 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.750
 a lot without actually doing anything 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.750
 just gets excited 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.950
 So a childhood story to 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.260
 to bring up and then to grow up 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.200
 still do it and then stop it 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.420
 just to be able to live 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.040
 that is what is what knut in peace 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.040
 and eat something with
