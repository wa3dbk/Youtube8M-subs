 but thin is synonymous with those h so at 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.010
 he in a small braid circumference you have to 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.630
 act specifically there 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.609

 So all the tips in the video come from 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.070
 my two friends sabrina and 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.050
 Heike both with fine hair 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
 we tried the whole in three 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.649
 golden rules for the care of fine 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.320
 hair that just too long or 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.180
 stay is to summarize number 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.920
 One very popular at long has then 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.360
 is the delaying the domestic order 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.960
 the burden of cleaning too 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.600
 minimize 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.730
 it is fine or gmh but hardly 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.739
 or even the scalp does not catch 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.140
 Too much to see you can see that very much 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.090
 very fast and also in the decker 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.100
 more often for mild and gentle 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.920
 Do not wash a false ambition that one 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.260
 then boring must be the second 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.240
 point are the hair clean and philipp 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.670
 go carefully and very sparingly 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.920
 ran in sum so care the up to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.360
 next laundry in the harbor remains fine 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.340
 Hair is overflowing and very fast 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.049
 then acts flat and noodle ick dosed 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.060
 really drop by drop and gropes 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.310
 slowly approach the optimal dosage 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.829
 The number three handles long hair 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.110
 but generally for fine long hair 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.829
 even more special is lovingly 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.380
 with them 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.530
 They are delicate and gentle 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.670
 careful no travel no tug 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.680
 stressful stylings with heat or 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.770
 Glueing the products forgives fine 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.490
 hair again less than thick ripped so 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.990
 far as good 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.750
 now there are more tips and 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.740
 tricks to the individual points 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.240
 Hair wash is not as a care too 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.530
 but understand as cleaning and the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.100
 is always a bit exhausting for 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.170
 the hair 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.729
 to keep the burden low 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.040
 The cleaning therefore always as mild as 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.500
 be possible without of course the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.450
 to miss cleanliness 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.070
 whoever washes often should therefore also his 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.350
 well caring for the scalp since they are so on the 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.270
 Fed is recommended for this is to 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.530
 For example, a lost massage with this 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.230
 boar bristles doze 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.090
 right before the laundry also pleasant 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.500
 is his scalp eco or a yogurt 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.690
 Chur you already from mine 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.760
 personal hair care knows about the 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.920
 Protecting the length is a simple and easy way 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.420
 effective method knows that too 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.340
 already from my own hair care there 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.110
 I showed you how and why this 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.630
 delete approach so wonderful for long 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.180
 Hair works your head with 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.620
 short rather complained twice a 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.630
 havel otherwise very fast after the laundry 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.819
 together again and she thinks about it 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.980
 that does not have to happen the risk is 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.209
 but larger than thicker h the fine 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.430
 just do not care so much 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.170
 can record as thick as seemingly 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.330
 has become both for sabrina heike and 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.489
 also for me that the world it in the coconut 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.519
 So shampoo is an all-rounder 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.560
 whether for thick or thin hair off 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.239
 like sabrina and heike individual 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.720
 shampoos for example from mixa shampoo 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.340
 or that is extra because that is 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.720
 always very individual and it 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.970
 You practically do not get to try it out 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.500
 around the lengths better recognizable too 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.450
 get or ampoules out for example 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.670
 it needs a suitable flushing like 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.650
 even when shampoo applies each hair like 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.630
 something else a small selection of 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.190
 The condition is good for heike and sabrina 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.130
 work are the altira 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.560

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.860
 animal citation the hair should be 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.440
 in no case hard or even glued 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.910
 Feelings are as already mentioned 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.880
 very with caution to enjoy 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.600
 sparingly drop by drop are gossamer thin 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.579
 the keywords 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.709
 It's about the hair lying flat 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.450
 and not too much kliems can fly 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.950
 Being easier than oils because they are 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.230
 distribute more evenly 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.030
 a matching ran in was found for 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.590
 heike with distance the heaviest part 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.019
 looking for a perfect care 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.880
 Give a routine because the hall is so fast

 cares about are working for them 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.920

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.269

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.120
 ran what I already showed you 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.070
 have sabrina sport zb on the left 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.630

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.130
 open hair tickler will only 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.530
 cheap sabrinas begin to fly 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.750
 an emergency tip is actually whole 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.570
 simple hand cream almost no matter which 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.370

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.890
 maybe stroking the hair and 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.720
 in sharp kneading very common physio 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.950
 Tips fine hair usually tell 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.200
 on more volume and that their 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.090
 grip when styling off can do it 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.860
 To copy fill hairspray curls 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.050
 or even put blonde highlights 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.000
 All these tips work 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.220
 only very short term thought if you 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.380
 do the hair very much if you fine 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.270
 tender you have to decide 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.280
 Do you really want long, healthy hair 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.470
 So a little more than up to the bra 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.930
 closure or do you want more volume 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.630
 the blunt both soon 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.940
 together hardly ever happens and with it 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.080
 we will arrive in the end small 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.460
 or thin hair is often called 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.120
 problematic or even unsightly 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.920
 perceived 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.840
 but I ask you look at it 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.760
 sabrina's beautiful dream hair on 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.100
 he could then claim it was not 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.450
 beautiful fine hair often gets more volume 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.070
 forced and thereby loses his 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.440
 naturalness and aesthetics of 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.140
 ease and side kite this 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.280
 again hardly accessible for those yet 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.480
 So fine hair really needs it 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.000
 not the great styling and 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.050
 nursing effort to replicate the stick 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.780
 but it needs what it wants 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.130
 Looks gentle gentle way around 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.050
 it in its delicate beauty too 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.160
 receive 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.080
 I hope that all these tips 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.820
