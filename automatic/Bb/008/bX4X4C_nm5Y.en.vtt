 dark for a picture let's leave the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.820
 portrait underneath a glass for 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.190
 to facilitate blends of oil paint 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.109
 let's prepare the basic colors of the face 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.090

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.570
 brown vandick and white how to start 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.130

 little earth will be burned 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.680
 we created this mixture a bit with white 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.300
 with the brush on the small we can do the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.630
 However the color pattern on the glass 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.630
 Photograph 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:09.660
 Now let's mix it up for this. 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.660
 area above the forehead see only 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.390
 for this we repeat the mixture of earth 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.860
 which will be natural and lands and on the burned 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:32.259

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:35.160
 See you again, we do the 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.160
 test with the brush 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.130

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.130
 cheek area that is the lighter area 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.880
 we started our mix with white and 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.479
 nor do we add a little bit of 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.819
 lands and land will be burned and 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.479
 We're already in the mood for it. 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.479

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.970
 black 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.470
 we got a bluish gray but 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.209
 It's still not good, let's believe a 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.660
 bit of magenta now and we repeat the 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.660
 tests 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.910
 remembering that these mixtures are made 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.580

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:52.040

 Good, it was very similar there. 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.230

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.020
 We believe other shades and other colors 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.650
 warmer colors warmer colors 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.960
