00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.260
 from a lot of people in the Netherlands 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.490
 more pleasant and social country where lace 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.990
 I think everyone stays that way 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.089
 the economy goes better with you 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.620
 bollards that do not have purchasing power and 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.059
 so true is of course something else 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.769
 otherwise happened in recent years 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.000
 differences between people we very large 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.720
 its just the difference between poor and 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.609
 rich 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.109
 difference between sick but also healthy 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.519
 contrast between native and 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.259
 immigrant I think our country there 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.490
 simply did not get better 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.960
 if there is anything i want the coming 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.699
 years we have seen those differences again 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.039
 make it smaller that we don't care 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.140
 of poverty in the food bank is not necessary 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.940
 are that we are putting an end to the 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.320
 situation that for you nursing home 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.670
 all kinds of terrible situations 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.780
 Just avoid the older people 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.570
 give them the right or care they need 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.280
 and that we are also going to do something about it 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.719
 anyone with a different color in one 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.100
 other religion feel that way 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.120
 idea they just also belong to 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.010
 they all find things that I like 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.539
 actually says it is perfectly normal 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.090
 so don't understand then the latter will 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.829
 not normally found in years 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.629
 but when we get together we give up the 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.890
 make the right choice you will have 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.890
 not just run an economy 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:12.860
