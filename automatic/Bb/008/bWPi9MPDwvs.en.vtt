hey guys it's me i'm going to be
teaching<00:00:02.220> you<00:00:02.580> how<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.730> get<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.060> infinite<00:00:03.510> UAV

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839 
teaching you how to get to infinite UAV

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.990 
teaching you how to get to infinite UAV
first<00:00:07.069> this<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.220> going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.400> be<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.820> most

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
first this is going to be the most

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.790 
first this is going to be the most
easiest<00:00:09.599> one<00:00:09.870> out<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.110> all<00:00:10.139> demand<00:00:10.559> it's<00:00:10.679> going

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
easiest one out of all demand it's going

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.850 
easiest one out of all demand it's going
to<00:00:10.889> be<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.969> like<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:12.870> actual<00:00:13.410> UAV

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
to be this is the like that actual UAV

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.820 
to be this is the like that actual UAV
this<00:00:14.130> will<00:00:14.280> help<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.580> big<00:00:14.880> time<00:00:15.500> in<00:00:16.500> putting

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
this will help you big time in putting

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.279 
this will help you big time in putting
this<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> infinite<00:00:18.240> UAV<00:00:19.760> so<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:21.000> first<00:00:21.289> go

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
this is a infinite UAV so this first go

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.470 
this is a infinite UAV so this first go
to<00:00:22.320> notepad<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:23.310> one<00:00:23.460> involves<00:00:23.850> no<00:00:24.029> internet

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
to notepad this one involves no internet

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.960 
to notepad this one involves no internet
connection<00:00:24.779> go<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.260> notepad<00:00:25.699> and<00:00:26.699> open<00:00:26.939> your

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
connection go to notepad and open your

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.700 
connection go to notepad and open your
up<00:00:27.210> when<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.510> open<00:00:27.930> your<00:00:27.960> computer<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.529> go<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
up when you open your computer and go to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.130 
up when you open your computer and go to
notepad<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.730> then<00:00:30.599> put<00:00:31.380> SC<00:00:31.880> I<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.630> over<00:00:33.960> here

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
notepad and then put SC I like over here

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.389 
notepad and then put SC I like over here
shown<00:00:35.180> sc7<00:00:36.180> Aoife<00:00:37.020> f2<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.210> mean<00:00:39.210> um<00:00:39.420> SC<00:00:40.110> 75<00:00:41.040> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
shown sc7 Aoife f2 I mean um SC 75 to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.970 
shown sc7 Aoife f2 I mean um SC 75 to
then<00:00:42.329> put<00:00:42.600> under<00:00:42.960> right<00:00:43.200> under<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:43.770> call

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
then put under right under it for call

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.080 
then put under right under it for call
of<00:00:44.010> duty<00:00:44.460> black<00:00:44.489> ops<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.770> then<00:00:46.770> put<00:00:47.460> me<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
of duty black ops and then put me and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.690 
of duty black ops and then put me and
then<00:00:48.300> I'll<00:00:48.539> skip<00:00:48.840> two<00:00:49.020> lines<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.440> put<00:00:49.710> UAV<00:00:50.460> and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
then I'll skip two lines and put UAV and

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.119 
then I'll skip two lines and put UAV and
then<00:00:51.510> right<00:00:51.750> under<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.289> put<00:00:52.530> these<00:00:52.800> numbers

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
then right under it put these numbers

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.069 
then right under it put these numbers
that<00:00:53.489> I'm<00:00:53.610> showing<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.120> right<00:00:54.570> now<00:00:56.930> give<00:00:57.930> you

open your homebrew channel and then um

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.770 
open your homebrew channel and then um
if<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.520> homebrew<00:01:14.909> browser<00:01:15.090> get<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
if you have homebrew browser get the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.219 
if you have homebrew browser get the
code<00:01:15.990> manage<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.560> get<00:01:16.740> cold<00:01:16.890> manager<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:18.229> I'm

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
code manage I get cold manager and I'm

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.020 
code manage I get cold manager and I'm
going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.710> show<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:19.979> what<00:01:20.310> code<00:01:20.580> manager

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
going to show you what code manager

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.300 
going to show you what code manager
looks<00:01:21.240> like<00:01:21.420> right<00:01:21.810> after<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.590> then<00:01:23.189> I'm
