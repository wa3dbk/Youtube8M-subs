instructions I remember it would take me

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.929 
instructions I remember it would take me
forever<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:07.049> solve<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:08.310> side<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
forever just to solve one side of the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.740 
forever just to solve one side of the
puzzle<00:01:10.430> but<00:01:11.430> then<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.909> wouldn't<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.570> how<00:01:12.720> to

puzzle but then I wouldn't know how to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.590 
puzzle but then I wouldn't know how to
solve<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.470> different<00:01:14.070> side<00:01:14.310> without<00:01:15.180> undoing

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
solve a different side without undoing

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.520

the<00:01:15.869> side<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.350> had<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:16.920> solved<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.530> I

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the side that I had just solved and I

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.410 
the side that I had just solved and I
sat<00:01:19.830> there<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.100> hours<00:01:20.640> trying<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> figure

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
sat there for hours trying to figure

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.630 
sat there for hours trying to figure
this<00:01:21.570> thing<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.230> so<00:01:23.160> it<00:01:23.310> kind<00:01:23.520> of

this thing out and so it kind of
frustrated<00:01:24.450> me<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.130> gave<00:01:26.520> up<00:01:26.730> I<00:01:27.260> lost

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
frustrated me and so I gave up I lost

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.240

from<00:02:23.090> someone<00:02:23.600> who<00:02:23.870> knows<00:02:24.880> how<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:25.940> solve<00:02:26.360> this

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
from someone who knows how to solve this

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.750 
from someone who knows how to solve this
puzzle<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:28.250> didn't

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.940 

when<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.360> had<00:02:32.599> seen<00:02:32.840> my<00:02:33.050> sister's<00:02:33.410> solve<00:02:33.739> this

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
when I had seen my sister's solve this

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.400 
when I had seen my sister's solve this
thing<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.670> myself<00:02:34.879> couldn't<00:02:35.450> solve<00:02:35.780> all

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
thing that I myself couldn't solve all

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.000 
thing that I myself couldn't solve all
of<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.709> sudden<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.580> hope<00:02:37.849> that<00:02:38.269> I<00:02:38.569> had<00:02:38.750> lost

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
of a sudden the the hope that I had lost

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.900 
of a sudden the the hope that I had lost
was<00:02:40.010> restored

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
was restored

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.330 
was restored
there<00:02:41.810> was<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.110> glimmer<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.069> hope<00:02:43.340> for<00:02:44.090> me

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
there was this glimmer of hope for me

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.860 
there was this glimmer of hope for me
because<00:02:46.340> if<00:02:46.519> this<00:02:46.700> person<00:02:47.239> can<00:02:47.450> do<00:02:47.629> what<00:02:47.840> I

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
because if this person can do what I

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.650 
because if this person can do what I
thought<00:02:48.260> was<00:02:48.530> impossible<00:02:49.269> then<00:02:50.269> what<00:02:50.480> makes

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
thought was impossible then what makes

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.809 
thought was impossible then what makes
me<00:02:50.870> think<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.380> can't<00:02:51.830> do<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.430> same<00:02:54.819> so

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
me think that I can't do the same so

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.050 
me think that I can't do the same so
what<00:02:56.030> she<00:02:56.209> did<00:02:56.450> was<00:02:56.750> she<00:02:57.050> showed<00:02:57.560> me<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.760> it

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
what she did was she showed me that it

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.199 
what she did was she showed me that it
is<00:02:59.630> possible<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.610> accomplish<00:03:01.610> this<00:03:01.849> thing

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
is possible to accomplish this thing

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.030 
is possible to accomplish this thing
that<00:03:02.480> seemed<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.110> be<00:03:03.230> impossible<00:03:03.680> to

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
that seemed to be impossible to

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.670 
that seemed to be impossible to
accomplish

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.070 

and<00:03:08.680> now<00:03:08.830> all<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.160> a<00:03:09.220> sudden<00:03:09.450> she<00:03:10.450> had<00:03:10.600> restored

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
and now all of a sudden she had restored

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:20.890 
and now all of a sudden she had restored
this<00:03:11.950> hope

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.320 

we<00:03:21.500> live<00:03:21.709> in<00:03:21.830> a<00:03:21.890> world<00:03:22.069> full<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.849> Christians

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
we live in a world full of Christians

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.660 
we live in a world full of Christians
who<00:03:23.510> believe<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:24.110> cannot<00:03:24.680> be<00:03:25.190> perfect

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
who believe that you cannot be perfect

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.899 
who believe that you cannot be perfect
who<00:03:26.360> believe<00:03:26.690> that<00:03:26.720> it's<00:03:27.500> impossible<00:03:28.400> to

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
who believe that it's impossible to

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.990 
who believe that it's impossible to
solve<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.480> sin<00:03:29.900> problem<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.489> reason<00:03:31.640> why

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
solve the sin problem and the reason why

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.420 
solve the sin problem and the reason why
we<00:03:32.239> can't<00:03:32.480> accomplish<00:03:32.810> things<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.440> seem<00:03:34.190> to

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
we can't accomplish things that seem to

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.850 
we can't accomplish things that seem to
be<00:03:34.459> impossible<00:03:34.879> to<00:03:35.269> accomplish<00:03:35.629> is<00:03:36.379> because

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
be impossible to accomplish is because

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.420 
be impossible to accomplish is because
we've<00:03:37.310> never<00:03:37.549> seen<00:03:37.909> it<00:03:38.090> done<00:03:38.299> before<00:03:39.129> and<00:03:40.129> so

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
we've never seen it done before and so

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.910 
we've never seen it done before and so
for<00:03:40.670> years<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.239> question<00:03:41.629> was<00:03:41.870> who<00:03:42.560> can<00:03:42.769> be

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
for years the question was who can be

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.550 
for years the question was who can be
saved

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
saved

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.009 
saved
nobody's<00:03:45.560> immune<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.280> death<00:03:46.659> but<00:03:47.659> people

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
nobody's immune to death but people

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.089 
nobody's immune to death but people
don't<00:03:48.140> realize<00:03:48.590> how<00:03:49.159> Jesus<00:03:49.670> really<00:03:50.329> saved<00:03:50.690> us

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
don't realize how Jesus really saved us

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.030 
don't realize how Jesus really saved us
Jesus<00:03:52.099> came<00:03:52.370> down<00:03:52.700> as<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:53.000> man<00:03:53.480> 100%<00:03:54.170> vulnerable

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
Jesus came down as a man 100% vulnerable

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.229 
Jesus came down as a man 100% vulnerable
to<00:03:55.250> certain<00:03:55.970> tations<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:56.959> sin<00:03:57.349> and<00:03:57.650> death<00:03:58.239> but

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
to certain tations and sin and death but

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.309 
to certain tations and sin and death but
he<00:03:59.390> overcame<00:04:00.730> people<00:04:01.730> filled<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.209> law<00:04:02.390> died

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
he overcame people filled the law died

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.330 
he overcame people filled the law died
then<00:04:03.950> resurrected<00:04:04.670> and<00:04:04.879> ascended<00:04:05.209> to<00:04:05.720> heaven

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
then resurrected and ascended to heaven

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.339 
then resurrected and ascended to heaven
well<00:04:07.340> what<00:04:07.760> was<00:04:07.909> the<00:04:08.030> difference<00:04:08.239> how<00:04:09.140> come

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
well what was the difference how come

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.559 
well what was the difference how come
Jesus<00:04:09.650> was<00:04:09.980> able<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.489> finish<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:10.940> task<00:04:11.180> that

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
Jesus was able to finish the task that

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.699 
Jesus was able to finish the task that
we<00:04:11.930> can't<00:04:12.459> how<00:04:13.459> come<00:04:13.700> he<00:04:14.269> was<00:04:14.569> able<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:15.200> be

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
we can't how come he was able to be

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.420 
we can't how come he was able to be
perfect

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.189 

that's<00:04:19.430> because<00:04:19.760> Jesus<00:04:20.269> had<00:04:20.479> guidance<00:04:21.019> from

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
that's because Jesus had guidance from

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.540 
that's because Jesus had guidance from
his<00:04:21.949> father<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:24.020> we'll<00:04:24.169> if<00:04:24.289> if<00:04:24.950> that's<00:04:25.190> the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
his father and we'll if if that's the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.520 
his father and we'll if if that's the
case<00:04:25.789> if<00:04:26.090> that's<00:04:26.510> what<00:04:26.810> it<00:04:26.900> takes<00:04:27.169> to<00:04:27.410> become

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
case if that's what it takes to become

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.800 
case if that's what it takes to become
perfect<00:04:28.010> if<00:04:28.760> that's<00:04:29.060> what<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.389> takes<00:04:29.599> to

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
perfect if that's what it takes to

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.469 
perfect if that's what it takes to
become<00:04:29.930> sinless<00:04:30.440> die<00:04:31.340> then<00:04:31.729> resurrect<00:04:32.300> an

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
become sinless die then resurrect an

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.050 
become sinless die then resurrect an
ascent<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.930> heaven<00:04:33.110> then<00:04:34.070> why<00:04:34.310> don't<00:04:34.490> we<00:04:34.669> seek

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
ascent to heaven then why don't we seek

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.320 
ascent to heaven then why don't we seek
guidance<00:04:35.389> from<00:04:35.750> God<00:04:36.440> ourselves<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:37.520> we<00:04:38.060> too

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
guidance from God ourselves and we too

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.950 
guidance from God ourselves and we too
can<00:04:38.690> be<00:04:38.900> perfect<00:04:40.150> we<00:04:41.150> can<00:04:41.389> become<00:04:41.889> perfect

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.409 

and<00:04:45.470> that's<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.949> example<00:04:46.580> that<00:04:46.610> Jesus<00:04:46.970> gave

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
and that's the example that Jesus gave

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.310 
and that's the example that Jesus gave
to<00:04:47.780> us<00:04:48.440> that<00:04:49.190> it<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:49.639> possible<00:04:49.669> to<00:04:50.630> be<00:04:50.810> perfect

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
to us that it is possible to be perfect

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.560 
to us that it is possible to be perfect
it<00:04:51.770> is<00:04:52.100> possible<00:04:52.699> to<00:04:52.880> be<00:04:53.449> sinless<00:04:54.050> I<00:04:55.570> mean

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
it is possible to be sinless I mean

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.439 
it is possible to be sinless I mean
Jesus<00:04:56.870> himself<00:04:57.110> said<00:04:57.740> in<00:04:57.919> Matthew<00:04:58.310> 5<00:04:58.580> verse<00:04:58.940> 48

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
Jesus himself said in Matthew 5 verse 48

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.260 
Jesus himself said in Matthew 5 verse 48
be<00:05:00.259> ye<00:05:00.289> therefore<00:05:00.800> perfect<00:05:01.400> even<00:05:01.789> as<00:05:02.210> your
