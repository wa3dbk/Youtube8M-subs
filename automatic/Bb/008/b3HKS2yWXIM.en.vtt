and it will definitely do more damage in
the<00:02:41.340> first<00:02:41.670> combo<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.989> next<00:02:43.650> combo<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.450> d<00:02:45.450> q

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.780 
so that's about the next combo I repeat
one<00:03:38.430> more<00:03:38.460> time

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
one more time

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:48.440 
one more time
is<00:03:39.540> DQ<00:03:40.440> e<00:03:40.710> w<00:03:41.780> d<00:03:43.070> q<00:03:44.070> e<00:03:44.630> wo<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:46.140> fail<00:03:46.470> again<00:03:47.390> so<00:03:48.390> you

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
is DQ e w d q e wo I fail again so you

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.300 
is DQ e w d q e wo I fail again so you
really<00:03:48.990> have<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.140> be<00:03:49.380> fast<00:03:49.710> and<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.100> really

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
really have to be fast and you really

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.800 
really have to be fast and you really
have<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.430> train<00:03:50.880> a<00:03:51.090> lot<00:03:51.170> for<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.320> combo<00:03:53.810> so

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
have to train a lot for this combo so

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.290 
have to train a lot for this combo so
the<00:03:55.020> main<00:03:55.890> thing<00:03:56.130> is<00:03:56.160> that<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.550> must<00:03:56.910> put<00:03:57.270> a

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
the main thing is that you must put a

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.390 
the main thing is that you must put a
stone<00:03:57.660> back<00:03:57.870> ways<00:03:58.170> when<00:03:58.830> you're<00:03:58.920> kicking<00:03:59.160> it

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.680 
stone back ways when you're kicking it
forward<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:00.750> must<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.910> must<00:04:03.060> put<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.570> stop

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
forward so you must you must put a stop

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.800 
forward so you must you must put a stop
back<00:04:04.160> so<00:04:05.160> I<00:04:05.190> think<00:04:05.459> it's<00:04:05.760> pretty<00:04:06.060> hot<00:04:06.240> for<00:04:06.450> me
