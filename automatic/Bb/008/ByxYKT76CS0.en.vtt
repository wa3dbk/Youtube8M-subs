for a few years so I haven't heard any
issues<00:02:03.430> with<00:02:03.580> them<00:02:03.760> but<00:02:03.930> from<00:02:04.930> what<00:02:05.050> I<00:02:05.110> can<00:02:05.260> I

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
issues with them but from what I can I

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.170 
issues with them but from what I can I
mean<00:02:05.980> I<00:02:06.070> guess<00:02:06.100> what's<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.640> break<00:02:06.850> there's<00:02:07.120> a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
mean I guess what's the break there's a

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.640 
mean I guess what's the break there's a
lot<00:02:07.330> less<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.690> break<00:02:07.870> because<00:02:08.050> it's<00:02:08.230> electric

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:08.650 
lot less to break because it's electric

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.730 
lot less to break because it's electric
but<00:02:09.400> it<00:02:09.490> does<00:02:09.670> have<00:02:10.350> it<00:02:11.350> does<00:02:11.560> have

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
but it does have it does have

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.650 
but it does have it does have
regenerative<00:02:12.160> braking<00:02:12.880> so<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.180> can<00:02:13.450> put<00:02:13.600> it

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
regenerative braking so you can put it

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.360 
regenerative braking so you can put it
in<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.810> mode<00:02:14.050> where<00:02:14.080> when<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:14.680> use<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.130> brakes

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
in a mode where when you use the brakes

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.460 
in a mode where when you use the brakes
or<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.700> can<00:02:15.850> sort<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.600> generate<00:02:16.960> its<00:02:17.110> own<00:02:17.200> power

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
or it can sort of generate its own power

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
or it can sort of generate its own power
to<00:02:17.710> give<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:17.920> some<00:02:18.130> additional<00:02:18.790> range<00:02:20.490> the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
to give you some additional range the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.220 
to give you some additional range the
other<00:02:21.520> thing<00:02:21.850> about<00:02:21.880> this<00:02:22.210> car<00:02:22.270> is<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.870> notice

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
other thing about this car is I notice

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.370 
other thing about this car is I notice

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
mid-level leave so essentially makes it

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:02.520 
mid-level leave so essentially makes it
a<00:03:55.299> upper<00:03:55.840> level<00:03:57.870> my<00:03:58.870> good<00:04:01.170> if<00:04:02.170> you<00:04:02.290> help<00:04:02.470> us

kind<00:04:25.539> of<00:04:25.599> feels<00:04:25.750> weird<00:04:25.960> but<00:04:26.440> at<00:04:27.220> first<00:04:27.490> anyway

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.000 

now<00:05:09.410> of<00:05:09.920> course<00:05:09.980> if<00:05:10.340> you<00:05:10.640> know<00:05:10.760> your<00:05:11.300> range

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
now of course if you know your range

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.920 
now of course if you know your range
we're<00:05:13.010> very<00:05:13.300> based<00:05:14.300> on<00:05:14.450> how<00:05:14.540> you<00:05:14.600> drive<00:05:14.720> the
