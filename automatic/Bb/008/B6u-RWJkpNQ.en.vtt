00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.350
 live people tutorial in 2013 all 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.080
 for windows today 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.560
 this in this video we will deal with the theme of 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.320
 how to create a shortcut to be able to 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.780
 enter directly with a double click or 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.170
 with a click according to where we have 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.890
 created this direct access to all 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.890
 our applications 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.980
 8 for example here I have my bar on 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.040
 Creator icon fulfill as see 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.060
 it automatically opens 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.390
 and also that of the applications of 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.030
 windows we also know all that to 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.840
 windows key 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.630
 we also 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.820
 but good to be able to do it a little 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.770
 more accessible for people who 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.980
 they are not yet 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.380
 accustomed to this new menu of 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.730
 then we can create an access 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.140
 direct to be able to have it 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.990
 to have the most access 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.330
 easily I 'll leave a file 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.030
 which can be downloaded from my 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.150
 website of the section all very but 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.970
 I 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.740
 Once the download is done, 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.660
 will appear esquerra gives a button 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.410
 fact is to bring here and within that 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.810
 way this folder and inside is the 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.610
 notebook with the explanation for 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.530
 create this direct ascent and then 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:55.410
 they have 4.3 exc that keeps giving it quillo 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.890
 and turn my website or my face where 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.680
 live argentina 67 or my other channel of 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.930
 live argentina 2013 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.350
 then to this one that says that 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.380
 If you double- click it and it will open 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.640
 cmb window and it will show your data 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.770
 internet and also where 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.440
 well once this is done, 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.680
 we will open about what we do to 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.280
 we will save and start with the beginning 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.600
 let's go right button then create access 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.340
 seer 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.780
 this first window what we will have 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.780
 what to do is copy 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.420
 this route with this key we will give you 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.420
 copy 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.469
 and we will give you next here 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.379
 We will have to decide the name that 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:49.129
 we will give this direct access in this case 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.129
 we will put 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.480
 we will indicate 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.050
 ok we will give you finalized as you see 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.690
 creates 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.140
 in the shortcut 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.830
 usable but the default icon 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.830
 comes from the windows explorer to be able 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.440
 change the peak we will not give you button 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.800
 right properties 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.010
 then we will give you to change icon and here 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.870
 we have to give a route then 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.870
 we will choose to examine 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.800
 we'll go 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.070
 to our local disk 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.660
 this case would be a thousand and eight we will go to 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.700
 windows 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.160
 after windows 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.370
 we will look there are 32 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.790
 Once the window is open, it consists of 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.160
 tip and two we will go back to notebook 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.460
 we will copy 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.500
 the completion of this file by 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.050
 example 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.050
 with the point of l 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.050
 efe 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.670
 there are 32 the name of m so they know 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.670
 where to look for them what comes to be 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.790
 manually if you can not chant the 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.790
 first name 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.190
 two copies here in the search bar 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.630
 of lanteri as they appear 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:26.310
 we thematically open it since 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.310
 certain icons appear 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.780
 sound and if we go in the end we'll do 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.330
 click on the blanks of more 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.340
 different icons come out to show a 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.190
 little as they are white and it is the everything 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.490
 that would be good for direct access 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:48.180
 or we give him to accept we give him to apply 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:51.720
 we will accept it and as you can see it is up to 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.110
 the shortcut with its icon that is 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.820
 very nice if we give double click as 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.800
 well it takes us directly to 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.190
 applications and at least search 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.540
 tico then it can not expand on the 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.270
 taskbar 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.409
 or good can leave it directly in 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.989
 the 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.989
 good friends, I hope you liked it 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.889

 facilitating the management of verÃ³n since 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:27.669
 many people still miss the menu 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:31.449
 home that had windows 7 but good 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:33.669
 with certain shortcuts and icons 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.059
 that we can talk in our bar 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.680
 tasks as you see here I have very 

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:41.370
 facilitated access to the different 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.370
 places 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.820
