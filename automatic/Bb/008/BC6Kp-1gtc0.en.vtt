00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
down in the rest of the way to simulate

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.940 
down in the rest of the way to simulate
you<00:01:44.549> know<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.850> first<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.210> little<00:01:45.299> bit<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.950> road

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
you know the first a little bit of road

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.700 
you know the first a little bit of road
wear<00:01:47.189> other<00:01:48.180> than<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.479> that's<00:01:48.750> about<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.229> so

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
wear other than that that's about it so

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.499 
wear other than that that's about it so
I'm<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> go<00:01:50.790> all<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.909> way<00:01:51.060> around<00:01:51.240> this

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
I'm going to go all the way around this

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.999 
I'm going to go all the way around this
side<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.930> tire<00:01:52.170> I'm<00:01:52.500> going<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.860> switch

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
side of the tire I'm going to switch

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.590 
side of the tire I'm going to switch
over<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.579> side<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.119> then<00:01:54.240> I'll<00:01:54.390> keep

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
over to this side and then I'll keep

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.530 
over to this side and then I'll keep
going<00:01:54.840> all<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.829> way<00:01:55.979> around<00:01:56.130> that's<00:01:57.000> about<00:01:57.329> it

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
going all the way around that's about it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.800 
going all the way around that's about it
so<00:01:57.960> that's<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.790> stud<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.909> your<00:02:00.060> tires<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
so that's a stud in your tires for the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.710
