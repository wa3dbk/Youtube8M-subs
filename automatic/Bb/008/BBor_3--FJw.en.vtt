change the way you approach your brakes

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.819 
change the way you approach your brakes
and<00:00:25.509> keep<00:00:26.050> them<00:00:26.169> working<00:00:26.320> to<00:00:26.560> their<00:00:26.680> full

we're going to look at is bleeding the

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.410 
we're going to look at is bleeding the
brakes<00:00:31.599> now<00:00:32.410> in<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:33.010> past<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.670> scenario<00:00:34.239> has

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
brakes now in the past the scenario has

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.870 
brakes now in the past the scenario has
always<00:00:34.660> been<00:00:35.079> you<00:00:35.710> get<00:00:35.890> cousin<00:00:36.340> Eddie<00:00:36.550> or<00:00:36.730> aunt

always been you get cousin Eddie or aunt
Thelma<00:00:37.090> inside<00:00:37.660> pushing<00:00:37.989> on<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.320> pedal<00:00:38.649> while

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
Thelma inside pushing on the pedal while

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.890 
Thelma inside pushing on the pedal while
you're<00:00:39.399> down<00:00:39.610> opening<00:00:40.300> and<00:00:40.450> closing<00:00:40.810> the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
you're down opening and closing the

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.110 
you're down opening and closing the
bleed<00:00:41.110> screws<00:00:41.410> at<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.650> wheels<00:00:41.950> and<00:00:42.280> in<00:00:42.820> doing

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
bleed screws at the wheels and in doing

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.540 
bleed screws at the wheels and in doing
this<00:00:43.270> hopefully<00:00:43.600> you<00:00:44.110> run<00:00:44.470> all<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:44.980> air<00:00:45.130> down

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
this hopefully you run all the air down

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.400 
this hopefully you run all the air down
and<00:00:45.850> out<00:00:45.970> through<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:46.330> bleed<00:00:46.510> screws<00:00:46.900> the

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
and out through the bleed screws the

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.860 
and out through the bleed screws the
problem<00:00:47.950> with<00:00:48.070> this<00:00:48.370> other<00:00:48.670> than<00:00:48.870> cousin

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
problem with this other than cousin

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.090 
problem with this other than cousin
Eddie<00:00:50.050> hitting<00:00:50.380> the<00:00:50.440> pedal<00:00:50.620> at<00:00:50.830> the<00:00:50.920> wrong

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
Eddie hitting the pedal at the wrong

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.280 
Eddie hitting the pedal at the wrong
time<00:00:51.400> is<00:00:51.640> that<00:00:52.120> you're<00:00:52.270> shoving<00:00:52.630> that<00:00:52.780> air<00:00:53.020> in

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
time is that you're shoving that air in

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.470 
time is that you're shoving that air in
exactly<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.250> wrong<00:00:54.430> direction<00:00:54.490> the<00:00:55.270> air

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
exactly the wrong direction the air

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.530 
exactly the wrong direction the air
wants<00:00:55.810> to<00:00:56.110> rise<00:00:56.350> so<00:00:57.280> Phoenix<00:00:57.790> systems<00:00:58.210> came

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
wants to rise so Phoenix systems came

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.510 
wants to rise so Phoenix systems came
out<00:00:58.720> with<00:00:58.900> this<00:00:59.020> tool<00:00:59.320> called<00:00:59.770> the<00:00:59.860> max<00:01:00.100> pro

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
out with this tool called the max pro

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.760 
out with this tool called the max pro
and<00:01:00.790> instead<00:01:01.720> of<00:01:01.840> pulling<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.200> air<00:01:02.410> down

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
and instead of pulling the air down

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.389 
and instead of pulling the air down
through<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:03.790> lines<00:01:04.030> it<00:01:04.960> forces<00:01:05.649> the<00:01:05.799> fluid<00:01:06.189> in

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
through the lines it forces the fluid in

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:27.010 
through the lines it forces the fluid in
at<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.790> caliper<00:01:07.299> or<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.600> slave<00:01:07.840> cylinder

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.770 

then<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.259> pushes<00:01:28.679> all<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.250> air<00:01:29.429> up<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.969> out

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
then it pushes all the air up and out

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.600 
then it pushes all the air up and out
the<00:01:31.049> top<00:01:31.319> of<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> master<00:01:32.009> cylinder<00:01:32.219> reservoir

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the top of the master cylinder reservoir

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.179 
the top of the master cylinder reservoir
which<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.539> where<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.079> wanted<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.530> go<00:01:34.710> anyway

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
which is where it wanted to go anyway

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.289 
which is where it wanted to go anyway
and<00:01:35.960> in<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.380> few<00:01:37.740> short<00:01:38.310> minutes<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:39.119> have

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
whatever you're working on now a lot of

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.630 
whatever you're working on now a lot of
you<00:01:54.720> know<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.349> you<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.189> change<00:01:56.459> your

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
you know that you have to change your

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.429 
you know that you have to change your
fluid<00:01:57.030> from<00:01:57.149> time<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.479> time<00:01:57.509> purge<00:01:57.989> the<00:01:58.259> system

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
fluid from time to time purge the system

fluid from time to time purge the system
the<00:01:59.099> question<00:01:59.489> is<00:01:59.700> when<00:02:00.599> do<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:00.959> it<00:02:01.140> I

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
the question is when do you do it I

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:02.630 
the question is when do you do it I
think<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.739> isn't<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.189> something<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.459> look

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
think this isn't just something you look

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.889 
think this isn't just something you look
at<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:02.849> fluid<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.239> say<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.450> dirty<00:02:03.689> it's

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
at the fluid and say it's dirty it's

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.499 
at the fluid and say it's dirty it's
time<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> change<00:02:04.349> it<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.759> where<00:02:06.060> these

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
time to change it that is where these

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.569 
time to change it that is where these
brake<00:02:06.899> strips<00:02:07.289> come<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.739> because<00:02:08.250> these

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:08.579 
brake strips come in because these

to<00:02:23.609> do<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.880> dip<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.389> strip<00:02:24.690> into<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.019> fluid

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
to do is dip the strip into the fluid
