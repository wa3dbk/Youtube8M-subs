and<00:01:55.979> artosis<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.820> i<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.450> how<00:01:57.630> qxe<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.229> doing

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
and artosis and i like how qxe is doing

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.560 
and artosis and i like how qxe is doing
this<00:01:58.770> because<00:01:59.040> he<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.490> actually<00:01:59.820> secure<00:02:00.360> off

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
this because he can actually secure off

this because he can actually secure off
this<00:02:00.780> choke<00:02:01.110> point<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.619> get<00:02:02.100> his<00:02:02.280> natural

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
this choke point and get his natural

this choke point and get his natural
expansion<00:02:02.939> afterwards<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:03.719> well<00:02:04.100> double

expansion afterwards as well double

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.399 
expansion afterwards as well double
gateways<00:02:05.430> does<00:02:05.820> mean<00:02:06.149> early<00:02:06.659> rush<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:07.170> just

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
gateways does mean early rush here just

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.260 
gateways does mean early rush here just
like<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.770> last<00:02:07.979> game<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.489> artosis<00:02:08.849> i<00:02:09.119> can

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
like in the last game and artosis i can

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.969

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
the front door of Team Europe is TLO

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.930 
the front door of Team Europe is TLO
going<00:02:59.709> to<00:02:59.770> be<00:02:59.860> able<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.100> hold<00:03:00.310> though<00:03:00.550> is<00:03:00.760> the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
going to be able to hold though is the

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.730 
going to be able to hold though is the
question<00:03:00.970> he<00:03:01.390> does<00:03:01.540> have<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.750> cybernetics<00:03:02.470> core

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
question he does have a cybernetics core

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.890 
question he does have a cybernetics core
on<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.220> way<00:03:03.370> as<00:03:03.580> well<00:03:04.120> as<00:03:04.240> one<00:03:04.540> sellout

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
on the way as well as one sellout

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.780 
on the way as well as one sellout
positioned<00:03:05.350> very<00:03:05.590> smartly<00:03:06.130> between<00:03:06.610> those

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
positioned very smartly between those

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.580 
positioned very smartly between those
two<00:03:06.970> gateways<00:03:07.240> gonna<00:03:07.959> definitely<00:03:08.260> make<00:03:08.560> it

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
two gateways gonna definitely make it

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.440 
two gateways gonna definitely make it
hard<00:03:08.950> for<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.220> Zurich<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.910> Protoss<00:03:10.270> to

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
hard for the Zurich and the Protoss to

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.800 
I do want to mention that the the wallet
and<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:25.880> little<00:04:26.060> one<00:04:26.240> was<00:04:26.360> actually<00:04:26.630> really

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
and the little one was actually really

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.910 
and the little one was actually really
good<00:04:26.990> it<00:04:27.140> was<00:04:27.230> almost<00:04:27.320> like<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.560> tower<00:04:27.800> defense

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
good it was almost like a tower defense

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.530 
good it was almost like a tower defense
map<00:04:28.490> where<00:04:28.670> you<00:04:28.730> have<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:28.910> run<00:04:29.090> your<00:04:29.240> units

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
map where you have to run your units

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.020 
map where you have to run your units
through<00:04:29.720> this<00:04:29.810> little<00:04:29.990> maze<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:30.820> I'm<00:04:31.820> not<00:04:32.000> a

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
through this little maze and I'm not a

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.910 
through this little maze and I'm not a
tower<00:04:32.240> defense<00:04:32.300> i<00:04:32.660> guess<00:04:32.810> that's<00:04:32.990> no<00:04:33.200> anyways

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
tower defense i guess that's no anyways

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.170 
tower defense i guess that's no anyways
where<00:04:34.160> yet<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.430> yet<00:04:34.580> run<00:04:34.760> through<00:04:34.940> it<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.090> was

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
where yet the yet run through it it was

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.270 
where yet the yet run through it it was
a<00:04:35.240> very<00:04:35.360> good<00:04:35.540> wall<00:04:35.690> in<00:04:35.840> but<00:04:36.020> not<00:04:36.350> enough<00:04:37.010> and

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
a very good wall in but not enough and

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.090 
a very good wall in but not enough and
those<00:04:38.030> hellions<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:38.840> his<00:04:39.380> ally<00:04:39.620> was<00:04:39.830> trying

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
those hellions that his ally was trying

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.950 
those hellions that his ally was trying
to<00:04:40.280> use<00:04:40.460> actually<00:04:41.060> got<00:04:41.180> taken<00:04:41.420> out<00:04:41.600> quite

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
to use actually got taken out quite

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.840 
to use actually got taken out quite
easily<00:04:42.200> and<00:04:42.650> now<00:04:43.130> he<00:04:43.190> looked<00:04:43.520> like<00:04:43.640> he's<00:04:43.760> got

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
easily and now he looked like he's got

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.490 
easily and now he looked like he's got
to<00:04:43.940> be<00:04:44.000> losing<00:04:44.210> almost<00:04:44.600> all<00:04:44.870> of<00:04:44.990> his<00:04:45.080> pylons

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
to be losing almost all of his pylons

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.080 
to be losing almost all of his pylons
which<00:04:45.620> means<00:04:45.920> no<00:04:46.160> more<00:04:46.310> units<00:04:46.610> for<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:46.850> little

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
which means no more units for the little

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.540 
which means no more units for the little
one<00:04:47.240> this<00:04:47.720> poor<00:04:48.140> guy<00:04:48.350> is<00:04:48.710> forced<00:04:49.160> to<00:04:49.250> run<00:04:49.370> all

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
one this poor guy is forced to run all

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.610 
one this poor guy is forced to run all
this<00:04:49.700> probes<00:04:49.970> out<00:04:50.120> across<00:04:50.480> the<00:04:50.720> mouth<00:04:50.900> he<00:04:51.470> is

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
this probes out across the mouth he is

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.650 
this probes out across the mouth he is
trying<00:04:52.070> to<00:04:52.160> escape<00:04:52.310> whatever<00:04:52.940> Propst<00:04:53.330> he<00:04:53.480> can

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
trying to escape whatever Propst he can

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.390 
trying to escape whatever Propst he can
so<00:04:53.840> he<00:04:53.870> can<00:04:53.960> stay<00:04:54.290> in<00:04:54.410> this<00:04:54.530> game<00:04:54.650> towards<00:04:55.160> lake

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
so he can stay in this game towards lake

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.940 
so he can stay in this game towards lake
in<00:04:55.580> now<00:04:55.730> I<00:04:55.760> like<00:04:56.120> how<00:04:56.300> jinro<00:04:56.870> has<00:04:57.380> transitioned

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
in now I like how jinro has transitioned

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.650 
in now I like how jinro has transitioned
in<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.310> Banshees<00:04:58.790> just<00:04:59.120> like<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.450> previous

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
here losing all of his probes it looks

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.700 
here losing all of his probes it looks
like<00:05:07.730> and<00:05:08.000> his<00:05:08.450> main<00:05:08.690> base<00:05:08.900> could<00:05:09.380> very<00:05:09.620> well

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
like and his main base could very well

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.260 
like and his main base could very well
go<00:05:10.010> down<00:05:10.220> the<00:05:10.430> little<00:05:10.640> one<00:05:10.760> might<00:05:11.060> get

go down the little one might get

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.540 
go down the little one might get
eliminated<00:05:11.540> but<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.500> Banshee<00:05:12.860> moving<00:05:13.220> across

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
eliminated but the Banshee moving across

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.610 
eliminated but the Banshee moving across
the<00:05:13.670> map<00:05:14.000> towards<00:05:14.420> the<00:05:14.570> front<00:05:14.810> and<00:05:14.960> jinro<00:05:15.380> is

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
the map towards the front and jinro is

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.010 
the map towards the front and jinro is
gonna<00:05:16.340> try<00:05:16.700> to<00:05:16.760> do<00:05:17.000> some<00:05:17.360> kind<00:05:17.600> of<00:05:17.660> damage<00:05:17.900> with

gonna try to do some kind of damage with
this<00:05:18.080> Banshee<00:05:18.410> notice<00:05:18.980> actually<00:05:19.400> that<00:05:19.850> the

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
this Banshee notice actually that the

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
little one is controlling the Banshee or

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.740 
little one is controlling the Banshee or
he<00:05:21.920> was<00:05:22.160> at<00:05:22.370> least<00:05:22.490> for<00:05:22.730> a<00:05:22.790> second<00:05:23.150> there<00:05:23.300> so

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
he was at least for a second there so

he was at least for a second there so
one<00:05:24.110> nice<00:05:24.350> thing<00:05:24.380> you<00:05:24.680> can<00:05:24.860> do<00:05:25.010> now<00:05:25.220> is<00:05:25.250> if<00:05:25.670> one

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
one nice thing you can do now is if one

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.390 
one nice thing you can do now is if one
player<00:05:26.510> gets<00:05:26.780> eliminated<00:05:27.020> well<00:05:27.860> general<00:05:28.280> can

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
player gets eliminated well general can

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
focus on the macro and the little one

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.620 
focus on the macro and the little one
can<00:05:30.350> focus<00:05:30.620> on<00:05:30.920> the<00:05:31.070> microbe<00:05:31.550> there<00:05:32.420> are<00:05:32.600> a

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
can focus on the microbe there are a

this<00:05:34.490> back<00:05:34.730> there<00:05:34.970> and<00:05:35.060> I<00:05:35.150> would<00:05:35.330> not<00:05:35.450> be

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
this back there and I would not be

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.030 
this back there and I would not be
surprised<00:05:36.020> to<00:05:36.080> see<00:05:36.200> the<00:05:36.350> little<00:05:36.470> one<00:05:36.680> control

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
surprised to see the little one control

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.890 
surprised to see the little one control
the<00:05:37.130> units<00:05:37.340> from<00:05:37.400> here<00:05:37.640> on<00:05:37.730> out<00:05:37.850> only<00:05:38.600> three

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
the units from here on out only three

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.660 
the units from here on out only three
kills<00:05:39.170> this<00:05:39.350> time<00:05:39.530> the<00:05:39.650> cloaking<00:05:40.070> is<00:05:40.190> done<00:05:40.490> but

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
kills this time the cloaking is done but

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.130 
kills this time the cloaking is done but
unfortunately<00:05:41.240> he<00:05:41.300> use<00:05:41.480> that<00:05:41.510> cloak<00:05:41.930> at<00:05:42.080> a

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
unfortunately he use that cloak at a

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.810 
unfortunately he use that cloak at a
time<00:05:42.410> he<00:05:42.590> doesn't<00:05:42.920> even<00:05:43.010> know<00:05:43.280> where<00:05:43.640> the

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
time he doesn't even know where the

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.700 
time he doesn't even know where the
probes<00:05:44.150> are<00:05:44.420> and<00:05:44.630> so<00:05:45.170> there<00:05:45.350> should<00:05:45.560> be<00:05:45.590> no

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
probes are and so there should be no

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.380 
probes are and so there should be no
trouble<00:05:46.190> although<00:05:46.460> it<00:05:46.880> doesn't<00:05:47.120> look<00:05:47.330> like

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
trouble although it doesn't look like

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.750 
trouble although it doesn't look like
artosis<00:05:47.810> has<00:05:48.230> a<00:05:48.260> layer<00:05:48.680> so<00:05:49.250> this<00:05:49.400> man<00:05:49.580> she

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
artosis has a layer so this man she

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.490 
artosis has a layer so this man she
can't<00:05:50.030> go<00:05:50.180> unchecked<00:05:50.660> as<00:05:50.870> long<00:05:51.110> as<00:05:51.260> it<00:05:51.380> is

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
can't go unchecked as long as it is

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.520 
can't go unchecked as long as it is
cloaked<00:05:51.950> but<00:05:52.610> I<00:05:52.670> mean<00:05:52.880> at<00:05:53.180> fax<00:05:53.840> or<00:05:54.050> fax<00:05:54.290> the

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
cloaked but I mean at fax or fax the

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.810 
cloaked but I mean at fax or fax the
little<00:05:54.740> ones<00:05:54.890> basically<00:05:55.310> out<00:05:55.430> of<00:05:55.550> the<00:05:55.640> game

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
little ones basically out of the game

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.690 
little ones basically out of the game
it's<00:05:56.060> two<00:05:56.240> on<00:05:56.390> one<00:05:56.570> right<00:05:56.810> now<00:05:56.840> well<00:05:57.800> it<00:05:58.040> is<00:05:58.430> two

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
it's two on one right now well it is two

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.550 
it's two on one right now well it is two
on<00:05:58.730> one<00:05:59.090> but<00:05:59.270> at<00:05:59.360> the<00:05:59.450> same<00:05:59.690> time<00:05:59.930> it<00:06:00.200> kind<00:06:00.470> of

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
on one but at the same time it kind of

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.620 
on one but at the same time it kind of
helps<00:06:00.830> because<00:06:01.010> the<00:06:01.370> little<00:06:01.670> one<00:06:01.820> can<00:06:02.390> control

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
helps because the little one can control

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.600 
helps because the little one can control
the<00:06:03.080> forces<00:06:03.260> actually<00:06:03.800> right<00:06:03.980> now<00:06:04.070> general<00:06:04.550> is

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
the forces actually right now general is

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.830 
the forces actually right now general is
controlling<00:06:05.000> the<00:06:05.030> Spanish<00:06:05.330> oh<00:06:05.390> you<00:06:05.510> guys<00:06:05.600> can

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
controlling the Spanish oh you guys can

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.870 
controlling the Spanish oh you guys can
tell<00:06:06.020> by<00:06:06.140> that<00:06:06.170> yellow<00:06:06.590> outline<00:06:06.800> taken<00:06:07.730> out

tell by that yellow outline taken out

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.000 
tell by that yellow outline taken out
the<00:06:08.060> Queen<00:06:08.510> right<00:06:08.780> there<00:06:09.050> and<00:06:09.260> jinro<00:06:09.830> now

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
the Queen right there and jinro now

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.560 
the Queen right there and jinro now
hovering<00:06:10.460> above<00:06:10.760> the<00:06:10.820> drone<00:06:11.180> line<00:06:11.360> it's

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
hovering above the drone line it's

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.240 
hovering above the drone line it's
almost<00:06:11.930> uncloaked<00:06:12.470> right<00:06:12.620> now<00:06:12.710> there<00:06:12.950> it<00:06:13.070> goes

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
almost uncloaked right now there it goes

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.280 
almost uncloaked right now there it goes
getting<00:06:13.610> unclothed<00:06:14.090> but<00:06:14.540> not<00:06:14.780> before<00:06:14.960> doing

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
getting unclothed but not before doing

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.860 
getting unclothed but not before doing
serious<00:06:15.710> damage<00:06:15.890> taking<00:06:16.610> six<00:06:17.000> kills<00:06:17.360> along

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
serious damage taking six kills along

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.930 
serious damage taking six kills along
the<00:06:18.110> way<00:06:18.290> and<00:06:18.680> it<00:06:19.070> looks<00:06:19.280> like<00:06:19.370> the<00:06:19.610> little<00:06:19.820> one

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
the way and it looks like the little one

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.390 
the way and it looks like the little one
still<00:06:20.300> was<00:06:20.510> able<00:06:20.720> somehow<00:06:20.930> to<00:06:21.440> retain<00:06:21.980> one

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
still was able somehow to retain one

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.370 
still was able somehow to retain one
probe<00:06:22.850> it<00:06:23.030> is<00:06:23.150> inside<00:06:23.600> of<00:06:23.810> gin<00:06:23.990> rose<00:06:24.200> base

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
probe it is inside of gin rose base

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.320 
probe it is inside of gin rose base
right<00:06:24.560> now<00:06:24.730> constructed<00:06:25.730> a<00:06:25.790> pylon<00:06:26.030> not

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
right now constructed a pylon not

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.510 
right now constructed a pylon not
actually<00:06:26.690> necessary<00:06:26.920> but<00:06:27.920> there<00:06:28.070> is<00:06:28.100> one

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
actually necessary but there is one

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.920 
actually necessary but there is one
probe<00:06:28.850> and<00:06:29.030> look<00:06:29.180> at<00:06:29.300> that<00:06:29.450> there<00:06:29.630> are<00:06:29.720> two

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
probe and look at that there are two

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.010 
probe and look at that there are two
banshees<00:06:30.200> over<00:06:30.890> artosis<00:06:31.250> is<00:06:31.580> base<00:06:31.820> and<00:06:32.090> I'm<00:06:32.630> it

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
banshees over artosis is base and I'm it

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.970 
banshees over artosis is base and I'm it
looks<00:06:33.230> like<00:06:33.380> the<00:06:33.530> little<00:06:33.830> one<00:06:33.950> now

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
looks like the little one now

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.710 
looks like the little one now
controlling<00:06:34.669> the<00:06:34.850> Banshees<00:06:35.270> so<00:06:35.419> he's

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
controlling the Banshees so he's

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.410 
controlling the Banshees so he's
to<00:06:35.810> be<00:06:35.870> doing<00:06:36.080> the<00:06:36.140> micro<00:06:36.530> from<00:06:36.740> here<00:06:36.920> on<00:06:37.040> out

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:37.420 
to be doing the micro from here on out

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.120 
to be doing the micro from here on out
now<00:06:38.420> then<00:06:38.780> he<00:06:38.930> was<00:06:39.110> able<00:06:39.290> to<00:06:39.470> take<00:06:39.650> out<00:06:39.800> to

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
now then he was able to take out to

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.650 
now then he was able to take out to
spore<00:06:40.550> crawlers<00:06:40.970> but<00:06:41.180> now<00:06:41.360> they<00:06:41.540> are

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
spore crawlers but now they are

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.000 
spore crawlers but now they are
burrowing<00:06:41.900> right<00:06:42.260> here<00:06:42.500> i<00:06:42.530> think<00:06:42.920> this

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
burrowing right here i think this

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.410 
burrowing right here i think this
harassment<00:06:43.280> is<00:06:43.610> eventually<00:06:43.880> going<00:06:44.150> to<00:06:44.240> end

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.420 
harassment is eventually going to end

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.420 
harassment is eventually going to end
especially<00:06:44.660> now<00:06:45.080> that<00:06:45.110> the<00:06:45.530> stalkers<00:06:46.190> have

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430 
especially now that the stalkers have

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.330 
especially now that the stalkers have
shown<00:06:46.820> up<00:06:47.030> the<00:06:47.240> drone<00:06:48.080> line<00:06:48.380> is<00:06:48.710> there's<00:06:49.130> a<00:06:49.190> lot

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
shown up the drone line is there's a lot

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.850 
shown up the drone line is there's a lot
less<00:06:49.520> drones<00:06:49.850> there<00:06:50.150> but<00:06:50.870> he<00:06:51.170> did<00:06:51.470> survive

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
less drones there but he did survive

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.350 
less drones there but he did survive
that<00:06:52.130> attack<00:06:52.160> and<00:06:52.610> there<00:06:52.700> are<00:06:52.820> a<00:06:52.850> bunch<00:06:53.210> of

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
that attack and there are a bunch of

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.880 
that attack and there are a bunch of
certain<00:06:53.660> things<00:06:53.720> on<00:06:53.960> the<00:06:54.110> map<00:06:54.260> for<00:06:54.560> artosis

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:54.890 
certain things on the map for artosis

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.100 
certain things on the map for artosis
the<00:06:55.460> problem<00:06:55.910> is<00:06:56.000> is<00:06:56.150> once<00:06:56.360> again<00:06:56.480> look<00:06:56.870> at<00:06:57.020> the

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
the problem is is once again look at the

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.170 
the problem is is once again look at the
entrance<00:06:57.470> of<00:06:57.590> gin<00:06:57.830> rose<00:06:58.040> base<00:06:58.310> he<00:06:58.640> has<00:06:58.790> such<00:06:59.150> a

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
entrance of gin rose base he has such a

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.150 
entrance of gin rose base he has such a
good<00:06:59.420> wall<00:06:59.660> in<00:06:59.870> it's<00:07:00.080> very<00:07:00.650> difficult<00:07:00.890> to

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
good wall in it's very difficult to

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160 
good wall in it's very difficult to
break<00:07:01.400> that<00:07:01.550> down<00:07:01.730> just<00:07:01.790> two<00:07:02.210> giant<00:07:02.810> buildings

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.170 
break that down just two giant buildings

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.420 
break that down just two giant buildings
1300<00:07:03.890> HP<00:07:04.430> on<00:07:04.640> one<00:07:05.330> and<00:07:05.630> 1250<00:07:06.560> HP<00:07:06.890> on<00:07:07.100> the<00:07:07.280> other

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.430 
1300 HP on one and 1250 HP on the other

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.040 
1300 HP on one and 1250 HP on the other
so<00:07:08.030> it's<00:07:08.270> going<00:07:08.360> to<00:07:08.420> be<00:07:08.510> hard<00:07:08.720> to<00:07:08.750> break<00:07:08.900> in

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
so it's going to be hard to break in

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.480 
so it's going to be hard to break in
there<00:07:09.200> but<00:07:09.410> he's<00:07:09.620> only<00:07:09.770> on<00:07:09.950> one<00:07:10.130> base<00:07:10.310> right

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:10.490 
there but he's only on one base right

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.070 
there but he's only on one base right
now<00:07:10.640> our<00:07:10.790> ptosis<00:07:11.210> got<00:07:11.360> to<00:07:11.450> be<00:07:11.510> denying<00:07:11.900> that

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 
now our ptosis got to be denying that

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.680 
now our ptosis got to be denying that
second<00:07:12.700> he<00:07:13.700> is<00:07:13.850> only<00:07:14.060> going<00:07:14.240> to<00:07:14.300> be<00:07:14.420> on<00:07:14.510> one

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
second he is only going to be on one

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.660 
second he is only going to be on one
base<00:07:14.900> jinro<00:07:15.350> thinking<00:07:15.830> about<00:07:16.040> trying<00:07:16.310> to<00:07:16.460> move

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:16.670 
base jinro thinking about trying to move

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.280 
base jinro thinking about trying to move
out<00:07:16.790> and<00:07:16.970> get<00:07:17.180> another<00:07:17.510> base<00:07:17.780> right<00:07:17.960> now<00:07:18.080> it<00:07:18.200> is

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.290 
out and get another base right now it is
