00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello with you video review of toys 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.259
 from the online store clitoris very 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.290
 I am often asked what is different with 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.920
 a repetition of a toy you say to from 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.170
 toys are less and Iâ€™ll tell you 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.600
 today about it on the example of two toys 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.640
 tigre saying zhko and tigre books like you 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.619
 can immediately pay attention first 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.660
 queue they differ in size 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.579
 tigrik less small and a cedric speaking 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.960
 more cabinet 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.890
 besides, they differ among themselves 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.890
 functional 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.660
 the functionality of the repeat is less 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.969
 in that he repeats the recorded phrase 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.730
 as it happens on the right foot 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.750
 it is a button which 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.750
 allows you to write the right phrase 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.030
 before 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.770
 she is another paw of this phrase can 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.770
 listen 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.420
 But in general, all that is able repetition 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.170
 he can repeat the necessary phrases 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.289
 the toy has yes here up to 500 cycles 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.000
 records 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:23.149
 accordingly, if you write one 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.369
 the phrase then the other previous is erased and 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:32.659
 how does he look closer to the front and side 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:36.340
 he goes in a box where 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.340
 detailed instructions 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.480

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.670

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:58.410
 in order to write the right phrase from 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:06.250

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:10.229

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.229
