00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello so we are sure tests in France 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.260
 and here I will try to test 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.400
 I was at 1 on pc on this wonderful 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.599
 small computer 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:21.529
 so this is a pentium processor a 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:24.930
 heart to 166 giguere and it's a nest pm 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.550
 thinkpad so one of the very first with 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.740
 windows 95 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.250
 the whole start of windows 95 the small 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.320
 mouse like that they pluton here's a 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.870
 wonderful readers also of it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.030
 make sure they are not DVD player 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.290
 floppy disk just below there is no 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.450
 of price this network there is no taking 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.460
 usb of course we can not have internet 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.410
 apart from the old modems that are 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.590
 more in operation now and we 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.910
 can notice that he acted nation mice 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:59.290
 who peÃ±a who has 16 mega of two oars 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.030
 Seneca of ram and conclude 1.8 giga of 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.420
 ram while if we see in the back 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.190
 from the cover of gt gt to 1 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.860
 we need c and will keep a minimum 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.450
 we have them 80 gigas spaces we 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.270
 we have it will fill half of 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.890
 hard drives on the prefect brot 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.440
 otherwise there is what so it takes less 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.930
 of 7 95 98 higher and after we have 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.200
 the little one from here that we are not going 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:35.140
 inserted in the super blu ray player 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:38.590
 in the right thought this wallpaper 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.020
 then had the scientific poll 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.880
 hours like that it's very rotten so 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.680
 it's a computer because at the time 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.490
 the time and it costs is still very 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.200
 dear ah here is a 27th he detected 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.190
 so we go with the questions installed 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.190
 with little mice 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.760
 they settle here 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.760
 here is a wise woman 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:09.800
 I am green it's great 1 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.819
 so it'll be 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.829
 the next wide mans is obvious 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.700
 knowing that I have more galley with 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:20.109
 twists to install that with him even dish 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.269
 I do not even know I think it's a 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:26.040
 processor set fast I think you're there 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.319
 a processor is so as we see on 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.749
 hard 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.829
 ipdia they say banks is it's done in 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:37.829
 1947 by ibm he has the reader this 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.499
 disk vector is so there we see well 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.560
 the frequency of the processor and the 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.560
 memory 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:51.210
 so it is to her it is hyper effect if 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:57.570
 you want them hyper and lose that's it 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.570
 here is a mouse attached veil 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.820
 so there he is settling 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.320
 it's boring because it's the way the 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.320
 size and for example with a phone 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.730
 so the thing he is 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.140
 no good I 'll resume the video just 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.440
 after that's what 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.510
 here we are on this beautiful cyberspace 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.720
 is using the mouse but 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.780
 like that does not work that's not very 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.020
 class with no my little ball and I 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.930
 am going to try to find bang I was 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.270
 reached settled it's a 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:39.110
 program enough so I took in this 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:44.850
 end of July the sesto lots of products 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:50.540
 totals that's so we start good 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.540
 head of tons attention we have some 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.790
 records that starts 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:05.680
 we can always go 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.860
 our brothers Shamakh orders 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.860
 funds 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.930
 tron that's loading in progress otherwise that 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.959
 it's not saying that that I'm not even so 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.959
 this idea away his hand 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.200
 super friendly 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.150
