 Hey, what's up guys!

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.544
My name is Nathalie and this is Pasta and Roll,

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:07.640
A Culinary program for those who like to get the hands dirty!

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.170
And in today's episode: Brusquetta.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.090
Well guys, today I will make a brusquetta with tomato, garlic and basil

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.730
which is a super easy starter to do,
Fast and delicious, I guarantee you'll love!

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.490
To make the brusquettas I'll need Italian bread,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.730
4 tomatoes,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.930
3 cloves garlic,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.370
a bit of basil,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.740
a little olive oil and salt to spice.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.550
So let`s start cutting the tomatoes,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.270
in the sequence we cut the garlic,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.270
put everything in a bowl,

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.000
rip the basil roughly,

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.000
spice it with olive oil

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.080
salt,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.450
mix everything

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.180
and it's done.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.150
then we take the slice bread,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.150
place on a baking sheet 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.020
and distribute this mixture of the tomatoes over the...

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.690
and distribute...

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.860
and distribute this...*laughs*

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.070
and distribute this mixture of the tomatoes over the breads,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.700
then just grating on Parmesan cheese  on the top,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.700
and put it on a preheated oven

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.700
*Preheating the oven to 200 degrees*

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.700
*Bake for 10 minutes*

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.580
We'll wait for about 10 minutes 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.250
to melt the cheese and let the bread crusty and tasty!

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.720
now that is ready just go for it!

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.630
so this is it guys!

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.660
that is the today's recipe!

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.660
