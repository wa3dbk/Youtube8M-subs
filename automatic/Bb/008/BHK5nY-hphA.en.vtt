00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 jack turned band of this brand new of 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.420
 minecraft pocket the fans as you gave 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.120
 the title today I am here to bring the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.759
 new minecraft news video 0.11 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.260
 zero point and passed about a month 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:19.380
 from 0.10 fatigue the network below 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.539
 we are in my version of 0.4 then the versions 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.680
 already moved you work very fast and 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.820
 I find myself doing the 0.1 video 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.980
 11.00 am , however, the news today is not 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.019
 many but they are really very much 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.390
 beautiful so I would say right away starting with 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.890
 today's first screening tests schemes 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.670
 it's about minecraft screening 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.530
 you will experience this zombie pigment recall 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.200
 since it came out minecraft had the skin 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.239
 tyner escape killed in this 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.579
 version was therefore solved just 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.579
 will come out will be solved and this makes it clear 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.559
 that will do working on the screen and that 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.890
 so it suggests that there will be one point 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.030
 screen also minecraft multiplayer 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.829
 movement everyone will have their own screen 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.629
 if I see the skin of one he will see the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.629
 my obviously different 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.880
 this will act I don't want to say one 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.160
 bullshit but it will only work if old 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.880
 minecraft bought legally with the 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.610
 own email 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.190
 so if we pass to the next he writes 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.710
 which concerns the worlds or the key 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.540
 edit of the worlds of modification keys 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.050
 as you see it has been redesigned from scratch 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.270
 we find new options and we find 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.090
 the option to peel from creative to 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.730
 survival then the other option is to 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.590
 set the day or night 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.080
 the other option is the one that allows us 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.820
 to see your feed and the other 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.710
 people what to avoid the text of 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.860
 your world then change the name to 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.020
 world as a network at the beginning the news was 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.430
 however, there are so many news there 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.320
 I recommend posting on our page 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.080
 official facebook you will find in 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.940
 description of but even if you like them 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.619
 these team videos mark what the new is 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.070
 method of recording that story of 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.750
 will be noticed by the lollipop in the fairies 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.280
 also know how the quality and the whole 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.650
 I remain even if he showed me nothing 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.270
 do you remember there was a nice trip you have 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.290
 understood this video was born a step 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.290
