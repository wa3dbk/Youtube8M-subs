00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
of the darkened areas so I do a nice big

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.620 
of the darkened areas so I do a nice big
circle<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.220> then<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.730> move<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.269> smooth

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
circle and then I move it to a smooth

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.600 
circle and then I move it to a smooth
area<00:03:18.870> either<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.500> forehead<00:03:19.980> or<00:03:20.010> somewhere<00:03:20.579> on

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
area either the forehead or somewhere on

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.880 
area either the forehead or somewhere on
the<00:03:20.790> cheek<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.299> will<00:03:21.840> pick<00:03:22.109> up<00:03:22.290> on<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.560> area

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
the cheek it will pick up on the area

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.880 
the cheek it will pick up on the area
where<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.220> move<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:24.500> you'll<00:03:25.500> see<00:03:25.709> that

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
where you move it to and you'll see that

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.280 
where you move it to and you'll see that
gets<00:03:26.100> rid<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.489> under<00:03:26.790> eye<00:03:26.820> shadows<00:03:27.540> but

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
gets rid of the under eye shadows but

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.530 
gets rid of the under eye shadows but
you<00:03:28.920> want<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.310> look<00:03:29.400> natural<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.120> usually

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
you want it to look natural so I usually

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.479 
you want it to look natural so I usually
pull<00:03:30.750> this<00:03:30.930> back<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.410> about<00:03:31.650> 45<00:03:32.310> 50<00:03:32.549> 55<00:03:32.880> percent

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
pull this back to about 45 50 55 percent

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.030 
pull this back to about 45 50 55 percent
so<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.609> you<00:03:35.730> can<00:03:35.940> still<00:03:36.209> see<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.660> shadow<00:03:37.590> but

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
so that you can still see the shadow but

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.120 
so that you can still see the shadow but
it's<00:03:38.220> reduced<00:03:39.260> next<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.350> want<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.620> do<00:03:40.739> just<00:03:40.769> an

it's reduced next I want to do just an

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.220 
it's reduced next I want to do just an
overall<00:03:41.430> skin<00:03:41.880> smoothing<00:03:42.299> here's<00:03:42.989> the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
situation

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.280 
situation
pixel<00:03:44.850> layers<00:03:45.030> will<00:03:45.329> cover<00:03:45.630> each<00:03:45.870> other<00:03:46.049> up

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
pixel layers will cover each other up

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.590 
pixel layers will cover each other up
and<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.709> background<00:03:47.160> copy<00:03:47.549> is<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.940> pixel<00:03:48.480> layer

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
and the background copy is a pixel layer

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.050 
and the background copy is a pixel layer
so<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.380> do<00:03:49.500> need<00:03:49.859> to<00:03:50.070> click<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.639> background
