00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.889
 Hello everyone today, I promised to show you 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.179
 I will not do a crash review 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.250
 this gun 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.009
 This will be the next video when I 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.720
 show all my collection of pneumatics we 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.360
 then we will do more and review on 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.759
 fully parsing today he's just 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.779
 I show that here is the fact that I have 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:31.309
 in the collection here is such a 63 and this is from 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.890
 of far childhood you all remember 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:39.149
 Kirov Vozdushki there is a screw cutter 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.940
 so yes here there is such a gun 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.859
 from the series if here we are in the past 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.239
 video was considered a gas balloon 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:50.910
 which shoots 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:56.249
 Here such due to compressed air 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:03.379
 he shot this gun like that 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:05.990
 then this one is already shooting 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:12.329
 lead bullets well, that's supposedly clinton 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:14.479
 this is a series of broken nicks yes there is 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.640
 three kinds of air here exactly 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.450
 air guns and shotguns have 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.280
 gas balloon there are crucial which 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.280
 charging due to the fact that there is 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:35.159
 at the turn of the lever is compressing 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.659
 spring and then due to the fact that we 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.259
 trigger 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.920
 but by lowering this spring 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.180
 air compressed air pushes a bullet and a bullet 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.070
 flies through the trunk that is still 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.350
 compression yes that is where the lever is but in 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.560
 principle compression seems to me they 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.880
 somewhere here is like a fracture 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.210
 no one there is basically the same 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.070
 only here we got the trunk to break 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.950
 and there in the same way spring 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:15.650
 we tighten the lever with a special one 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.450
 he already is threaded by the way many 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.060
 pneumatic gas balonnik of 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.260
 go rifled trunks next 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.450
 the video I show this gun here 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:31.730
 that allows you to shoot 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:34.040
 lead bullets that 's not what 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.510
 I can tell when we go to 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.730
 nature on kebabs 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.280
 he allows us to gain mass 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.849
 positive emotions shoot at 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.130
 targets on the jars so on here's how 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.010
 only I will review all pneumatics 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.510
 which I eat we will go with you 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.849
 somewhere in nature I will buy targets 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.069
 buy more 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.170
 gas cartridges bullets to 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.170
 shoot check accuracy check 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.700
 how much can you shoot with one balloon 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.950
 such as bullets yes, that is, well, in general 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.630
 check all the resources that will allow 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.920
 Called allows us to make an assessment 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:16.299
 one way or another 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:20.450
 weapons here 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:23.030
 the primary is such a review of another 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.790
 an instance from my collection here I am 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.750
 finished now I move on to the next one 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.280
 video clip 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.470
 I will tell about if here for example 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.739
 gun yes but it is Chinese then understandable 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.200
 the bar vile pn 49 understands how 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:43.310
 toy due to the fact that there are bolts 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.430
 But itâ€™s already there 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.000
 analogue of a military pistol and to him we 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.000
 now go
