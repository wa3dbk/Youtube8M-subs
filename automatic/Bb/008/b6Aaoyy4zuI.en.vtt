 One year warranty but I understood it 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.720
 three years is written 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.720

 rechargeable batteries and a charger for 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:24.170

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.969
 they place it by 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.280

 well there if you do not understand with the 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:37.380
 another proposal to ask that the page

 it is very important one can not pass 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:47.780

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:53.590
 Well, I recommend them 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.490

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.070
 good 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.430
 if you go to 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:10.970
 when you go to take the picture this takes out 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.039
 a little bit not completely and this gives birth 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:17.330
 where are you hiding uneven 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:20.419
 silvia and when this comes as a 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:23.810
 laser come from tucker is then what 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:27.849
