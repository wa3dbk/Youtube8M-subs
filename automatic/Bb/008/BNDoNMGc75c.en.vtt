00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.970
 Hello , I think it's yours 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.680
 chelsea and today with a special one 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.960
 We look at each other like that 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.750
 called speed farm picture to the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.260
 So if he now six colors 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.330
 or 12 what takes the one for this 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.029
 what to do next to the help equipment 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.660
 if that's enough of the gray, of course 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.000
 davis very much the talents above all 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.519
 in the passive talents we go here 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.040
 very strong on movement talents and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.340
 Of course, as well as bloodcheck stuff us 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.960
 through which it has to pick up ours 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.969
 as well as on our discipline again 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.160
 increase it so we just continue faster 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.960
 and so on the whole is natural 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.660
 pointed out that he already has one 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.399
 have a little something on it for that 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.219
 I'll come to that in a moment 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.559
 we manage the six right in the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.149
 minute-less than two minutes 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.070
 are not a problem at all 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.260
 and as you can see from the talents 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.899
 Of course we have the usual one here 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.570
 focus multiple our damage talents 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.880
 and then just as important for them 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.280
 agility with cabbage and being 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.900
 house to replenish infection 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.700
 possibly only for the lies 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.350
 mops before that, we do not need it as we 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.869
 the class more than enough with 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.909
 hand out and once again 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.890
 to increase his discipline again and 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.080
 we back in the background we draws 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.990
 just want to through the hordes pug 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.330
 blast everything away to play 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.820
 Spaniards search the shoot twice 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.110
 then tell us and then start 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.110
 the whole again from the beginning 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.799
 and last but not least, of course 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.320
 The equipment is a very important point 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.960
 Of course we have a complete one 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.720
 sets and indeed the new unholy time 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.430
 you completely need with what in 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.409
 combination with the two rings 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.549
 restraint and focus can benefit 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.159
 just because we still have 900 ps 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.570
 thereby getting and of course the more 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.520
 the human being we do the faster 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.310
 the whole of city ​​quarters goes all the way 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.829
 important because it would be synonymous asked her 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.350
 have the resource discipline that 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.910
 will guide you through items like talents 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.800
 the smaller it becomes, the smaller it gets 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.140
 talent it is increased the preparation 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.010
 with strength and in addition is the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.410
 maximum possible discipline bowl 81 me 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.850
 80 actually have the blooming point 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.830
 I lose in the post about the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.450
 station wanted to because I have so 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.830
 made a compromise because you otherwise 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.660
 the weapon in the secondary 12 discipline and 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.940
 then, of course , the quiver again 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.480
 the secondary 12 I am quite whole 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.700
 important there through the set bonus secure 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.680
 hand is increased discipline so 15 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.269
 percent more harm will be the prime 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.040
 It is very important that he does that 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.450
 high because the question arises how 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.850
 it may be that you with multi-shot 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.519
 billion you get now and move 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.410
 millions precisely I go habs 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.340
 now for discipline almost at the limit 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.220
 and additionally 15 or more 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.180
 14 percent more man by nervous 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.950
 on the shoes on the head and on the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.319
 Quiver that means when you're here 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.450
 deep into my little worth of the 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.970
 list we look see I have 42 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.500
 percent more damage through multi shot 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.320
 and I'm looking up here again 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.930
 I now have elements of match 26 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.600
 So millions of gps you have seen her 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.359
 harm 2 million then to 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.130
 For example, the 17 percent damage of the 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.609
 necklace not included and if 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.160
 you look again 2.67 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.410
 if you fight more or less 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.579
 and additionally the gamecocks 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.440
 I am so at 3.5 to 3.9 here 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.390
 nothing more the demon hunter 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.799
 can stop and certainly not out 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.410
 if it just becomes everything 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.760
 ironed down and therefore we can do it 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.799
 allow us as well as above all else 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.049
 talked about getting the match 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.930
 talente takes out the talents rey 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.180
 take it on 26 and similar enough ap 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.209
 the opponent admits that they survive 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.859
 can multi reminder today 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:08.310
 shot upside down quiver 12 discipline 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:11.190
 on weapon shot plate and then 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.319
 of course as the most important element 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.430
 or the most important in the whole 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.380
 Equipment is of course the 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.470
 changing tables namely that we put 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.700
 yes healing bullets 27 percent of our sea 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.650
 must come back 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.540
 it's just elementary that one 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.400
 practically takes the hemispheres because 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.200
 which provides not only the premiere was 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.340
 here we also get bloodshot 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.910
 still discipline 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.730
 that means the more we hold 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.650
 the less that can stop us 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.150
 and still like the end of one 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.980
 videos a little hint one clicks 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.390
 below also the link there I have you 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.520
 that again in the written form 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.620
 also summarized the games you 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.480
 needed and the picture should you on 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.610
 drop in any case and 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.590
 otherwise the always near the end of 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.520
 videos did not forget a thumb 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.810
 up 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.090
 I'm happy about that, of course 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.560
 whenever you liked the video 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.980
 if it was of course helpful 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.500
 ask questions in the comments and 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.510
 that would still offer if I still 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.130
 another class has no idea how to 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.800
 For example, a clean playing my them 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.360
 want to pull mixed in speed or something 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.010
 let it come then then this in 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.230
 which class I will be next 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.760
 I want to see and until then I wish 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.380
 of course, as always good luck much 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.950
 Success and you will see us next time 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.950
 Video
