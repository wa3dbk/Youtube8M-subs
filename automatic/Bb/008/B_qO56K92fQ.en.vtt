00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:04.080
 construction itself 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.020
 p 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.760
 The driving position of the c3 has been designed to offer a style 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.760
 innovative and functional 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.050
 the driving position 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.009
 can be adjusted thanks to multiple over classes 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.009
 The steering column adjusts in height and depth 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.560
 depending on versions, the front seats also adjust in height 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.500
 front visibility has been greatly improved thanks to the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.890
 optimization of windshield uprights that have narrowed to the 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.690
 maximum 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.760
 for the rear view the widths are rear-view mirrors offering visual comfort 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.300
 optical 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.530
 the mirror can be heated in order to allow rapid demisting 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.930
 in case of ice 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.960
 The instrument cluster, made up of three circular indicators, groups together 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.750
 one surface all the information useful for the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.860
 driving 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.930
 the center indicator is a speedometer that incorporates warning lights fault 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.930
 of the bbc door open and so on 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.140
 the indicator on the right has an LCD screen that provides 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.810
 information related to speed control 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.619
 and a direct access to the time and outside temperature as well as to the 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.240
 Gear shift indications 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.240
 for ecological driving 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.180
 Finally, the indicator located in the left area exercises the function of 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.620
 tachometer 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.780
 and includes warning signs of oil pressure water temperature 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.210
 ctra battery 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.020
 at night the illumination of the indicators can be reduced in facts and improve 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.150
 in this way the visual comfort 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.540
 the road behavior benefits from the latest set-ups of a 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.210
 chassis especially focused on agility and stability 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.590
 the optimization of the prisoners of the vehicle contributes to improve their 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.420
 manageability and creativity 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.630
 the variable electric assistance address adapts automatically and in 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.220
 real time at speed 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.220
 it becomes lighter for maneuvers a low speed 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.550
 and more consistent on highway and highway in order to offer a 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.550
 More precise response in large radius curves 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.599
 braking rests on a powerful and progressive device with a 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.519
 easier dosing 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.010
 in all versions 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.590
 Front ventilated disc brakes offer strong capacity 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.670
 deceleration and a high resistance to overheating 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.849
 of a bs that optimizes the braking distances whatever the state of the 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.879
 road 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.159
 the electronic braking distributor adjusts the pressure to deliver in each 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.159
 rolls the maximum permissible braking power 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:49.159
 the emergency braking aid amplifies the braking pressure when 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.119
 an emergency situation is detected thus allowing the shortest distance of 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:54.449
 possible braking 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:58.139
 st ensures dynamic control of stability 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.549
 this system is activated from the moment in which a certain drift is detected 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.549
 allows to maintain the desired trajectory for the driver 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:13.159
 the lane change indicators are activated for a series of three 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.159
 intermittences when a gentle pressure is applied on the sea 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:22.539
 no need to put back in command in its initial position 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.510
 the exterior mirror bases have a lateral memory of the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.169
 intermittent 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:36.139
 you can optimize your consumption by following the advice of the change indicator 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.229
 march of series 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:43.059
 this helps to identify the right time to move from one gear to another 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:46.959
 depending on the speed of the engine the slope of the road or the 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.339
 pressure on accelerated 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:54.059
 the c3 can be equipped with a regulator and a voluntary speed limiter 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.349
 the controller memorizes a speed that you program 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.389
 will automatically be maintained whatever the profile of the road without the 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.139
 less pressure on the accelerator 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:08.899
 the speed limiter allows you to set a maximum speed that can not be 

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:10.299
 to overtake 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.819
 all settings and operate by a knob on the left of the steering wheel 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.729
 if necessary, these two functions can be deactivated at any time 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.379
 the rear parking aid can facilitate the maneuvers of walking 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:25.529
 behind 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.729
 the four ultrasonic sensors integrated in the lower skirt 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.270
 allow to evaluate the presence of objects when reverse gear is engaged 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.020
 the system sounds alerts that accelerate as the vehicle 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.379
 approaches an obstacle 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:43.099
 in the models with the option hurts me the indication also appears on the 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.099
 central color screen 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.490
 depending on the load of the vehicle the headlights can be adjusted in height 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.770
 with the help of a command located next to the steering wheel
