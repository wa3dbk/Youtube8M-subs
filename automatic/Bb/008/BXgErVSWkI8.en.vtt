00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
you'll be invisible like that

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.080 
you'll be invisible like that
the<00:01:40.680> other<00:01:40.829> version<00:01:41.070> where<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.640> do<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the other version where you do it in the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.160 
the other version where you do it in the
garage<00:01:42.390> was<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> little<00:01:42.869> bit<00:01:42.960> difficult

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
garage was a little bit difficult

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.289 
garage was a little bit difficult
sometimes<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.100> works<00:01:44.369> sometimes<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:45.000> wouldn't

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
sometimes it works sometimes it wouldn't

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.719

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
but this is like the easiest method that

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.580 
but this is like the easiest method that
you<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:48.030> do<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.659> anyone<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.439> is

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
you can do so anyone can do this is
