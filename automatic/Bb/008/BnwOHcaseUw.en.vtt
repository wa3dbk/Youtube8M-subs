with almost any camera so overall what
you<00:01:10.310> do<00:01:10.430> is<00:01:10.550> you<00:01:10.640> take<00:01:10.759> a<00:01:10.820> photo<00:01:11.119> of<00:01:11.330> an<00:01:11.450> object

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
you do is you take a photo of an object

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.900 
you do is you take a photo of an object
and<00:01:11.960> then<00:01:12.080> you<00:01:12.200> move<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.530> object<00:01:12.770> ever<00:01:13.520> so

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
and then you move the object ever so

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.270 
and then you move the object ever so
slightly<00:01:14.300> and<00:01:14.810> take<00:01:15.020> another<00:01:15.320> photo<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.130> then

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
slightly and take another photo and then

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.969 
slightly and take another photo and then
you<00:01:16.310> repeat<00:01:16.910> it<00:01:16.940> for<00:01:17.330> about<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.660> zillion<00:01:18.380> years

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
you repeat it for about a zillion years

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.950 
you repeat it for about a zillion years
you<00:01:19.280> combine<00:01:19.460> all<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:20.030> photos<00:01:20.360> together<00:01:20.690> and

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
you combine all the photos together and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.170 
you combine all the photos together and
it<00:01:21.380> looks<00:01:21.619> kind<00:01:21.920> of<00:01:22.070> seamless<00:01:22.490> as<00:01:22.640> if<00:01:23.000> the

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
it looks kind of seamless as if the

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.630 
it looks kind of seamless as if the
object<00:01:23.720> was<00:01:23.900> moving<00:01:24.080> on<00:01:24.470> its<00:01:24.680> own<00:01:24.860> objects

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
object was moving on its own objects

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.150 
object was moving on its own objects
with<00:01:25.820> more<00:01:26.000> joints<00:01:26.479> like<00:01:26.690> in<00:01:27.050> action<00:01:27.740> figure

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
with more joints like in action figure

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.930 
with more joints like in action figure
Bowl<00:01:28.400> look<00:01:28.640> more<00:01:28.850> fluid<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.390> an<00:01:29.630> object<00:01:29.810> like

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
Bowl look more fluid and an object like

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.090 
Bowl look more fluid and an object like
so<00:01:31.940> first<00:01:32.240> what<00:01:32.509> you<00:01:32.540> will<00:01:32.720> need<00:01:32.899> is<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.440> tripod

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
so first what you will need is a tripod

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.130 
so first what you will need is a tripod
although<00:01:34.520> fancy<00:01:35.060> equipment<00:01:35.240> isn't<00:01:35.780> exactly

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
although fancy equipment isn't exactly

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.590 
although fancy equipment isn't exactly
necessary<00:01:36.830> a<00:01:37.040> tripod<00:01:37.580> is<00:01:37.880> unless<00:01:38.360> you're

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
necessary a tripod is unless you're

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.870 
necessary a tripod is unless you're
doing<00:01:38.810> some<00:01:39.020> sort<00:01:39.290> of<00:01:39.380> handheld<00:01:40.100> type<00:01:40.729> of

doing some sort of handheld type of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.910 
doing some sort of handheld type of
stop-motion<00:01:41.229> for<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.350> most<00:01:42.530> part<00:01:42.770> you'll

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
stop-motion for the most part you'll

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.010 
stop-motion for the most part you'll
probably<00:01:43.190> need<00:01:43.460> some<00:01:43.700> surgery<00:01:43.940> I<00:01:44.210> pod<00:01:44.450> have<00:01:44.990> a

remote<00:01:45.350> control<00:01:45.409> is<00:01:45.920> really<00:01:46.100> time-saving<00:01:47.090> and

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
remote control is really time-saving and

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.300 
remote control is really time-saving and
great<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:47.720> but<00:01:48.080> not<00:01:48.320> necessary<00:01:48.830> as<00:01:48.979> always

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
great to but not necessary as always

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.500 
great to but not necessary as always
you're<00:01:49.490> super<00:01:50.450> careful<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.229> you<00:01:51.440> don't<00:01:51.710> move

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
you're super careful and you don't move

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.960 
you're super careful and you don't move
Puckett's<00:01:53.510> this<00:01:53.990> is<00:01:54.230> just<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.650> personal<00:01:55.430> tip<00:01:55.790> I

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
Puckett's this is just a personal tip I

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.000 
Puckett's this is just a personal tip I
don't<00:01:56.060> think<00:01:56.360> it's<00:01:56.480> necessary<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.380> take<00:01:57.830> your

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
don't think it's necessary to take your

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.050 
don't think it's necessary to take your
photos<00:01:58.370> in<00:01:58.520> full<00:01:58.760> resolution<00:01:58.970> HD<00:01:59.780> video<00:02:00.410> is

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
photos in full resolution HD video is

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.020 
photos in full resolution HD video is

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030

approximately a little bit over 2
megapixel<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.160> 4k<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.399> equivalent<00:02:10.880> to

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
megapixel and 4k is equivalent to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.300 
megapixel and 4k is equivalent to
approximately<00:02:11.120> 212<00:02:12.110> megapixels<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.280> you

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
approximately 212 megapixels so you

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.420 
approximately 212 megapixels so you
don't<00:02:13.640> exactly<00:02:13.940> need<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.510> bajillion

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
don't exactly need a bajillion
