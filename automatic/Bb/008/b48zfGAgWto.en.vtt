00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.109
 the drink detonation contributes to the set we are going to give us a round in this 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.109
 citroen ds3 accompanied please 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.789
 com 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.930
 I agree 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.500
 we take out 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.680
 well I bet on the outside three meters and 95 centimeters of citroen c3 no 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.480
 ditrén ds3 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.000
 which means action seven weeks later basically that citroen has 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.570
 wanted to give a point of exclusivity mab one of their models very apart from the center 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.230
 it is normal current and grinding them more phenomenal well then it has taken off 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.650
 this version is in ps3 recovering a mythical name of four oils 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.480
 decades 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.710
 and what he has done has been or give a little bit of category class the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.200
 elegance of knowing how to be obviously everyone is going to compare it with the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.120
 mine because the truth is that one owns the fact of having the roof of another color 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.340
 of the retro because it gives him that plus of distinction is sure that citroen 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.240
 he thinks to explode of origin of chest they have just taken a series with three of 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.910
 its new rose albert and lake colors is a bit of what it is going to 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.740
 develop it in the citroen commercial base to sell the exclusivity that 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.450
 indeed it has it from citroen ds3 that is the base of the falconer the east and 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.280
 Well, I know what I'm telling you, it has been written on the outside and already seen a saint 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.580
 very nice a roof in different color the back part is dismissed with a 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.330
 daring optical groups solved in a fantastic way I'm a little 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.560
 another distinctive arsenal touch that can certainly be it will keep your 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.820
 his sales success was lavished by one hundred on the inside asbestos on the outside 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.330
 you also see that it is a little more careful of normality there is chemistry be 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.770
 a success the Celtic diese almost all over the cabin the picture of 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.179
 controls very very well solved the now pretty pretty nice 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:24.289
 In the end, bush that touch of distinction in this case 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:27.989
 we are testing the version of 150 gasoline horses 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.380
 p 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.370
 foundling is counted on the rise is the engine the highest 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.730
 citroen ds3 and it may seem that maybe it is focused more on the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.459
 sportsmanship that in another thing vienna 7 is evidently an engine that accelerates 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.770
 pretty well runs pretty that it's fine but let's say that in all the 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.920
 set it is not the most appropriate is what you are looking for is a sports car is a 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.750
 Very comfortable car even though you have some deals to do this cute in 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.750
 according to what times but if you want sportsmanship you forget the DS3 you can 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.569
 be worth but but it is better to look for other solutions the ds3 what is going on 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.349
 everything to that category is distinctions that will be a little bit more class on 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.080
 he then the rest of the mortals and xove the rest of the normal cars we can 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.660
 say look at this life specifically we are testing to ree with this mode 150 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.799
 horses gasoline and in the network and in the six-speed gearbox 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:20.930
 manual 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.990
 I have been starting from 20 thousand 200 euros for those of a price perhaps a tad 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.239
 high but is that you are not buying of trénor suitcases buying therefore what 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.109
 comes to be a disenchantment goods freeze them and little else can be 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.879
 say because as you always know this is a short summary of the test and 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.400
 of the most exhaustive analysis that we do contribute specific things of the 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.209
 web page of the motor world network and that's where we are and where you can 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.349
 know exactly everything we tell about this car so little else until 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.580
 the next
