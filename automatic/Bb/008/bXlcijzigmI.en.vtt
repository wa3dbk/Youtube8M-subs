00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
down the two strings so you probably get

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.200 
down the two strings so you probably get
the<00:00:49.080> note<00:00:49.260> G<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.100> then<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.790> string<00:00:51.059> they'll

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the note G and then this string they'll

the note G and then this string they'll
be<00:00:51.449> muted<00:00:51.870> which<00:00:52.019> is<00:00:52.170> fine<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.680> then<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.339> the
