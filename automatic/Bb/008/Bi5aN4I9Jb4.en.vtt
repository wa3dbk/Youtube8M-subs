00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
it seemed to go pretty well when they

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.970

here<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.720> start<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.590> process<00:02:53.640> so<00:02:54.640> I<00:02:54.670> line<00:02:54.970> it

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
here and start the process so I line it

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.240 
here and start the process so I line it
from<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.390> top<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:55.900> just<00:02:56.380> start<00:02:56.710> going<00:02:56.890> down

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
from the top and just start going down

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.790 
from the top and just start going down
like<00:02:57.580> so<00:02:58.110> until<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.170> get<00:02:59.290> all<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.500> way<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.620> the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
like so until I get all the way to the

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.370 
like so until I get all the way to the
bottom<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.400> push<00:03:00.850> all<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.210> way<00:03:01.240> through<00:03:01.380> now

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
bottom and push all the way through now

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.710 
bottom and push all the way through now
I<00:03:02.440> can<00:03:02.830> get<00:03:03.520> this<00:03:03.700> piece<00:03:03.970> out<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.330> way<00:03:04.480> this

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
I can get this piece out of the way this

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.540 
I can get this piece out of the way this
is<00:03:04.780> protecting<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.530> front<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:06.010> don't<00:03:06.430> need

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
is protecting the front I don't need

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.580 
is protecting the front I don't need
that<00:03:06.700> anymore<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.600> I<00:03:07.690> can<00:03:07.870> take<00:03:08.080> this<00:03:08.230> roller

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
that anymore and I can take this roller

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.280 
that anymore and I can take this roller
and<00:03:08.830> kind<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.190> roll<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.180> over<00:03:10.450> more<00:03:10.840> just<00:03:11.170> to

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
and kind of roll it over more just to

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.500 
and kind of roll it over more just to
make<00:03:11.440> sure<00:03:11.470> it's<00:03:11.700> perfectly<00:03:12.700> aligned<00:03:13.150> and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
make sure it's perfectly aligned and

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.410 
make sure it's perfectly aligned and
then<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.620> last<00:03:14.650> step<00:03:15.040> is<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.700> carefully

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
then the last step is to carefully

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.160 
then the last step is to carefully
remove<00:03:17.410> this<00:03:17.860> top<00:03:18.820> layer<00:03:19.120> that's<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.959> piece

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
remove this top layer that's the piece

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.990 
remove this top layer that's the piece
that<00:03:20.200> was<00:03:20.440> kind<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.680> holding<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.250> screen

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
that was kind of holding the screen

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.290 
that was kind of holding the screen
shield<00:03:22.209> on<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.930> then<00:03:23.500> without<00:03:24.370> hopefully

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
shield on and then without hopefully

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.330 
shield on and then without hopefully
playing<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.690> screen<00:03:25.959> show<00:03:26.140> up<00:03:26.350> he'll<00:03:27.100> this

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
playing the screen show up he'll this

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.840 
playing the screen show up he'll this
layer<00:03:27.610> off<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:29.100> even<00:03:30.100> if<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.310> comes<00:03:30.550> up<00:03:30.700> a

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
layer off and even if it comes up a

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.850 
layer off and even if it comes up a
little<00:03:31.090> bit<00:03:31.239> I<00:03:31.480> can<00:03:31.989> still<00:03:32.230> take<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.620> roller

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
little bit I can still take the roller

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.220 
little bit I can still take the roller
then<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.550> like<00:03:34.239> a<00:03:34.300> roll<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.750> back<00:03:34.900> down<00:03:35.200> i

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
then and like a roll it back down i

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.000 
then and like a roll it back down i
believe<00:03:35.709> so<00:03:36.489> let's<00:03:36.700> see<00:03:36.880> how<00:03:36.910> we<00:03:37.060> did<00:03:37.150> here<00:03:38.010> get

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
believe so let's see how we did here get

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.080 
believe so let's see how we did here get
this<00:03:39.160> out<00:03:39.370> of<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.459> way<00:03:39.519> we<00:03:39.760> don't<00:03:39.910> need<00:03:40.000> that

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
this out of the way we don't need that

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.420 
this out of the way we don't need that
anymore<00:03:40.470> still<00:03:41.470> keep<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.830> roller<00:03:42.040> just<00:03:42.340> in

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
anymore still keep the roller just in

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.580 
anymore still keep the roller just in
case<00:03:42.640> or<00:03:42.880> any<00:03:43.000> bubbles<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:44.110> I'm<00:03:44.200> going<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.380> pop

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
case or any bubbles and I'm going to pop

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.400 
case or any bubbles and I'm going to pop
this<00:03:44.620> out<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.269> looks<00:03:46.480> pretty<00:03:46.870> good<00:03:47.080> I<00:03:47.350> do

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
this out and it looks pretty good I do

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.470 
this out and it looks pretty good I do
see<00:03:47.680> some<00:03:47.920> bubbles<00:03:48.070> at<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.489> top<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:49.300> I'll<00:03:49.420> just

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
see some bubbles at the top so I'll just

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.020 
see some bubbles at the top so I'll just
take<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.930> roller<00:03:50.170> here<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.860> you<00:03:51.610> know<00:03:51.640> roll

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
take the roller here and you know roll

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.150 
take the roller here and you know roll
it<00:03:52.209> along<00:03:52.300> just<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:53.709> make<00:03:53.830> sure<00:03:53.860> I<00:03:54.010> get

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
it along just to make sure I get

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.280 
it along just to make sure I get
everything<00:03:54.519> smoothed<00:03:55.000> out<00:03:55.209> probably<00:03:56.110> do<00:03:56.260> it

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
everything smoothed out probably do it

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.800 
everything smoothed out probably do it
in<00:03:56.470> either<00:03:56.650> orientation<00:03:57.580> it<00:03:58.510> doesn't<00:03:58.750> really

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
in either orientation it doesn't really

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.530 
in either orientation it doesn't really
matter<00:03:59.019> which<00:03:59.320> I<00:03:59.709> find<00:04:00.580> that<00:04:00.820> it's<00:04:01.000> worked

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
matter which I find that it's worked

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.420 
matter which I find that it's worked
pretty<00:04:01.630> well<00:04:01.930> I<00:04:02.230> do<00:04:02.620> see<00:04:02.920> some<00:04:03.130> bubbling

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
pretty well I do see some bubbling

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.670 
pretty well I do see some bubbling
across<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.910> top<00:04:04.150> I'll<00:04:04.810> be<00:04:04.930> used<00:04:05.080> like<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.320> card

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
across the top I'll be used like a card

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.670 
across the top I'll be used like a card
or<00:04:05.860> something<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:06.310> smooth<00:04:06.550> it<00:04:06.700> out<00:04:07.019> but<00:04:08.019> they

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
or something to smooth it out but they

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.660 
or something to smooth it out but they
may<00:04:08.830> even<00:04:08.860> go<00:04:09.280> away<00:04:09.519> over<00:04:09.820> time

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
may even go away over time

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.550 
may even go away over time
the<00:04:11.000> one<00:04:11.209> thing<00:04:11.450> that<00:04:11.510> I<00:04:11.690> do<00:04:11.750> notice<00:04:12.050> and<00:04:12.349> I<00:04:12.380> did

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
the one thing that I do notice and I did

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.979 
the one thing that I do notice and I did
notice<00:04:12.740> this<00:04:13.099> when<00:04:13.310> they<00:04:14.090> installed<00:04:14.270> is<00:04:14.750> the

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
notice this when they installed is the

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.199 
notice this when they installed is the
home<00:04:15.170> button<00:04:15.380> is<00:04:15.530> just<00:04:15.709> a<00:04:15.830> little<00:04:16.250> off<00:04:16.489> if<00:04:17.090> I

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
home button is just a little off if I

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.789 
home button is just a little off if I
bring<00:04:17.450> this<00:04:17.600> in<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:18.169> don't<00:04:18.470> know<00:04:18.560> if<00:04:18.680> you're

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
bring this in I don't know if you're

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.470 
bring this in I don't know if you're
about<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:18.980> make<00:04:19.190> it<00:04:19.370> out<00:04:19.519> it's<00:04:20.030> just<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.299> little

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
about to make it out it's just a little

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.870 
about to make it out it's just a little
off<00:04:20.750> around<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.169> right-hand<00:04:21.680> side

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
off around the right-hand side

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.070 
off around the right-hand side
everything<00:04:22.880> else<00:04:23.000> looks<00:04:23.120> perfect<00:04:23.690> as<00:04:23.780> far<00:04:23.960> as

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
everything else looks perfect as far as

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.770 
everything else looks perfect as far as
all<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.320> cutouts<00:04:24.680> goes<00:04:25.010> if<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.180> give<00:04:26.389> it<00:04:26.510> just<00:04:26.690> a

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
all the cutouts goes if I give it just a

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.770 
all the cutouts goes if I give it just a
quick<00:04:27.050> wipe<00:04:27.610> there<00:04:28.610> are<00:04:28.730> no<00:04:28.970> bubbles<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.630> mean

said it might be like one little one up
here<00:04:34.130> at<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.310> top<00:04:34.370> but<00:04:34.910> it's<00:04:35.450> pretty<00:04:35.750> much<00:04:35.930> a

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
here at the top but it's pretty much a

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.200 
here at the top but it's pretty much a

know the orange pili like texture

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.750 
know the orange pili like texture
although<00:04:48.410> these<00:04:48.800> don't<00:04:49.070> really<00:04:49.280> have<00:04:49.460> much<00:04:49.729> of

although these don't really have much of
an<00:04:50.090> orange<00:04:50.330> peel<00:04:50.660> effect<00:04:51.080> and<00:04:51.290> you<00:04:51.680> can<00:04:51.830> see

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
an orange peel effect and you can see

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.290 
an orange peel effect and you can see
how<00:04:52.160> clear<00:04:52.520> they<00:04:52.639> are<00:04:52.820> they<00:04:52.970> are<00:04:53.060> definitely
