00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
creativity now obviously these are

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.150 
creativity now obviously these are
things<00:05:45.200> that<00:05:45.260> are<00:05:45.380> available<00:05:45.500> in<00:05:45.860> the<00:05:45.950> pro

things that are available in the pro

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.860 
things that are available in the pro
package<00:05:46.460> of<00:05:46.790> this<00:05:46.970> which<00:05:47.479> I<00:05:47.570> believe<00:05:47.780> is

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
package of this which I believe is

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.810 
package of this which I believe is
around<00:05:48.050> $9.99<00:05:48.650> a<00:05:48.830> month<00:05:48.860> but<00:05:49.400> if<00:05:49.550> you<00:05:49.640> pay<00:05:49.760> for

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
around $9.99 a month but if you pay for

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.790 
around $9.99 a month but if you pay for
the<00:05:49.970> year<00:05:50.060> in<00:05:50.120> full<00:05:50.330> it's<00:05:50.450> 399<00:05:50.750> a<00:05:51.080> month<00:05:51.320> and

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
the year in full it's 399 a month and

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.620 
the year in full it's 399 a month and
I'm<00:05:51.919> seriously<00:05:52.729> considering<00:05:53.210> it's<00:05:53.479> always

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
I'm seriously considering it's always

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.790 
I'm seriously considering it's always
hard<00:05:53.780> for<00:05:53.810> me<00:05:53.930> to<00:05:53.990> let<00:05:54.110> go<00:05:54.140> to<00:05:54.229> sleep<00:05:54.530> at<00:05:54.680> night

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
hard for me to let go to sleep at night

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.830 
hard for me to let go to sleep at night
it's<00:05:54.950> always<00:05:55.130> hard<00:05:55.430> for<00:05:55.490> me<00:05:55.729> to<00:05:55.910> just<00:05:56.150> take<00:05:56.810> a

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
it's always hard for me to just take a

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.170 
it's always hard for me to just take a
minute<00:05:57.200> and<00:05:57.380> relax<00:05:58.010> without<00:05:58.700> just<00:05:58.880> wanting<00:05:59.150> to

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
minute and relax without just wanting to

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.500 
minute and relax without just wanting to
nap<00:05:59.630> obviously<00:06:00.410> and<00:06:00.770> so<00:06:01.250> I<00:06:01.280> think<00:06:01.430> that<00:06:01.640> this

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
nap obviously and so I think that this

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.510 
nap obviously and so I think that this
can<00:06:02.660> only<00:06:02.900> do<00:06:03.110> good<00:06:03.140> things<00:06:03.590> plus<00:06:04.130> I<00:06:04.310> really

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
can only do good things plus I really

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.600 
can only do good things plus I really
like<00:06:04.880> listening<00:06:05.360> to<00:06:05.419> lakes<00:06:06.380> and<00:06:06.770> leaves<00:06:07.130> and
