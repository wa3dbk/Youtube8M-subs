00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
team just came off of a first-place win

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.990 
team just came off of a first-place win
at<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.310> Asiana<00:03:32.800> Championships<00:03:33.800> and<00:03:34.010> in<00:03:34.250> China

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
at the Asiana Championships and in China

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.840 
at the Asiana Championships and in China
the<00:03:35.780> average<00:03:36.050> is<00:03:36.200> seventeen<00:03:36.710> point<00:03:37.040> six<00:03:37.130> and

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
the average is seventeen point six and

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.940 
the average is seventeen point six and
it<00:03:38.180> was<00:03:38.300> their<00:03:38.450> highest<00:03:38.750> average<00:03:39.050> ever<00:03:39.260> right

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
it was their highest average ever right

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.130 
it was their highest average ever right
now<00:03:40.130> they're<00:03:40.400> just<00:03:40.430> finished<00:03:41.030> around<00:03:41.210> three<00:03:41.750> I

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
now they're just finished around three I

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.230 
now they're just finished around three I
think<00:03:42.380> they're<00:03:42.770> probably<00:03:43.190> right<00:03:43.700> around<00:03:44.000> that

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
think they're probably right around that

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.960 
think they're probably right around that
average<00:03:44.690> right<00:03:44.930> now<00:03:45.140> so<00:03:45.800> we<00:03:45.920> set<00:03:46.130> two<00:03:46.700> goals

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
average right now so we set two goals

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.640 
average right now so we set two goals
for<00:03:47.240> the<00:03:47.360> for<00:03:47.570> we<00:03:47.750> set<00:03:47.930> an<00:03:48.020> eighteen<00:03:48.410> point

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
for the for we set an eighteen point

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.560 
for the for we set an eighteen point
average<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.640> for<00:03:49.820> the<00:03:49.880> eight<00:03:50.030> way<00:03:50.240> we<00:03:50.360> set<00:03:50.540> a

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
average and for the eight way we set a

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.260 
average and for the eight way we set a
fourteen<00:03:51.050> point<00:03:51.290> average<00:03:51.620> in<00:03:51.800> January<00:03:52.610> so<00:03:52.910> it

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
fourteen point average in January so it

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.760 
fourteen point average in January so it
looks<00:03:53.450> like<00:03:53.540> we're<00:03:53.780> right<00:03:54.020> on<00:03:54.080> track<00:03:54.410> or

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
looks like we're right on track or

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.670 
looks like we're right on track or
hopefully<00:03:55.130> be<00:03:55.280> above<00:03:55.520> it
