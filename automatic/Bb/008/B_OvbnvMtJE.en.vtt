 biggest month of function gta 5 and well 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.980
 sure after the biggest jumps the most 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.690
 fail big and well I really made 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.980
 really chelou stuff and suddenly it 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.299

 stun assembly and of course I have a 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.449
 little series there that I launched there is no 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.560
 long as they are called jean paul 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.789
 did for those who do not know 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.039
 again and every day I pass you a 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.330
 stunt with a fail a what the fuck and at 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.070
 the end of the video of the little old people for 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.390
 subscribers and then I can you too 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.520
 challenge me for me to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.780
 do in my videos and you can 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.219
 even send your clips to go into 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.899
 bonus so if it does not tempt you it's 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.860
 see and then that's it so thank you 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.870
 advanced 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.899
 and if not, well, let's go 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.460
 start in 10th place well that's 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.050
 party we start nicely at the tenth 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.850
 position with this clip which is basically 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.020
 a failed stent is actually the car in 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.670
 loose we fall up and down 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.860
 she will hang between the wall and the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.329
 hate and speeding up it's going to make a 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.370
 really weird ride I had never 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.210
 seen before and frankly low considering the state of 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.619
 the car I would say she did 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.299
 really do not like and we continue with 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.500
 this ninth position with a title 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.450
 rather surprising since today 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.830
 character had a car accident 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.060
 but did not want to die at once 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.060
 he crossed the wall simply 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.869
 for this eighth position we get 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.430
 found with a rather funny clip 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.470
 because in fact after missing on the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.640
 jump the character is well he'll get 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.900
 hang on to life i want to say 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.240
 he'll stay a little bit like this 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.200
 quiet cushy by the arm and after 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.000
 Well, here he is going to fall 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.240
 and apparently it works and it has him 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640
 save the life 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.079
 in the 7th position is left with this 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.000
 clip well what the fuck since 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.049
 apparently when you invite a girl 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.369
 to go for a ride in 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.049
 car she has the right to be half 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.340
 okay and I want to add 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.270
 today she did not want to 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.860
 to pass on we continue with 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.240
 this sixth place and this clip 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.880
 frankly good fun you will see 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.409
 the character in fact he misses his all 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.659
 right on the burida not enough or suddenly 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.070
 he falls back and his arm is going to get stuck 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.450
 under the bike so stuck a little bit 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.590
 in the void I want to say and the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.820
 blow he'll do he'll try to get himself 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.970
 clear as he can and frankly 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.970
 it's ridiculous 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.869
 let's go we go for this 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.880
 top 5 with this weird frank clip yet 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.470
 once since the character down in 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.910
 taking in doing this stuff this little 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.500
 accident and well he will block his motorcycle 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.000
 under the big bridge and looking for 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.769
 solutions to recover it he has 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.290
 found you are trying to jump flat 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.580
 belly with x and bm so for for 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.560
 try to miss laughing next to the bike 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.180
 and recover it but apparently 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.090
 as you see it does not work very well 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.860
 since here it is in fact 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.290
 crawling and that gives something 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.580
 again very ridiculous and that's it 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.560
 so his bike is there just for the 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.120
 taunt in fact and ba he can not the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.250
 recover and frankly that's good 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.609
 happy for him so he will try 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.109
 maybe the other way to see up 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.180
 so hoisted landed on the ground 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.530
 but apparently it does not look like 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.850
 to walk much better frankly 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.670
 give a good thing what the fuck this 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.590
 little little clip where he gets into the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.590
 empty frankly it's very huge 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.160
 in number 4 we will still find each other 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.480
 with a totally weird clip you 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.800
 go see because we are strolling in 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.390
 full city and there a car of wicres 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.830
 his arrest explodes and the 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:13.940
 cops keep talking after they die 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:15.170
 simply in chain in the top 3 with 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.610
 this third place is frankly a 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.230
 clip totally or what the fuck still 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.670
 once since you will see that the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.900
 character makes it by missing the stone 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.400
 who's going to crash the bike whose wall 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.510
 which holds in the air alone in 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.190
 the wall to the blog a little bit in all 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.480
 the senses but it's not over since in 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.650
 done by wanting to retrieve it I say to myself 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.970
 that he drank a little too much when 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.830
 even since you are going to see that it's going 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:36.950
 push it and there it goes market all 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:39.019
 oddly it's gone for this 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.220
 second position and a clip still a 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.540
 times totally the one where I'm going 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.890
 call it the bike ria jean crisis 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.480
 epilepsy I think it sounds good 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.250
 for the clip since in fact the 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.989
 character he's just missed 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.730
 his stand he will fall off the bike and the 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.840
 motorcycle is going to get stuck that toasting and 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.890
 apparently they are very good friends 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.450
 since she can not let go 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.040
 and actually the character by wanting 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.720
 get the bike back on the bike 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.959
 motorcycle toasting until the moment he 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.959
 will die 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.460
 it's gone for place number one 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.230
 this top 10 what the fuck and of course a 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.940
 totally incredible clip since 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.250
 character after missing this job eh 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.300
 well they land where the water is there 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.220
 something unusual instead of 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.720
 go up to the surface by swimming well 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.280
 he finds himself under water with all the 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.260
 breathing that he needs to be able to 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.120
 explore the seabed and suddenly at 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.480
 simply balattou under the water he can 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.700
 explore the tranquillou jump and 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.890
 frankly if it's totally what the 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.000
 fuck and you'll see that it's not 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.470
 finished since we still arrive at 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.780
 call it underwater simply 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.780
 so why not here it is beautiful 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.480
 and that's the end of this 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.830
 video i hope you will appreciate 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.120
 if that's the case do not hesitate to put 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.930
 a little secular and to share that with me 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.520

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.170
