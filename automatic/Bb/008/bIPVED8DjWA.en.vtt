 more lawyers to respond to the 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.790

 presidential elections and already by 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.530
 some established pre-candidates 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.600
 seen publicly who do you think 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.250

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.150

 eliminate this democratic process 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.580
 started in 2008, those who believe that the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.810
 great popularity of this lugo 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.160

 citizenship I think it's a government 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.520
 acceptable by most of the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.670
 citizenship and the only way is to 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.640
 hinder the process is never and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.949
 eliminate the president of these actions 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.949

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.200
 those who have lived privilegedly in 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.170
 the last years and well they are 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.570
