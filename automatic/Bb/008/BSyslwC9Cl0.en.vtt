the middle underneath oh yeah can
Spencer<00:03:19.190> can<00:03:19.370> spin<00:03:19.670> full<00:03:19.940> 360<00:03:20.690> Emily<00:03:21.470> there's

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
Spencer can spin full 360 Emily there's

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.440 
Spencer can spin full 360 Emily there's
screws<00:03:22.520> on<00:03:22.700> each<00:03:22.880> Center

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
screws on each Center

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.880 
screws on each Center
onii-chan<00:03:23.750> tried<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.260> props<00:03:24.500> or<00:03:24.709> whatever

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
onii-chan tried the props or whatever

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.540 
onii-chan tried the props or whatever
yep<00:03:25.519> so<00:03:25.700> what<00:03:25.880> they<00:03:26.030> do<00:03:26.209> is<00:03:26.450> there<00:03:26.989> is<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.550> think

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
yep so what they do is there is a think

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.240 
yep so what they do is there is a think
of<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:28.760> almost<00:03:28.940> as<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.209> like<00:03:29.690> a<00:03:29.720> dead<00:03:30.050> bolt<00:03:30.260> that

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
of it almost as a like a dead bolt that

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.910 
of it almost as a like a dead bolt that
they<00:03:31.670> dropped<00:03:32.150> into<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.660> hole<00:03:32.930> which<00:03:33.620> kind<00:03:33.860> of

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
they dropped into a hole which kind of

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.460 
they dropped into a hole which kind of
locks<00:03:34.160> transmission<00:03:34.940> into<00:03:35.150> place<00:03:35.360> that<00:03:35.690> boat

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
locks transmission into place that boat

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.979 
locks transmission into place that boat
is<00:03:36.590> able<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:36.920> thrust<00:03:37.250> forward<00:03:37.580> so<00:03:38.330> each<00:03:38.540> time

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
is able to thrust forward so each time

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.620 
is able to thrust forward so each time
they<00:03:39.170> go<00:03:39.320> to<00:03:39.650> pull<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.250> pin<00:03:40.430> from<00:03:40.580> back<00:03:40.910> and

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
they go to pull the pin from back and

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.600 
they go to pull the pin from back and
drop<00:03:41.930> it<00:03:42.140> into<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.470> hole<00:03:42.500> from<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:42.950> front<00:03:43.250> huh

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
drop it into the hole from the front huh

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.110 
drop it into the hole from the front huh
oh<00:03:44.769> yeah<00:03:45.769> yeah<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.070> mean<00:03:46.190> so<00:03:46.580> that<00:03:46.730> they<00:03:46.910> have

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
oh yeah yeah I mean so that they have

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.140 
oh yeah yeah I mean so that they have
the<00:03:48.110> thrust<00:03:48.470> from<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:49.010> correct<00:03:49.400> transmission

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
the thrust from the correct transmission

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.780 
the thrust from the correct transmission
follow<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:51.170> like<00:03:51.470> in<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.650> midpoint<00:03:51.920> it<00:03:52.550> does

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
follow that like in the midpoint it does

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.360 
follow that like in the midpoint it does
like<00:03:53.269> 16<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:53.930> 21<00:03:54.260> knots<00:03:54.560> depending<00:03:55.160> on<00:03:55.280> the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
like 16 to 21 knots depending on the

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.720 
like 16 to 21 knots depending on the
weather

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.910 

really<00:03:58.730> it<00:03:58.850> gets<00:03:59.030> really<00:03:59.300> foggy<00:03:59.690> it's<00:04:00.590> so

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
really it gets really foggy it's so

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.259 
really it gets really foggy it's so
thick<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:01.459> can't<00:04:01.730> see<00:04:01.970> but<00:04:02.330> you<00:04:02.420> figure<00:04:04.269> five

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
thick you can't see but you figure five

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.970 
thick you can't see but you figure five
horns<00:04:05.660> are<00:04:05.959> going<00:04:06.200> off<00:04:06.350> and<00:04:06.380> then<00:04:06.769> you<00:04:06.860> have

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
horns are going off and then you have

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:18.069 
horns are going off and then you have
the<00:04:07.070> strobe<00:04:07.459> lights<00:04:07.730> at<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.000> dark
