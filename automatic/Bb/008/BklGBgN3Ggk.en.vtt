anymore and i can make decisions but the
tutorial<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:36.700> actually<00:03:36.940> fairly<00:03:37.239> long<00:03:37.630> so<00:03:38.640> you

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
time he doesnt sit 17 so it's gonna be a

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.379 
time he doesnt sit 17 so it's gonna be a
little<00:04:26.289> while<00:04:26.379> hello<00:04:26.949> you<00:04:27.909> do<00:04:28.030> level<00:04:28.270> ups

incredibly<00:04:29.259> fast<00:04:29.500> I<00:04:29.830> wondering<00:04:30.370> how<00:04:30.460> many

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
incredibly fast I wondering how many

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.010 
incredibly fast I wondering how many
levels<00:04:30.759> there<00:04:31.030> are<00:04:31.150> two<00:04:31.240> max<00:04:31.449> or<00:04:31.629> if<00:04:31.780> there<00:04:31.930> is

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
levels there are two max or if there is

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.719 
levels there are two max or if there is
a<00:04:32.050> max<00:04:32.319> that<00:04:32.500> maybe<00:04:32.710> that's<00:04:32.830> just<00:04:32.949> the<00:04:33.430> endgame

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
a max that maybe that's just the endgame

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.460 
a max that maybe that's just the endgame
is<00:04:33.879> constantly<00:04:34.599> gaining<00:04:35.590> more<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:35.800> more

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
is constantly gaining more and more

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.110 
is constantly gaining more and more
looks<00:04:38.470> like<00:04:38.680> this<00:04:39.099> fight<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:39.639> just<00:04:39.849> about

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
looks like this fight is just about

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.740 
looks like this fight is just about
wiped<00:04:40.900> up<00:04:41.669> that<00:04:42.669> actually<00:04:42.940> gets<00:04:43.030> fairly<00:04:43.389> hard

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
wiped up that actually gets fairly hard

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.670 
wiped up that actually gets fairly hard
so<00:04:44.110> I<00:04:45.870> should<00:04:46.870> be<00:04:46.960> really<00:04:47.169> hard<00:04:47.349> to<00:04:47.379> win<00:04:47.590> the
