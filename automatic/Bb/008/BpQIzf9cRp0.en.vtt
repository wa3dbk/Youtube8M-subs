'part this is all I know is this is the

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 
first thing that will be going up on

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.690 
first thing that will be going up on
that<00:00:10.700> part<00:00:10.970> number<00:00:11.210> 23<00:00:11.840> I<00:00:11.870> think<00:00:12.200> anyway<00:00:13.190> so<00:00:13.250> we

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
that part number 23 I think anyway so we

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.280 
that part number 23 I think anyway so we
only<00:00:13.790> have<00:00:14.030> one<00:00:14.060> thing<00:00:14.330> to<00:00:14.390> show<00:00:14.600> off<00:00:14.780> right

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290 
only have one thing to show off right

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.919 
only have one thing to show off right
now<00:00:15.500> this<00:00:15.980> comes<00:00:16.250> from<00:00:16.309> Oklahoma<00:00:16.849> and<00:00:17.359> as<00:00:17.810> the

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:17.929 
now this comes from Oklahoma and as the

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
now this comes from Oklahoma and as the
back<00:00:18.109> says<00:00:18.380> you<00:00:18.980> will<00:00:19.279> need<00:00:19.999> scissors<00:00:20.599> so<00:00:21.529> let

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
back says you will need scissors so let

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.759 
back says you will need scissors so let
us<00:00:21.980> get<00:00:22.310> our<00:00:22.490> scissors<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:23.380> I<00:00:24.380> think<00:00:24.619> it's

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
us get our scissors and I think it's

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.319 
us get our scissors and I think it's
safe<00:00:24.919> to<00:00:24.949> cut<00:00:25.220> along<00:00:25.429> the<00:00:25.490> side<00:00:25.759> here<00:00:25.789> if<00:00:26.179> it's

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:26.329 
safe to cut along the side here if it's

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.899 
safe to cut along the side here if it's
not<00:00:26.390> now<00:00:26.689> know<00:00:26.929> soon<00:00:27.140> enough<00:00:27.550> I'll<00:00:28.550> find<00:00:28.789> out

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:28.909

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.409 
not now know soon enough I'll find out
the<00:00:29.029> hard<00:00:29.119> way<00:00:29.210> I<00:00:29.329> guess<00:00:30.310> up<00:00:31.310> it<00:00:31.669> was<00:00:31.909> safe<00:00:32.180> but

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
the hard way I guess up it was safe but

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.280 
the hard way I guess up it was safe but
barely<00:00:32.840> uh-huh<00:00:33.440> how<00:00:33.830> about<00:00:33.980> that<00:00:34.160> so<00:00:35.290> let's
