the trailer I like what was said about

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.780 
the trailer I like what was said about
diving<00:01:21.689> catches<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.250> said<00:01:23.549> that

diving catches you know they said that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.399 
diving catches you know they said that
they<00:01:24.000> tried<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.299> do<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> lot<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.960> different

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
they tried to do a lot of different

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.950 
they tried to do a lot of different
variations<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> diving<00:01:26.580> catch<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.810> they

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
variations of the diving catch so they

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.630 
variations of the diving catch so they
can<00:01:28.140> attempt<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.829> know<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.220> more

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
can attempt you know to have more

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.170 
can attempt you know to have more
animation<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.869> won't<00:01:31.590> likely<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
animation so you won't likely see the

animation so you won't likely see the
same<00:01:33.540> diving<00:01:34.079> catch<00:01:34.259> over<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.770> over<00:01:34.829> again<00:01:35.040> I

as<00:01:45.720> far<00:01:46.170> as<00:01:46.290> quote<00:01:46.680> unquote<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.250> animation

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
as far as quote unquote the animation

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.240 
as far as quote unquote the animation
but<00:01:48.780> my<00:01:48.930> only<00:01:49.079> problem<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> outcome<00:01:49.920> is

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
but my only problem is the outcome is

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.149 
but my only problem is the outcome is
the<00:01:50.369> same<00:01:50.840> you<00:01:51.840> know<00:01:51.960> none<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.649> these<00:01:52.920> bull

Brady and you know Urlacher people like
that<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:03.010> know<00:03:03.040> just<00:03:03.400> some<00:03:03.730> examples<00:03:03.880> that

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
that you know just some examples that

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.020 
that you know just some examples that
even<00:03:05.530> if<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.680> can't<00:03:05.950> get<00:03:06.040> at<00:03:06.190> NFL<00:03:06.670> players

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
even if you can't get at NFL players

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.840 
even if you can't get at NFL players
maybe<00:03:07.330> ex-players<00:03:07.959> or<00:03:08.230> maybe<00:03:08.610> college<00:03:09.610> play

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
maybe ex-players or maybe college play

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.410 
maybe ex-players or maybe college play
but<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.209> needs<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.540> be<00:03:10.630> real<00:03:11.019> athletes<00:03:12.420> you

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
but it needs to be real athletes you

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.789 
but it needs to be real athletes you
know<00:03:13.450> cuz<00:03:13.780> it'll<00:03:14.019> just<00:03:14.170> make<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.500> game<00:03:14.769> a

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
know cuz it'll just make the game a

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.680 
know cuz it'll just make the game a
little<00:03:15.010> more<00:03:15.250> authentic<00:03:15.970> as<00:03:16.090> far<00:03:16.360> as<00:03:16.510> how

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
little more authentic as far as how

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.910 
little more authentic as far as how
smoothly<00:03:17.230> animation<00:03:17.920> will<00:03:18.040> come<00:03:18.220> out<00:03:18.780> also

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
smoothly animation will come out also

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.910 
smoothly animation will come out also
along<00:03:20.920> those<00:03:21.190> lines<00:03:21.549> I<00:03:22.320> think<00:03:23.320> instead<00:03:23.769> of

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
along those lines I think instead of

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.490 
along those lines I think instead of
simulating<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:25.000> outcome<00:03:25.660> like<00:03:25.959> as<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:26.320> can

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
simulating the outcome like as you can

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.900 
simulating the outcome like as you can
see<00:03:26.680> in<00:03:26.769> that<00:03:26.890> mo<00:03:27.100> cabbie<00:03:27.400> you'll<00:03:27.610> see<00:03:27.820> it

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
see in that mo cabbie you'll see it

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.020 
see in that mo cabbie you'll see it
again<00:03:28.000> in<00:03:28.269> a<00:03:28.360> minute<00:03:29.130> instead<00:03:30.130> of<00:03:30.310> just<00:03:30.640> having

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
again in a minute instead of just having

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.880 
again in a minute instead of just having
that<00:03:31.180> guy<00:03:31.480> falling<00:03:31.840> down<00:03:32.170> so<00:03:32.410> you<00:03:32.500> can<00:03:32.650> capture

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
that guy falling down so you can capture

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.449 
that guy falling down so you can capture
that<00:03:33.070> moment<00:03:34.530> what's<00:03:35.530> wrong<00:03:35.769> with<00:03:35.829> having

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
that moment what's wrong with having

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.880 
that moment what's wrong with having
them<00:03:36.579> battle<00:03:37.290> what's<00:03:38.290> wrong<00:03:38.440> with<00:03:38.500> having

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
them battle what's wrong with having

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.800 
them battle what's wrong with having

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
those two guys really battle it out in

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.050 
those two guys really battle it out in
the<00:03:40.900> trenches<00:03:41.859> like<00:03:42.040> then<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.430> see<00:03:42.640> who<00:03:42.820> win

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
the trenches like then to see who win

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.710 
the trenches like then to see who win
like<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:43.930> really<00:03:43.959> happens<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:46.209> whatever<00:03:46.600> the

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
like it really happens and whatever the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.590 
like it really happens and whatever the
outcome<00:03:46.750> is<00:03:47.140> you<00:03:47.980> capture<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:48.609> and

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
outcome is you capture that and

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.570 
outcome is you capture that and
implement<00:03:50.170> that<00:03:50.290> in<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.530> game

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
implement that in the game

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.490 
implement that in the game
and<00:03:52.060> I'll<00:03:52.180> show<00:03:52.390> you<00:03:52.420> guys<00:03:52.690> in<00:03:52.960> just<00:03:52.990> a<00:03:53.200> moment

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
and I'll show you guys in just a moment

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.560 
and I'll show you guys in just a moment
when<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.680> gets<00:03:53.800> back<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.130> mocap<00:03:54.580> right

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
when it gets back to the mocap right

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.600 
when it gets back to the mocap right
here<00:03:55.810> see<00:03:56.680> how<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:56.860> guy<00:03:57.130> this<00:03:57.190> playing

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
here see how the guy this playing

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.460 
here see how the guy this playing
defense<00:03:58.090> just<00:03:58.210> falls<00:03:58.510> down<00:03:58.810> so<00:03:59.020> they<00:03:59.140> can<00:03:59.290> get

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
defense just falls down so they can get

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.640 
defense just falls down so they can get
that<00:03:59.620> animation<00:04:01.140> what's<00:04:02.140> wrong<00:04:02.320> with<00:04:02.380> just

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
that animation what's wrong with just

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.620 
that animation what's wrong with just
letting<00:04:02.950> these<00:04:03.070> two<00:04:03.370> guys<00:04:03.610> battle<00:04:04.300> for

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
letting these two guys battle for

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.800 
letting these two guys battle for
position<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.350> see<00:04:06.010> who<00:04:06.250> wins<00:04:06.550> and<00:04:06.970> whatever

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
position and see who wins and whatever

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.290 
position and see who wins and whatever
outcome<00:04:08.320> you<00:04:08.740> get<00:04:09.010> if<00:04:09.190> you<00:04:09.250> do<00:04:09.850> that<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.030> hundred

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
outcome you get if you do that a hundred

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.690 
outcome you get if you do that a hundred
times<00:04:10.510> whatever<00:04:11.080> outcome<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:12.040> get<00:04:12.280> that

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
times whatever outcome you get that

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.289 
times whatever outcome you get that
should<00:04:13.060> be<00:04:13.300> what<00:04:14.050> is<00:04:14.200> mocap<00:04:14.740> and<00:04:15.100> put<00:04:16.030> that<00:04:16.180> in

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
should be what is mocap and put that in

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.880 
should be what is mocap and put that in
the<00:04:16.390> game<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:16.900> that's<00:04:17.080> the<00:04:17.230> way<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:17.709> can

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
the game and that's the way that you can

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.420 
the game and that's the way that you can
capture<00:04:18.330> realistic<00:04:19.330> outcomes<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:21.280> know

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
capture realistic outcomes you know

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.040 
capture realistic outcomes you know
again<00:04:21.700> you<00:04:21.910> suggest<00:04:22.270> suggestions<00:04:22.870> but<00:04:23.020> I

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
again you suggest suggestions but I

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.320 
again you suggest suggestions but I
think<00:04:23.350> they're<00:04:23.530> very<00:04:23.700> logical<00:04:24.700> and<00:04:24.730> very<00:04:25.000> easy

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
think they're very logical and very easy

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.100 
think they're very logical and very easy
suggesting<00:04:26.170> to<00:04:26.680> implement<00:04:27.600> all<00:04:28.600> right<00:04:28.810> so<00:04:28.960> let

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
suggesting to implement all right so let

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.240 
suggesting to implement all right so let
me<00:04:29.170> go<00:04:29.290> ahead<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:29.560> get<00:04:29.620> out<00:04:29.770> of<00:04:29.920> here<00:04:30.010> man<00:04:30.070> like

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
me go ahead and get out of here man like

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.770 
me go ahead and get out of here man like
always<00:04:31.110> let<00:04:32.110> me<00:04:32.230> know<00:04:32.350> what<00:04:32.440> you<00:04:32.590> think
