this<00:05:00.610> is<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:00.910> most<00:05:01.090> important<00:05:01.419> for<00:05:01.840> us<00:05:02.020> to

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
this is the most important for us to

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.170 
this is the most important for us to
look<00:05:02.740> at<00:05:02.950> market<00:05:03.280> development<00:05:03.700> because<00:05:03.940> this

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
look at market development because this

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.050

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
this is what you want to produce in this

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.620 
this is what you want to produce in this
world<00:05:08.500> so<00:05:09.040> some<00:05:09.640> biggest<00:05:09.790> market<00:05:10.390> right<00:05:10.600> now

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
world so some biggest market right now

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.140 
world so some biggest market right now
is<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.230> US<00:05:11.470> and<00:05:11.680> we<00:05:12.520> have<00:05:12.669> two<00:05:12.790> companies

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
these are the next important markets

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.010 
these are the next important markets

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
finally we have Canada Europe in Japan

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.990 
finally we have Canada Europe in Japan
so<00:05:20.800> with<00:05:21.490> this<00:05:21.520> general<00:05:22.030> idea<00:05:22.270> I<00:05:22.480> will<00:05:22.600> pass<00:05:22.870> on
