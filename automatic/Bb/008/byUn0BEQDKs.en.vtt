well as you see we're not doing a whole
lot<00:01:04.460> here<00:01:04.759> right<00:01:05.059> now<00:01:06.460> prior<00:01:07.460> to<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.970> spill

this<00:01:09.649> was<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.890> bustling<00:01:10.430> place

this was a bustling place

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.870 
this was a bustling place
production-wise<00:01:11.840> will<00:01:12.800> probably<00:01:13.460> add<00:01:13.580> about

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
production-wise will probably add about

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.200 
production-wise will probably add about
say<00:01:14.510> about<00:01:14.720> 30<00:01:15.110> percent<00:01:15.320> of<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.740> good<00:01:16.460> season

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210

that's<00:01:17.330> probably<00:01:17.780> where<00:01:18.290> we're<00:01:18.470> at<00:01:18.620> right<00:01:18.650> now

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
that's probably where we're at right now

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.660 
that's probably where we're at right now
and<00:01:19.490> that's<00:01:19.880> a<00:01:20.030> shame<00:01:20.330> now<00:01:21.010> many<00:01:22.010> industries

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
and that's a shame now many industries

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.390 
and that's a shame now many industries
would<00:01:23.060> just<00:01:23.299> fold<00:01:23.540> up<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.020> say<00:01:24.260> we're<00:01:24.950> walking

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
would just fold up and say we're walking

the nature of this of these oysters they

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.880 
the nature of this of these oysters they
grow<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.459> fast<00:03:14.690> that<00:03:15.690> their<00:03:15.870> thin<00:03:16.140> shell<00:03:16.500> and

oysters<00:03:22.410> it'll<00:03:23.220> it'll<00:03:23.459> be<00:03:23.700> preyed<00:03:24.000> on<00:03:24.030> very

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.400 
oysters it'll it'll be preyed on very
easily<00:03:24.720> by<00:03:25.079> fresh

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
easily by fresh

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.220

so<00:03:27.160> this<00:03:27.520> sorcerer<00:03:27.970> ideally<00:03:28.660> should<00:03:28.720> be<00:03:28.900> grown

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
so this sorcerer ideally should be grown

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.320 
so this sorcerer ideally should be grown
in<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.500> cage<00:03:29.740> to<00:03:30.190> protect<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.700> from<00:03:30.880> Friday's

in a cage to protect you from Friday's

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.620 
in a cage to protect you from Friday's
so<00:03:32.020> in<00:03:32.380> this<00:03:32.800> type<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.130> system<00:03:33.460> you<00:03:34.210> have<00:03:34.330> large

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
so in this type of system you have large

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.440 
so in this type of system you have large
mesh<00:03:34.990> cages<00:03:35.350> that<00:03:36.250> support<00:03:36.700> smaller<00:03:37.120> mesh

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
or the oysters through efficient methods

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.000 
or the oysters through efficient methods
and<00:03:42.940> technology<00:03:43.480> transfer<00:03:43.720> like<00:03:44.200> this<00:03:44.440> we<00:03:44.800> can

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
and technology transfer like this we can

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.370 
and technology transfer like this we can
we<00:03:45.340> can<00:03:45.580> create<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.210> lot<00:03:46.360> of<00:03:46.420> jobs<00:03:46.600> doing<00:03:47.110> this

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
we can create a lot of jobs doing this

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.780 
we can create a lot of jobs doing this
yeah<00:03:47.740> I<00:03:47.770> don't<00:03:47.950> believe<00:03:48.220> I<00:03:48.280> believe<00:03:48.520> I'm<00:03:48.640> the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
yeah I don't believe I believe I'm the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.930 
yeah I don't believe I believe I'm the
only<00:03:48.910> one<00:03:49.060> doing<00:03:49.390> it<00:03:49.510> at<00:03:49.660> it<00:03:49.750> is<00:03:49.900> time<00:03:50.880> with<00:03:51.880> a

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
only one doing it at it is time with a

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.260 
only one doing it at it is time with a
little<00:03:52.510> bit<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.720> volume<00:03:52.870> I'm<00:03:53.740> using<00:03:54.010> I<00:03:54.520> think

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
little bit of volume I'm using I think

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.920 
little bit of volume I'm using I think
hopefully<00:03:55.870> in<00:03:55.960> the<00:03:56.080> future<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:58.000> is<00:03:58.420> gonna<00:03:58.660> be

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
hopefully in the future this is gonna be

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.230 
hopefully in the future this is gonna be
a<00:03:58.960> better<00:03:59.170> way<00:03:59.410> to<00:03:59.440> grow<00:03:59.740> to<00:03:59.800> hoist<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.240> then

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
a better way to grow to hoist to then

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.610 
a better way to grow to hoist to then
when<00:04:01.360> you're<00:04:01.480> gonna<00:04:01.570> get<00:04:01.780> up<00:04:01.930> when<00:04:02.440> you<00:04:02.530> got

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
when you're gonna get up when you got

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.860 
when you're gonna get up when you got
box<00:04:03.100> or<00:04:03.340> some<00:04:03.610> hours<00:04:03.940> of<00:04:04.150> these<00:04:04.360> oysters

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
box or some hours of these oysters

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.780 
box or some hours of these oysters
there's<00:04:05.500> gonna<00:04:05.680> be<00:04:05.800> like<00:04:05.950> you<00:04:06.070> open<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.370> box<00:04:06.610> of

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
there's gonna be like you open a box of

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.730
