want to put the right parts on it so I

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.360 
want to put the right parts on it so I
don't<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.620> worry<00:00:37.920> about<00:00:38.190> things

the<00:01:12.090> SC<00:01:12.840> ten<00:01:13.580> vehicle<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.909> keep<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.780> mind

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the SC ten vehicle so keep that in mind

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.690 
the SC ten vehicle so keep that in mind
if<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.440> do<00:01:16.829> plan<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.399> these<00:01:17.490> things

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
if you do plan to what are these things

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.569 
if you do plan to what are these things
they're<00:01:18.689> quite<00:01:19.020> heavy<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:20.130> was<00:01:20.369> really

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
they're quite heavy and I was really

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.420 
they're quite heavy and I was really
kind<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.210> taken<00:01:22.079> back<00:01:22.259> at<00:01:22.530> they<00:01:22.740> not<00:01:23.070> only<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
kind of taken back at they not only the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.670 
kind of taken back at they not only the
quality<00:01:23.969> of<00:01:24.090> these<00:01:24.210> things<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:24.780> how<00:01:25.320> heavy

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
quality of these things but how heavy

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530 
quality of these things but how heavy
they<00:01:25.920> are<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.159> weighed<00:01:26.820> them<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.180> with<00:01:27.360> my

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
they are I weighed them in with my

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.810 
they are I weighed them in with my
trusty<00:01:28.079> little<00:01:28.229> scale<00:01:28.680> here<00:01:29.039> and<00:01:29.250> they're

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
trusty little scale here and they're

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.039 
trusty little scale here and they're
about<00:01:29.969> a<00:01:30.090> third<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.689> pound<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:32.479> as<00:01:33.479> we're

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
about a third of a pound so as we're

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.350 
about a third of a pound so as we're
working<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.500> project<00:01:35.310> trail<00:01:35.909> honcho<00:01:36.329> here

working on project trail honcho here
it's<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.680> very<00:01:37.890> important<00:01:38.399> to<00:01:38.490> look

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
it's going to be very important to look

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.969 
it's going to be very important to look
at<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.780> motor<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.350> everything<00:01:40.740> else<00:01:40.890> that

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
at the motor and everything else that

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.800 
at the motor and everything else that
you're<00:01:41.159> running<00:01:41.310> because<00:01:41.820> you're<00:01:42.390> turning

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
you're running because you're turning

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.050 
you're running because you're turning
some<00:01:43.020> pretty<00:01:43.229> heavy-duty<00:01:43.710> stuff<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.579> with

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
some pretty heavy-duty stuff and with

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.990 
some pretty heavy-duty stuff and with
that<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:46.079> need<00:01:46.289> heavy<00:01:47.130> duty<00:01:47.460> equipment<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
that you need heavy duty equipment to

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.420 
that you need heavy duty equipment to
turn<00:01:48.299> those<00:01:48.479> axles<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.950> best<00:01:50.159> thing<00:01:50.340> I

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
turn those axles the the best thing I

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
with these MIP spline drives so I've put

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.290 
with these MIP spline drives so I've put
one<00:03:31.750> together<00:03:32.400> I've<00:03:33.400> already<00:03:33.730> greased<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.150> up

but that's part of you know making these

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:53.220 
but that's part of you know making these
great<00:03:50.010> drive<00:03:51.010> shafts<00:03:51.310> here<00:03:51.580> so<00:03:51.880> all<00:03:52.870> in<00:03:53.110> all

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
great drive shafts here so all in all

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.110 
great drive shafts here so all in all
really<00:03:53.860> happy<00:03:54.190> with<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.489> way<00:03:54.610> these<00:03:54.790> things

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
really happy with the way these things

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.040 
really happy with the way these things
that<00:03:55.330> went<00:03:55.510> together<00:03:55.780> they<00:03:56.500> have<00:03:58.350> really<00:04:01.050> put

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
that went together they have really put

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.650 
that went together they have really put
some<00:04:02.260> time<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.680> effort<00:04:03.190> into<00:04:03.910> making<00:04:04.360> these

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
some time and effort into making these

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.530 
some time and effort into making these
so<00:04:05.220> definitely<00:04:06.220> want<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.520> throw<00:04:07.330> that<00:04:07.480> out

so definitely want to throw that out
there<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.170> here's<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:09.360> stock<00:04:10.360> drive<00:04:10.750> shaft

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
there and here's a stock drive shaft

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.850 
there and here's a stock drive shaft
from<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:12.450> scx10<00:04:13.450> now<00:04:14.260> these<00:04:14.410> are<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.680> same

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
from the scx10 now these are the same

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.099 
from the scx10 now these are the same
drive<00:04:15.160> shafts<00:04:15.430> you'll<00:04:15.700> find<00:04:15.970> on<00:04:16.120> most<00:04:16.780> all<00:04:17.080> of

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
drive shafts you'll find on most all of

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.330 
drive shafts you'll find on most all of
the<00:04:17.290> axle<00:04:17.709> vehicles

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
the axle vehicles

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.460 
the axle vehicles
you<00:04:18.760> know<00:04:18.880> they've<00:04:19.330> worked<00:04:19.510> in<00:04:19.750> some<00:04:20.109> some

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
you know they've worked in some some

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.430 
you know they've worked in some some
metal<00:04:20.739> portions<00:04:21.190> right<00:04:21.400> here<00:04:22.169> but<00:04:23.169> if<00:04:23.290> you

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
metal portions right here but if you

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.720 
metal portions right here but if you
look<00:04:23.620> into<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:24.010> drive<00:04:24.220> shafts<00:04:25.020> they<00:04:26.020> are

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
look into the drive shafts they are

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.820 
look into the drive shafts they are
hollow<00:04:27.730> if<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.300> can<00:04:28.450> see<00:04:28.690> into<00:04:28.930> there<00:04:29.140> both

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
hollow if you can see into there both

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.140 
hollow if you can see into there both
sides<00:04:30.160> all<00:04:30.640> the<00:04:30.669> way<00:04:30.790> hollow<00:04:31.560> so<00:04:32.970> that's<00:04:33.970> the

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
sides all the way hollow so that's the

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.300 
sides all the way hollow so that's the
one<00:04:34.300> thing<00:04:34.479> that<00:04:34.720> is<00:04:34.930> kind<00:04:35.560> of<00:04:35.740> controversial

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
one thing that is kind of controversial

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.610 
one thing that is kind of controversial
in<00:04:36.640> these<00:04:36.789> driveshafts<00:04:37.360> is<00:04:37.660> if<00:04:38.140> you<00:04:38.289> put<00:04:38.500> some

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
in these driveshafts is if you put some

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.660 
in these driveshafts is if you put some
good<00:04:38.800> amount<00:04:39.010> of<00:04:39.130> torque

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
good amount of torque

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.630 
good amount of torque
you<00:04:39.700> can<00:04:39.880> end<00:04:40.120> up<00:04:40.890> having<00:04:41.890> that<00:04:42.190> Center<00:04:42.610> one

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
you can end up having that Center one

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.330 
you can end up having that Center one
this<00:04:43.000> blind<00:04:43.300> one<00:04:43.510> right<00:04:43.660> here<00:04:44.020> collapse<00:04:44.770> so

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
this blind one right here collapse so

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.910 
this blind one right here collapse so
all<00:04:46.180> in<00:04:46.390> all<00:04:46.510> I<00:04:46.570> think<00:04:46.780> this<00:04:47.080> is<00:04:47.230> a<00:04:47.260> very<00:04:47.590> good

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
all in all I think this is a very good

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.490 
all in all I think this is a very good
upgrade<00:04:48.240> I'm<00:04:49.240> gonna<00:04:49.480> go<00:04:49.660> ahead<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:49.870> install

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
that's where it kind of joins on to the

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.250 
that's where it kind of joins on to the
center<00:05:22.000> transmission<00:05:22.630> right<00:05:22.810> there<00:05:23.020> that's

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
center transmission right there that's

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.830 
center transmission right there that's
the<00:05:23.410> one<00:05:23.650> side<00:05:23.920> and<00:05:24.880> there's<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.360> other<00:05:25.600> and

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
the one side and there's the other and

the one side and there's the other and
you'll<00:05:25.990> see<00:05:26.200> that<00:05:26.380> kind<00:05:26.530> of<00:05:26.650> glisten<00:05:27.220> of<00:05:27.490> the

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
you'll see that kind of glisten of the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.840 
you'll see that kind of glisten of the
grease<00:05:28.930> that<00:05:28.960> I've<00:05:29.230> applied<00:05:29.560> as<00:05:30.370> per<00:05:30.730> the

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
grease that I've applied as per the

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.630 
grease that I've applied as per the
instructions<00:05:31.590> also<00:05:32.590> those<00:05:32.830> two<00:05:32.860> little<00:05:33.280> set

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
instructions also those two little set

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.130 
instructions also those two little set
screws<00:05:33.940> that<00:05:34.090> you<00:05:34.210> see<00:05:34.390> there<00:05:34.570> there's<00:05:34.780> one<00:05:34.840> on

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
screws that you see there there's one on

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.430 
screws that you see there there's one on
the<00:05:35.230> right<00:05:35.500> side<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:37.060> then<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.690> can<00:05:38.290> actually

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
the right side and then I can actually

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.750 
the right side and then I can actually
flip<00:05:39.070> it<00:05:39.220> over<00:05:39.310> yet

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
flip it over yet

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.120 
flip it over yet
but<00:05:40.210> on<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:40.420> other<00:05:40.540> side<00:05:40.660> red<00:05:41.440> loctite<00:05:41.710> is

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
but on the other side red loctite is

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.930 
but on the other side red loctite is
definitely<00:05:42.550> needed<00:05:42.880> to<00:05:43.090> get<00:05:43.840> those<00:05:43.990> things

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
definitely needed to get those things

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.670 
definitely needed to get those things
perfectly<00:05:45.940> snug<00:05:46.230> I'm<00:05:47.230> gonna<00:05:47.380> go<00:05:47.470> ahead<00:05:47.530> and

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
perfectly snug I'm gonna go ahead and

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.820 
perfectly snug I'm gonna go ahead and
drop<00:05:47.860> down<00:05:47.890> here<00:05:48.100> see<00:05:48.580> this<00:05:48.730> and<00:05:48.970> see<00:05:49.120> where<00:05:49.300> it

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
drop down here see this and see where it

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:56.190 
drop down here see this and see where it
drops<00:05:50.830> on<00:05:51.010> to<00:05:51.370> the<00:05:51.640> rear<00:05:53.370> differential<00:05:55.200> and

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
drops on to the rear differential and

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.170 
drops on to the rear differential and
once<00:05:56.440> again<00:05:56.770> you<00:05:56.920> know<00:05:57.040> definitely<00:05:57.400> a<00:05:57.700> beefy

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
once again you know definitely a beefy

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.370 
once again you know definitely a beefy
setup<00:05:58.600> it's<00:05:59.260> a<00:05:59.590> solid<00:06:00.250> steel<00:06:00.640> and<00:06:01.120> I<00:06:01.870> don't

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
setup it's a solid steel and I don't

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.110 
setup it's a solid steel and I don't
think<00:06:02.530> these<00:06:02.860> things<00:06:02.920> are<00:06:03.250> gonna<00:06:03.370> go<00:06:03.640> anywhere

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
think these things are gonna go anywhere

I'm<00:06:04.900> gonna<00:06:05.020> go<00:06:05.110> ahead<00:06:05.170> and<00:06:05.260> pan<00:06:05.530> over<00:06:05.830> here<00:06:06.040> to

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
I'm gonna go ahead and pan over here to

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.990 
I'm gonna go ahead and pan over here to
the<00:06:06.610> front<00:06:07.570> drive<00:06:08.110> shaft<00:06:08.490> going<00:06:09.490> up<00:06:09.610> to<00:06:09.820> the

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
the front drive shaft going up to the

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.390 
the front drive shaft going up to the
front<00:06:10.360> differential<00:06:10.890> you'll<00:06:11.890> see<00:06:12.070> that<00:06:12.190> there

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
front differential you'll see that there

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.030 
front differential you'll see that there
as<00:06:12.490> well<00:06:12.730> and<00:06:13.120> then<00:06:14.020> I'm<00:06:14.530> gonna<00:06:14.680> go<00:06:14.830> ahead<00:06:14.860> and

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
will see some of the articulation of

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.360 
will see some of the articulation of
