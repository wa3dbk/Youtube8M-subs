most standard chorus pedals now here's a

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.759 
most standard chorus pedals now here's a
little<00:03:13.280> bit<00:03:13.370> of<00:03:13.489> technical<00:03:14.060> information

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
little bit of technical information

little bit of technical information
chorus<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:16.010> chorus<00:03:16.400> effect<00:03:16.700> is<00:03:16.879> achieved<00:03:17.299> by

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
chorus a chorus effect is achieved by

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.899 
chorus a chorus effect is achieved by
incorporating<00:03:20.329> a<00:03:20.840> very<00:03:21.079> short<00:03:21.500> delay<00:03:22.430> and

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
incorporating a very short delay and

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.149 
incorporating a very short delay and
mixing<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:23.659> delayed<00:03:24.079> signal<00:03:24.349> with<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.859> dry

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
mixing that delayed signal with the dry

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.459 
mixing that delayed signal with the dry
guitar<00:03:25.549> sound<00:03:25.879> and<00:03:26.090> then<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.750> that<00:03:27.260> is

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:27.469 
guitar sound and then that that is

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.879 
guitar sound and then that that is
modulated<00:03:28.280> by<00:03:28.430> an<00:03:28.549> LFO<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:29.689> there<00:03:30.530> there's

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
modulated by an LFO so there there's

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.520 
modulated by an LFO so there there's
movement<00:03:31.280> in<00:03:31.669> the<00:03:31.730> in<00:03:32.629> the<00:03:32.840> delayed<00:03:33.199> signal

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
movement in the in the delayed signal

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.860 
movement in the in the delayed signal
and<00:03:33.919> together<00:03:34.639> with<00:03:34.879> that<00:03:35.000> dry<00:03:35.299> signal<00:03:35.599> it

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
and together with that dry signal it

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.899 
and together with that dry signal it
creates<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.409> you<00:03:36.919> know<00:03:37.040> like<00:03:37.219> that<00:03:37.579> really

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
creates that you know like that really

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.899 
creates that you know like that really
nice<00:03:38.120> 80s<00:03:39.079> kind<00:03:39.319> of<00:03:39.530> chorus<00:03:39.889> effect<00:03:40.250> this<00:03:40.730> is

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
nice 80s kind of chorus effect this is

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.300 
nice 80s kind of chorus effect this is
an<00:03:41.030> analog<00:03:41.419> digital<00:03:41.750> hybrid<00:03:42.500> chorus<00:03:42.919> pedal

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
an analog digital hybrid chorus pedal

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.490 
an analog digital hybrid chorus pedal
and<00:03:43.459> at<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.329> heart<00:03:44.540> of<00:03:44.629> this<00:03:44.780> pedal<00:03:45.019> is<00:03:45.169> a<00:03:45.290> very

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
and at the heart of this pedal is a very

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.399 
and at the heart of this pedal is a very
short<00:03:45.829> digital<00:03:46.280> delay<00:03:46.579> line<00:03:46.819> and<00:03:47.139> let<00:03:48.139> me<00:03:48.199> just

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
short digital delay line and let me just

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.039 
short digital delay line and let me just
show<00:03:49.219> you<00:03:49.250> how<00:03:49.909> the<00:03:49.969> controls<00:03:50.449> work<00:03:50.689> on<00:03:50.900> this

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
show you how the controls work on this

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.509 
show you how the controls work on this
pedal<00:03:51.379> basically<00:03:51.769> you<00:03:51.889> should<00:03:51.919> look<00:03:52.250> at<00:03:52.400> it

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
pedal basically you should look at it

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.349 
pedal basically you should look at it
like<00:03:52.699> this<00:03:52.939> these<00:03:53.359> three<00:03:53.780> controls<00:03:55.359> intensity

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
like this these three controls intensity

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.159 
like this these three controls intensity
animate<00:03:56.989> and<00:03:57.169> dimension<00:03:57.829> function<00:03:58.729> as<00:03:58.879> a

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
animate and dimension function as a

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.899 
animate and dimension function as a
basically<00:04:00.169> kind<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.739> like<00:04:00.889> a<00:04:00.949> delay<00:04:01.489> pedal

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
basically kind of like a delay pedal

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.670 
basically kind of like a delay pedal
with<00:04:02.389> a<00:04:02.419> very<00:04:02.840> very<00:04:03.169> short<00:04:03.590> delay<00:04:03.909> and<00:04:04.909> then

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
with a very very short delay and then

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.259 
with a very very short delay and then
intensity<00:04:06.680> is<00:04:06.799> the<00:04:06.949> mix<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:07.549> dimension<00:04:08.120> and

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
intensity is the mix and dimension and

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.490 
intensity is the mix and dimension and
animate<00:04:08.750> control<00:04:09.229> the<00:04:09.439> feedback<00:04:10.269> and<00:04:11.500> the

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
animate control the feedback and the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.129 
animate control the feedback and the
delay<00:04:12.829> time<00:04:13.099> respectively<00:04:13.849> and<00:04:14.180> then<00:04:14.720> these

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
delay time respectively and then these

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.349 
delay time respectively and then these
three<00:04:15.530> controls<00:04:15.979> are<00:04:16.250> pretty<00:04:16.280> standard<00:04:16.880> on

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
three controls are pretty standard on

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.710 
three controls are pretty standard on
chorus<00:04:18.019> pedal<00:04:18.320> rate<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:18.829> depth<00:04:19.519> so<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.419> speed

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
chorus pedal rate and depth so the speed

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.020 
chorus pedal rate and depth so the speed
of<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:20.959> effect<00:04:21.349> and<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.739> intense<00:04:22.190> intensity

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
of the effect and the intense intensity

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.610 
of the effect and the intense intensity
of<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.270> effect<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.690> depth<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.320> chorus

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
of the effect the depth of the chorus

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.310 
of the effect the depth of the chorus
effect<00:04:24.919> and<00:04:25.099> then<00:04:25.580> this<00:04:25.789> shape<00:04:26.150> dial<00:04:26.570> allows

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
effect and then this shape dial allows

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.290 
effect and then this shape dial allows
you<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.620> go<00:04:27.770> from<00:04:27.979> a<00:04:28.190> regular<00:04:28.669> sine<00:04:29.030> wave

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
you to go from a regular sine wave

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.430 
you to go from a regular sine wave
chorus<00:04:29.919> via<00:04:30.919> a<00:04:31.099> triangle<00:04:32.030> wave<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.719> square

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
chorus via a triangle wave to a square

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.260 
chorus via a triangle wave to a square
wave<00:04:33.620> which<00:04:33.830> sounds<00:04:34.159> very<00:04:34.280> trickier<00:04:34.789> than<00:04:35.090> in

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
wave which sounds very trickier than in

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.390 
wave which sounds very trickier than in
the<00:04:35.389> last<00:04:35.539> example<00:04:36.139> that<00:04:36.259> I<00:04:36.289> just<00:04:36.590> played<00:04:36.889> so

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
the last example that I just played so

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.830 
the last example that I just played so
if<00:04:37.490> you<00:04:37.610> look<00:04:37.759> at<00:04:37.880> it<00:04:37.969> like<00:04:38.120> that<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.539> becomes

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
if you look at it like that it becomes

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.050 
if you look at it like that it becomes
less<00:04:39.050> intimidating<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:39.949> less<00:04:40.130> scary<00:04:40.520> pedal<00:04:40.909> to

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
less intimidating a less scary pedal to

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.420 
less intimidating a less scary pedal to
use<00:04:41.270> this<00:04:41.900> pedal<00:04:42.229> really<00:04:42.409> likes<00:04:42.740> dirt<00:04:43.070> pedals

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
use this pedal really likes dirt pedals

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.890 
use this pedal really likes dirt pedals
in<00:04:43.550> front<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:43.880> it<00:04:44.000> but<00:04:44.120> it's<00:04:44.240> also<00:04:44.389> very<00:04:44.509> nice

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
in front of it but it's also very nice

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.070 
in front of it but it's also very nice
in<00:04:45.889> front<00:04:46.190> of<00:04:46.310> clean<00:04:46.849> or<00:04:47.030> a<00:04:47.150> crunchy<00:04:47.599> amplifier

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
in front of clean or a crunchy amplifier

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.899 
in front of clean or a crunchy amplifier
and<00:04:48.349> I'll<00:04:48.710> just<00:04:48.919> go<00:04:49.099> ahead<00:04:49.219> and<00:04:49.460> let<00:04:49.610> you<00:04:49.639> hear

and I'll just go ahead and let you hear
some<00:04:49.940> more<00:04:50.270> sounds<00:04:50.719> next<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.080> let<00:04:51.199> you<00:04:51.349> hear

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
some more sounds next to let you hear

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.420 
some more sounds next to let you hear
how<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:51.680> can<00:04:51.800> go<00:04:51.919> from<00:04:52.070> a<00:04:52.219> pretty

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
how you can go from a pretty

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.430 
how you can go from a pretty
straightforward<00:04:52.759> chorus<00:04:53.419> sound<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:54.139> sound

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
straightforward chorus sound to sound

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.649 
straightforward chorus sound to sound
that<00:04:54.590> sounds<00:04:54.800> much<00:04:55.010> like<00:04:55.039> there<00:04:55.430> is<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.659> spring

that sounds much like there is a spring
reverb

00:04:57.739 --> 00:04:57.749

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:00.079

or a very drippy sounding reverb with
chorus<00:05:00.449> mixed<00:05:00.809> in<00:05:00.929> going<00:05:01.229> on<00:05:01.379> and<00:05:01.709> that<00:05:01.830> is

chorus mixed in going on and that is

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.039 
chorus mixed in going on and that is
possible<00:05:02.429> due<00:05:02.639> to<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:02.939> longer<00:05:03.299> delay<00:05:03.749> time

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:04.049 
possible due to the longer delay time

00:05:04.049 --> 00:05:06.049 
possible due to the longer delay time
that<00:05:04.319> the<00:05:04.469> see<00:05:04.649> machine<00:05:04.889> offers<00:05:05.129> over<00:05:05.580> over

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:07.939 
that the see machine offers over over
many<00:05:06.239> chorus<00:05:06.629> pedals<00:05:06.989> and<00:05:07.199> together<00:05:07.739> with<00:05:07.919> a

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
high dimension setting so a longer delay

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.079 
high dimension setting so a longer delay

time with more repeats is going to

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.479 
time with more repeats is going to
result<00:05:12.449> in<00:05:12.599> a<00:05:12.719> very<00:05:13.079> quick<00:05:13.379> almost<00:05:13.709> reverb

what's really cool about Earthquaker is

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.140 
what's really cool about Earthquaker is
that<00:06:06.710> they<00:06:06.830> not<00:06:07.009> only<00:06:07.039> make<00:06:07.310> these<00:06:07.669> really

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
that they not only make these really

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.029 
that they not only make these really
wonderful<00:06:08.300> fuzzies<00:06:09.080> but<00:06:09.469> whenever<00:06:09.650> they<00:06:09.889> do<00:06:10.009> a

wonderful fuzzies but whenever they do a

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.129 
wonderful fuzzies but whenever they do a
