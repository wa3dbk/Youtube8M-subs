and<00:00:13.349> this<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.860> hardware<00:00:14.130> tour<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.790> new

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
and this is the hardware tour of the new

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.140 
and this is the hardware tour of the new
AT&amp;T<00:00:15.450> pantech<00:00:15.990> matrix<00:00:16.890> Pro<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:18.090> is

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
AT&amp;T pantech matrix Pro this is

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.730 
AT&amp;T pantech matrix Pro this is
basically<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.840> successor<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.710> original

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
basically the successor to the original

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.130 
basically the successor to the original
pantech<00:00:20.640> duo<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.180> we're<00:00:21.600> gonna<00:00:21.689> take<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> look

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
pantech duo and we're gonna take a look

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.420 
pantech duo and we're gonna take a look
at<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.619> compare<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.039> with<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> new

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
at that and compare it with the new

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.609 
at that and compare it with the new
version<00:00:23.660> soon<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.109> reason<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.439> they

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
version soon now the reason that they

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.290 
version soon now the reason that they
called<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> matrix<00:00:26.460> probe<00:00:26.820> was<00:00:27.029> because

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
called it the matrix probe was because

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.630 
called it the matrix probe was because
the<00:00:27.449> matrix<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:28.109> kind<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.830> non<00:00:29.039> smartphone

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
the matrix is kind of a non smartphone

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.640 
the matrix is kind of a non smartphone
version<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
version of this so this is the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.020 
version of this so this is the
smartphone<00:00:31.920> version<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.520> matrix<00:00:32.880> they

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
smartphone version of the matrix they

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.209 
smartphone version of the matrix they
call<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.360> pro<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.500> that's<00:00:34.710> that's<00:00:35.040> where

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
call it the pro so that's that's where

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.920 
call it the pro so that's that's where
the<00:00:35.309> name<00:00:35.460> comes<00:00:35.670> from<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.360> let's<00:00:36.480> take<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> look

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
the name comes from so let's take a look

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.840 
the name comes from so let's take a look
at<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> device<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.620> very<00:00:37.860> rounded<00:00:38.340> edges<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
at the device it is very rounded edges a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.880 
at the device it is very rounded edges a
total<00:00:39.480> fingerprint<00:00:40.020> magnet<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.500> front<00:00:40.770> in

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
total fingerprint magnet on the front in

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.410 
total fingerprint magnet on the front in
fact<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.309> haven't<00:00:41.610> even<00:00:41.730> touched<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.210> screen

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
fact I haven't even touched the screen

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.779 
fact I haven't even touched the screen
yet<00:00:42.920> within<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.980> last<00:00:44.129> few<00:00:44.370> minutes<00:00:44.430> because

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
yet within the last few minutes because

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.580 
yet within the last few minutes because
if<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.059> did<00:00:45.270> look<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:45.750> would<00:00:45.840> happen<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.500> would

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
if I did look what would happen it would

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.310 
if I did look what would happen it would
get<00:00:46.680> lots<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.160> fingerprints<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.989> in<00:00:48.989> hand

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
get lots of fingerprints on it in hand

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.220 
get lots of fingerprints on it in hand
it<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.620> very<00:00:49.920> very<00:00:50.340> very<00:00:50.700> thick<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.719> fact<00:00:51.960> it's

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
it is very very very thick in fact it's

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.569 
it is very very very thick in fact it's
as<00:00:52.440> thick<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> stack<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.579> 13<00:00:54.120> quarters<00:00:55.579> to

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
as thick as a stack of 13 quarters to

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.310 
as thick as a stack of 13 quarters to
give<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.940> an<00:00:57.030> idea<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.300> exactly<00:00:57.420> how<00:00:57.899> thick<00:00:58.199> it

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
give you an idea of exactly how thick it

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.010 
give you an idea of exactly how thick it
is<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.859> thicker<00:00:59.160> than<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.640> 18<00:01:00.059> t<00:01:00.239> tilt<00:01:00.570> which

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
is it's thicker than the 18 t tilt which

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.560 
is it's thicker than the 18 t tilt which
is<00:01:01.140> also<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> Titan<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.149> just<00:01:03.149> trust<00:01:03.359> me<00:01:03.449> when

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
is also the Titan to just trust me when

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.420 
is also the Titan to just trust me when
I<00:01:03.600> say<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.170> quite<00:01:04.409> thick<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:04.860> let's<00:01:05.220> take<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
I say it is quite thick so let's take a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.649 
I say it is quite thick so let's take a
look<00:01:05.610> at<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.729> rest<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.090> device<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
look at the rest of the device we have a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.560 
look at the rest of the device we have a
2.4<00:01:07.409> inch<00:01:07.530> diagonal<00:01:08.070> screen<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:08.760> QVGA

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
2.4 inch diagonal screen with QVGA

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.320 
2.4 inch diagonal screen with QVGA
resolution<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.409> that's<00:01:10.560> 240<00:01:10.950> across<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.520> 320

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
resolution so that's 240 across and 320

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.890 
resolution so that's 240 across and 320
down<00:01:12.510> we<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> speaker<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.900> going

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
down we have the speaker here and going

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.870 
down we have the speaker here and going
down<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.590> much<00:01:17.070> larger<00:01:17.280> d-pad

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
down here we have a much larger d-pad

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.399 
down here we have a much larger d-pad
than<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.119> found<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> original<00:01:18.780> pantech

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
than we found on the original pantech

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.140 
than we found on the original pantech
duo<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.860> you'll<00:01:19.950> see<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> minute<00:01:20.490> we

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
duo and you'll see that in a minute we

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.690 
duo and you'll see that in a minute we
also<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> soft<00:01:22.500> key<00:01:22.740> menu<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.430> here

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
also have a soft key menu here and here

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700 
also have a soft key menu here and here
we<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> home<00:01:24.479> button<00:01:24.810> here<00:01:25.170> which<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.439> kind

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
we have a home button here which is kind

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.859 
we have a home button here which is kind
of<00:01:25.799> flat<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.240> easy<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.570> miss

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
of flat and it's really easy to miss

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.240 
of flat and it's really easy to miss
this<00:01:28.020> button<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.470> accidentally<00:01:29.040> hit<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
this button and accidentally hit the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.679 
this button and accidentally hit the
button<00:01:29.579> above<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.970> because<00:01:30.240> they're<00:01:30.420> kind<00:01:30.600> of

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
button above it because they're kind of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.350 
button above it because they're kind of
on<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.560> same<00:01:31.829> level<00:01:32.130> there<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.270> have

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
on the same level there and then we have

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.300 
on the same level there and then we have
a<00:01:33.390> call<00:01:33.600> start<00:01:33.960> call<00:01:34.200> end<00:01:34.439> button<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.920> then

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.420 
devices if we slide out the first slider
we<00:01:42.119> get<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.750> nice-looking<00:01:43.100> keypad<00:01:44.100> but

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
we get a really nice-looking keypad but

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.179 
we get a really nice-looking keypad but
unfortunately<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.600> totally<00:01:46.470> flat<00:01:46.770> meaning

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
unfortunately it is totally flat meaning

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.639 
unfortunately it is totally flat meaning
if<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.939> rub<00:01:48.119> my<00:01:48.240> finger<00:01:48.540> against<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.530> only

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
if I rub my finger against this the only

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.760 
if I rub my finger against this the only
thing<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.100> feel<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.579> are<00:01:51.270> these<00:01:52.200> lines<00:01:52.500> here

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
thing I can feel is are these lines here

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.499 
thing I can feel is are these lines here
that<00:01:52.829> differentiate<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> rows<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.180> can't

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
that differentiate the rows so I can't

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.060 
that differentiate the rows so I can't
dial<00:01:54.930> without<00:01:55.290> actually<00:01:55.680> looking<00:01:55.890> at<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
dial without actually looking at the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.039 
dial without actually looking at the
keypad<00:01:56.430> which<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> shame

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
keypad which is a shame

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.020 
keypad which is a shame
this<00:01:58.380> whole<00:01:58.530> keypad<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.070> backlit<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.790> when<00:01:59.939> you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
this whole keypad is backlit so when you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.530 
this whole keypad is backlit so when you
type<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:00.960> dark<00:02:01.290> out<00:02:02.180> or<00:02:03.180> actually

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
type on it and it's dark out or actually

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.700 
type on it and it's dark out or actually
doesn't<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> light<00:02:04.020> sensor<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.500> when<00:02:04.530> you

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
doesn't have a light sensor so when you

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.440 
doesn't have a light sensor so when you
type<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.219> anytime<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.850> light<00:02:06.000> will<00:02:06.149> go<00:02:06.270> on

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
type on it anytime the light will go on

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.419 
type on it anytime the light will go on
something<00:02:07.259> that's<00:02:07.530> kind<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.920> weird<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.340> this

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
something that's kind of weird and this

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.190 
something that's kind of weird and this
is<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> note<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:08.819> usability<00:02:09.539> because<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
is a note on usability because the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.110 
is a note on usability because the
device<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.069> thick<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.700> there's<00:02:11.910> such<00:02:12.090> a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
device is so thick and there's such a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.120 
device is so thick and there's such a
large<00:02:12.360> distance<00:02:12.599> from

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
large distance from

large distance from
this<00:02:13.250> area<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.240> area<00:02:14.540> it's<00:02:14.990> quite

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
this area to this area it's quite

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
this area to this area it's quite
awkward<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:16.480> use<00:02:17.480> both<00:02:17.840> both<00:02:18.620> this<00:02:18.890> area<00:02:19.220> in

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
awkward to use both both this area in

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.740 
awkward to use both both this area in
this<00:02:19.460> area<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.820> control<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.300> phone<00:02:20.510> because

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
this area to control the phone because

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.540 
this area to control the phone because
you're<00:02:21.050> going<00:02:21.350> down<00:02:21.500> such<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.800> far<00:02:22.130> distance

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
you're going down such a far distance

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.890 
you're going down such a far distance
it's<00:02:22.700> kind<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:22.940> uncomfortable<00:02:23.240> for<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.720> thumb

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
it's kind of uncomfortable for the thumb

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.480 
it's kind of uncomfortable for the thumb
and<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.470> imagine<00:02:24.770> that<00:02:24.890> people<00:02:24.980> with<00:02:25.220> large

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
and I imagine that people with large

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.160 
and I imagine that people with large
thumbs<00:02:25.790> may<00:02:26.000> find<00:02:26.240> this<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.510> be<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.810> bigger

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
thumbs may find this to be a bigger

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.660 
thumbs may find this to be a bigger
problem<00:02:27.440> than<00:02:27.620> people<00:02:27.980> with<00:02:28.070> average<00:02:28.220> sized

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
problem than people with average sized

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.290 
problem than people with average sized
hands<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:29.900> we<00:02:29.990> have<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.110> microphone<00:02:30.410> down<00:02:30.800> here

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
hands so we have a microphone down here

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.420 
hands so we have a microphone down here
and<00:02:32.300> also<00:02:32.540> notice<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.860> buttons<00:02:34.250> are

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
and also notice that the buttons are

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.830 
and also notice that the buttons are
covered<00:02:34.760> with<00:02:34.850> a<00:02:34.880> metallic<00:02:35.330> finish<00:02:35.510> which

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
covered with a metallic finish which

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.920 
covered with a metallic finish which
will<00:02:35.990> also<00:02:36.080> pick<00:02:36.710> up<00:02:36.800> fingerprints<00:02:37.420> on<00:02:38.420> the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
will also pick up fingerprints on the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.480 
will also pick up fingerprints on the
left<00:02:39.260> side<00:02:39.440> we<00:02:39.650> have<00:02:39.740> a<00:02:39.770> volume<00:02:39.800> up<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.460> down

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
left side we have a volume up and down

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.490 
left side we have a volume up and down
rocker<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.180> then<00:02:41.930> we<00:02:42.050> have<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.230> record

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
rocker and then we have the record

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.350 
rocker and then we have the record
button<00:02:42.800> which<00:02:43.040> will<00:02:43.250> bring<00:02:43.400> up<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:44.030> quick

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
button which will bring up the the quick

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.790 
button which will bring up the the quick
list<00:02:44.630> that<00:02:45.140> will<00:02:45.290> allow<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.590> switch

profiles<00:02:46.460> let's<00:02:47.240> take<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.420> look<00:02:47.600> at<00:02:47.690> the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
profiles let's take a look at the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.660 
profiles let's take a look at the
keyboard<00:02:47.930> actually<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.710> this<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.370> actually

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
keyboard actually and this is actually

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.920 
keyboard actually and this is actually
one<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:49.940> bright<00:02:50.150> points<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:50.630> device

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
one of the bright points of this device

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.830 
one of the bright points of this device
is<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.110> keyboard<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.760> tactile<00:02:53.180> feedback<00:02:53.480> on

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
is the keyboard the tactile feedback on

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.350 
is the keyboard the tactile feedback on
these<00:02:53.990> buttons<00:02:54.320> are<00:02:54.500> fantastic<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.490> was<00:02:56.240> able

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
these buttons are fantastic I was able

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.400 
these buttons are fantastic I was able
to<00:02:56.510> type<00:02:56.660> quite<00:02:56.990> fast

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
to type quite fast

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.200 
to type quite fast
the<00:02:57.650> worst<00:02:58.400> part<00:02:58.640> about<00:02:58.670> this<00:02:58.880> keyboard<00:02:59.030> is

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
the worst part about this keyboard is

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.540 
the worst part about this keyboard is
that<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.510> spacebar<00:02:59.960> is<00:03:00.200> in<00:03:00.440> line<00:03:00.740> with<00:03:01.070> the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
that the spacebar is in line with the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.610 
that the spacebar is in line with the
letters<00:03:01.970> between<00:03:02.240> you<00:03:02.750> know<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.990> V<00:03:03.170> key<00:03:03.410> and

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
letters between you know the V key and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.170 
letters between you know the V key and
the<00:03:03.680> B<00:03:03.860> key<00:03:04.070> so<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.520> takes<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.790> lot<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:04.970> getting

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
the B key so it takes a lot of getting

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.820 
the B key so it takes a lot of getting
used<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.510> but<00:03:05.690> once<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:06.050> do<00:03:06.230> get<00:03:06.380> used<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.740> it

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
used to but once you do get used to it

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.070 
used to but once you do get used to it
it's<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.820> really<00:03:08.030> good<00:03:08.240> keyboard<00:03:08.450> surprisingly

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
it's a really good keyboard surprisingly

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.890 
it's a really good keyboard surprisingly
and<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.830> soft<00:03:10.070> keys<00:03:10.310> are<00:03:10.520> here<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.120> here<00:03:11.510> so

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
and the soft keys are here and here so

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.270 
and the soft keys are here and here so
they're<00:03:12.320> kind<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.560> within<00:03:12.710> reach<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.070> your

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
they're kind of within reach of your

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.680 
they're kind of within reach of your
thumbs<00:03:13.580> when<00:03:13.790> you're<00:03:13.910> typing<00:03:14.060> along<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:14.630> you

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
thumbs when you're typing along so you

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.030 
thumbs when you're typing along so you

something<00:03:16.970> that<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:17.210> really<00:03:17.450> like<00:03:17.660> about<00:03:17.690> this

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
something that I really like about this

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.810 
something that I really like about this
device<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.320> that<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.740> screen<00:03:19.010> is<00:03:19.250> perfectly

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
device is that the screen is perfectly

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.480 
device is that the screen is perfectly
centered<00:03:20.330> on<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:21.080> keyboard<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.070> looks

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
centered on the keyboard so it looks

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.950 
centered on the keyboard so it looks
really<00:03:22.730> nice<00:03:22.970> when<00:03:23.210> you're<00:03:23.330> typing<00:03:23.540> with<00:03:23.810> it

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
really nice when you're typing with it

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.990 
really nice when you're typing with it
it<00:03:24.770> looks<00:03:25.010> like<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.250> screen<00:03:25.520> is<00:03:25.730> where<00:03:25.910> it

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
it looks like the screen is where it

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.510 
it looks like the screen is where it
should<00:03:26.210> be<00:03:26.590> okay<00:03:27.590> let's<00:03:27.800> go<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.220> bottom

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
should be okay let's go to the bottom

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.790 
should be okay let's go to the bottom
here<00:03:28.700> here<00:03:29.120> we<00:03:29.240> have<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.450> micro<00:03:29.780> SD<00:03:30.230> slot<00:03:30.530> so

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
here here we have the micro SD slot so

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.470 
here here we have the micro SD slot so
good<00:03:31.040> thing<00:03:31.190> it's<00:03:31.310> external<00:03:31.820> meaning<00:03:32.390> that

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
good thing it's external meaning that

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.440 
good thing it's external meaning that
you<00:03:32.600> can<00:03:32.780> take<00:03:33.620> out<00:03:33.740> your<00:03:33.770> your<00:03:34.580> micro<00:03:34.910> SD<00:03:35.180> card

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
you can take out your your micro SD card

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.200 
you can take out your your micro SD card
while<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.110> phone<00:03:36.290> is<00:03:36.440> on<00:03:36.790> or<00:03:37.790> over<00:03:37.880> on<00:03:38.090> the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
while the phone is on or over on the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.540 
while the phone is on or over on the
other<00:03:38.240> side<00:03:38.390> we<00:03:38.720> have<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:39.070> camera<00:03:40.070> button<00:03:40.250> for

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
other side we have the camera button for

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.820 
other side we have the camera button for
the<00:03:40.610> 2<00:03:40.790> megapixel<00:03:41.360> camera<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:41.840> then<00:03:42.470> we<00:03:42.620> have

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
the 2 megapixel camera and then we have

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.880 
the 2 megapixel camera and then we have
a<00:03:43.100> flat<00:03:43.459> for<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:44.290> proprietary<00:03:45.290> Jack<00:03:45.620> and

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
a flat for the proprietary Jack and

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.130 
a flat for the proprietary Jack and
pentek's<00:03:46.490> jacks<00:03:46.910> are<00:03:47.209> really<00:03:47.540> difficult<00:03:47.780> to

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
pentek's jacks are really difficult to

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.460 
pentek's jacks are really difficult to
use<00:03:48.170> so<00:03:48.860> here<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.670> USB<00:03:49.970> cable<00:03:50.360> it's<00:03:50.990> thick

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
use so here is the USB cable it's thick

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.440 
use so here is the USB cable it's thick
and<00:03:51.680> cumbersome<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:52.880> have<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.240> line<00:03:53.420> it

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
and cumbersome and you have to line it

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.740 
and cumbersome and you have to line it
up<00:03:53.780> just<00:03:54.020> right<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:56.000> got<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.240> jiggle<00:03:56.480> it

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
up just right and you got to jiggle it

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.280 
up just right and you got to jiggle it
and<00:03:56.900> sometimes<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:57.740> just<00:03:58.310> doesn't<00:03:59.200> want<00:04:00.200> to

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
and sometimes it just doesn't want to

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.470 
and sometimes it just doesn't want to
get<00:04:00.410> in<00:04:00.560> there<00:04:00.709> unlike<00:04:01.040> micro<00:04:01.459> USB<00:04:01.970> which<00:04:02.240> just

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
get in there unlike micro USB which just

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.410 
get in there unlike micro USB which just
goes<00:04:02.630> right<00:04:02.840> in<00:04:03.580> so<00:04:04.580> perhaps<00:04:05.000> I<00:04:05.240> have<00:04:05.360> this

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
goes right in so perhaps I have this

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.580 
goes right in so perhaps I have this
upside<00:04:05.750> down<00:04:05.780> although<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.230> arrows<00:04:06.440> on<00:04:06.530> the

top see what I mean it's not it's not

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.120

very<00:04:08.120> easy<00:04:08.360> to<00:04:08.600> use<00:04:08.780> unfortunately<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:09.860> on

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
very easy to use unfortunately and on

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.400 
very easy to use unfortunately and on
the<00:04:10.250> top<00:04:10.459> there<00:04:10.760> is<00:04:10.880> nothing<00:04:11.270> on<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.930> back<00:04:12.140> we

the top there is nothing on the back we

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.160 
the top there is nothing on the back we
can<00:04:12.560> see<00:04:12.740> this<00:04:12.890> kind<00:04:13.130> of<00:04:13.190> greenish<00:04:13.490> blue<00:04:14.170> color

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
can see this kind of greenish blue color

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.479 
can see this kind of greenish blue color
to<00:04:15.410> it<00:04:15.530> which<00:04:15.680> is<00:04:15.770> kind<00:04:15.950> of<00:04:15.980> interesting<00:04:16.160> it's

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
to it which is kind of interesting it's

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.430 
to it which is kind of interesting it's
got<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.640> metallic<00:04:16.820> finish<00:04:17.420> to<00:04:17.600> it<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.140> shines

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
got a metallic finish to it so it shines

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.190

comes with this which is made to look

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.879 
comes with this which is made to look
like<00:04:36.950> suede<00:04:37.340> but<00:04:37.370> it's<00:04:37.610> actually<00:04:37.940> just<00:04:38.120> fabric

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
like suede but it's actually just fabric

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.620 
like suede but it's actually just fabric
it<00:04:39.889> fits<00:04:40.250> well<00:04:40.550> but<00:04:40.940> it<00:04:41.060> adds<00:04:41.240> even<00:04:41.450> more

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
it fits well but it adds even more

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.390 
it fits well but it adds even more

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
extremely thick though if you're worried

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.020 
extremely thick though if you're worried

matrix Pro it may be a good idea to use
this<00:04:49.630> alright<00:04:50.630> and<00:04:50.690> so<00:04:50.840> let's<00:04:51.020> compare<00:04:51.290> the

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
thing that you'll probably have noticed

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.650 
thing that you'll probably have noticed
by<00:04:57.800> now<00:04:57.830> is<00:04:58.130> that<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.639> the<00:04:58.880> new<00:04:59.060> version<00:04:59.450> looks

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
by now is that the the new version looks

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.800 
by now is that the the new version looks
much<00:04:59.990> more<00:05:00.290> high<00:05:00.530> quality<00:05:01.600> much<00:05:02.600> more

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
much more high quality much more

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.330 
much more high quality much more
aesthetically<00:05:03.229> pleasing<00:05:03.380> than<00:05:03.889> the<00:05:03.979> previous

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
aesthetically pleasing than the previous

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.800 
aesthetically pleasing than the previous
version<00:05:04.700> which<00:05:04.790> had<00:05:05.000> this<00:05:05.120> kind<00:05:05.360> of<00:05:05.389> dimpled

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
version which had this kind of dimpled

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.600 
version which had this kind of dimpled
pattern<00:05:06.200> around<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.500> screen<00:05:06.830> and<00:05:07.040> you<00:05:07.460> can

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
pattern around the screen and you can

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.960 
pattern around the screen and you can
tell<00:05:07.790> but<00:05:07.970> after<00:05:08.240> a<00:05:08.270> little<00:05:08.540> bit<00:05:08.660> of<00:05:08.750> use<00:05:08.900> dust

of<00:05:12.350> bad<00:05:12.560> build<00:05:12.830> quality<00:05:13.070> which<00:05:13.639> is<00:05:13.669> one<00:05:14.180> of<00:05:14.270> our

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
of bad build quality which is one of our

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.390 
of bad build quality which is one of our
biggest<00:05:14.510> complaints<00:05:15.050> with<00:05:15.200> the<00:05:15.320> old<00:05:15.560> pantech

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
biggest complaints with the old pantech

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.150 
biggest complaints with the old pantech
duo<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:17.389> d-pad<00:05:17.720> is<00:05:17.960> much<00:05:18.320> much<00:05:18.590> larger<00:05:18.830> which

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
duo the d-pad is much much larger which

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.159 
duo the d-pad is much much larger which
is<00:05:19.310> great<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:20.270> buttons<00:05:20.570> have<00:05:20.690> flattened<00:05:21.080> out

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
is great the buttons have flattened out

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:22.690 
is great the buttons have flattened out
a<00:05:21.229> little<00:05:21.440> bit<00:05:21.650> which<00:05:21.830> makes<00:05:22.010> it<00:05:22.220> difficult<00:05:22.400> to

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
a little bit which makes it difficult to

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.219 
a little bit which makes it difficult to
feel<00:05:22.910> for<00:05:23.150> unlike<00:05:23.479> here<00:05:23.750> where<00:05:23.900> they're<00:05:24.050> kind

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
feel for unlike here where they're kind

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.379

of<00:05:24.320> raised<00:05:24.560> a<00:05:24.740> little<00:05:24.860> bit<00:05:25.030> let's<00:05:26.030> take<00:05:26.180> a<00:05:26.210> look

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
of raised a little bit let's take a look

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.870 
of raised a little bit let's take a look
at<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:26.540> keypads<00:05:27.340> again<00:05:28.340> we<00:05:28.460> have<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.639> flat

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
at the keypads again we have the flat

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.810 
at the keypads again we have the flat
keypad<00:05:29.360> here<00:05:29.750> and<00:05:29.960> on<00:05:30.680> the<00:05:30.860> Pentek<00:05:31.310> duo<00:05:31.550> we

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
keypad here and on the Pentek duo we

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.150 
keypad here and on the Pentek duo we
have<00:05:32.030> a<00:05:32.060> kind<00:05:32.300> of<00:05:32.360> raised<00:05:32.690> looking<00:05:33.590> keypad<00:05:33.979> but

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
have a kind of raised looking keypad but

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.969 
have a kind of raised looking keypad but
it<00:05:34.280> looks<00:05:34.700> cheaper<00:05:35.180> and<00:05:35.390> and<00:05:35.660> not<00:05:36.590> as<00:05:36.770> good

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
it looks cheaper and and not as good

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.159 
it looks cheaper and and not as good
quality<00:05:37.460> as<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:37.820> new<00:05:37.970> version<00:05:38.360> so<00:05:38.870> let's<00:05:39.020> take

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
quality as the new version so let's take

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.870 
quality as the new version so let's take
a<00:05:39.200> look<00:05:39.320> at<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.560> side<00:05:39.800> keyboards<00:05:42.669> similar<00:05:43.669> key

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
a look at the side keyboards similar key

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.330 
a look at the side keyboards similar key
keyboard<00:05:44.240> layout<00:05:44.810> although<00:05:45.710> these<00:05:45.950> buttons

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
keyboard layout although these buttons

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.219 
keyboard layout although these buttons
are<00:05:46.550> raised<00:05:46.880> while<00:05:47.300> these<00:05:47.479> buttons<00:05:47.870> are<00:05:47.990> flat

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
are raised while these buttons are flat

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:49.690 
are raised while these buttons are flat
and<00:05:48.260> I<00:05:48.380> think<00:05:48.590> that's<00:05:48.770> why<00:05:49.010> the<00:05:49.070> the<00:05:49.520> new

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
and I think that's why the the new

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.870 
and I think that's why the the new
matrix<00:05:50.419> Pro<00:05:50.810> has<00:05:51.080> better<00:05:51.740> typing<00:05:52.460> response

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
matrix Pro has better typing response

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.880 
matrix Pro has better typing response
than<00:05:53.090> does<00:05:53.270> the<00:05:53.419> previous<00:05:53.840> version<00:05:54.229> in<00:05:54.710> terms

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
than does the previous version in terms

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.290 
than does the previous version in terms
of<00:05:55.039> thickness<00:05:55.250> they're<00:05:55.700> pretty<00:05:56.120> much<00:05:56.240> the

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
of thickness they're pretty much the

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.110 
of thickness they're pretty much the
same<00:05:56.780> thickness<00:05:57.340> I'd<00:05:58.340> say<00:05:58.610> that<00:05:58.789> the<00:05:58.850> matrix

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
same thickness I'd say that the matrix

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.029 
same thickness I'd say that the matrix
Pro<00:05:59.360> maybe<00:05:59.690> a<00:05:59.960> hair<00:06:00.350> maybe<00:06:00.650> a<00:06:00.770> millimeter

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
Pro maybe a hair maybe a millimeter

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.850 
Pro maybe a hair maybe a millimeter
thicker<00:06:01.940> than<00:06:02.539> the<00:06:02.840> previous<00:06:03.260> generation<00:06:03.770> and

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
thicker than the previous generation and

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.500 
thicker than the previous generation and

flipping over to the back we don't have

flipping over to the back we don't have
that<00:06:05.720> battery<00:06:06.020> bulge<00:06:06.470> that<00:06:06.860> we<00:06:06.979> did<00:06:07.220> on<00:06:07.430> the

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
that battery bulge that we did on the

the old version on the new version which
is<00:06:10.010> good<00:06:10.220> lending<00:06:11.150> to<00:06:11.300> cleaner<00:06:11.600> lines<00:06:11.900> and<00:06:12.200> the

portrait mirror which is kind of
interesting<00:06:20.840> a<00:06:22.930> way<00:06:23.930> that<00:06:24.139> the<00:06:24.260> old<00:06:24.530> pantech

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
interesting a way that the old pantech

duo has a leg up on the matrix Pro is
that<00:06:27.080> there's<00:06:27.410> a<00:06:27.470> quick<00:06:27.800> way<00:06:27.830> to<00:06:28.039> access<00:06:28.340> the

go down to lock so it's basically three

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.950 
go down to lock so it's basically three
steps<00:06:36.169> to<00:06:37.010> lock<00:06:37.190> the<00:06:37.370> device<00:06:37.599> whereas<00:06:38.599> on<00:06:38.810> the

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
steps to lock the device whereas on the

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.239 
steps to lock the device whereas on the
previous<00:06:39.349> version<00:06:39.740> it<00:06:39.919> was

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:40.249 
previous version it was

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:42.189 
previous version it was
just<00:06:40.369> one<00:06:40.609> so<00:06:41.239> I<00:06:41.269> think<00:06:41.389> that<00:06:41.629> from<00:06:41.719> at<00:06:41.869> least<00:06:41.959> a

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 
just one so I think that from at least a

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:43.299 
just one so I think that from at least a
design<00:06:42.559> perspective

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:43.309 
design perspective

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:45.309 
design perspective
pantech<00:06:43.849> did<00:06:43.999> some<00:06:44.119> really<00:06:44.329> good<00:06:44.509> things<00:06:44.779> with

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 
pantech did some really good things with

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:48.219 
pantech did some really good things with
the<00:06:45.499> matrix<00:06:46.009> Pro<00:06:46.279> to<00:06:46.729> improve<00:06:47.059> upon<00:06:47.479> the<00:06:48.049> last

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:48.229 
the matrix Pro to improve upon the last

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:50.229 
the matrix Pro to improve upon the last
generation<00:06:48.829> device<00:06:49.099> which<00:06:49.339> looked<00:06:49.639> you<00:06:50.119> know

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:50.239 
generation device which looked you know

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:53.259 
generation device which looked you know
not<00:06:50.719> modern<00:06:51.229> it<00:06:51.379> looked<00:06:51.859> cheap<00:06:52.189> and<00:06:52.429> it<00:06:52.909> felt

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:53.269 
not modern it looked cheap and it felt

00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:55.599 
not modern it looked cheap and it felt
cheap<00:06:53.479> in<00:06:53.629> hand<00:06:53.869> we<00:06:54.859> have<00:06:54.979> a<00:06:55.009> lot<00:06:55.039> more<00:06:55.339> to<00:06:55.459> go

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:55.609 
cheap in hand we have a lot more to go

00:06:55.609 --> 00:06:57.579 
cheap in hand we have a lot more to go
on<00:06:55.639> the<00:06:56.029> pantech<00:06:56.479> matrix<00:06:56.959> Pro<00:06:57.229> we're<00:06:57.409> going<00:06:57.529> to

00:06:57.579 --> 00:06:57.589 
on the pantech matrix Pro we're going to

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:59.049 
on the pantech matrix Pro we're going to
do<00:06:57.679> the<00:06:57.769> software<00:06:58.099> tour<00:06:58.399> next<00:06:58.549> and<00:06:58.849> then<00:06:58.969> we're

00:06:59.049 --> 00:06:59.059 
do the software tour next and then we're

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:00.519 
do the software tour next and then we're
gonna<00:06:59.149> have<00:06:59.299> the<00:06:59.359> review<00:06:59.629> posted<00:07:00.019> soon<00:07:00.169> on

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:00.529

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:01.869 
gonna have the review posted soon on
Pocket<00:07:00.949> nail<00:07:01.069> comm<00:07:01.429> which<00:07:01.579> will<00:07:01.699> talk<00:07:01.819> about

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:01.879 
Pocket nail comm which will talk about

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:03.339 
Pocket nail comm which will talk about
battery<00:07:02.239> life<00:07:02.419> and<00:07:02.719> performance<00:07:02.839> and<00:07:03.289> all

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:03.349 
battery life and performance and all

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:04.029 
battery life and performance and all
that<00:07:03.499> good<00:07:03.649> stuff

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039
