see how well the site works on recon you
know<00:05:11.300> it's<00:05:11.510> a<00:05:11.600> little<00:05:11.720> it's<00:05:11.990> better<00:05:12.200> than<00:05:12.380> the

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
know it's a little it's better than the

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.470 
know it's a little it's better than the
holo<00:05:12.680> sight<00:05:13.040> be<00:05:13.340> being<00:05:13.640> that<00:05:13.790> it's<00:05:13.940> a<00:05:14.060> cross

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
holo sight be being that it's a cross

air<00:05:14.720> instead<00:05:15.110> of<00:05:15.230> the<00:05:15.350> little<00:05:15.620> dot<00:05:15.830> so

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
air instead of the little dot so

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.030 
air instead of the little dot so
precision<00:05:17.870> sniping<00:05:18.350> should<00:05:18.530> be<00:05:18.620> a<00:05:18.650> little<00:05:18.830> bit

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
precision sniping should be a little bit

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.800 
precision sniping should be a little bit
better<00:05:19.190> especially<00:05:19.550> for<00:05:20.000> close<00:05:20.210> ranges<00:05:22.810> going

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
better especially for close ranges going
