like on ps4 pc whether that's been

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.799 
like on ps4 pc whether that's been
better<00:00:37.350> or<00:00:37.559> even<00:00:37.860> worse<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.460> who<00:00:38.940> knows<00:00:39.090> so

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
better or even worse but who knows so

better or even worse but who knows so
the<00:00:40.350> first<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.980> know<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.610> at<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.879> top

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the first I know this is at the top

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.389 
the first I know this is at the top
better<00:00:42.270> for<00:00:42.450> three<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> battlefield<00:00:43.739> 4<00:00:44.010> xbox

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399

is this massive one hit kill bug I
cannot<00:01:07.320> believe<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.100> has<00:01:08.250> been<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
cannot believe that this has been in the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.969 
cannot believe that this has been in the
game<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.299> even<00:01:09.540> had<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> beta<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.680> battle

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
game we even had a beta for battle

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.530 
game we even had a beta for battle
before<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.700> still<00:01:11.939> made<00:01:12.210> its<00:01:12.390> way<00:01:12.510> into

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
before and it is still made its way into

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.789 
before and it is still made its way into
the<00:01:12.810> actual<00:01:12.990> game<00:01:13.080> that's<00:01:13.409> been<00:01:13.500> over<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> month

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the actual game that's been over a month

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.670 
the actual game that's been over a month
since<00:01:14.070> they<00:01:14.310> fixed<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.909> mean<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
since they fixed it I mean just to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.179 
since they fixed it I mean just to
explain<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:17.880> really<00:01:18.320> okay<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.560> but

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
explain it it's really okay it's but

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.510 
explain it it's really okay it's but
it's<00:01:20.220> where<00:01:21.650> bullets<00:01:22.650> traveling<00:01:23.130> obviously

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
it's where bullets traveling obviously

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.340 
it's where bullets traveling obviously
extremely<00:01:24.030> fast<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.960> still<00:01:25.140> got<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
extremely fast and you still got the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.770 
extremely fast and you still got the
slight<00:01:25.590> server<00:01:25.890> lag<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.310> between<00:01:27.000> frames<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
slight server lag but between frames the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.749 
slight server lag but between frames the
bullets<00:01:28.110> seem<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.740> double<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.369> damage

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
bullets seem to like double in damage

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.480 
bullets seem to like double in damage
the<00:01:29.970> same<00:01:30.240> bullet<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.659> will<00:01:30.750> hit<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.250> so<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the same bullet that will hit you so it

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.460 
the same bullet that will hit you so it
really<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.509> know<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.810> effect<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.290> doing

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
really so you know in effect it's doing

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.380 
really so you know in effect it's doing
w<00:01:34.799> matter<00:01:34.979> damage<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.270> it's
