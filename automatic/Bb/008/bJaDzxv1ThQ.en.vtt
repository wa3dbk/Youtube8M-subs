next<00:00:18.630> we're<00:00:18.720> going<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.869> take<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.080> look<00:00:19.320> at<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
next we're going to take a look at the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.160 
next we're going to take a look at the
effects<00:00:19.830> unit<00:00:20.449> the<00:00:21.449> controls<00:00:21.900> for<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
effects unit the controls for the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.890 
effects unit the controls for the
effects<00:00:22.439> units<00:00:22.830> are<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> left<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.269> FX<00:00:24.630> 1

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
effects units are on the left for FX 1

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.529 
effects units are on the left for FX 1
and<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.590> right<00:00:25.949> for<00:00:26.430> FX<00:00:26.730> 2<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.269> their<00:00:27.420> zone

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and on the right for FX 2 on their zone

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.030 
and on the right for FX 2 on their zone
DX<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.920> software<00:00:29.689> FX<00:00:30.689> 1<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.470> above<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
DX and in the software FX 1 is above the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.240 
DX and in the software FX 1 is above the
left<00:00:32.219> hand<00:00:32.489> X<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.000> FX<00:00:33.690> 2<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.380> above<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> right

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
left hand X and FX 2 is above the right

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.510 
left hand X and FX 2 is above the right
hand<00:00:35.489> X<00:00:36.829> so<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.890> first<00:00:38.100> thing<00:00:38.250> we're<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.460> to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
hand X so the first thing we're going to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.369 
hand X so the first thing we're going to
do<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.879> select<00:00:39.030> an<00:00:39.329> effect<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:42.870> hit<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.050> Select

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
do is select an effect so hit the Select

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.080 
do is select an effect so hit the Select
effects<00:00:43.680> button<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.460> LED<00:00:44.489> comes<00:00:45.000> on

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
effects button the LED comes on

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.850 
effects button the LED comes on
underneath<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.629> switch<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.140> you'll<00:00:46.590> see

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
underneath the switch and you'll see

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.330 
underneath the switch and you'll see
that<00:00:47.309> there<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.700> surround<00:00:48.620> those<00:00:49.620> blue<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
that there is a surround those blue and

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.150 
that there is a surround those blue and
the<00:00:50.579> effect<00:00:50.940> type<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.539> then<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.770> choose<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the effect type and then to choose the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.150 
the effect type and then to choose the
effect<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.579> want<00:00:54.020> we<00:00:55.020> simply<00:00:55.410> scroll<00:00:55.770> through

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
effect we want we simply scroll through

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.139 
effect we want we simply scroll through
using<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.969> encoder<00:00:58.609> once<00:00:59.609> we're<00:00:59.820> happy<00:00:59.910> with

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
using the encoder once we're happy with

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.990 
using the encoder once we're happy with
your<00:01:00.660> fact<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:00.960> want<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:01.710> press<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.430> activate

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
your fact we want we press the activate

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.670 
your fact we want we press the activate
button<00:01:03.030> which<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.809> push<00:01:04.080> action<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
button which is the push action of the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.530 
button which is the push action of the
encoder<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.670> turns<00:01:05.939> off<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> Select

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
encoder this turns off the Select

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.000 
encoder this turns off the Select
effects<00:01:06.840> button<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:08.430> lose<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:10.799> blue

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
effects button and you lose the blue

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.800 
effects button and you lose the blue
surround<00:01:11.430> around<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> effect<00:01:12.360> type<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
surround around the effect type in the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.550 
surround around the effect type in the
software<00:01:14.570> okay<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.630> now<00:01:15.810> we've<00:01:15.990> selected<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
software okay so now we've selected the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.240 
software okay so now we've selected the
effect<00:01:16.890> type<00:01:17.360> we<00:01:18.360> want<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.689> assign<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.590> effect

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
effect type we want to assign the effect

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.410 
effect type we want to assign the effect
unit<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.820> debt<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.060> we're<00:01:21.299> running

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
unit to the debt that we're running

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.480 
unit to the debt that we're running
audio<00:01:21.869> through<00:01:22.200> well<00:01:22.830> I'm<00:01:22.979> running<00:01:23.159> audio

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
audio through well I'm running audio

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.300 
audio through well I'm running audio
through<00:01:23.670> debt<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.290> I'm<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:26.040> going<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
through debt one so I'm just going to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.630 
through debt one so I'm just going to
select<00:01:26.520> FX<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:28.259> start<00:01:28.439> transport

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.410 

okay<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.909> first<00:01:33.060> thing<00:01:33.180> we're<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
okay so the first thing we're going to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.999 
okay so the first thing we're going to
do<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.750> actually<00:01:33.900> turn<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.350> effect<00:01:34.439> unit<00:01:34.890> on

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
do is actually turn the effect unit on

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.399 
do is actually turn the effect unit on
and<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.850> won't<00:01:35.970> initially<00:01:36.450> get<00:01:36.810> any<00:01:37.049> sort<00:01:37.320> of

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and we won't initially get any sort of

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.499 
and we won't initially get any sort of
response<00:01:37.770> because<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.610> depth<00:01:38.909> control<00:01:39.360> is

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
response because the depth control is

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.170 
response because the depth control is
down<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:40.680> look<00:01:40.829> at<00:01:40.950> these<00:01:41.070> controls<00:01:41.970> we

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
down so if we look at these controls we

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.730 
down so if we look at these controls we
have<00:01:42.210> depth<00:01:42.630> which<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> wet-dry

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
have depth which is like a wet-dry

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.810 
have depth which is like a wet-dry
control<00:01:45.799> you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.950> hear<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> high<00:01:47.549> pass

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
control you can hear the high pass

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.819 
control you can hear the high pass
filter<00:01:48.119> cutting<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:51.350> second<00:01:52.350> control<00:01:52.680> is

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
filter cutting in that second control is

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.440 
filter cutting in that second control is
a<00:01:52.860> modulation<00:01:53.280> control<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.119> case<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
a modulation control in the case of a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.940 
a modulation control in the case of a
high-pass<00:01:54.750> filter<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> resonance

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
high-pass filter this is the resonance

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.590 
high-pass filter this is the resonance
so<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:56.880> hear<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> difference<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
so you can hear the difference in the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.480 
so you can hear the difference in the
resonance<00:01:57.990> now<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:04.590> my<00:02:04.680> third<00:02:04.890> control<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.369> my

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
resonance now and my third control is my

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.270 
resonance now and my third control is my
X<00:02:05.700> control<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:07.200> differs<00:02:07.590> between<00:02:07.770> different

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
X control this differs between different

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.100 
X control this differs between different
effects<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.450> case<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.810> high-pass

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
effects in the case of the high-pass

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.009 
effects in the case of the high-pass
filter<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.649> my<00:02:10.770> LFO<00:02:11.220> amount

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.089 

you<00:02:16.019> start<00:02:16.349> hearing<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.860> LFO<00:02:18.769> now<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.830> rate

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
you start hearing the LFO now the rate

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.350 
you start hearing the LFO now the rate
of<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.430> LFO<00:02:20.849> is<00:02:21.330> determined<00:02:21.959> by<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.110> time<00:02:23.360> and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
of the LFO is determined by the time and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.990 
of the LFO is determined by the time and
the<00:02:25.260> time<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:26.459> adjusted<00:02:27.000> using<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.599> encoder

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
the time is adjusted using the encoder

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.420 
the time is adjusted using the encoder
so<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.060> can<00:02:30.209> hear<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.480> difference<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.989> the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
so you can hear the difference in the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.729 
so you can hear the difference in the
LFO<00:02:32.430> there<00:02:32.700> I'll<00:02:33.269> go<00:02:33.420> for<00:02:33.569> half<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.900> beat<00:02:34.079> 3/4<00:02:34.709> of

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
LFO there I'll go for half a beat 3/4 of

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:42.699 
LFO there I'll go for half a beat 3/4 of
a<00:02:34.890> beat<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:36.390> one<00:02:36.599> beat<00:02:39.290> two<00:02:40.290> beats<00:02:41.420> four<00:02:42.420> beats

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
a beat to one beat two beats four beats

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.809 
a beat to one beat two beats four beats
and<00:02:43.910> then<00:02:44.910> fractions<00:02:45.870> off<00:02:46.049> again<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:47.670> you're

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
and then fractions off again and you're

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:56.449 
and then fractions off again and you're
getting<00:02:47.970> more<00:02:48.239> severe<00:02:54.319> so<00:02:55.319> basically<00:02:55.680> the

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
getting more severe so basically the

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.270 
getting more severe so basically the
depth<00:02:56.640> control<00:02:56.879> is<00:02:57.209> like<00:02:57.329> a<00:02:57.359> wet/dry<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:59.040> mod

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
depth control is like a wet/dry the mod

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.589 
depth control is like a wet/dry the mod
and<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.790> X<00:03:00.000> depend<00:03:00.720> on<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.799> effect<00:03:02.390> if<00:03:03.390> you

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
and the X depend on the effect if you

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.149 
and the X depend on the effect if you
reference<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.019> user<00:03:04.319> guide<00:03:04.590> you'll<00:03:04.829> get<00:03:05.129> a

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
reference the user guide you'll get a

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.849 
reference the user guide you'll get a
much<00:03:05.430> better<00:03:05.579> description<00:03:06.269> of<00:03:06.359> what<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:06.859> mod

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
much better description of what the mod

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.280 
much better description of what the mod
and<00:03:08.069> X<00:03:08.250> controls<00:03:08.700> do<00:03:08.940> on<00:03:09.180> any<00:03:09.510> one<00:03:09.750> individual

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
and X controls do on any one individual

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.000 
and X controls do on any one individual
effect<00:03:12.109> so<00:03:13.109> we've<00:03:13.230> discussed<00:03:13.409> the<00:03:13.709> Select

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
effect so we've discussed the Select

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.470 
effect so we've discussed the Select
effects<00:03:14.310> button<00:03:14.549> we've<00:03:14.970> discussed<00:03:15.299> the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
effects button we've discussed the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.710 
effects button we've discussed the
on/off<00:03:15.780> button<00:03:19.609> now<00:03:20.609> look<00:03:20.790> at<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:20.940> b3<00:03:21.389> button

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
on/off button now look at the b3 button

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.809 
on/off button now look at the b3 button
which<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:21.989> currently<00:03:22.349> lit<00:03:22.680> which<00:03:23.160> means<00:03:23.459> we're

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
which is currently lit which means we're

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.849 
which is currently lit which means we're
in<00:03:23.849> beats<00:03:24.180> mode<00:03:24.480> when<00:03:25.319> we<00:03:25.410> discussed<00:03:25.769> about

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
in beats mode when we discussed about

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.220 
in beats mode when we discussed about
the<00:03:26.040> timing<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.880> I'll<00:03:27.239> use<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.540> time<00:03:27.750> control

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
the timing and I'll use the time control

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.440 
the timing and I'll use the time control
you<00:03:28.950> can<00:03:29.129> see<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.459> time<00:03:29.700> element<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.389> the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
you can see the time element and the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.309 
you can see the time element and the
software<00:03:30.870> changing<00:03:32.030> if<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.299> go<00:03:33.480> into<00:03:33.629> free<00:03:34.049> mode

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
software changing if I go into free mode

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.800 
software changing if I go into free mode
basically<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.639> can<00:03:35.790> see<00:03:35.879> that<00:03:36.060> time<00:03:36.329> has<00:03:36.569> now

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
basically you can see that time has now

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.780 
basically you can see that time has now
changed<00:03:37.169> to<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:38.370> milliseconds<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:41.250> can<00:03:41.519> tap

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
changed to a milliseconds and I can tap

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.589 
changed to a milliseconds and I can tap
in<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.180> tempo<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.549> can<00:03:45.510> see<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:48.209> time<00:03:48.449> in

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
in a tempo and you can see the time in

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.420 
in a tempo and you can see the time in
milliseconds<00:03:48.840> changing<00:03:49.680> as<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:49.949> tap<00:03:50.160> in<00:03:50.310> the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
milliseconds changing as I tap in the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.290 
milliseconds changing as I tap in the
tempo

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.210 

if<00:03:58.300> I<00:03:58.420> go<00:03:58.570> back<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.750> beats<00:03:59.080> you<00:03:59.620> can<00:03:59.800> see<00:03:59.980> that

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
if I go back to beats you can see that

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.020 
if I go back to beats you can see that
my<00:04:00.520> time<00:04:00.760> now<00:04:01.060> is<00:04:01.300> in<00:04:01.630> derivative<00:04:02.170> of<00:04:02.320> beats<00:04:03.030> so

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
my time now is in derivative of beats so

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.030 
my time now is in derivative of beats so
that's<00:04:04.210> a<00:04:04.300> basic<00:04:04.690> overview<00:04:04.810> of<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.740> effect

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
that's a basic overview of the effect

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.430 
that's a basic overview of the effect
