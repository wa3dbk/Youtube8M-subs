00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.760
 hello so like the time we were at limoux stage we had 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.139
 recovered the vehicle 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.349
 to avoid a new fall in a pond that lamentable 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.439
 today it has happened a lot of way too much the day of lines times to 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.779
 know all the total restoration of the bodywork 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.779
 we can not do that when in France 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.359
 as well as the coach of the backs 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.699
 today people in the slot 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.720
 this is where everyone 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.250
 this closure rate and then if it requires some molding of the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.360
 form 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.670
 then every year debates of the years we also try both 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.100
 sides they will follow too common in China everything was curly 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.820
 so both in ten years serious between two trucks worse hell back 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.650
 feeder butcher 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.800
 we see here the silence 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.780
 and if we present 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.780
 all the left side 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.670
 we then follow the entire sanding the eu 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.930
 Duchaussoy 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.939
 so everybody the blues have to count have been undermined entirely 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.829
 then undergone protection 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.599
 antirust for two years or that we see today in caen which gives a 

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:34.700
 gray appearance 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.520
 Clement clement jean-pierre of the association always 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.160
 let's add two of them 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.040
 everyone since amnesty sealing 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.680
 m at the sheet joints 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.390
 and then in the world criticizing in his practice 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.479
 would like to have a small aesthetic appearance so why the site have not dropped 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.130
 just because you have to know one thing is that 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.640
 in those 50s and 60s the world protections 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.450
 the second is found holder is very very summary 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.360
 composed of Bethune today who are much more recent 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.020
 so you have to know that when we are all the media posed 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.239
 in the first round the case here 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.759
 splashing water 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.979
 among other projects of the indh of the water of the earth that form the mud 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:17.489
 and that without passing the peaks of course that's what promotes corrosion between 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.969
 two shootings so the number of costs later on a couple of holes like 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.939
 we say redon in the chassis 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.979
 so to overcome this problem 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.979
 so we applied ourselves an elite match cited 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.020
 I regret today on all our old cars 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.609
 like their parents 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.730
 and so that will avoid get 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.239
 this post this mud heap 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.079
 between two rounds so we will now favor optimal protection for 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.359
 the profit base 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.839
 so this putty will apply to all 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:46.989
 of the vehicle 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.399
 who will suffer 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:51.799
 for now so today we are at the stage there 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.799
 there are photos that are visible on the site 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.209
 but here is the reformation of toulouse the implementations at the level of the rates 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.099
 long changes of Toulouse 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.099
 so he's rotten paris pernod 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.150
 today we approach closed today the vehicle is elsewhere 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.479
 how do we arrive soon after ten years ago 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.439
 that's near there fission priscilla only 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.779
 to overcome small defects that we do not see the draw 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.779
 but which in passing would not be seen again and less 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.029
 you'll see it through this guide will help the most fragile 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.259
 finally here is george 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.839
 in the region we see touquettois against welding by their parents 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:35.419
 so this is a piece that formed 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.889
 and catella report focused on the old according to these same children 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.939
 so we see well without the knowledge of the redon that enters his part a few 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.989
 change 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.989
 the average yield is another 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:52.139
 another issue 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.399
 we had a lot of distinction because we did not want the calf welding in 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:58.929
 a year this mechanical suicide m which 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:00.659
 who immediately says to the calf 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.479
 lose a little milk I get out of the steel so 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:04.539
 at the level 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:07.909
 mechanical resistances have formulated is similar however and it is unclean 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:08.459
 I do not believe
