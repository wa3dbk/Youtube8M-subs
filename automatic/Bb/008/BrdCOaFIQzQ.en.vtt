00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.530 
remington t studio curling wand it's
very<00:00:38.850> comparable<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> khania<00:00:40.379> infinity

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
very comparable to the khania infinity

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.520 
very comparable to the khania infinity
originally<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> was<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.020> go<00:00:43.170> get<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
originally I was going to go get the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.029 
originally I was going to go get the
conair<00:00:43.980> infinity<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.300> decided<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:46.039> I

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
conair infinity but I decided that I

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.400 
conair infinity but I decided that I
just<00:00:47.460> didn't<00:00:47.760> want<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.539> also<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:49.200> they

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
just didn't want that and also that they

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.010 
just didn't want that and also that they
didn't<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.829> at<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> store<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.570> i<00:00:51.600> could

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
didn't have it at the store so i could

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.510 
didn't have it at the store so i could
have<00:00:52.110> bought<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.350> online<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.039> saw<00:00:53.280> this

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
have bought it online but I saw this

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.600 
have bought it online but I saw this
product<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.750> was<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.320> immediately<00:00:56.280> fell

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
another piece so I'm just taking really

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.710 
another piece so I'm just taking really
big<00:02:26.410> chunks<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:27.670> it's<00:02:28.030> going<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.360> be<00:02:28.420> very

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
big chunks so it's going to be very

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.870 
big chunks so it's going to be very
loose<00:02:29.350> waves<00:02:31.500> if<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.709> want<00:02:33.010> out<00:02:33.310> cuter

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
loose waves if you want out cuter

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.570 
loose waves if you want out cuter
tighter<00:02:34.239> waves<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:34.930> will<00:02:35.110> also<00:02:35.260> do<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:36.190> but

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
tighter waves this will also do that but

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.600 
tighter waves this will also do that but
you<00:02:36.880> just<00:02:37.060> need<00:02:37.270> smaller<00:02:37.750> pieces<00:02:38.400> maybe<00:02:39.400> I'll

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
you just need smaller pieces maybe I'll

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.410 
you just need smaller pieces maybe I'll
hold<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:39.970> for<00:02:40.709> maybe<00:02:41.709> 15<00:02:42.280> seconds<00:02:42.730> I'm<00:02:43.060> holding

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
hold it for maybe 15 seconds I'm holding

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.080

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
take another big piece I know it's an

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.750 
take another big piece I know it's an
awkward<00:02:58.390> way<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.959> hold<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.470> curling<00:02:59.890> iron<00:02:59.980> but

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
awkward way to hold the curling iron but

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.690 
awkward way to hold the curling iron but
um<00:03:00.970> that's<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.049> only<00:03:02.260> way<00:03:02.440> that<00:03:02.709> I<00:03:02.890> found<00:03:03.430> that

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
um that's the only way that I found that

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.270 
um that's the only way that I found that
I<00:03:03.819> can<00:03:04.090> do<00:03:04.239> outward<00:03:04.720> curls<00:03:05.140> it's<00:03:06.130> probably

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
I can do outward curls it's probably

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.720 
I can do outward curls it's probably
another<00:03:06.580> way<00:03:06.850> probably<00:03:07.600> easier<00:03:07.930> way<00:03:08.110> but<00:03:08.730> i'll

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
another way probably easier way but i'll

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.620 
another way probably easier way but i'll
just<00:03:09.970> do<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.150> this<00:03:10.299> way<00:03:10.510> okay<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:12.459> just<00:03:12.670> another

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
just do it this way okay so just another

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.160 
just do it this way okay so just another
big<00:03:13.959> piece<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:16.000> curl<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:19.780> hold<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.109> there

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170
