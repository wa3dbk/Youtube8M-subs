00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
playing the scales continuous the most

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.029 
playing the scales continuous the most
important<00:01:28.500> thing<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.549> speed<00:01:30.110> so<00:01:31.110> you

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
important thing is the speed so you

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.219 
important thing is the speed so you
don't<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.759> play<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.420> scale<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
don't have to play the scale the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.139 
don't have to play the scale the
technical<00:01:34.709> a<00:01:34.740> scale<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.700> explained

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
technical a scale that I have explained

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.830 
technical a scale that I have explained
in<00:01:36.450> previous<00:01:36.630> lessons<00:01:38.060> where<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.390> fingers

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
in previous lessons where the fingers

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.300 
in previous lessons where the fingers
study<00:01:40.700> studied<00:01:41.700> from<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:43.069> the<00:01:44.069> most

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
study studied from here the most

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.139 
study studied from here the most
important<00:01:44.909> thing<00:01:45.270> was<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:46.289> impact<00:01:46.970> over<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
important thing was in impact over the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.529 
important thing was in impact over the
string<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.929> string<00:01:49.200> okay<00:01:49.850> forget<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.909> we

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
string on the string okay forget it we

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.320 
string on the string okay forget it we
aren't<00:01:51.720> playing<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.130> where<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.270> are

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
aren't playing like that where you are

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.029 
aren't playing like that where you are
playing<00:01:54.659> as<00:01:54.780> well<00:01:54.899> continuous<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.800> most

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
playing as well continuous the most

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.460 
playing as well continuous the most
important<00:01:56.580> thing<00:01:56.849> is<00:01:57.209> the<00:01:57.509> speed<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.989> playing

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
important thing is the speed is playing

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.979 
important thing is the speed is playing
as<00:01:58.619> quick<00:01:58.950> as<00:01:59.160> possible<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.789> you<00:02:00.569> don't<00:02:00.599> have

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:00.989 
as quick as possible so you don't have

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:03.859 
as quick as possible so you don't have
to<00:02:01.170> play<00:02:01.379> with<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.099> fingers<00:02:02.489> here<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.539> here

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
to play with the fingers here but here

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.359 
to play with the fingers here but here
for<00:02:03.959> example<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.709> a<00:02:04.800> good<00:02:04.830> position<00:02:05.220> um

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
for example it's a good position um

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.790 
for example it's a good position um
usually<00:02:08.369> we<00:02:09.030> are<00:02:09.149> gonna<00:02:09.390> play<00:02:09.690> first<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.679> all

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
usually we are gonna play first of all

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.280 
usually we are gonna play first of all
with<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.039> finger<00:02:11.580> then<00:02:12.150> with<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> ring<00:02:12.720> then

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
with the finger then with the ring then

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.229 
with the finger then with the ring then
the<00:02:13.440> middle<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.069> then<00:02:14.310> with<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.760> intense

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
the middle and then with the intense

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.449 
the middle and then with the intense
right<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.930> they<00:02:16.110> are<00:02:16.290> doing<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:16.890> we<00:02:16.950> play<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
right and they are doing but we play the

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.509 
right and they are doing but we play the
index<00:02:17.790> from<00:02:18.450> down<00:02:18.629> to<00:02:18.780> up<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.349> quickly<00:02:19.830> we'll

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
index from down to up and quickly we'll

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.250 
index from down to up and quickly we'll
start<00:02:21.060> again<00:02:21.300> in<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.870> same<00:02:22.260> basket<00:02:23.930> all<00:02:24.930> this

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
start again in the same basket all this

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.500 
start again in the same basket all this
in<00:02:25.530> our<00:02:25.709> country

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.649 

okay<00:02:33.659> so<00:02:35.010> another<00:02:36.010> thing<00:02:36.280> is<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.239> don't

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
okay so another thing is that you don't

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.309 
okay so another thing is that you don't
have<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:38.140> lend<00:02:38.590> your<00:02:38.980> thumb<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.690> C<00:02:40.900> string

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
have to lend your thumb on the C string

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:53.369 
have to lend your thumb on the C string
a<00:02:41.560> nice<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.220> complain<00:02:42.640> like<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.959> fingers

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379

this video was not invented but

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.300 
this video was not invented but
developed<00:05:12.580> by<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:12.880> maestro<00:05:13.690> because<00:05:14.500> uh<00:05:14.680> he

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
developed by the maestro because uh he

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.540 
developed by the maestro because uh he
usally<00:05:16.030> play<00:05:16.300> this<00:05:16.750> effect<00:05:17.620> with<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.370> right

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
least it is amazing also in my opinion

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.740

right I'm like before we can play we
play<00:06:27.900> in<00:06:28.260> cycles<00:06:29.220> of<00:06:29.550> three<00:06:30.060> girls<00:06:30.720> for<00:06:31.020> each

color

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:03.170 

a<00:06:57.710> second<00:06:59.629> possibility<00:07:00.629> is<00:07:01.669> like<00:07:02.669> before<00:07:02.849> the

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
a second possibility is like before the

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.899 
a second possibility is like before the
cycles<00:07:03.629> of<00:07:03.780> tutorials<00:07:04.740> and<00:07:04.919> then<00:07:05.159> with<00:07:05.819> the

frequent with the index grab to lava
from<00:07:08.159> down<00:07:08.370> to<00:07:08.550> up

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:29.790 
well anyway these are only some examples

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.050 
well anyway these are only some examples
of<00:07:30.000> this<00:07:30.380> missing<00:07:31.380> president<00:07:31.980> and<00:07:32.700> I<00:07:32.820> hope

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 
of this missing president and I hope

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.560 
of this missing president and I hope
that<00:07:33.330> you<00:07:33.540> develop<00:07:34.050> that<00:07:34.560> you<00:07:35.120> explore<00:07:36.120> this

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:36.570 
that you develop that you explore this

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.330 
that you develop that you explore this
new<00:07:37.380> technique<00:07:37.860> not<00:07:38.670> new<00:07:38.970> because<00:07:39.780> it's<00:07:40.140> very

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.340 
new technique not new because it's very

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.750 
new technique not new because it's very
antique<00:07:41.340> very<00:07:41.730> old<00:07:41.940> but<00:07:42.510> I<00:07:43.130> think<00:07:44.130> that<00:07:44.460> the

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 
circum you seek is a treasure is a gift

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.610 
circum you seek is a treasure is a gift
that<00:07:48.420> we<00:07:48.600> have<00:07:49.050> given<00:07:49.230> and<00:07:50.120> we<00:07:51.120> must<00:07:51.780> respect

the music dust all with our careers as

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.600 
the music dust all with our careers as

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.480 
is a good chance of keeping those old
techniques<00:08:05.610> and<00:08:06.450> integrate<00:08:07.170> them<00:08:07.800> in<00:08:08.190> their

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:08.490 
techniques and integrate them in their

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.330 
techniques and integrate them in their
models<00:08:09.000> so<00:08:09.690> now<00:08:10.080> you<00:08:10.140> have<00:08:10.410> a<00:08:10.440> new<00:08:10.680> tube<00:08:10.950> a<00:08:11.220> new

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340 
models so now you have a new tube a new

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.310 
models so now you have a new tube a new
technique<00:08:11.730> and<00:08:12.150> I<00:08:12.240> hope<00:08:12.450> that<00:08:12.690> you<00:08:12.930> enjoy<00:08:13.290> it

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:13.320 
technique and I hope that you enjoy it

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.880 
technique and I hope that you enjoy it
and<00:08:13.710> you<00:08:14.610> play<00:08:14.730> it
