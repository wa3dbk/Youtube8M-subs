stainless steel a coffee and on these

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.060 
stainless steel a coffee and on these
particular<00:01:06.420> ones<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> friction<00:01:07.920> fit

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
particular ones it's not a friction fit

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.679 
particular ones it's not a friction fit
it's<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.460> very<00:01:08.610> loose<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.330> when<00:01:09.570> you're

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
it's just very loose so when you're

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.410 
it's just very loose so when you're
knocking<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:10.760> you<00:01:11.760> push<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.180> forward

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
knocking it out you push that forward

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.990 
knocking it out you push that forward

this<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.479> something<00:01:27.900> most<00:01:27.990> machines<00:01:28.259> don't

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
this is something most machines don't

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.090 
this is something most machines don't

have oh your water water level if you

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.710 
have oh your water water level if you
scoot<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.850> like<00:01:33.119> hunker<00:01:33.540> down<00:01:33.619> well<00:01:35.720> you

keep<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.729> Machine<00:04:42.030> study<00:04:42.680> machine<00:04:43.680> then<00:04:45.080> so

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
keep the Machine study machine then so

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.629 
keep the Machine study machine then so
it's<00:04:46.199> pressurized<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:47.070> don't<00:04:47.250> have<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.520> do<00:04:47.610> a

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
it's pressurized you don't have to do a

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.590 
it's pressurized you don't have to do a
ton<00:04:47.910> of<00:04:47.970> tamping<00:04:48.600> so<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:51.210> fact<00:04:51.419> that<00:04:51.479> you

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
ton of tamping so the the fact that you

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.140 
ton of tamping so the the fact that you
got<00:04:51.720> a<00:04:51.780> tamp<00:04:52.080> upwards<00:04:52.680> is<00:04:53.039> fine<00:04:53.400> on<00:04:53.729> this<00:04:53.940> guy

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
got a tamp upwards is fine on this guy

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.810 
got a tamp upwards is fine on this guy
because<00:04:54.900> you're<00:04:55.889> not<00:04:56.010> going<00:04:56.430> for<00:04:56.610> thirty

because you're not going for thirty

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.629 
because you're not going for thirty
pounds<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.240> pressure

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
pounds of pressure

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.950 
pounds of pressure

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
machine that's entry level mm-hmm three

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.210 
machine that's entry level mm-hmm three
four<00:06:36.850> or<00:06:36.970> five<00:06:37.150> years<00:06:37.450> out<00:06:37.690> of<00:06:37.720> it<00:06:37.960> maybe<00:06:38.560> yeah

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
four or five years out of it maybe yeah

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.890 
four or five years out of it maybe yeah
and<00:06:39.820> they're<00:06:40.090> not<00:06:40.120> what<00:06:40.420> I<00:06:40.480> would<00:06:40.720> call

and they're not what I would call

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.980 
and they're not what I would call
probably<00:06:41.890> worth<00:06:42.340> fixing<00:06:42.940> okay<00:06:43.690> if<00:06:43.810> it's

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
probably worth fixing okay if it's

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.510 
probably worth fixing okay if it's
anything<00:06:44.260> major<00:06:44.590> it's<00:06:44.890> going<00:06:45.040> to<00:06:45.100> exceed<00:06:45.370> the

anything major it's going to exceed the
price<00:06:45.700> of<00:06:45.880> the<00:06:45.940> Machine<00:06:46.240> yeah<00:06:46.720> but<00:06:47.610> okay<00:06:48.610> it's

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
price of the Machine yeah but okay it's

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.200 
price of the Machine yeah but okay it's
got<00:06:49.540> more<00:06:49.690> metal<00:06:50.110> involved<00:06:50.830> in<00:06:50.980> it<00:06:51.250> so<00:06:51.970> that's
