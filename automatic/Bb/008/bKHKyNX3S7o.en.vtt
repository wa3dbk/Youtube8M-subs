these
but<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:19.800> thought<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.520> one<00:02:20.760> right<00:02:20.910> here

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
but I thought that this one right here

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.090 
but I thought that this one right here
is<00:02:21.570> kind<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.140> going<00:02:22.290> with<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.560> theme<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.040> I

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
is kind of going with a theme that I

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.640 
is kind of going with a theme that I
have<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.670> ribbon<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.150> chose<00:02:24.560> then<00:02:25.560> it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
have the ribbon that I chose then it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.230 
have the ribbon that I chose then it
already<00:02:25.860> has<00:02:26.010> little<00:02:26.370> pup<00:02:26.550> dog<00:02:26.760> on<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.090> back

already has little pup dog on the back

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.910 
already has little pup dog on the back
and<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.720> thought<00:02:27.900> what<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.140> would<00:02:28.200> do<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.740> I<00:02:28.890> would

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920
