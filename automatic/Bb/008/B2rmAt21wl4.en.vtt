should boot back up and we should be
rooted<00:05:29.280> with<00:05:30.280> clockworkmod<00:05:31.000> recovery<00:05:31.770> so

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
rooted with clockworkmod recovery so

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.689 
rooted with clockworkmod recovery so
we'll<00:05:32.889> be<00:05:33.010> right<00:05:33.130> back<00:05:33.250> when<00:05:33.400> that's<00:05:33.550> all
