 70,000 euro net 330 ps maximum 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.660
 torque of 450 newton meters 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.160
 I would like to drive 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.110
 but we'll have a look together 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.110
 the vehicle to what he can buy 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.090
 2.0 liters 265 or 280 ps like this 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.460
 is the seat leon cupra and he has one 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.220
 maximum torque of 350 newton meters 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.930
 he has 265 or 82 ps 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.640
 more power than the current VW Golf 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.230
 gti and how this seat leon cupra 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.270
 drive today, we'll take a quick look today 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.120
 to competitor check there we would have the 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.719
 opel astra gtc opc has something more 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.100
 torque 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.079
 on the other side we have 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.340
 nor the renault megane it is there 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.170
 However, the lock only optional 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.370
 available and then you still have the 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.020
 ford focus st 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.400
 he has to get along without being stiff 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.960
 Let's get to the optical 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.329
 We would have changes there, for example 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.190
 the new grille with warm grilles 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.230
 and the cupra logo the newly drawn 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.210
 bumper also mesh with honeycomb 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.489
 and what I like most about it 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.350
 the seat leon cupra are the led 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.950
 Headlights already installed as standard 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.320
 our seat león cupra 280 rolls up here 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.630
 19 inch rims and hidden behind there 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.060
 you see the brake system boards 82 ps 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.070
 also moved with a cargo ship 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.299
 the engine technical superiority the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.500
 Of course, you can see it at the tail as well 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.909
 especially the wing with the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.920
 integrated third brake light the 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.960
 cupra lettering on the tailgate with 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.760
 the cupra logo the newly designed 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.130
 bumper she will be the spectator and 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.740
 the double-flow exhaust system facts 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.420
 facts facts the seat león the games 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.700
 as three or five-door within 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.740
 of 5 76 seconds, the cupra accelerates 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.450
 from zero to 100 km h and is with it 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.430
 faster than any other 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.270
 standard competitors two 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.280
 motorizations lies the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.140
 top speed at 250 km h 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.340
 is switched either manually over 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.240
 a six-speed manual or 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.010
 optional over the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.990
 six-speed dual-clutch transmission at 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.030
 the fuel consumption after nefz is the 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.549
 seat leon cupra at values between 64 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.049
 and take 66 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.000
 Let's just say that you have the seat leon 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.380
 cupra will be a little sporty moves then 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.540
 you see the gas station a little more often 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.250
 because the tank content is only 50 liters 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.200
 and whatever we want to mention 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.390
 the seat leon cupra likes to drink super 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.189
 plus a little more about the interior 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.750
 I'm sitting on athletic contours 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.519
 Sit that offer a good page stop 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.470
 The steering wheel is also good in the 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.390
 hand leave all controls 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.950
 to reach each other well and the whole cockpit 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.599
 is very driver-oriented it so 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.470
 there is no such thing as a bit of facing 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.480
 really a lot to complain about 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.630
 the seat leon cupra tacho is there 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.480
 tempo 300 and also in the interior 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.910
 one by so little adaptation here in what 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.930
 man sits cupra logo 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.750
 driver sits he is now actually 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.550
 itself a body size of 1 75 seats 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.780
 now back and have enough 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.850
 legroom sufficient headroom 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.300
 and there really is not much to it 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.160
 gripe 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.200
 the seat leon cupra is supposed to 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.060
 his everyday sports car and his 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.130
 You can do that here after our own 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.300
 short test confirm first impression 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.770
 after 22 km 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.010
 the left must be the circuit directly 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.300
 crisp sound pleasant braking brakes 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.140
 Seat here has the so-called progressive 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.250
 Steering installed this 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.990
 Translation ratio wirtin 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.070
 Requirements adapted to the chassis 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.070
 can be about the so-called 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.850
 copper wire profile or the dtc 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.290
 to adjust 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.610
 about the adjustment I have 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.710
 In addition , influence on the gas intake 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.330
 the switching of the dfb are influenced 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.100
 and a sound actor takes over 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.840
 Sound-technical background in sport mode 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.820
 her seat leon cupra gives his 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.440
 the day before a differential lock also the 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.180
 locking effect is via the drive profile 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.100
 do you actually know such a influenced one 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.140
 lock makes the drive torque in 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.730
 If need be, only one wheel will guide that 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.260
 improves the handling and should therefore 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.940
 One understeer the fast corners 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.140
 Avoid driving through all descend 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.370
 you can not do it with it 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.120
 one can not limit the physics 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.760
 outsmart 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.900
 Today we are exactly 22 kilometers 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.690
 drove and lie loud on-board computer 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.050
 now with a consumption of 13 4 liters 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.730
 and we would betray you and cheat 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.110
 but above all we bend when we 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.870
 Now give a detailed verdict 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.550
 would be the consumption of 13 4 liters 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.840
 that is unrealistic that we know 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.950
 because we are really here today only 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.390
 driven back and forth to the 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.830
 everyday life la also belongs to the 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.410
 luggage compartment we have a volume here 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.840
 from 340 to 1,160 liters available 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.290
 and the maximum load is almost 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.390
 500 kilograms of this baby drives here 250 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.130
 km h and the base price is the 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.200
 30,000 930 euros 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.480
 exactly two hours has me with the seat 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.550
 leon cupra to produce only I am 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.170
 go and that's why we 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.940
 the vehicle will mark us again 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.410
 want to be around for a longer review 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.910
 to show you as well as you 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.620
 who deserves to be normal 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.000
 I'm interested in seat leon 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.740
 we have two more videos 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.450
 dazzle last time has the normal 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.260
 five-door and the combo we have 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.900
 already tested to you 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.400

 it is please if you ask for 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.940
 coup commented we have only a short comment 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.449
 but maybe we can test yours 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.370

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:49.710
 the cupra stands at the tender cupra 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.659
 stands for kapp racing and that's why 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.800
 we are at the nürburgring today and want us 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:56.599
 watch the race now 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.599
 until the next video show 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.639
 the normal operation 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.410
 I'm not sorry again 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.540
 one I'm normal again please 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.580
 study again please the normal 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:21.270
 driving report to the normal series and the 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:22.980
 evil evil we form we form that 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.230
 make them look again it is us 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:30.390
 cup race we do not owe
