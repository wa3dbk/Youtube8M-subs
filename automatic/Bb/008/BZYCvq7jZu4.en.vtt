so<00:00:39.050> I'll<00:00:39.170> concentrate<00:00:39.440> on<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.920> mini<00:00:40.160> for<00:00:40.370> now

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
so I'll concentrate on the mini for now

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.030 
so I'll concentrate on the mini for now
so<00:00:41.750> on<00:00:41.809> the<00:00:41.899> front<00:00:42.020> of<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.230> phone<00:00:42.380> is<00:00:42.620> a<00:00:42.649> three

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
so on the front of the phone is a three
