actually really really good animation

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.430 
actually really really good animation
done<00:02:26.400> by<00:02:26.580> sunrise<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.750> could<00:02:27.900> kind<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.200> look

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
done by sunrise and I could kind of look

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.010 
done by sunrise and I could kind of look
past<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.040> law<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:29.940> series<00:02:30.360> which<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.840> hope

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
past that law of the series which I hope

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.540 
past that law of the series which I hope
that<00:02:31.230> they<00:02:31.380> don't<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:31.650> completely<00:02:32.250> just

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
that they don't like completely just

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.790 
that they don't like completely just
give<00:02:32.910> up<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.209> do<00:02:33.660> cg<00:02:34.080> for<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.380> rest<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
give up and do cg for the rest of the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.590 
give up and do cg for the rest of the
dancing<00:02:35.400> parts<00:02:35.760> in<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:35.940> series<00:02:36.270> because<00:02:36.390> that

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
dancing parts in the series because that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.360 
dancing parts in the series because that
would<00:02:36.840> just<00:02:36.870> be<00:02:36.989> very<00:02:37.290> very<00:02:37.440> annoying<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.160> get

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
would just be very very annoying I get

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.830 
would just be very very annoying I get
very<00:02:38.489> pissed<00:02:38.730> off<00:02:38.940> but<00:02:39.330> yeah<00:02:39.390> that's<00:02:39.510> really

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
very pissed off but yeah that's really

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.630 
very pissed off but yeah that's really

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
all I have to say about this very

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.490 
all I have to say about this very
interesting<00:02:41.880> we<00:02:42.420> saw<00:02:42.660> we<00:02:42.930> saw<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.110> couple<00:02:43.200> of

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
interesting we saw we saw a couple of

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.589 
interesting we saw we saw a couple of
different<00:02:43.739> songs<00:02:43.920> we<00:02:44.280> saw<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.239> little<00:02:45.420> bit

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
different songs we saw a little bit

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.360 
different songs we saw a little bit
glimpses<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.170> other<00:02:46.260> characters<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:47.160> the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
glimpses of other characters like the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.610 
glimpses of other characters like the
school<00:02:47.670> president<00:02:48.090> vice<00:02:48.510> president<00:02:48.620> some

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620

random<00:02:49.950> girl<00:02:50.130> singing<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:51.090> main<00:02:51.720> characters

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
random girl singing the main characters

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.750 
random girl singing the main characters
sister<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.010> all<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.160> kind<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.370> other<00:02:53.489> stuff

sister and all the kind of other stuff

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.039 
sister and all the kind of other stuff
so<00:02:54.030> we'll<00:02:54.120> probably<00:02:54.299> see<00:02:54.540> more<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:54.810> later

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
so we'll probably see more of that later

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.780 
so we'll probably see more of that later
on<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.500> series<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:55.980> only<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.340> 13-episode

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
on the series this is only a 13-episode

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.970 
on the series this is only a 13-episode
anime<00:02:57.480> TV<00:02:57.660> series<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:58.410> not<00:02:58.560> gonna<00:02:58.709> be

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
anime TV series so it's not gonna be

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.970 
anime TV series so it's not gonna be
that<00:02:59.250> long<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.410> think<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.709> gonna<00:03:01.860> be

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
that long so it I think it is gonna be

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.800 
that long so it I think it is gonna be
interesting<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.549> see<00:03:02.730> how<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.299> group<00:03:03.660> of

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
interesting to see how this group of

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.800 
interesting to see how this group of
regular<00:03:04.560> girls<00:03:04.920> become<00:03:05.459> an<00:03:05.700> idol<00:03:06.030> group<00:03:06.569> so
