 Y 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.520
 today deliver him one chef is not going to be 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.050
 a chicken breast maracuyá us 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.460
 we are already the ingredients with friends 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.970
 so that you put yourself would go to the foot of the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.110
 this canyon we give ourselves while it's up 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.210
 and the passion fruit chicken breasts 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.560
 six half breasts 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.710
 the juice of 12 passion fruit 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.680
 in a quarter cup of oil salt and 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.079
 pepper a glass of white wine and a 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.510
 tablespoon of flour to start 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.309
 species talking about the passion fruit go to 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.260
 remove the passion fruit cut it by the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.720
 half with a spoon they take all the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.199
 pulp and put it in the blender with a 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.040
 little bit of water to move and 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.600
 obviously it has all the little seeds 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.720
 that's why we put it in and that's what it has 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.659
 acid the aniseed and funny taste if 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.909
 they want they can put this on 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.920
 teaspoon of honey or sugar for 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.020
 remove the points but it seems to me 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.659
 which is rich in the acidity of passion fruit and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.390
 look let's start we use some 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.460
 cambrai onions to flavor 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.040
 in this case we put only one person 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.410
 to the breast 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.510
 we go from the end to the day of the scream with 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:28.190
 little onion and let's go warm now 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:30.230
 and where the chicken is on both sides and 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.240
 let's put the pole we have to remove 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.280
 the excess oil because when 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.500
 we dorado the chicken starts to release the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.900
 grease sometimes that what remains of 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.180
 skin plus the oil that we left 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.460
 so much oil then after that 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.260
 We put the breasts and removed them 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.950
 we remove the excess oil we leave 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.390
 just a little bit ok 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.390
 let's put the breasts 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.380
 starting to warm up and observe once 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.970
 that is already hot what we are going to 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.970
 to do is add the passion fruit 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.369
 then we are going to add 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.060
 the White wine 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.520
 we are going to add 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.920
 a little water 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.920
 and let's go and we're going to put pepper 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.840
 and save 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.610
 good friends and since I cooked when 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.840
 already begins to boil 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.840
 we are going to throw flour to thicken 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.110
 to express and we go stirring to 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.110
 Do not make lumps 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:58.370
 and this is all this can be donated 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.730
 white potatoes 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.770
 of pablos because before with a pasta 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.010
 but without knowing 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.020
 if you attach the donkey to the donkey to the donkey boyfriend 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.780
 like 16 is also that it must be a 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.830
 something that goes with jean is that like 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.870
 balance and not spin more than delight 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.350
 this is more passion fruit maracuja already 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:26.990
 They saw that 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:29.510
 that's what he's putting on is the salsita is already 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.380
 the same you have to let your kind of 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.380
 the real recipe 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.940
 now they will not tell me that they can not 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.880
 to do is forgués now difficulty 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.360
 as they say 0 but watch how it goes 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.830
 doing besides going taking as another 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.390
 colour 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:55.600
 another color but if you realize 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.600
 yellow and if they already change exactly 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.239
 the organization 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:17.340
 8 92 73 26 on my cell phone 99 81 19 38 25 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.380
 they want sea chicken to support quickly 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.850
 we lower the wonders of the tree and what 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.930
 I have a clean hand that you also have 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.060
 passion fruit no but now I have nothing and 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.040
 not like another color gave some reds and 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.350
 then they do nothing so yellowish 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.780
 when they start to grow they are 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.180
 little ones are green and then you 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.950
 you leave and the ideal is to wait for it to fall 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.860
 when it came out in wonders because it is 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:49.560
 perfect then what do you do if you have 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:53.730
 a passion fruit plant and they do not generate it 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.010
 the soft ones that eat the grenades 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.930
 with the children the circuses also british 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.940
 Very fast but good the passion fruit 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.340
 of pain when you have many say 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.620

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.100
 passion fruit you put it in a tupperware and what 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.100
 froze 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:19.629
 right now thank you very much 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:21.339

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:25.169

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.169
