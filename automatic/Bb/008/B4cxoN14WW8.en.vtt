00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.050
 improved a lot of this car 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.940
 it's completely different from the 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.000
 previous generation 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.500
 finally lexus has taken everything 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.629
 toyota that the cars had 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.699
 previously and they were doing it 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.220
 much more luxurious at a much more level 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.140
 elevated above all because the competition 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.989
 it's also got pretty strong like that 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.299
 that we are in the model in this same 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.769

 the swift and that has 306 horses 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.989
 force 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.880
 both are handled in a way 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.430
 spectacular so let's make a 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.490
 small test here on this track

 from the world camping of the nascar 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.780
 and it also serves to make enough 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.510
 tests pretty kind of track in 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.890
 peralta this is an oval however 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.670
 let's use the clean one here for 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.390
 do the test with the lexus there is to 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:38.140

 fifty and there is that transit and has the 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.830
 eight-speed transmission which 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.650
 contributes to the best performance and also 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.560
 to have a little more efficiency in the 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.090
 fuel consumption the track is a 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.930
 little wet so that will be a test 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.930

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.980
 in order to demonstrate good management 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.720
 great conditioning that have made the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.569
 engine suspension brakes 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.760
