00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
take very long let's get it's hot and

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.070 
take very long let's get it's hot and
hold<00:01:15.350> it

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.760 

and<00:01:20.470> then<00:01:20.590> bring<00:01:20.800> it<00:01:20.890> down<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.250> hold<00:01:21.430> it<00:01:22.770> if

do<00:01:25.930> it<00:01:26.020> in<00:01:26.110> more<00:01:26.230> sections<00:01:26.710> but<00:01:26.920> since<00:01:27.190> it's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
do it in more sections but since it's

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.810 
do it in more sections but since it's
short<00:01:27.660> the<00:01:28.660> most<00:01:28.900> that<00:01:29.050> any<00:01:29.260> of<00:01:29.440> them<00:01:29.590> take<00:01:30.130> to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
short the most that any of them take to

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.840 
short the most that any of them take to
you<00:01:31.600> now<00:01:31.720> look<00:01:31.900> at<00:01:32.050> that<00:01:32.230> it's<00:01:32.980> fun<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.890> gives

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
you now look at that it's fun it gives

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.400 
you now look at that it's fun it gives
it<00:01:37.030> a<00:01:37.210> very<00:01:37.350> distinct<00:01:38.350> kind<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.700> finger<00:01:39.700> wave

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
it a very distinct kind of finger wave

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:49.290 
it a very distinct kind of finger wave
texture<00:01:44.580> that<00:01:45.580> if<00:01:45.910> I<00:01:46.120> can<00:01:47.910> commit<00:01:48.910> not

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
texture that if I can commit not

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.600 
texture that if I can commit not
detaching<00:01:49.900> with<00:01:50.050> it<00:01:50.230> touching<00:01:50.620> with<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:50.920> works

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
detaching with it touching with it works

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.870 
detaching with it touching with it works
really<00:01:51.850> well<00:01:52.000> just<00:01:52.150> on<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:52.810> just<00:01:52.840> like<00:01:53.440> that

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
really well just on so just like that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:10.969 
really well just on so just like that
it's<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.970> very<00:01:55.270> simple<00:01:55.540> sprain<00:01:56.260> your<00:01:56.320> session

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:32.870 

hold<00:02:11.640> it

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:51.000 

give<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.030> body<00:02:34.240> to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.670 

now<00:02:52.010> we're<00:02:52.190> going<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.370> section<00:02:52.880> off<00:02:53.270> this<00:02:53.960> I'm

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
now we're going to section off this I'm

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:09.370 
now we're going to section off this I'm
going<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.069> leave<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.400> bags<00:02:55.760> straight<00:03:08.380> because

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
going to leave the bags straight because

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.430 
going to leave the bags straight because
those<00:03:09.650> are<00:03:09.800> too<00:03:09.980> short<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:12.110> clamp

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
those are too short to clamp

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:21.500 
those are too short to clamp
convincingly

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:33.530 

hmm

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.970 

so<00:03:34.540> it's<00:03:34.690> complicated<00:03:35.260> as<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.410> tool<00:03:35.680> as<00:03:35.830> it

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
so it's complicated as a tool as it

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.270 
so it's complicated as a tool as it
looks<00:03:36.220> it's<00:03:36.460> super<00:03:36.940> easy<00:03:36.970> do<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.860> iron<00:03:42.070> is

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
looks it's super easy do the iron is

00:03:42.280 --> 00:04:06.150 
looks it's super easy do the iron is
most<00:03:42.550> important<00:03:43.030> for<00:03:43.060> you

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.200 

you<00:04:07.000> want<00:04:07.210> to<00:04:07.300> try<00:04:07.600> not<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:07.990> recruit<00:04:08.740> him

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
you want to try not to recruit him

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.260 
you want to try not to recruit him
that's<00:04:10.210> why<00:04:10.360> it's<00:04:10.540> portent<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.650> have

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
that's why it's portent to have

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.660 
that's why it's portent to have
organized<00:04:13.270> sections<00:04:14.700> because<00:04:15.700> if<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.030> get

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
organized sections because if you get

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.699 
organized sections because if you get
the<00:04:18.670> wave<00:04:19.030> pattern<00:04:19.510> right<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:20.080> one<00:04:20.290> try<00:04:20.530> you

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
the wave pattern right and one try you

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.190 
the wave pattern right and one try you
don't<00:04:20.860> have<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.220> worry<00:04:21.600> curl<00:04:22.600> over<00:04:22.840> it<00:04:23.080> because

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
don't have to worry curl over it because

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.150 
don't have to worry curl over it because
it<00:04:23.380> will<00:04:23.470> muck<00:04:23.680> it<00:04:23.830> up<00:04:25.530> see<00:04:26.530> this<00:04:26.710> was<00:04:26.920> not<00:04:27.130> a

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
it will muck it up see this was not a

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.890 
it will muck it up see this was not a
