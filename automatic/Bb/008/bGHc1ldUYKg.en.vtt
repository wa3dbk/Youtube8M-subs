00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.510
 hello to all and welcome to live guitar and welcome to a new 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.590
 heading that will be out devoted and this without six Germans to the technique of 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.679
 tapping 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.660
 % and I will try to make you develop the hand that will type so 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.770
 right for left-handed left-handed 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.770
 starting with one finger and then gradually 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.199
 trying to use all our fingers 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.800
 so we're going to leave with a base of the stuff it's going to be playing with you 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.930
 the major role index it's going to depend on people 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.850
 and for him little at the level of the notes on the handle that I will choose in a 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.970
 first time 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.690
 it's taking some simple elements and right now for 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.990
 melodic and who walks very fast in line 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.990
 what has made besides were quits and his famous 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.120
 e with these tools there are milks major triads minor and diminished 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.420
 Firstly 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.290
 which will correspond dompierre 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.960
 to the type of agreement includes counter e in on the harmonization of the major scale 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.720
 so at first I'll show you 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.050
 so these three prices attracts a single horn it will be close voice to do the 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.830
 job 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.560
 warm tones and for him of the exchange of rope also 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.910
 so we'll have first of all 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.670
 I'm going on the little rope 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.700
 I start in A minor will have first percent proof riyad to 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.600
 the fundamental state we will play the dominique 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.560
 and here I will do like that 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.250
 so not already at first even though just at the level of the 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.940
 position what we will do 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.420
 carpet level line 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.490
 for the leader of radiohead inches on the slice 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.890
 to give us a support that will move along the neck 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.409
 on what we have to do and then so at first month I'm going 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.630
 use the index here 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.590
 so what we are going to do at the level of the notes is therefore the dominique 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.130
 so there a symptomatic case cord with the index 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.069
 the back with the little finger and the myth 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.109
 we will type with the index so we will have this thing 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.709
 this is the first trial first reversal 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.219
 in the ground state speech forgiveness the first rank launch there are now 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.309
 mike of water and I look for the pearl 17 17 th break 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.709
 and secondly launch 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.369
 let's start with the map 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.819
 the right middle mid there and the back almost 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.139
 here is in the same clan 3 trial minor
