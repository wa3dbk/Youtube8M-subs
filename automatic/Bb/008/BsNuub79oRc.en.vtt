you<00:00:17.360> see<00:00:17.600> lives<00:00:18.410> on<00:00:18.590> symbian<00:00:18.920> platform<00:00:19.040> which

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
you see lives on symbian platform which

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.810 
you see lives on symbian platform which
is<00:00:19.760> the<00:00:19.850> same<00:00:20.000> as<00:00:20.060> the<00:00:20.740> patio<00:00:21.740> right<00:00:22.100> but<00:00:22.699> it's

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
is the same as the patio right but it's

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.540 
is the same as the patio right but it's
got<00:00:22.939> faster<00:00:23.269> processor<00:00:23.750> under<00:00:24.160> 720<00:00:25.160> megahertz

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
got faster processor under 720 megahertz

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.130 
got faster processor under 720 megahertz
right<00:00:25.910> the<00:00:26.300> screen<00:00:26.539> is<00:00:26.570> now<00:00:26.869> a<00:00:26.900> lot<00:00:27.109> more

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
right the screen is now a lot more

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.929 
right the screen is now a lot more
sensitive<00:00:27.740> as<00:00:27.830> well<00:00:28.010> even<00:00:28.250> though<00:00:28.400> it's<00:00:28.550> using

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
sensitive as well even though it's using

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.939 
sensitive as well even though it's using
the<00:00:29.029> same<00:00:29.240> resistive<00:00:29.689> technology<00:00:30.199> yeah<00:00:30.560> as

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
the same resistive technology yeah as

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.280 
the same resistive technology yeah as
you<00:00:31.070> can<00:00:31.220> see<00:00:31.369> it's<00:00:31.490> very<00:00:31.580> slim<00:00:32.390> a<00:00:32.630> lot<00:00:33.050> smaller

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
you can see it's very slim a lot smaller

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.200 
you can see it's very slim a lot smaller
than<00:00:33.530> Sethi<00:00:33.800> oh<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.220> it's<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:34.910> smallest

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
than Sethi oh and it's the smallest

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.119 
than Sethi oh and it's the smallest

capability<00:00:37.760> at<00:00:37.910> 720p<00:00:38.450> well<00:00:39.379> I<00:00:39.590> understand<00:00:40.010> it

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
capability at 720p well I understand it

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.130 
capability at 720p well I understand it
uses<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.370> human<00:00:41.030> curvature<00:00:41.450> design<00:00:41.750> actually

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
uses the human curvature design actually

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.660 
uses the human curvature design actually
a<00:00:42.410> little<00:00:42.649> bit<00:00:42.829> about<00:00:42.920> that<00:00:43.070> it's<00:00:43.280> basically

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
a little bit about that it's basically

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.430 
a little bit about that it's basically
all<00:00:43.850> is<00:00:44.059> something<00:00:44.480> incorporated<00:00:45.079> into<00:00:45.200> all

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
all is something incorporated into all

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.650 
all is something incorporated into all
our<00:00:45.620> new<00:00:45.739> handsets<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:46.789> it's<00:00:47.239> just<00:00:47.450> sort<00:00:47.629> of

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
our new handsets and it's just sort of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.900 
our new handsets and it's just sort of
design<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:48.140> sort<00:00:48.440> of<00:00:48.500> see<00:00:49.309> when<00:00:49.520> you<00:00:49.610> held<00:00:49.789> in

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
design to sort of see when you held in

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.270 
design to sort of see when you held in
your<00:00:49.940> hand<00:00:50.059> it<00:00:50.390> just<00:00:50.570> feels<00:00:50.750> a<00:00:51.590> lot<00:00:52.039> nicer

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
your hand it just feels a lot nicer

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.450 
your hand it just feels a lot nicer
instead<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:53.590> easier<00:00:54.590> to<00:00:54.710> use<00:00:54.859> and<00:00:54.890> not<00:00:55.129> nice<00:00:55.430> to

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
instead of easier to use and not nice to

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.599 
instead of easier to use and not nice to
use<00:00:55.760> basically<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:57.559> panels<00:00:58.010> on<00:00:58.250> there<00:00:58.489> as

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
use basically the panels on there as

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.319 
use basically the panels on there as
well<00:00:58.820> same<00:00:59.719> as<00:00:59.870> what<00:00:59.989> you<00:01:00.020> had<00:01:00.230> on<00:01:00.260> set<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:01.329> but

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
well same as what you had on set you but

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.180 
well same as what you had on set you but
the<00:01:02.719> screen<00:01:02.840> is<00:01:02.960> is<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.410> lot<00:01:03.620> more<00:01:03.739> sensitive

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
the screen is is a lot more sensitive

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.920 
the screen is is a lot more sensitive
now<00:01:04.340> and<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:05.030> panel's<00:01:05.300> themselves<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:05.810> can

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
now and the panel's themselves you can

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.350 
now and the panel's themselves you can
actually<00:01:06.020> customize<00:01:06.350> what<00:01:07.340> they<00:01:07.580> are<00:01:07.760> as<00:01:07.940> well

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
actually customize what they are as well

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.090 
actually customize what they are as well
as<00:01:08.480> the<00:01:08.600> content<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.650> you<00:01:09.740> can<00:01:09.830> actually<00:01:09.920> just

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
as the content so you can actually just

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.560 
as the content so you can actually just
press<00:01:10.520> on<00:01:10.550> hold<00:01:10.820> on<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.030> tap<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.240> it<00:01:11.450> can

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
press on hold on the tap and it can

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.480 
press on hold on the tap and it can
change<00:01:11.810> what<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.320> time<00:01:12.530> actually<00:01:12.680> does<00:01:13.070> my

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
change what the time actually does my

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.910 
change what the time actually does my
rights<00:01:13.910> which<00:01:14.180> has<00:01:14.300> a<00:01:14.330> step<00:01:14.720> forward<00:01:14.990> from

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
rights which has a step forward from

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.830 
rights which has a step forward from
what's<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.610> tea<00:01:16.670> or<00:01:16.790> have<00:01:16.970> them<00:01:17.060> there<00:01:17.240> on<00:01:17.600> the

what's a tea or have them there on the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.810 
what's a tea or have them there on the
side<00:01:18.050> we've<00:01:18.260> got<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.500> micro<00:01:18.860> USB<00:01:18.890> port<00:01:19.610> for

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
side we've got a micro USB port for

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.120 
side we've got a micro USB port for
charging<00:01:20.470> in<00:01:21.470> line<00:01:21.680> with<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:21.890> whole<00:01:22.010> industry

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
charging in line with the whole industry

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.150 
charging in line with the whole industry
moving<00:01:22.670> forwards<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.420> use<00:01:23.570> my<00:01:23.720> 30<00:01:23.990> space<00:01:24.260> and<00:01:25.100> a

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
moving forwards to use my 30 space and a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.440 
moving forwards to use my 30 space and a
three<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:25.400> a<00:01:25.460> half<00:01:25.520> million<00:01:25.820> headphone<00:01:26.180> jack

three and a half million headphone jack

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.240 
three and a half million headphone jack
as<00:01:26.660> well<00:01:26.690> so<00:01:27.200> that<00:01:27.230> means<00:01:27.590> customers<00:01:27.800> can<00:01:28.100> use

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
as well so that means customers can use

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.340 
as well so that means customers can use
any<00:01:28.490> headphones<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.910> they<00:01:29.120> wish<00:01:29.300> I<00:01:29.540> directly

any headphones that they wish I directly
on<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.530> handset<00:01:30.830> I<00:01:30.980> noticed<00:01:31.460> there's<00:01:31.610> no

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
on the handset I noticed there's no

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.670 
on the handset I noticed there's no
there's<00:01:32.420> no<00:01:32.450> keep<00:01:32.720> out<00:01:32.900> on<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.170> device<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:33.620> if

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
there's no keep out on the device so if

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.350 
there's no keep out on the device so if
you<00:01:33.770> talk<00:01:33.950> me<00:01:34.070> through<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.370> touchscreen

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
you talk me through the touchscreen

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.320 
you talk me through the touchscreen
interface<00:01:35.650> absolutely<00:01:36.650> yes<00:01:37.000> for<00:01:38.000> example

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
interface absolutely yes for example

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.050 
interface absolutely yes for example
messaging<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:39.370> do<00:01:40.370> actually<00:01:40.550> have<00:01:40.730> quite<00:01:41.000> a

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
messaging you do actually have quite a

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.460 
messaging you do actually have quite a
few<00:01:41.120> options<00:01:41.630> for<00:01:41.960> writing<00:01:42.320> messages

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
few options for writing messages

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.110 
few options for writing messages
obviously<00:01:43.460> you've<00:01:43.550> got<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.700> full<00:01:43.880> qwerty
