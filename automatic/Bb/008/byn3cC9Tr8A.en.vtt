information<00:01:19.380> into<00:01:19.799> databases<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.670> could<00:01:20.790> be

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
information into databases that could be

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.280 
information into databases that could be
accessed<00:01:21.060> by<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> pis<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.220> met<00:01:23.580> tons<00:01:23.850> of

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
accessed by a pis and so I met tons of

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.600 
accessed by a pis and so I met tons of
programmers<00:01:25.290> who<00:01:25.770> were<00:01:25.979> screwing<00:01:26.460> around

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
programmers who were screwing around

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.429 
programmers who were screwing around
trying<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.420> figure<00:01:27.600> out<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:28.020> they<00:01:28.140> could<00:01:28.200> do

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
trying to figure out what they could do

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.710 
trying to figure out what they could do
with<00:01:28.470> those<00:01:28.710> API<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.540> guys<00:01:30.689> I

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
with those API so so one of the guys I

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630 
with those API so so one of the guys I
talked<00:01:31.049> about<00:01:31.220> what<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> hell's<00:01:32.490> his<00:01:32.579> name

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
talked about what the hell's his name

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.219

AOL but he was really funny like one of
the<00:01:36.329> apps<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.720> think<00:01:36.900> he<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.920> Sean<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.189> was

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the apps I think he that Sean I was

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.100 
the apps I think he that Sean I was
somebody<00:01:38.549> else<00:01:38.820> now<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.119> Norman<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.960> was

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
somebody else now of Norman but I was

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.270 
somebody else now of Norman but I was
one<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> apps<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.920> person

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
one of the apps that this person

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.340 
one of the apps that this person
developed<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.790> was<00:01:41.880> really<00:01:42.090> really<00:01:42.329> funny<00:01:42.659> was

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
developed it was really really funny was

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.030 
developed it was really really funny was
it<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.979> an<00:01:44.399> app<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:45.270> figure<00:01:45.659> out<00:01:45.930> where<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.890> was

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
it was an app to figure out where it was

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.039 
it was an app to figure out where it was
safest<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.640> park<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.149> knock<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> parking

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
safest to park and knock in a parking

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.109 
safest to park and knock in a parking
ticket<00:01:49.079> if<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.619> don't<00:01:50.009> pay<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.369> parking<00:01:50.759> and

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
ticket if you don't pay for parking and

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.359 
ticket if you don't pay for parking and
so<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:51.930> they<00:01:52.079> did<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.320> they<00:01:52.890> created<00:01:53.070> this

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
so what they did is they created this

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.020 
so what they did is they created this
app<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.810> mind<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:56.369> Baltimore<00:01:56.579> City

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
app and in mind the the Baltimore City

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.510 
app and in mind the the Baltimore City
database<00:01:57.710> was<00:01:58.710> able<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.009> pick<00:01:59.219> up<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
database was able to pick up the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.120 
database was able to pick up the
addresses<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.390> then<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.810> was<00:02:00.930> basically<00:02:01.619> able

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
addresses and then it was basically able

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.200 
addresses and then it was basically able
to<00:02:02.280> heat<00:02:02.579> map<00:02:02.909> where<00:02:03.659> tickets<00:02:04.380> were<00:02:04.770> given

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
to heat map where tickets were given

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.570 
to heat map where tickets were given
right<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.780> would<00:02:06.960> see<00:02:07.229> all<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.369> red

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
right so you would see all of the red

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.089 
right so you would see all of the red
heatmap<00:02:08.970> spots<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:10.080> where<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.440> most<00:02:10.679> tickets

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
heatmap spots of where the most tickets

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.920 
heatmap spots of where the most tickets
are<00:02:11.250> given<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.849> then<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.209> could<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.660> take

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
are given and then you could just take

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.760 
are given and then you could just take
it<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.290> take<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.530> look

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
it that take a look

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.610 
it that take a look
visually<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.790> see<00:02:15.360> where<00:02:15.750> tickets<00:02:16.230> weren't

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
visually and see where tickets weren't

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.530 
visually and see where tickets weren't
given<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.280> figured<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.120> was<00:02:18.330> probably

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
given and figured that that was probably

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.510 
given and figured that that was probably
a<00:02:18.780> safe<00:02:19.080> location<00:02:19.320> so<00:02:19.800> what<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.100> person<00:02:20.400> was

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
a safe location so what this person was

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.800 
a safe location so what this person was
thinking<00:02:20.850> is<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.000> know<00:02:21.120> Baltimore<00:02:21.570> City

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
thinking is you know Baltimore City

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.600 
thinking is you know Baltimore City
parking<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.500> an<00:02:22.620> absolute<00:02:22.980> nightmare<00:02:23.190> if<00:02:23.520> you

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
parking is an absolute nightmare if you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.100 
parking is an absolute nightmare if you
park<00:02:23.820> in<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.000> wrong<00:02:24.120> place<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.870> can<00:02:24.990> get

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
park in the wrong place you can get

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.470 
park in the wrong place you can get
really<00:02:25.590> ridiculously<00:02:26.250> expensive<00:02:26.520> tickets<00:02:27.090> so

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
really ridiculously expensive tickets so

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.360 
really ridiculously expensive tickets so
what<00:02:27.840> they<00:02:27.930> thought<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.380> hey<00:02:28.530> if<00:02:28.860> they're

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
what they thought is hey if they're

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.220 
what they thought is hey if they're
opening<00:02:29.790> up<00:02:29.910> their<00:02:30.180> their<00:02:30.450> AP<00:02:30.810> there<00:02:31.020> their

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
opening up their their AP there their

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.040 
opening up their their AP there their
database<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.860> an<00:02:31.950> API<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.700> wonder<00:02:33.540> if<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.780> could

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
database to an API I wonder if I could

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.130 
database to an API I wonder if I could
scrape<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:35.040> for<00:02:35.490> where<00:02:36.360> all<00:02:36.540> these<00:02:36.690> tickets

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
scrape it for where all these tickets

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.330 
scrape it for where all these tickets
you<00:02:37.290> know<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.500> addresses<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.010> where<00:02:38.220> these

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
you know the addresses of where these

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.550 
you know the addresses of where these
tickets<00:02:38.730> are<00:02:38.880> being<00:02:39.360> written<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:40.020> then<00:02:40.350> I

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
tickets are being written and then I

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.620 
tickets are being written and then I
could<00:02:40.830> see<00:02:41.100> where<00:02:41.430> it's<00:02:41.640> safe<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.060> park<00:02:42.240> right

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
could see where it's safe to park right

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.300 
could see where it's safe to park right
that's<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.410> type<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.650> thing<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:43.950> you're<00:02:44.160> going

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
that's a type of thing that you're going

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.340 
that's a type of thing that you're going
to<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:45.180> start<00:02:45.420> doing<00:02:45.660> if<00:02:46.020> you<00:02:46.170> want<00:02:46.290> to

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
to have to to start doing if you want to

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.990 
to have to to start doing if you want to
be<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.470> programmer<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.160> basically<00:02:47.550> go<00:02:47.820> out

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
be a programmer is basically go out

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.900 
be a programmer is basically go out
there<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.600> find<00:02:49.470> problems<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.370> then<00:02:50.580> solve

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
there and find problems and then solve

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.870 
there and find problems and then solve
the<00:02:51.030> problems<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.720> what<00:02:51.960> you<00:02:52.080> do<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.710> you<00:02:53.580> find

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
the problems and what you do is you find

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.660 
the problems and what you do is you find
problems<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.680> think<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.430> can

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
problems that you think that you can

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.550 
problems that you think that you can
solve<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.330> then<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.810> just<00:02:57.990> get<00:02:58.110> bigger<00:02:58.380> and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
solve and then you just get bigger and

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.980 
solve and then you just get bigger and
bigger<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.490> bigger<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.150> bigger<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.900> bigger

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.630 
bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
from<00:03:01.620> there<00:03:01.890> right<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:05.130> know<00:03:05.280> maybe<00:03:05.490> if

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
from there right so you know maybe if

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.430 
from there right so you know maybe if
you<00:03:05.670> want<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:05.910> create<00:03:06.030> an<00:03:06.210> Android<00:03:06.630> or<00:03:06.720> iOS<00:03:06.930> app

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
you want to create an Android or iOS app

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.170 
you want to create an Android or iOS app
in<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.710> beginning<00:03:08.130> maybe<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.820> create<00:03:09.120> a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
in the beginning maybe you create a

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.260 
in the beginning maybe you create a
little<00:03:09.360> app<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:09.900> all<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.350> does<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:11.030> it's<00:03:12.030> one

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
little app and all it does is it's one

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.140 
little app and all it does is it's one
button<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:13.020> take<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.320> picture<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.100> then<00:03:14.160> as

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
button you take a picture and then as

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.580 
button you take a picture and then as
soon<00:03:15.570> as<00:03:15.690> you're<00:03:15.840> done<00:03:15.960> pay<00:03:16.140> taking<00:03:16.530> the

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
soon as you're done pay taking the

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.290 
soon as you're done pay taking the
picture<00:03:16.890> maybe<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.370> automatically<00:03:17.880> email

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
picture maybe it automatically email

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.210 
picture maybe it automatically email
somebody<00:03:18.630> or<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.290> automatically<00:03:19.860> post<00:03:20.100> to

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
somebody or it automatically post to

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.280 
somebody or it automatically post to
something<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.150> all<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:21.720> have<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.870> do<00:03:22.050> is<00:03:22.200> learn

something so all you have to do is learn

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.380 
something so all you have to do is learn
the<00:03:22.410> control<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:23.160> taking<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.790> picture<00:03:23.970> on<00:03:24.330> a

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
there you learn how to do geo tagging

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.770 
there you learn how to do geo tagging
with<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.610> from<00:03:35.820> there<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.270> learn<00:03:36.390> something

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
problems we see problems and we try to

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.870 
problems we see problems and we try to
solve<00:03:48.959> them<00:03:49.200> so<00:03:49.800> that's<00:03:50.130> what<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.459> need<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.670> do

solve them so that's what you need to do

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.190 
solve them so that's what you need to do
you<00:03:51.120> need<00:03:51.270> to<00:03:51.360> go<00:03:51.420> around<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:51.959> take<00:03:52.020> a<00:03:52.080> look

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
and see what problems you think you can

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.199 
and see what problems you think you can
solve<00:03:54.720> with<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.959> smartphone<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.670> then<00:03:56.970> try<00:03:57.150> to

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
solve with a smartphone and then try to

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.150 
solve with a smartphone and then try to
solve<00:03:57.450> them<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.840> then<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.350> just<00:03:58.560> keep<00:03:58.800> doing

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
solve them and then you just keep doing

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.830

important thing with all this kind of
stuff<00:04:02.010> like<00:04:02.220> with<00:04:02.430> programming<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.090> what<00:04:03.240> you

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
stuff like with programming is what you

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.180 
stuff like with programming is what you
do<00:04:03.450> is<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.630> start<00:04:03.750> asking<00:04:03.959> people<00:04:04.200> have<00:04:05.100> you

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
do is you start asking people have you

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.980 
do is you start asking people have you
ever<00:04:05.340> thought<00:04:05.550> about<00:04:05.610> having<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.510> mobile<00:04:06.720> app

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
ever thought about having a mobile app

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.170 
ever thought about having a mobile app
developed<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.560> now<00:04:07.890> everybody<00:04:08.730> has<00:04:08.850> an<00:04:08.970> idea

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
developed and now everybody has an idea

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.760 
developed and now everybody has an idea
for<00:04:09.300> a<00:04:09.360> mobile<00:04:09.570> app<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:10.170> you<00:04:10.230> listen<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.650> them

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
for a mobile app so you listen to them

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.460 
for a mobile app so you listen to them
and<00:04:10.920> like<00:04:11.640> in<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:12.420> beginning<00:04:12.540> 90%<00:04:13.320> of<00:04:13.350> them

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
and like in the beginning 90% of them

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.930 
and like in the beginning 90% of them
you're<00:04:13.650> gonna<00:04:13.709> be<00:04:13.890> like<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.250> have<00:04:14.550> no<00:04:14.670> idea<00:04:14.880> how

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
you're gonna be like I have no idea how

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.159 
you're gonna be like I have no idea how
to<00:04:15.000> do<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.150> right<00:04:15.420> but<00:04:15.570> they'll<00:04:15.690> be<00:04:15.750> like<00:04:15.870> 10%

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
to do that right but they'll be like 10%

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.740 
to do that right but they'll be like 10%
we're<00:04:16.500> like<00:04:16.709> I<00:04:16.919> think<00:04:17.520> I<00:04:17.669> can<00:04:17.730> do<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.180> and

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
we're like I think I can do that and

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.810 
we're like I think I can do that and
then<00:04:19.440> you<00:04:19.530> sit<00:04:19.680> down<00:04:19.830> you<00:04:20.040> do<00:04:20.160> it<00:04:20.190> for<00:04:20.489> them<00:04:20.580> and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
then you sit down you do it for them and

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.280 
then you sit down you do it for them and
like<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.090> first<00:04:21.270> one<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.540> do<00:04:21.660> for<00:04:21.840> free<00:04:22.080> and

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
like the first one you do for free and

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.379 
like the first one you do for free and
then<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.890> second<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.280> do<00:04:23.430> for<00:04:23.760> 100

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
then the second you do for 100

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.200 
then the second you do for 100
the<00:04:24.810> 30<00:04:25.050> do<00:04:25.259> for<00:04:25.440> 300<00:04:25.919> bucks<00:04:26.039> and<00:04:26.370> forth<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.090> do

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
problems you think you can solve and go

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.710 
problems you think you can solve and go
for<00:04:36.569> it
