00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.290
 until death is a game of riddles 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.030
 or puzzle in which your main 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.490
 goal will be to release a number 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.150
 specific of souls to move to 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.520
 next level in its first version 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.970
 has 25 levels that we say the 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.910
 first 20 are easy and the last 5 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.060
 they are something a little more complicated like 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.890
 we can see it 's a very nice game 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.890
 but it 's something small 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.170
 at the beginning of each level we will be indicated 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.840
 the number of souls that we must release 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.449
 to go to the next level in the 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.090
 top we can see the number of 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:55.809
 souls 0 of 10 and the red dots of 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.300
 down are our lives we can also 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.660
 see in it 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.559
 time 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.890
 we can call them to the souls to open 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.440
 this door when the arms of 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.710
 blue color is when we can touch them and 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.430
 is when they will tell us if we 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.890
 we touch a soul that is not converted 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.100
 in blue like in this case we're going to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.640
 transform into a demon if that demon 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.320
 touches us will take a life 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.600
 as well 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.090
 but we can also use some 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 advantages like after going through certain 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.600
 walls 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.640
 or use 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.620
 The mode 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:51.130
 if I have what it is when we are not going to 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.130
 be able to detect any other zero 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.630
 as we can see 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.370
 we can keep walking even pass 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.170
 for them and they will not do anything to us 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.630
 we also have a shield 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.729
 that allows us to go through certain areas 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.150
 without being harmed 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.269
 once we have put together our 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.629
 the necessary number of souls in this 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.549
 case of days 10 of 10 we will appear 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.930
 this arrow that will indicate us the 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:27.549
 exit number in some occasions 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.069
 we are going to have to do other things not 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.610
 they will only take more sign as we see here 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.920
 destroy some machines in this case 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.200
 this is a scientist but we can 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.560
 sell them use our advantages 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.270
 how to run 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.319
 here what we have to do is 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.540
 destroy a robot that comes out in this 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.650
 moment but for this we must open 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.650
 all these doors 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.379
 the circle of this circle that we see 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.629
 here will tell us where you are 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.629
 these these souls that we can take 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.080
 once we have this touched 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.830
 this is the robot that we must destroy 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.450
 but once we have already opened all 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.450
 the doors is when we can destroy it 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.010
 there will also be other levels a little 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.220
 different like this where you have 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.220
 what 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:39.490
 that will save 85-85 souls can result 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.040
 easy but if you're wrong 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.450
 it may be more difficult for example 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.220
 here we are going to do it on purpose 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.220
 and we are going to transform many souls 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.440
 as a summary the truth is a very game 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.390
 and yet interesting features 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:03.090
 only 25 levels some are very easy 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.530
 mainly those from the beginning that 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.290
 as you go forward they are doing 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.030
 a little more difficult but it really is 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.120
 a game that will entertain you without 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.940
 But it's not that kind of game that 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.940
 obsessions that you become addicted to him 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.979
 it's more than anything to hang out and 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.189
 really when you have nothing that 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.189
 do
