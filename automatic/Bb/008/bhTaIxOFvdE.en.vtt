00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.270
 simpler ingredients but then 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.820

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.980
 first you take to expose our sea bream 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.440
 in clay pot that is better 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.530
 true of the typical Madrid hoop and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.390

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.390
 mud the whole bream I do not know if clean 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.480

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.040
 where is the rate that the 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.120
 very good rate manager as nothing 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.530

 three cuts would come out as we do 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.440
 to process now a lemon one the 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.530
 lemon you have seen no yolanda we give you three 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.590
 cuts is big big and we cut 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.000
 slices of lemon lime and place it 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.470
 here 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.800
 in the cuts that we have made to 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.930

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.180
 of lemon 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.110
 we put salt to suit each person 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:06.010
 Clear 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:09.880
 and let's go to the rest and now tomato sauce 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.600
 but this I have done here for the tavern 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.010
 here everything fresh here all caserito is 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.450
 clear that if you've seen in the analyze if 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.960
 we do not put the tomato donato on top 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.510
 of the vescovo vale vale I take note I already 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.360

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.250
 we tossed shake stirred a powder in this 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.600
 case you have seen there is no great slam powder 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.950
 Clear 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.630
 other times we are always there that if 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.570
 chop the garlic that yes by the way 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.610
 apply the garlic but quickly we put a 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.780
 little bit of parsley that has to be 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.090
 dry parsley 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.250
 you've seen Ireland not garlic powder and in 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.959
 this dry parsley case we said the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.930
 fresh fish the parsley and that we 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.850
 lack we do not put here the man rayadito 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.130
 as for us to order a little 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.240
 when we put it in the oven there it gives a 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.880
 little more of confidence stays covered 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:07.330
 the sea bream and gives a good presentation 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:10.700
 then we throw here the oil that is 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.510
 very simple fast but you have to follow 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.120
 all the steps of a cigar to see you 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.120
 review we have made the lemon we have 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.220
 put the garlic the breadcrumbs the parsley 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.380
 good tomato sauce and now that we 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.260
 lack does not lack wine white wine 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.450
 above the white wine above 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.800
 today what a rich thing for us to come out very 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.080
 nice and very tasty 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.760
 I like I like this recipe and the 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.490
 the person you want is to the taste of each 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.740
 rather one can only won a 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.030
 little more oil a little more 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.300
 it may be because you take tomato a 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.550
 little parsley like the way and there that 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.040
 you have shots in the frying pan bird in the 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.100
 skillet the bakery potato listening to it 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.420
 The've done as you have done with 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.960
 onion onion already putting the potato 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:06.690
 cut in julienne and support and this is 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.940
 already the potatoes already know a little 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.570
 Onion in exact julienne and on fire 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.570
 slow true 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.799
 those are also made and the 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.900
 we incorporate to our jail and it is 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.120
 true all the ingredients put what 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.370
 incorporated here to the casserole 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.169
 is worth today how much more I like honey 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.729
 fish with potatoes also because it has 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.970
 to go to a little bit of the sea bream so that 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.500
 give a better presentation and great 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.350
 now what do we do with this because this 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.550
 Yolanda is already here and now that she is 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.100
 oven 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.320
 and while it takes the oven Thomas 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.520
 I tell you we have not told you we are in 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.290
 the daniela that is a site 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.270
 traditionally known by the 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.250
 cooked but they also have some breams 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.199
 very rich and tomás told me i want 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.940
 show you another dish that we have in 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.470
 the restaurant that are the croquettes of 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.240
 cooked that we have been told that since 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:02.300
 they already have them people do not ask for 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:03.680
 ham because it's true that he cast forth to 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.479
 the cooked croquettes because while 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.100
 our bream is made, we are going to give it to 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.050
 people a little trick to be able to do them 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:15.370
 because with what meat you do them here 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:18.009
 with the third turned over codelco and that 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.420
 meat if we have morcilla here 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:25.500
 chorizo ​​sausage 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.210
 the bacon or chicken and ham tip and what 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.030
 what you have to do is chop the meat well 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.420
 chopped and the truth explain everything very 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.710
 very chopped everything and this we do with 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.330
 this first thing to do is what 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.000
 first thing to do, look that the 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:42.060
 pan and handrail 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.960
 and steal it in the fire 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:48.240
 and fix everything from the cooked 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.780
 you will have seen no yolanda and a success 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.780
 this 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.570
 is when we start making the bechamel 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.150
 not what would be done would be 200 grams of 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.820
 flour you've seen in Ireland the thing is 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.890
 the thing is to chop the meat well chopped in 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.330
 this case of cooked meat and not of 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.330
 the remains because this is not the remains 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.010
 of these are the cooked meat chop it 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.930
 I saw Maria and she starts doing the 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.790
 Exact bechamel is made with the 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.380
 butter then you put the flour and 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:20.210
 Now it's making a traditional bechamel 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:24.360
 he puts the flour he puts milk now 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:27.000
 Warm installation a little more 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.310
 the little warmth that golden little color that 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.819
 your point has to be exact 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.590
 seen not yolanda that simple that you go 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:37.199
 to animate to make cooked croquettes 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.400
 I'm going to think about it for the first time 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.469
 tanger the cooked and it costs me enough 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.479
 is to see how gas remains because we are not going to 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:44.849
 teach how they are going to teach how 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:46.710
 it's good we leave the bechamel there and 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:48.960
 while we remove the sea bream we see how 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.099
 good while you take the bream out 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.780
 I will show you how is this 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:53.280
 bechamel life that's how it looks then 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.590
 truth amelia that with lugo is doing 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.000
 some traditional croquettes and look 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.770
 how is it then the croquettes that 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:05.219
 true are croquettes xxl my mother yes

 I'm going to measure it so good and good 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:13.080
 you will see to come to know the visa and you 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:14.699
 we let go is by the way we have not said 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.539
 how much is worth eating here in the restaurant 

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:20.330
 thirty-odd euros 35 worth the 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:22.979
 Bream is a bit more luxurious but good 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.389
 with this I say goodbye yolanda good 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:27.379
