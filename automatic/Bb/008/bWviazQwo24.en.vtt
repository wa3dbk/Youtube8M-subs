00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
surprising to me yeah but at that point

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.780 
surprising to me yeah but at that point
it<00:03:24.380> had<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.620> move<00:03:24.710> those<00:03:24.920> Breton<00:03:25.490> no<00:03:25.610> more

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
three in fact 30 so if you could get

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.130 
three in fact 30 so if you could get
back<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.210> better<00:03:29.240> have<00:03:29.510> another<00:03:29.660> grunts<00:03:30.080> I

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
back you better have another grunts I

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.480 
back you better have another grunts I
could<00:03:30.290> go<00:03:30.380> back<00:03:30.530> here<00:03:30.710> we<00:03:30.770> got<00:03:30.920> taken<00:03:31.100> down<00:03:31.310> but

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
could go back here we got taken down but

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.860 
could go back here we got taken down but
at<00:03:31.700> that<00:03:31.730> point<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.150> was<00:03:32.240> the<00:03:32.390> end<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.540> that<00:03:32.600> too

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
at that point it was the end of that too

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.320 
at that point it was the end of that too
and<00:03:33.110> sure<00:03:33.350> so<00:03:34.340> grunts<00:03:34.640> is<00:03:34.760> better<00:03:34.970> it's<00:03:35.150> just<00:03:35.270> a

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
and sure so grunts is better it's just a

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.570 
and sure so grunts is better it's just a
quick<00:03:35.510> question<00:03:35.630> occurred<00:03:36.050> about<00:03:36.680> this<00:03:36.890> so<00:03:37.400> at

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
quick question occurred about this so at

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.390 
quick question occurred about this so at
that<00:03:37.730> point<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:38.300> thought<00:03:39.160> what<00:03:40.160> do<00:03:40.220> you<00:03:40.280> think

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
that point I thought what do you think

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.430 
that point I thought what do you think
of<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:40.520> format<00:03:40.790> in<00:03:40.880> general<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:41.420> think<00:03:42.140> it's

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
of this format in general I think it's

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.250 
of this format in general I think it's
good<00:03:42.710> I<00:03:43.040> I<00:03:43.550> don't<00:03:43.850> like<00:03:43.970> green<00:03:44.210> okay<00:03:44.960> I<00:03:45.110> like

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
good I I don't like green okay I like

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.020 
good I I don't like green okay I like
degree<00:03:45.530> 6<00:03:45.710> colors<00:03:46.040> I'm<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.310> fan<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.670> light<00:03:46.910> in

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
degree 6 colors I'm a fan of light in

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.720 
degree 6 colors I'm a fan of light in
here<00:03:47.150> fair<00:03:47.960> enough<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:48.470> I<00:03:48.590> I<00:03:48.950> think<00:03:49.640> either

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
here fair enough and I I think either

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.060 
here fair enough and I I think either
you<00:03:49.940> go<00:03:50.060> like<00:03:50.420> really<00:03:51.020> aggressive<00:03:51.530> suburban

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
you go like really aggressive suburban

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.670 
you go like really aggressive suburban
controllers<00:03:52.550> okay<00:03:53.170> so<00:03:54.170> when<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.380> sit<00:03:54.530> down<00:03:54.560> to

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
controllers okay so when you sit down to

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.930 
controllers okay so when you sit down to
draft<00:03:55.010> there's<00:03:55.280> nothing<00:03:55.580> you're<00:03:55.670> trying<00:03:55.880> to

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.650 
three times so there just wasn't a ton
of<00:04:48.770> red<00:04:48.950> coming<00:04:49.220> through<00:04:49.310> there<00:04:49.490> so<00:04:50.450> you<00:04:50.510> like

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
of red coming through there so you like

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.940 
of red coming through there so you like
your<00:04:50.780> chances<00:04:50.900> with<00:04:51.110> this<00:04:51.290> egg<00:04:51.440> look<00:04:51.590> how<00:04:51.770> good

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
your chances with this egg look how good

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.710 
your chances with this egg look how good
is<00:04:52.130> this<00:04:52.280> deck<00:04:52.490> is<00:04:52.520> this<00:04:52.760> a<00:04:52.790> I<00:04:53.210> think<00:04:53.510> it's<00:04:53.660> a

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
is this deck is this a I think it's a

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.300 
is this deck is this a I think it's a
2-1<00:04:54.020> but<00:04:54.200> it<00:04:54.380> doesn't<00:04:54.590> have<00:04:54.650> many<00:04:54.860> ball

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
2-1 but it doesn't have many ball

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.880 
2-1 but it doesn't have many ball
but<00:04:55.520> what<00:04:55.760> has<00:04:56.210> application<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:56.930> just<00:04:57.140> be

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
but what has application to just be

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.500 
but what has application to just be
relaxed<00:04:58.250> physics<00:04:58.670> I'm<00:04:58.820> actually<00:04:59.060> going<00:04:59.390> to

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
relaxed physics I'm actually going to

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.350 
relaxed physics I'm actually going to
overhear<00:04:59.900> removal<00:05:00.560> take<00:05:00.770> two<00:05:01.090> lycra<00:05:02.090> trees

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
overhear removal take two lycra trees

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.570 
overhear removal take two lycra trees
that<00:05:02.570> become<00:05:02.750> full<00:05:02.960> force<00:05:03.170> nice<00:05:03.320> turn<00:05:03.530> so<00:05:04.160> you

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
that become full force nice turn so you

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.860 
that become full force nice turn so you
might<00:05:04.760> just<00:05:04.940> beat<00:05:05.150> everything<00:05:05.390> I<00:05:05.600> matter<00:05:05.750> how

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
might just beat everything I matter how

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.900 
might just beat everything I matter how
good<00:05:06.020> your<00:05:06.140> back<00:05:06.290> is<00:05:06.440> just<00:05:06.920> like<00:05:07.130> levels<00:05:07.820> of

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
good your back is just like levels of

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.450 
good your back is just like levels of
insulin<00:05:08.150> drop<00:05:08.660> and<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:08.930> glutes<00:05:09.280> but<00:05:10.280> you

insulin drop and the glutes but you

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.220 
insulin drop and the glutes but you
might<00:05:10.700> also<00:05:10.910> run<00:05:11.240> into<00:05:11.480> like<00:05:11.600> prepared<00:05:12.080> with

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
character are sharing business so you've

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.290 
character are sharing business so you've
got<00:05:15.500> yourself<00:05:15.890> sitting<00:05:16.220> on<00:05:16.310> 71<00:05:16.940> at<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.150> end<00:05:17.270> of

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
got yourself sitting on 71 at the end of

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.480 
got yourself sitting on 71 at the end of
the<00:05:17.390> day<00:05:17.510> is<00:05:17.720> that<00:05:17.840> the<00:05:17.990> printed<00:05:18.920> prediction

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
the day is that the printed prediction

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.300 
the day is that the printed prediction
yeah<00:05:20.030> either<00:05:20.840> Simon<00:05:21.290> or<00:05:21.320> eagle<00:05:21.770> I<00:05:21.920> will<00:05:22.190> be<00:05:22.280> a

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
yeah either Simon or eagle I will be a

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.780 
yeah either Simon or eagle I will be a
variance<00:05:22.610> of<00:05:22.700> my<00:05:22.790> research<00:05:23.680> caranavi<00:05:24.680> well<00:05:25.670> we

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
variance of my research caranavi well we

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
variance of my research caranavi well we
should<00:05:25.970> we<00:05:26.090> be<00:05:26.210> watching<00:05:26.330> you<00:05:26.600> tomorrow

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
you'll be near the top of the standings

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.800 
you'll be near the top of the standings
when<00:05:28.190> tomorrow<00:05:28.430> starts<00:05:28.520> one<00:05:29.420> way<00:05:29.570> or<00:05:29.750> the

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
when tomorrow starts one way or the

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.110
