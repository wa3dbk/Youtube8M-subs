00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.450
 hello youtube we are here in a new 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:10.960
 video and good today we are going to give them 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.759
 I'm going to teach how to make a few 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.680
 chests that can be blocked and 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:19.920
 unlock with a simple 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.390
 password so to speak good first 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.730
 I will explain how it works more or 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.020
 except this can only be done with these 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:34.050
 materials with earth wood these 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:35.660
 bricks the sandstone the wood this is not 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.720
 it is affordable 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.710
 this man the good that thing the 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:47.450
 neder and with quartz and good then explains 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.480
 to start if we put a chest under 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.690
 of a block 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.050
 Now I show you 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.039
 of kings if we put a chest under 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.720
 a block is going to block but 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.540
 I'm the one but 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.430
 we can put a step of it 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.430
 material than the other blocks 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.969
 and it will look exactly the same 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.540
 as if it were the wall but in this case 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.390
 if it can be unlocked 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.330
 do not 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.390
 and now we can make them block and 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.000
 unlock when we want so we have 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.300
 to see to do this we have to put 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.320
 the chest in this way can not be of 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.830
 the sim ni 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.840
 not so 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.000
 it has to be necessarily on the side of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.770
 equal to what side but good we have 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.659
 that put another being that double 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.329
 A) Yes 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.020
 and now what is going to happen is that 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.020
 put this 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.780
 if it can be unlocked but when 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.000
 let's try here blocks 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.700
 although on this side you can unlock 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.160
 when the other is covered, it will block and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.740
 well what we are going to do is here 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.140
 fill up a little like that not like that and give it three 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.560
 of height from the good 4 counting the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.580
 first 2 3 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.830
 1 2 3 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.870
 12 32 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.330
 here equal 2 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.060
 and two but good this wall remains 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.860
 or better you have to put it but it was very 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.920
 important that here on this side not 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:45.100
 put nothing and there put on the 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.400
 second trunk put three earth 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.680
 this is mandatory if it will not work 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.890
 and good now what has to be done 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.910
 He is now locked 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.630
 paul but when we will make this land it 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.030
 will unlock 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.310
 will be unlocked and when you 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.250
 let's give the second of earth to the second 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.620
 block of ground is blocked and so 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.840
 we can play with this thing there was left 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.700
 blocked blocked blocked 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.520
 unlocked by was unlocked not 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.620
 there is blocked 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.620
 there is unlocked 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.340
 there the earth went 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.150
 I unlocked 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.650
 and blocked 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.210
 but here what I would do would be to cover 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.840
 here also and that simply that is the 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.700
 land 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.069
 It is very important that they be three because 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.819
 if there was not a point where yes 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:52.760
 we remove the third one unlocks 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.430
 and it can no longer be blocked 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.829
 it is unlocked again but you can not 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.150
 back to block there I'm playing and 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.150
 when put is 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.120
 again blocked 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.299
 unlocked 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.150
 and blocked and good as always he came back 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.159
 to be the house is 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.290
 and I 'm going to show you how they can put it 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.410
 in your case they would have to do good 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.210
 they would have to put two blocks of wood 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.520
 and other two of other good not wooden 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.220
 necessarily but that any of the 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.139
 that has steps can be what I'm going to 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.620
 be better of quartz that I like more 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:39.120
 good would be to put two quartz 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.280
 well and put a 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.440
 they are not the best I am going to change it because 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:49.169
 is going to be confused a little with the house 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.719
 I'm not going to do it with brick 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.909
 where is the brick block here is 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.840
 would put two is left a space of two and 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:05:01.800
 two more are put 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:06.569
 now with the trunk they have to put on 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:10.050
 this equal way of the double-double chest 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:13.490
 and now what should be done is 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.490
 put a 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:20.159
 in this 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.439
 a step of that material so that 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:28.860
 conceals and it does not matter if it is the other way around 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:28.860
 well because it can also be opened 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.290
 now we take here 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:38.500
 the same thing that we cover up 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.230
 to the top 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.830
 I here put the third 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:48.180
 then they had to put equal 3 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:52.129
 here is the 3 2 1 and it's blocked 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:58.200
 now equal with the 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:06:02.160
 with the voice simply there is unlocked 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:07.230
 and equipment and here blocks is very simple 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.720
 from block to block to block to block 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:12.540
 and well we could have our 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.420
 more protected things so to speak of 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.070
 somehow and well this is all for 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.800
 today's video I hope you have them 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.430
 liked like and subscribe for 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.930
 plus 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.930
 and good, goodbye
