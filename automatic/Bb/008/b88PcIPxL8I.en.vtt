pretty<00:02:09.399> simple<00:02:09.700> i<00:02:10.090> think<00:02:10.569> at<00:02:10.630> some<00:02:10.750> point

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
pretty simple i think at some point

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.600 
pretty simple i think at some point
they'll<00:02:11.170> probably<00:02:11.440> change<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.490> little

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
they'll probably change that a little

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.870 
they'll probably change that a little
bit<00:02:12.970> like<00:02:13.660> we<00:02:13.780> would<00:02:13.840> make<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.050> lot<00:02:14.260> more<00:02:14.320> fun

pans<00:02:35.030> out<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.719> think<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:36.139> Mexica<00:02:36.409> 1000<00:02:36.859> is

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
pans out I think the Mexica 1000 is

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.229 
pans out I think the Mexica 1000 is
coming<00:02:37.129> in<00:02:37.189> a<00:02:37.280> good<00:02:37.459> time<00:02:37.670> actually<00:02:37.909> i<00:02:38.180> think

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
coming in a good time actually i think

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.629 
coming in a good time actually i think
that<00:02:38.769> there's<00:02:39.769> a<00:02:39.859> lot<00:02:40.069> of<00:02:40.099> people<00:02:40.250> who<00:02:40.489> might

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
that there's a lot of people who might

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.709 
that there's a lot of people who might
be<00:02:42.909> intimidated<00:02:43.909> or<00:02:44.000> just<00:02:44.269> wanted<00:02:44.510> something

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:44.719
