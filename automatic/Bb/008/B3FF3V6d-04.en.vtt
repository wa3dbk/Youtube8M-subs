00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 you have it clear if we start at 3 1 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.589
 2. 3 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.110
 hello good kids we are here 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.500
 new video what I've always wanted 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.880
 do mine good guys well 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.670
 we are here as you see I am with my 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.160
 girlfriend who is the frame and let's play 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.350
 a game of weapons game and going 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.539
 the command in every death that we get 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.550
 we should not be at the bottom of each 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.539
 death do to us so change a 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.539
 little why 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.840
 let's see the weapons game to see if 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.239
 we found a game that is not 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.649
 started and if not then I put directly 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.649
 one that is already entered and 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.079
 let's go but let's see this so 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.050
 they carry many masses because if they do not take 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.969
 advantages and this will be impossible yes 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.769
 at least we start with equality as 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.299
 better we can do something not win it by 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.299
 than to win them I see it impossible with 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.270
 m 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.250
 let's see better 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.380
 with three casualties 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.820
 we can hit when we 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.990
 We tried her is that she played very 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.590
 little to this game 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.360
 in a live that I did and well it will be 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.690
 a game of searching and destroying it and with 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.690
 the franc the part that was 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:36.310
 and it took a while for us to clarify that 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:40.550
 skip the versada or you will have already removed 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.470
 some games for that to 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.500
 teach yourself a little about jumping 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.500
 and all that I do not see very clearly 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.520
 answer 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.460
 if we catch one since we have to go 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.690
 well 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.460
 and on top of that I also have to say that at 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.380
 be in an account with the club with the 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.720
 that is not found is pretty good 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.970
 then from her then as if 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.500
 it costs a lot we should not create it 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.070
 an account so 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.070
 if we can 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.810
 to try to say then that kill a 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.790
 little bit easier because of course 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.790
 and it costs more 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.050
 from rafa to mother 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.010
 all right 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.330
 bengasi or girlfriend or another 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.260
 whatever it is 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.260
 Y 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.230
 hide 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.230
 and always more to the people who jump 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.620
 come on 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.020
 and her 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.110
 we find each other 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.610
 while I look for it 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.060
 is loosing 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.560
 and there is always someone still 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.870
 to point below 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.520
 here is always good 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:36.970
 I wait for you 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.490
 or not 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.730
 Mr 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.280
 I'm a bit touched 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.090
 like reds and browns I could 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.889
 this water 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.639
 this must this 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.639
 safe 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.820
 no this 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.310
 come on 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:24.980
 there you have it 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.719
 it's going very fast and safe 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:50.250
 the most normal is highly us 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:03.629
 or 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.280
 6 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.430
 hi yo 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.680
 and again that is firing so 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.680
 automatic 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.070
 22 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.219
 I'm not getting very nervous 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.629
 but 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:11.629
 but 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:40.800
 we have got the truth but good if 

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:42.479
 the video is cool because we will try to play 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:48.919
 more and see if we can win any 

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:48.919
 it does not look good 

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.620
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.620
 next
