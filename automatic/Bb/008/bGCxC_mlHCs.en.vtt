00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
course that of course that's almost

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.809

certainly that's just a dream right
but<00:03:28.569> the<00:03:28.690> I'm<00:03:28.840> already<00:03:29.260> here<00:03:29.620> was<00:03:29.859> quite<00:03:30.010> a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
but the I'm already here was quite a

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.120 
but the I'm already here was quite a
significant<00:03:30.790> thing<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.239> was<00:03:31.799> really<00:03:32.799> trying

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
significant thing so I was really trying

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.449 
significant thing so I was really trying
to<00:03:33.310> find<00:03:33.549> some<00:03:33.880> answers<00:03:34.150> some<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:35.310> read<00:03:36.310> all

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
to find some answers some I read all

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.220 
to find some answers some I read all
these<00:03:36.609> books<00:03:36.910> about<00:03:37.180> Catholicism<00:03:37.510> for

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
these books about Catholicism for

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.199 
these books about Catholicism for
example<00:03:38.739> thinking<00:03:39.280> I'd<00:03:39.459> be<00:03:39.669> very<00:03:39.819> happy<00:03:39.970> to

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
example thinking I'd be very happy to

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.180 
example thinking I'd be very happy to
prove<00:03:40.569> it<00:03:40.840> one<00:03:41.109> way<00:03:41.139> or<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:41.470> other<00:03:41.530> if<00:03:41.829> I<00:03:41.980> read

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190

something<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.430> think<00:03:42.609> I<00:03:42.669> can't<00:03:42.940> possibly<00:03:43.120> go

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480
