00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
cycles you know you just may be a little

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.290 
cycles you know you just may be a little
high<00:00:48.960> reps<00:00:49.320> towards<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.100> end<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:50.940> helps

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
high reps towards the end you know helps

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.040 
high reps towards the end you know helps
to<00:00:51.480> bring<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.870> little<00:00:51.989> more<00:00:52.140> definition

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
to bring in a little more definition

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.000 
to bring in a little more definition
basically<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.410> start<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.800> bench

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
basically I like to start with a bench

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.779 
basically I like to start with a bench
press<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.670> know<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.360> one<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> basic

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
press you know it's one of the basic

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.959 
press you know it's one of the basic

know then I'll go into a nice stretching

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.850 
know then I'll go into a nice stretching
move<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> fly<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.080> know<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> slight

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
move like a fly you know a slight

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.310 
move like a fly you know a slight
incline<00:01:26.220> fly<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.700> first<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.750> know<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.140> then

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
incline fly at first you know and then

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.990 
incline fly at first you know and then
do<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> few<00:01:28.979> sets<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.310> those<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.729> I'll<00:01:29.790> switch

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
do a few sets of those and I'll switch

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.749 
do a few sets of those and I'll switch
it<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.299> slight<00:01:30.600> decline<00:01:31.079> fly<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
it to a slight decline fly you know and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.480 
it to a slight decline fly you know and
that<00:01:33.150> helps<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:34.829> give<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> good

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that helps you really give you a good

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.210 
that helps you really give you a good
stretch<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.240> those<00:01:36.689> pecs<00:01:37.020> because<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.890> bench

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
stretch for those pecs because a bench

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.810 
stretch for those pecs because a bench
press<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:40.009> compound<00:01:41.009> contraction

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
press is a like a compound contraction

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.800 
press is a like a compound contraction
move<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.229> fly<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.890> stretching<00:01:44.729> move<00:01:44.939> kind

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
move and a fly is a stretching move kind

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.300 
move and a fly is a stretching move kind
of<00:01:45.899> does<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> couple<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.560> different<00:01:46.890> things<00:01:47.070> you

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
of does a couple of different things you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.069 
of does a couple of different things you
know<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.880> fly<00:01:48.390> actually<00:01:50.149> creates<00:01:51.149> more

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
know the fly actually creates more

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.020 
know the fly actually creates more
muscle<00:01:52.590> fibers<00:01:52.619> because<00:01:53.549> you're<00:01:53.670> stretching

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
muscle fibers because you're stretching

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.870 
muscle fibers because you're stretching
it<00:01:54.270> farther<00:01:54.659> it'll<00:01:55.259> split<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> fibers<00:01:56.219> you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
it farther it'll split the fibers you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.480 
it farther it'll split the fibers you
know<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:58.320> when<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.500> come<00:01:58.680> into<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.009> fly<00:01:59.219> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
know so when you come into the fly and
