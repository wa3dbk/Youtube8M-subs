with<00:01:17.090> almost<00:01:18.090> same<00:01:18.630> wheels<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.560> see<00:01:19.890> it

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
with almost same wheels you can see it

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.140 
with almost same wheels you can see it
looks<00:01:20.820> pretty<00:01:20.970> scale<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.630> well<00:01:21.979> but<00:01:23.000> there<00:01:24.000> are

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
looks pretty scale as well but there are

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.380 
looks pretty scale as well but there are
beadlocks<00:01:25.280> looks<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:26.490> homemade<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
beadlocks looks like homemade but it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.260 
beadlocks looks like homemade but it
actually<00:01:27.780> works<00:01:28.170> very<00:01:28.290> well<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.829> if<00:01:28.950> you

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
actually works very well and if you

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.050 
actually works very well and if you
wanted<00:01:30.270> them<00:01:30.650> just<00:01:31.650> send<00:01:32.130> me<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.310> message<00:01:32.790> you

can have them for twenty-five dollars
plus<00:01:36.210> shipping<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:37.110> 404<00:01:39.619> well<00:01:40.619> also<00:01:40.799> back<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
plus shipping but 404 well also back to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.450 
plus shipping but 404 well also back to
the<00:01:41.369> tire<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.649> thread

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
the tire you can see that the thread

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.969 
the tire you can see that the thread
pattern<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.240> quite<00:01:45.600> deep<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.619> actually

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
pattern is quite deep and it actually

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.850 
pattern is quite deep and it actually
works<00:01:47.520> very<00:01:47.670> well<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.200> tires<00:01:49.439> are<00:01:49.649> also

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
works very well so the tires are also

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.539 
works very well so the tires are also
very<00:01:50.310> sticky<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.210> soft<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.130> see<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
very sticky and soft you can see the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.330 
very sticky and soft you can see the
dead<00:01:53.759> land<00:01:54.119> rover<00:01:54.509> which<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.079> not<00:01:55.340> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
dead land rover which is not the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.440 
dead land rover which is not the
lightest<00:01:56.759> vehicle

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.620 

is<00:02:01.310> actually<00:02:02.780> squeezing<00:02:03.780> them<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> bit<00:02:05.630> and

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
is actually squeezing them a bit and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.330 
is actually squeezing them a bit and
they<00:02:06.869> work<00:02:07.049> very<00:02:07.079> well<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:08.069> only

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
they work very well the only

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.680 
they work very well the only
disadvantage<00:02:09.440> might<00:02:10.440> be<00:02:10.769> due<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> its<00:02:12.120> small

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
disadvantage might be due to its small

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.589 
disadvantage might be due to its small
size<00:02:13.019> which<00:02:13.349> actually<00:02:13.620> looks<00:02:14.069> great<00:02:14.760> on<00:02:15.120> this

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
size which actually looks great on this

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.970 
size which actually looks great on this
vehicle<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.230> clearance<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.440> not<00:02:19.470> so

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
vehicle that the clearance is not so

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.910 
vehicle that the clearance is not so
high<00:02:22.160> well<00:02:23.160> another<00:02:23.880> tire<00:02:24.470> which<00:02:25.470> we<00:02:25.709> have

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
high well another tire which we have

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.440 
high well another tire which we have
here<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.630> actually<00:02:27.630> much<00:02:28.590> plugger<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:30.120> scale

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
here is actually much plugger the scale

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.860 
here is actually much plugger the scale
tire<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:32.190> can<00:02:32.340> see<00:02:32.519> where<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.690> buy

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
tire you can see where you can you buy

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.610 
tire you can see where you can you buy
it<00:02:35.299> it's<00:02:36.299> much<00:02:36.599> more<00:02:36.810> expensive<00:02:37.140> than<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
it it's much more expensive than the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.490 
it it's much more expensive than the
previous<00:02:38.099> one<00:02:38.430> but<00:02:38.880> it's<00:02:39.120> like<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.959> others

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.000 

this<00:02:43.500> looks<00:02:43.769> really<00:02:43.980> nice<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:45.860> actually<00:02:46.860> this

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
this looks really nice and actually this

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:55.120 
this looks really nice and actually this

which<00:02:56.130> is<00:02:57.140> actually<00:02:58.140> installed<00:02:59.040> on<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.400> car

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
which is actually installed on this car

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.490 
which is actually installed on this car
so<00:03:01.380> if<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.650> buy<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:01.920> for<00:03:02.870> few<00:03:03.870> hundred<00:03:04.170> dollars

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
so if you buy it for few hundred dollars

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.740 
so if you buy it for few hundred dollars
I<00:03:04.829> bought<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:05.639> for<00:03:05.880> five<00:03:06.150> hundred<00:03:06.299> dollars

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
I bought this for five hundred dollars

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.599 
I bought this for five hundred dollars
is<00:03:06.900> RT<00:03:07.590> r<00:03:09.560> then<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:12.540> comes<00:03:12.840> with<00:03:13.290> these<00:03:13.650> wheels

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
is RT r then it comes with these wheels

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.800 
is RT r then it comes with these wheels
I<00:03:15.090> will<00:03:15.810> show<00:03:16.019> you<00:03:16.079> how<00:03:16.200> they<00:03:16.560> look<00:03:16.769> like<00:03:16.980> on

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
I will show you how they look like on

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.699 
I will show you how they look like on
this<00:03:18.810> nice<00:03:19.109> def<00:03:20.810> so<00:03:21.810> they<00:03:21.989> are<00:03:22.139> bigger

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
this nice def so they are bigger

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.199 
this nice def so they are bigger
actually<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:24.540> can<00:03:24.690> see<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:25.079> difference

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
actually you can see that difference

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.580 
actually you can see that difference
looks<00:03:27.209> like<00:03:27.389> much<00:03:27.720> bigger<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.230> then<00:03:28.380> there

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
looks like much bigger and then there

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.650 
looks like much bigger and then there
you<00:03:28.709> really<00:03:29.100> are<00:03:31.430> as<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.579> said<00:03:32.790> scale<00:03:33.180> tire<00:03:33.420> so

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
you really are as I said scale tire so

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.140 
you really are as I said scale tire so
you<00:03:33.750> can<00:03:33.900> see<00:03:34.139> it<00:03:34.260> on<00:03:34.620> real<00:03:34.980> vehicle<00:03:35.489> which<00:03:36.030> is

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
you can see it on real vehicle which is

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
you can see it on real vehicle which is
nice<00:03:36.389> but<00:03:37.109> in<00:03:37.829> comparison<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:39.120> our<00:03:39.389> a<00:03:40.760> 1028

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
nice but in comparison to our a 1028

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.160 
nice but in comparison to our a 1028
they<00:03:43.170> don't<00:03:43.650> perform<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.579> well<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:45.569> advantage

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
they don't perform so well the advantage

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.819 
they don't perform so well the advantage
is<00:03:46.349> the<00:03:46.620> clearance<00:03:47.160> it's<00:03:47.549> higher<00:03:47.819> you<00:03:48.209> can<00:03:48.389> see

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
is the clearance it's higher you can see

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:56.900 
is the clearance it's higher you can see
this<00:03:49.829> bigger<00:03:50.870> but<00:03:51.870> they<00:03:52.139> are<00:03:52.200> also<00:03:52.410> thinner<00:03:52.859> so

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.230 

can<00:03:57.120> check<00:03:57.360> this<00:03:58.220> huge<00:03:59.220> difference<00:03:59.820> action

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
can check this huge difference action

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.720 
can check this huge difference action
and<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:02.730> trip<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.870> tread<00:04:04.770> pattern<00:04:04.800> is<00:04:05.430> not

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
and the trip is the tread pattern is not

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.420 
and the trip is the tread pattern is not
so<00:04:05.940> deep<00:04:06.210> which<00:04:06.690> means<00:04:07.020> that<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.380> spin<00:04:07.770> that

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
so deep which means that the spin that

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.480 
so deep which means that the spin that
the<00:04:08.700> wheels<00:04:08.940> can<00:04:09.270> spin<00:04:09.750> much<00:04:10.590> more<00:04:10.890> easily<00:04:11.100> and

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
the wheels can spin much more easily and

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:18.620 
the wheels can spin much more easily and
they<00:04:12.180> do<00:04:12.240> actually<00:04:15.200> well<00:04:16.400> last<00:04:17.400> tighter<00:04:17.730> 1.9

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
they do actually well last tighter 1.9

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.660 
they do actually well last tighter 1.9
again<00:04:19.470> is<00:04:20.180> called<00:04:21.180> rock<00:04:21.720> stompers<00:04:22.460> it's<00:04:23.460> also

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
again is called rock stompers it's also

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:30.110 
again is called rock stompers it's also
by<00:04:24.000> RC<00:04:24.720> w<00:04:24.870> is<00:04:25.800> 4wd<00:04:28.550> it's<00:04:29.550> actually<00:04:29.700> cheaper

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
by RC w is 4wd it's actually cheaper

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.260 
by RC w is 4wd it's actually cheaper
than<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.510> previous<00:04:30.930> one<00:04:31.170> and<00:04:31.790> it's<00:04:32.790> I<00:04:33.150> think

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
than the previous one and it's I think

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.350 
than the previous one and it's I think
the<00:04:33.600> most<00:04:33.840> aggressive<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.400> biggest<00:04:35.790> tire

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
the most aggressive and the biggest tire

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.040 
the most aggressive and the biggest tire
of<00:04:36.870> this<00:04:37.110> three<00:04:37.650> at<00:04:37.770> least<00:04:38.660> so<00:04:39.660> it's<00:04:39.810> really

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
of this three at least so it's really

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.110 
of this three at least so it's really
huge<00:04:40.620> I<00:04:41.720> haven't<00:04:42.720> tried<00:04:43.020> it<00:04:43.050> yet<00:04:43.200> but<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:45.090> looks

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
huge I haven't tried it yet but it looks

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.580 
huge I haven't tried it yet but it looks
quite<00:04:45.600> sticky<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:48.600> pattern<00:04:49.050> is<00:04:49.230> also

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
quite sticky and the pattern is also

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.650 
quite sticky and the pattern is also
very<00:04:49.740> aggressive<00:04:50.370> so<00:04:50.640> you<00:04:50.910> can<00:04:51.090> see<00:04:51.300> you<00:04:51.390> when

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
very aggressive so you can see you when

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.290 
very aggressive so you can see you when
I<00:04:51.690> touch<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:51.990> then<00:04:52.320> it's<00:04:52.530> it's<00:04:53.250> really<00:04:54.030> hard

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
I touch it then it's it's really hard

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.040 
I touch it then it's it's really hard
and<00:04:55.260> how<00:04:55.410> they<00:04:55.650> look<00:04:55.860> like<00:04:56.070> on<00:04:56.430> on<00:04:56.730> deaf<00:04:57.000> it's

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:08.090 

you<00:05:01.050> can<00:05:01.260> see<00:05:01.530> it<00:05:01.620> here<00:05:04.760> the<00:05:05.760> really<00:05:06.390> huge<00:05:07.170> yeah

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
you can see it here the really huge yeah

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.980 
you can see it here the really huge yeah
you<00:05:09.090> can<00:05:09.300> see<00:05:09.570> here<00:05:10.050> this<00:05:10.650> is<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:10.860> problem<00:05:11.460> the

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
you can see here this is the problem the

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.960 
you can see here this is the problem the
doesn't<00:05:12.990> fit<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.300> body<00:05:15.540> so<00:05:16.020> well<00:05:16.940> so<00:05:17.940> i

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
doesn't fit to the body so well so i

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.900 
doesn't fit to the body so well so i
think<00:05:18.120> i<00:05:18.450> want<00:05:18.630> have<00:05:18.750> to<00:05:18.900> cut<00:05:19.169> this<00:05:19.919> part<00:05:20.250> a<00:05:20.610> bit

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
think i want have to cut this part a bit

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.330 
think i want have to cut this part a bit
around<00:05:22.190> it<00:05:23.190> maybe<00:05:23.550> put<00:05:24.650> the<00:05:25.650> clearance<00:05:26.130> bit

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
around it maybe put the clearance bit

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.790 
around it maybe put the clearance bit
harder<00:05:26.700> this<00:05:27.590> it<00:05:28.590> should<00:05:28.800> be<00:05:28.830> much<00:05:29.070> better

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.710 

so<00:05:32.430> if<00:05:32.580> I<00:05:32.699> compare<00:05:33.150> it<00:05:33.210> to<00:05:33.900> the<00:05:34.199> other<00:05:34.349> tires

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
so if I compare it to the other tires

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.180 
so if I compare it to the other tires
these<00:05:36.720> are<00:05:37.370> drugs<00:05:38.370> numbers<00:05:38.789> are<00:05:39.000> tallest<00:05:40.190> the

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
these are drugs numbers are tallest the

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.440 
these are drugs numbers are tallest the
most<00:05:41.460> aggressive<00:05:41.879> and<00:05:44.479> are<00:05:45.479> also<00:05:45.720> white
