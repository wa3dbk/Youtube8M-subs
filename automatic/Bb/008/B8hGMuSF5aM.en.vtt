00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
that are available for YouTube use you

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.910

do<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.869> produce<00:01:22.110> them<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.560> they<00:01:22.650> aren't

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
do have to produce them so they aren't

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.039 
do have to produce them so they aren't
free<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.759> kind<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.119> bummer<00:01:24.270> but

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
free so that it is kind of a bummer but

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.899 
free so that it is kind of a bummer but
these<00:01:25.259> games<00:01:25.500> include<00:01:25.920> street<00:01:26.310> past<00:01:26.520> squad

and<00:01:29.040> street<00:01:29.340> past<00:01:29.579> battle<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.299> guess<00:01:30.450> these

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and street past battle so I guess these

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.300
