00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.930
 xbox 360 controller emulation 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.730
 otherwise it does not work do not use 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.780
 I'm going to do a vibration test is going 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:19.540
 to hear it here it proves that it works 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.510
 you could use my name it's a 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.680
 his but the dj little voice and their 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.370
 chromes cart left kaboul and you 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:34.750
 open the demo for four years and you 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.810
 put play religion sorry for this 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.290
 cut then we had to do 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.760
 that because camtasia did not want 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.810
 to film the game so we have to 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.150
 filmed with a phone 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.140
 so they prove that the controller is good 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.570
 connected to the computer follow the movie 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.750
 so she is well connected show you 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:59.440
 that the game works very well with the 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.970
 handle of wounds but there a little to see 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.830
 like that we see better like that 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:08.510
 okay 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:11.900
 this is indeed like that of soaps agreement 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:16.610
 planet is well positioned for that 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:20.390
 you also see the screen so here is 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:23.840
 as if I did not want to already said it's 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:26.180
 the buttons of the xbox that's normal there 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.390
 got to be there so as it is 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.790
 a demo there are only a few clubs 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:35.930
 sorry so here is the joystick 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:38.840
 who use the game look at the keyboard 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.030
 there and down and the briefcase and at 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.440
 home 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.920
 I'll just do a little test for 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.920
 to prove to you that it works 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.920
 now 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.620
 so the game bug a bit when you are 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.780
 at the mini game but when it's the match 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.960
 hallboeuf almost never this is it 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.960
 left 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:11.430
 look so that's so you see tac 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.720
 played this wii game beautifully 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.040
 is beautifully it was just 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.340

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.410
