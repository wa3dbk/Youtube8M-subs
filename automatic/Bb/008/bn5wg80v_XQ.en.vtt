00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.890
 hello visitors to sing and 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.110
 Today I will tell you about how to shoot 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.570
 100 past this video lesson will be 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.960
 split into several centuries due to the fact 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.600
 that this topic is extensive and requires freestyle 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.420
 a detailed study of the first part of this 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.330
 video course and tell you about food and 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.250
 plot scenarios and then what technique 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.650
 necessary in order to make a good 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.170
 quality knocking in creativity 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.359
 tell you about the difference between filming 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.489
 knocking tires at home everything is like 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:36.649
 on the street is also used movement 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.130
 variable illumination and object 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.559
 moves to 1000 steam and will do 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.840
 your first stop motion video at home 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.160
 conditions and 4 parts will tell you about 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.930
 what programs are needed 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.430
 use to turn 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.390
 frame set 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:57.399
 ready video 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.399
 so let's start with the most important thing with the idea 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.280
 now delete them full of different 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.619
 or clips on topics faced 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.900
 now the district doctor is not invented therefore 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.540
 if you want to somehow stand out and 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.910
 create something unique to you 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.820
 will have to preload the brains for this 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.460
 video course I decided to do stop motion 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.289
 movie at home with this 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.300
 minimum amount of funds and costs 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.850
 as a prop, I decided 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.890
 use simple coins my doo you 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.920
 There will be at each house to use 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.020
 coins are convenient because they are easy 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.700
 move and not run away static 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.800
 with the help of them you can build 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.470
 different figures also at home I found 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.270
 old rubik cube and help what it would be 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.039
 nice to shoot how he magically 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.590
 way he is going without participation 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.720
 man that is how you see find 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.890
 props idea inspiration possible 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.899
 absolutely everywhere 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.700
 now let's talk about technology 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.569
 which we will use in order 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.819
 to shoot 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:00.830
 stop motion white is essentially us 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.770
 need only a camera and a tripod 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.090
 now let's talk about cameras 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.270
 get you can use any 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.550
 soapbox for mirror in principle can 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.940
 even mobile phone is already on 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.280
 your desire and discretion in this 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.209
 video course I will use my 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.670
 reflex camera 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.130
 but you can use any other 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.370
 the difference will be insignificant and notice 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.170
 he can only be a professional 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.620
 Now let's talk about tripods for what 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.020
 need 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.349
 if you will shoot 100 duties role 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.080
 imperatives then your hands will create 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.060
 micro oscillations and no matter how hard you try 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.190
 loss of a camera in one place 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.610
 frames will be moved one regarding 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.240
 other and therefore when gluing together there will be 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.700
 highly 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.130
 ugly expression all this of course 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.100
 can be stabilized but in any case 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.630
 and a tripod I consider it a necessary thing 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.520
 villages stop motion rolls 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.950
 and of course the most important attribute 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.460
 filming knock machine is availability 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.590
 free time and patience how would you 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.960
 it did not seem to be initially a simple matter 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.120
 when you completely come up straight and 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.200
 it wasn't all that easy because 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.750
 every frame 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.730
 must constantly be done many times 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.200
 be colossal patience especially 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.450
 if you do this video in 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.180
 alone now let's talk about 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.520
 some camera settings 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.880
 best if you frame 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.770
 without pressing the shutter button but by timer 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.220
 To do this, go to the appropriate 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.560
 settings and select the timer 2 seconds 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.740
 this is the optimal time for which the tripod 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.540
 manages to suppress all vibration shutter speed 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.270
 I would not advise you to bet less than 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.170
 one sixtieth let me though 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.210
 stop motion but still the shutter speed should 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.770
 be no less than one sixtieth 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:54.140
 otherwise the image will be smeared go further 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:58.040
 if you are going to shoot at night 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.510
 time then of course and 164,100 either 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.060
 it suits you better 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.180
 if you shoot with good 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:09.730
 light or bright weather is better 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.730
 if your sou has a small 400
