00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.419
 beware of scripts 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.880
 hello to all guys and welcome back up 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.849
 channel playing flash flex Today 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.550
 we are here with the firewire video 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:23.539
 of our exclusive channel and see 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.970
 everyone now minds what happened 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.150
 then during the war , then before 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.360
 all we did not fuck up us 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.340
 which we have not checked in 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.250
 requests, that is, we took ourselves for granted 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.590
 that the people who therefore request not 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.500
 were already in a world and instead there is the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.320
 people who miss 12 hours or more 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.090
 even the world and not even a few that is 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.670
 how many were 15 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.830
 a move of the kind that is death then 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.200
 first thing for the next war 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.780
 guys don't request if you are 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.330
 single because of course there is the clan 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.580
 it is called a favor to the coc made on purpose 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.460
 therefore it makes little sense for wars 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.659
 come if you are already at war 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.369
 then what is important this is a clan 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.789
 dedicated exclusively to these mud and 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.679
 then to wars and fans and once 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.210
 When the war is over we will come out of this 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.179
 phenomenon in ours 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.450
 so guys and promotions network 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:26.100
 because there will be no precisely because not 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.749
 makes sense with promotions for two 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.719
 days of war 

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:32.039
 then i'm am member i choose you did 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.249
 I practically leave my second 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.219
 mary account as a leader 

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:41.100
 I think they always leave that much not 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.079
 I use it and returning to vr 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.719
 another problem that has occurred is that 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.170
 we have donations at random 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.689
 there were also 23 members who 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.869
 they continued despite ours 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.420
 notices to donate for example to dinner that 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.350
 these fantastic of the others but also 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.329
 barbarians never asked and then we fronzo 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.090
 it was a way because we were online 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.849
 waiting for the name to appear 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.189
 this one never appeared to collapse 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.769
 went out we came back relying on 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:16.379
 repeat the other barbarians donated then e 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:20.220
 we hope that you sleep at this 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:23.280
 problem in the next vs no we should 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.590
 put troop restrictions 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.170
 unfortunately then you see a bit of 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.450
 act as a module as you see from 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.060
 description we put the attacks more 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:38.750
 electrical what the fucking censorship 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:43.549
 none of them logical ethical because heroic 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:47.010
 they are a bit of a pain here more in my point 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:50.010
 then but ward unfortunately went wrong 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.200
 this love also because it is there 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.670
 people who came out hot supporting her 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.069
 pact of attacks but have not been 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.709
 much more than the others 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.040
 here we begin immediately with the 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:09.030
 most noteworthy people the first e 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.120
 powell ex karma win from nothing e 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.819
 then the number 14 that attacked the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.010
 13 has made three stars so this is it 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.860
 no doubt an attack of honeys known 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.599
 here is the replay 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.849
 we would like to emphasize that we have 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.959
 saw all of all the replays before 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.569
 make a judgment 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.269
 yes because it was one of the few that it is 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:36.900
 managed to make three stars against one 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:38.459
 the higher he used I didn't see the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.969
 care children always used inside 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.629
 of the walls he saw now talking 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:48.900
 staying there will follow scale but in Prague has 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:52.049
 given only a little care of a dragon and 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.650
 then it was used in practice sense 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.319
 it is then not sticky to the spells 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.450
 in short, it is a waste and I recommend it 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.170
 the truth of barbarians only when 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.980
 prints die or there is little life 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.220
 half of the way 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.739
 in short, not to waste it because that 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.409
 used immediately, but ok, it had a lot 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.639
 luck though I have to say this 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:20.190
 war and dragons played a lot role 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:23.220
 determined because all attacks full 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.310
 passages of liszt and also see in this 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.500
 case it was slightly perhaps not even 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.389
 disadvantaged flowers the dogs because of the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.380
 the corresponding number that 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:38.190
 family is disadvantaged maybe and that 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.380
 village put better than inquisitor 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.600
 but perhaps we will never know then the number 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.539
 26 who made three stars against the 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.510
 number 23 is therefore even better if 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:54.300
 this less the only one we have seen now 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:58.039
 he attacked as you can see a 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.590
 report as you see him 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:04.440
 let's start with the classic ok graphics 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:08.669
 which makes percentage cleans up a bit 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.949
 nostalgic of the broom clan 3 is not one 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.690
 what so obvious scanelli troops of the 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.750
 aware and there is a lot of people there 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.909
 throw the troops at random so without first 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.789
 to flush them out I would say that it is fundamental 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:22.650
 above all years I go low because 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.300
 you never know what the 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.880
 castle the clan spoke to each other done e 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.099
 goodnight and had tried undoing first 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.539
 thanks also to my music it was a 6 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:36.840
 from now on it is ready hard in short ha 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:41.240
 It ended too ends here made all 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.949
 defenses destroyed and brawls escaped 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.870
 then guys these were the mythical 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:49.110
 anyway attack the attacks that there 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.840
 are more liked than the war of the 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.880
 hunger world up declaring the attacks 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.000
 more those who have had us on 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.940
 pauses to attack the fort and have 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.220
 had even better then see you there 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.990
 next funworld I recommend inter 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.240
 like the facebook page we will do 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.820
 know when the next supply 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.349
 an important agreement has for one 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.930
 live let us know 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:14.930
 the Vedic texts when they would reverberate 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.080
 same therefore also via messages 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.260
 facebook write us the day that 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.520
 would you prefer to live our so 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.520
 a salute from mars
