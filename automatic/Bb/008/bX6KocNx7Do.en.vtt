HTC<00:01:12.410> should<00:01:12.800> use<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.250> same<00:01:13.580> panel<00:01:14.149> that<00:01:14.330> was

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
HTC should use the same panel that was

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.440 
HTC should use the same panel that was
used<00:01:14.810> in<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.200> one<00:01:15.350> m8<00:01:15.770> this<00:01:16.430> is<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.700> beautiful

panel with rich vibrant colors and I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.550 
panel with rich vibrant colors and I
think<00:01:20.540> that<00:01:20.690> would<00:01:20.810> make<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.140> tablet

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
think that would make the tablet

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.980 
think that would make the tablet
experience<00:01:21.860> much<00:01:22.580> much<00:01:22.940> better<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.540> optimal

experience much much better the optimal
display<00:01:24.410> size<00:01:24.890> would<00:01:25.220> be<00:01:25.250> around<00:01:25.640> 8<00:01:25.910> inches

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
display size would be around 8 inches

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.889 
display size would be around 8 inches
similar<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.619> Galaxy<00:01:28.160> Tab<00:01:28.430> s<00:01:28.640> which<00:01:29.450> sports

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
similar to the Galaxy Tab s which sports

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
in 8.4 inch display now this is about

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.980 
in 8.4 inch display now this is about
the<00:01:33.950> largest<00:01:34.369> you<00:01:34.610> can<00:01:34.789> get<00:01:34.970> while<00:01:35.300> still

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
the largest you can get while still

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.560 
the largest you can get while still
being<00:01:36.110> able<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.590> hold<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.550> device<00:01:37.789> in<00:01:38.000> one

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
One m8 on this tablet but that's not

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.570 
One m8 on this tablet but that's not
really<00:01:59.509> feasible<00:02:00.160> considering<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.340> fact

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
really feasible considering the fact

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.389 
really feasible considering the fact
that<00:02:01.700> one<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:02.270> is<00:02:02.479> a<00:02:02.509> tablet<00:02:03.080> too<00:02:03.770> making<00:02:04.280> it

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
that one this is a tablet too making it

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.999 
that one this is a tablet too making it
all<00:02:04.520> metal<00:02:05.360> would<00:02:05.660> probably<00:02:06.080> make<00:02:06.259> it<00:02:06.440> a<00:02:06.619> lot

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
all metal would probably make it a lot

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.160 
all metal would probably make it a lot
heavier<00:02:07.490> three<00:02:08.270> it<00:02:08.509> would<00:02:08.630> make<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:08.990> lot

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
heavier three it would make it a lot

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.309 
heavier three it would make it a lot
more<00:02:09.229> slippery<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.310> four<00:02:10.970> well<00:02:11.840> Jack<00:02:12.170> the

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
more slippery and four well Jack the

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.440 
more slippery and four well Jack the
price<00:02:12.560> up<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:12.920> ton<00:02:13.130> therefore<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:13.760> think<00:02:14.030> the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
price up a ton therefore I think the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.480 
price up a ton therefore I think the
smarter<00:02:14.900> solution<00:02:15.560> won't<00:02:15.740> be<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.130> use<00:02:16.310> the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
smarter solution won't be to use the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.650 
smarter solution won't be to use the
same<00:02:16.849> design<00:02:17.420> as<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.950> HTC<00:02:18.950> One<00:02:19.220> EA<00:02:19.580> which<00:02:20.390> is

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
same design as the HTC One EA which is

these are both 8-inch tablets and
they're<00:04:22.950> flagships<00:04:23.580> from<00:04:23.940> their<00:04:24.150> specific

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.520 
they're flagships from their specific
manufacturers<00:04:25.910> so<00:04:27.020> something<00:04:28.020> in<00:04:28.140> that<00:04:28.290> range

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.710 
manufacturers so something in that range
would<00:04:28.860> probably<00:04:29.340> be<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:30.030> most<00:04:30.180> reasonable

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
would probably be the most reasonable

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.770

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
for an HTC flagship tablet so that's

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.320 
for an HTC flagship tablet so that's
what<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.020> think<00:04:34.560> HTC<00:04:35.310> should<00:04:35.640> put<00:04:35.880> into<00:04:36.060> their

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
what I think HTC should put into their

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.630 
what I think HTC should put into their
tablet<00:04:36.810> if<00:04:37.020> they<00:04:37.560> choose<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:37.890> come<00:04:38.250> out<00:04:38.460> with
