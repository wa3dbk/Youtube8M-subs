difficult<00:02:16.180> part<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.019> team<00:02:17.260> for<00:02:17.590> me<00:02:17.739> it's

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
difficult part of the team for me it's

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.250 
difficult part of the team for me it's
probably<00:02:18.880> going<00:02:19.060> from<00:02:19.360> like<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.660> stunts<00:02:20.110> to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
probably going from like the stunts to

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.600 
probably going from like the stunts to
the<00:02:20.380> jumps<00:02:20.739> because<00:02:20.800> this<00:02:21.010> offense<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.430> so

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
the jumps because this offense is so

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.970 
the jumps because this offense is so
like<00:02:21.850> physically<00:02:22.390> demanding<00:02:22.709> it's<00:02:23.709> really

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
like physically demanding it's really

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.509 
like physically demanding it's really
long<00:02:24.160> hard<00:02:25.470> it's<00:02:26.470> like<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.830> longest<00:02:27.190> that

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
long hard it's like the longest that

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:35.100 
long hard it's like the longest that
we've<00:02:27.730> ever<00:02:27.910> had<00:02:28.350> mines<00:02:29.350> tumbling

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.410 

evading<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.560> team<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:36.220> work<00:02:36.550> really<00:02:36.820> hard<00:02:37.060> at

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
evading this team to work really hard at

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.240 
evading this team to work really hard at
practice<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.900> outside<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.590> practice<00:02:38.950> so

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
practice and outside of the practice so

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.880 
practice and outside of the practice so
we're<00:02:40.030> not<00:02:40.150> at<00:02:40.360> practice<00:02:40.780> I'm<00:02:41.020> constantly<00:02:41.710> in

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
we're not at practice I'm constantly in

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.830 
we're not at practice I'm constantly in
the<00:02:42.010> gym<00:02:42.220> working<00:02:42.970> out<00:02:43.240> trying<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.720> better

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
the gym working out trying to better

everything<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.790> possibly<00:02:46.000> can<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.840> the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
everything that I possibly can to the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.119 
everything that I possibly can to the
mat<00:02:47.350> this<00:02:47.530> area

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.100 

this<00:02:54.129> year's<00:02:54.370> two<00:02:55.150> worlds<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.629> little<00:02:55.989> bit

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
this year's two worlds a little bit

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.850 
this year's two worlds a little bit
different<00:02:56.470> than<00:02:56.739> last<00:02:57.459> year's<00:02:57.900> last<00:02:58.900> year<00:02:59.290> we

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
different than last year's last year we

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.500 
different than last year's last year we
only<00:02:59.980> decided<00:03:00.579> to<00:03:00.670> go<00:03:00.819> to<00:03:00.909> the<00:03:00.970> world<00:03:01.120> after

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
only decided to go to the world after

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.420 
only decided to go to the world after
the<00:03:01.840> team<00:03:02.049> was<00:03:02.079> picked<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.739> we<00:03:02.920> were<00:03:03.040> like<00:03:03.189> oh

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
the team was picked and we were like oh

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.339 
the team was picked and we were like oh
we're<00:03:03.909> pretty<00:03:04.000> good<00:03:04.239> maybe<00:03:04.480> we<00:03:04.629> can<00:03:04.870> go<00:03:04.989> and

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
we're pretty good maybe we can go and

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.140 
we're pretty good maybe we can go and
participate<00:03:05.650> worlds<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.579> see<00:03:06.790> all<00:03:06.909> the<00:03:07.000> big

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
participate worlds and see all the big

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.270 
participate worlds and see all the big
teams<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.750> see<00:03:07.870> what<00:03:07.989> it's<00:03:08.110> like<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:09.099> was

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
teams and see what it's like and it was

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.690 
teams and see what it's like and it was
more<00:03:09.579> of<00:03:09.819> a<00:03:10.450> fun<00:03:11.290> trip<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.220> know<00:03:12.310> we<00:03:12.489> just

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
more of a fun trip that you know we just

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.130 
more of a fun trip that you know we just
wanted<00:03:12.909> to<00:03:13.000> have<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.239> experience<00:03:13.329> of<00:03:13.900> going

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
wanted to have the experience of going

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.880 
wanted to have the experience of going
to<00:03:14.230> worlds<00:03:14.560> but<00:03:15.069> once<00:03:15.129> we<00:03:15.549> got<00:03:15.730> there<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.180> we

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
to worlds but once we got there and we

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.069 
to worlds but once we got there and we
competed<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.400> we<00:03:19.030> actually<00:03:19.209> did<00:03:19.569> pretty<00:03:19.930> well

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
competed and we actually did pretty well

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.429 
competed and we actually did pretty well
for<00:03:20.560> being<00:03:20.739> there<00:03:21.040> for<00:03:21.220> our<00:03:21.280> first<00:03:21.549> time<00:03:22.439> we

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:23.439 
for being there for our first time we

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.099 
for being there for our first time we
thought<00:03:23.739> okay<00:03:24.280> let's<00:03:24.400> actually<00:03:24.879> go<00:03:25.599> to<00:03:25.659> Worlds

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
thought okay let's actually go to Worlds

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.410 
thought okay let's actually go to Worlds
let's<00:03:26.319> actually<00:03:26.730> compete<00:03:27.730> at<00:03:27.940> Worlds<00:03:28.299> this

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
let's actually compete at Worlds this

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.089 
let's actually compete at Worlds this
time<00:03:28.629> rather<00:03:28.870> than<00:03:29.019> just<00:03:29.409> participate<00:03:29.980> in

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
time rather than just participate in

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.259 
time rather than just participate in
worlds<00:03:30.370> so<00:03:31.170> this<00:03:32.280> road<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.579> Worlds<00:03:33.909> this<00:03:34.030> year

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
worlds so this road to Worlds this year

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.140 
worlds so this road to Worlds this year
is<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.930> little<00:03:35.470> bumpier<00:03:35.920> because<00:03:36.370> we<00:03:36.819> had<00:03:37.000> to

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
is a little bumpier because we had to

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.520 
is a little bumpier because we had to
set<00:03:37.359> things<00:03:37.480> up<00:03:37.689> we<00:03:37.870> had<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.200> make<00:03:38.349> things

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
set things up we had to make things

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.679 
set things up we had to make things
harder<00:03:38.859> if<00:03:39.250> we<00:03:39.549> want<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.939> really<00:03:40.510> represent

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
harder if we want to really represent

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.589 
harder if we want to really represent
our<00:03:41.019> worlds<00:03:41.349> and<00:03:41.560> be<00:03:41.920> competitive<00:03:42.579> we<00:03:43.329> needed

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
our worlds and be competitive we needed

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.089 
our worlds and be competitive we needed
to<00:03:43.750> step<00:03:43.989> up<00:03:44.019> our<00:03:44.260> tumbling<00:03:44.560> we<00:03:44.680> need<00:03:44.829> to<00:03:44.889> step

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
to step up our tumbling we need to step

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.789 
to step up our tumbling we need to step
up<00:03:45.129> our<00:03:45.370> accenting<00:03:45.909> and<00:03:46.150> we<00:03:46.720> decided<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.620> team

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
up our accenting and we decided the team

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.619 
up our accenting and we decided the team
that<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.220> was<00:03:48.489> a<00:03:48.730> goal<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.060> we<00:03:49.359> were<00:03:49.450> going

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
that that was a goal that we were going

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.020 
that that was a goal that we were going
to<00:03:49.720> have<00:03:49.870> this<00:03:50.019> year<00:03:50.230> so<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.280> routine<00:03:51.579> is<00:03:51.790> much

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
to have this year so the routine is much

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.879 
to have this year so the routine is much
harder<00:03:52.299> there's<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.840> lot<00:03:53.170> more<00:03:53.319> tumbling<00:03:53.709> this

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
harder there's a lot more tumbling this

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.970 
harder there's a lot more tumbling this
year<00:03:54.129> but<00:03:55.090> it's<00:03:55.389> what<00:03:55.599> we<00:03:55.720> have<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:56.109> do<00:03:56.290> to

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
year but it's what we have to do to

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.800 
year but it's what we have to do to
accomplish<00:03:57.639> the<00:03:58.000> goal<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.209> we<00:03:58.599> made

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
accomplish the goal that we made

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.390 
accomplish the goal that we made
together<00:03:59.019> so<00:03:59.949> even<00:04:00.699> though<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.449> is<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:02.680> bumpy

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
together so even though it is a bumpy

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.479 
together so even though it is a bumpy
road<00:04:03.669> and<00:04:04.180> there<00:04:04.840> are<00:04:05.049> more<00:04:05.319> tears<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:06.190> there

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
road and there are more tears and there

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:06.690 
road and there are more tears and there
are

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
are

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.720 
are
or<00:04:06.880> laying<00:04:07.569> on<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.900> floor<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.590> you<00:04:09.400> know<00:04:09.459> more

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
or laying on the floor and you know more

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.720 
or laying on the floor and you know more
I'm<00:04:09.849> gonna<00:04:10.030> pass<00:04:10.270> out<00:04:10.510> in<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.290> end<00:04:11.610> it's<00:04:12.610> gonna

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
I'm gonna pass out in the end it's gonna

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.770

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
go for their hitch kick double so it's

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.180
