cables<00:03:31.760> are<00:03:32.030> pretty<00:03:32.480> tight<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:33.020> what<00:03:33.110> we're

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
cables are pretty tight so what we're

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.990 
cables are pretty tight so what we're
going<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.380> do<00:03:33.560> this<00:03:33.770> has<00:03:33.950> an<00:03:34.070> adjuster<00:03:34.580> right

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
going to do this has an adjuster right

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.090 
going to do this has an adjuster right

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
in the wire harness that I took out to

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.370 
in the wire harness that I took out to
make<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.090> install<00:05:13.389> just<00:05:13.660> a<00:05:13.780> little<00:05:14.020> simpler

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
again that doesn't need to be done but I

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.730 
again that doesn't need to be done but I
find<00:05:17.590> it<00:05:17.710> much<00:05:17.949> easier<00:05:19.320> go<00:05:20.320> ahead<00:05:20.470> and<00:05:20.590> wipe

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
find it much easier go ahead and wipe

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:27.480
