had that extra typing angle somehow I
kind<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.760> think<00:03:14.880> it's<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.180> one<00:03:15.300> thing<00:03:15.480> that's

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
kind of think it's the one thing that's

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.390 
kind of think it's the one thing that's
missing<00:03:15.750> otherwise<00:03:16.500> it's<00:03:16.800> pretty<00:03:17.040> unique

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
missing otherwise it's pretty unique

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.400 
missing otherwise it's pretty unique
design<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.030> one<00:03:18.300> that's<00:03:18.480> really<00:03:18.750> functional
