progress definitely coming over the next
little<00:01:18.570> while<00:01:18.689> now<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.590> terms<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
little while now in terms of the of the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.950 
little while now in terms of the of the
i/o<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> thing<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:21.810> pretty

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
i/o of the thing it's pretty

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.109 
i/o of the thing it's pretty
straightforward<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:22.890> got<00:01:23.100> three<00:01:23.700> USB<00:01:23.970> ports

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
straightforward it's got three USB ports

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.999 
straightforward it's got three USB ports
on<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.780> side<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.080> plug<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.590> gamepad

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
on the one side you plug in your gamepad

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.440 
on the one side you plug in your gamepad
your<00:01:26.280> keyboard<00:01:26.670> your<00:01:26.820> mouse<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.150> then<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
your keyboard your mouse and then on the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.630 
your keyboard your mouse and then on the
other<00:01:27.479> side<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.320> got<00:01:28.530> mini<00:01:28.860> B<00:01:29.070> ports<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
other side it's got mini B ports so the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.359 
other side it's got mini B ports so the
idea<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:31.020> either<00:01:31.290> run<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.220> with

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
idea is that you can either run it with

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.030 
idea is that you can either run it with
straight<00:01:32.939> wired<00:01:33.240> connections<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.200> next<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
straight wired connections for next to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.760 
straight wired connections for next to
zero<00:01:35.220> latency<00:01:35.880> or<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.170> even<00:01:37.380> hook<00:01:37.530> things

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
zero latency or you can even hook things

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.069 
zero latency or you can even hook things
up<00:01:37.920> wirelessly<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.790> run<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.390> however<00:01:39.780> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
up wirelessly and run it however you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.780 
up wirelessly and run it however you
want<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> sit<00:01:40.860> back<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> couch<00:01:41.520> with

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
want you can sit back on the couch with

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.030 
want you can sit back on the couch with
a<00:01:41.850> couch<00:01:42.090> master<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.170> keyboard<00:01:43.860> and

running here with a bunch of their other
gear<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:49.680> well<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.700> real<00:01:50.850> question<00:01:51.090> guys

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
gear as well so the real question guys

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.600 
gear as well so the real question guys
is<00:01:51.840> how<00:01:52.049> well<00:01:52.619> does<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:52.950> work<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.579> answer

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
is how well does it work and the answer

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.240 
is how well does it work and the answer
is<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.619> was<00:01:55.619> surprised

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
is I was surprised

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.310 
is I was surprised
it's<00:01:56.399> basically<00:01:56.880> an<00:01:57.119> unfair<00:01:57.600> advantage<00:01:57.750> I

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
it's basically an unfair advantage I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.139 
it's basically an unfair advantage I
mean<00:01:58.469> all<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.649> us<00:01:58.860> PC<00:01:59.310> folks<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.820> pretty<00:02:00.030> much

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
mean all of us PC folks can pretty much

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.090 
mean all of us PC folks can pretty much
agree<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> keyboard<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.680> mouse<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:02.009> a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
agree that a keyboard and mouse is a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.670 
agree that a keyboard and mouse is a
superior<00:02:02.850> method<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.719> controlling<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.439> game

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
superior method of controlling a game

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.119 
superior method of controlling a game
but<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.909> mean<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.869> guess<00:02:06.960> some<00:02:07.259> people<00:02:07.290> will

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
but I mean I guess some people will

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.249 
but I mean I guess some people will
disagree<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.119> know<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> guess<00:02:09.539> well<00:02:09.750> once

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
disagree but you know I guess well once

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
review unit at some point so we can

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
check this out on a lower latency

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.020 
check this out on a lower latency

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
but neither of these demos are probably

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.370 
but neither of these demos are probably
as<00:05:20.430> impressive<00:05:20.820> as<00:05:21.150> in<00:05:21.270> videos<00:05:21.570> face<00:05:22.020> works

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380

demo<00:05:22.740> now<00:05:23.370> we've<00:05:23.550> seen<00:05:23.790> this<00:05:24.000> before<00:05:24.600> but

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
demo now we've seen this before but

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.250 
demo now we've seen this before but
we've<00:05:25.260> never<00:05:25.470> seen<00:05:25.620> it<00:05:25.950> running<00:05:26.250> on<00:05:26.400> a<00:05:26.460> mobile

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
we've never seen it running on a mobile

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.790 
we've never seen it running on a mobile
processor<00:05:28.260> and<00:05:28.380> there's<00:05:28.500> a<00:05:28.560> bunch<00:05:28.710> of

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
processor and there's a bunch of

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.410 
processor and there's a bunch of
advanced<00:05:29.100> stuff<00:05:29.340> going<00:05:29.610> on<00:05:29.700> here<00:05:29.940> so<00:05:30.090> for<00:05:30.270> one

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
advanced stuff going on here so for one

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.240 
advanced stuff going on here so for one
thing<00:05:30.690> the<00:05:31.140> tessellation<00:05:31.830> in<00:05:31.950> the<00:05:32.040> eye<00:05:32.070> is

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
thing the tessellation in the eye is

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.520 
thing the tessellation in the eye is
part<00:05:32.760> of<00:05:32.790> what<00:05:32.970> makes<00:05:33.150> it<00:05:33.300> look<00:05:33.450> so<00:05:33.510> round<00:05:34.200> and

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
part of what makes it look so round and

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.950 
part of what makes it look so round and
so<00:05:35.130> realistic<00:05:35.850> and<00:05:36.060> then<00:05:36.420> we've<00:05:36.660> got<00:05:36.840> other

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
so realistic and then we've got other

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.780 
so realistic and then we've got other
stuff<00:05:37.230> we've<00:05:37.350> got<00:05:37.380> subsurface<00:05:38.040> scattering<00:05:38.280> in

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
stuff we've got subsurface scattering in

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.000 
stuff we've got subsurface scattering in
the<00:05:38.820> ear<00:05:39.150> that<00:05:39.690> allows<00:05:39.930> us<00:05:40.110> to<00:05:40.260> see<00:05:40.410> not<00:05:40.590> just

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
the ear that allows us to see not just

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.420 
the ear that allows us to see not just
you<00:05:41.490> know<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.670> the<00:05:42.300> skin<00:05:42.840> hue<00:05:43.290> of<00:05:43.350> a<00:05:43.590> human<00:05:43.980> ear

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
you know the the skin hue of a human ear

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.790 
you know the the skin hue of a human ear
well<00:05:45.090> specifically<00:05:45.660> like<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:45.960> white<00:05:46.410> due<00:05:46.620> to

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
well specifically like a white due to

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.760 
well specifically like a white due to
human<00:05:47.070> ear<00:05:47.220> but<00:05:47.430> also<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:48.450> red<00:05:48.840> of<00:05:49.140> the<00:05:49.470> blood

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
human ear but also the red of the blood

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.220 
human ear but also the red of the blood
underneath<00:05:50.340> it<00:05:50.640> not<00:05:51.090> only<00:05:51.210> that<00:05:51.540> but<00:05:51.780> I<00:05:52.050> mean

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
underneath it not only that but I mean

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.630 
underneath it not only that but I mean
okay<00:05:52.620> to<00:05:52.680> be<00:05:52.890> clear<00:05:53.100> guys<00:05:53.900> this<00:05:54.900> guy<00:05:55.080> will<00:05:55.290> run

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
okay to be clear guys this guy will run

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.120 
okay to be clear guys this guy will run
using<00:05:56.640> other<00:05:57.060> standards<00:05:57.600> so<00:05:57.720> not<00:05:57.870> OpenGL<00:05:58.320> 4.4

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
using other standards so not OpenGL 4.4

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.830 
using other standards so not OpenGL 4.4
but<00:05:59.460> just<00:06:00.000> kind<00:06:00.210> of<00:06:00.270> look<00:06:00.480> at<00:06:00.630> him<00:06:00.750> like

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
but just kind of look at him like

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.970 
but just kind of look at him like
there's<00:06:01.050> there's<00:06:01.230> lots<00:06:01.320> of<00:06:01.470> other<00:06:01.560> stuff<00:06:01.860> like

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
there's there's lots of other stuff like

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.500 
there's there's lots of other stuff like
the<00:06:02.100> greasiness<00:06:02.310> of<00:06:02.700> his<00:06:02.790> face<00:06:03.000> the<00:06:03.270> soft

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
the greasiness of his face the soft

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.240 
the greasiness of his face the soft
shadows<00:06:03.870> of<00:06:04.020> his<00:06:04.110> face<00:06:04.320> but<00:06:04.500> it's<00:06:04.830> really<00:06:05.070> most

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
shadows of his face but it's really most

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.040 
shadows of his face but it's really most
clear<00:06:05.460> if<00:06:05.550> you<00:06:05.580> do<00:06:05.700> a<00:06:05.730> side<00:06:06.060> by<00:06:06.270> side<00:06:06.300> demo<00:06:06.750> and

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
clear if you do a side by side demo and

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.080 
clear if you do a side by side demo and
look<00:06:07.560> at<00:06:07.710> it<00:06:07.830> just<00:06:08.010> running<00:06:08.400> on<00:06:08.550> your<00:06:08.760> your

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
look at it just running on your your

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.280 
look at it just running on your your
standard<00:06:09.600> you<00:06:10.290> know<00:06:10.730> mobile<00:06:11.730> API<00:06:12.690> versus

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
standard you know mobile API versus

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.020 
standard you know mobile API versus
running<00:06:13.410> on<00:06:13.590> OpenGL<00:06:13.860> 4.4<00:06:14.610> and<00:06:14.700> I<00:06:14.760> think<00:06:14.910> you'll

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
running on OpenGL 4.4 and I think you'll

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.790 
running on OpenGL 4.4 and I think you'll
really<00:06:15.060> see<00:06:15.570> what<00:06:16.020> I<00:06:16.320> mean

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
really see what I mean

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.230 
really see what I mean
