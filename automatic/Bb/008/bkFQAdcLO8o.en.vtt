so Samsung Galaxy Note vs samsung galaxy
nexus<00:00:13.040> so<00:00:14.040> let's<00:00:14.309> go<00:00:14.490> quadrant<00:00:15.450> standard

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
nexus so let's go quadrant standard

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.330 
nexus so let's go quadrant standard
version<00:00:16.560> we're<00:00:16.710> going<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> run<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.039> full

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
version we're going to run a full

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.480 
version we're going to run a full
benchmark<00:00:18.199> so<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.189> going<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.400> be

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
benchmark so this is going to be

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:29.210 
benchmark so this is going to be
interesting<00:00:24.500> okay<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:26.070> are<00:00:26.310> off<00:00:27.830> and<00:00:28.830> we

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
interesting okay and we are off and we

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.160 
interesting okay and we are off and we
can<00:00:29.369> clearly<00:00:29.609> see<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.150> 1.4<00:00:30.840> gigahertz

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
can clearly see that the 1.4 gigahertz

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.280 
can clearly see that the 1.4 gigahertz

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.229 
processor dual core samsung galaxy note
already<00:00:35.130> finish<00:00:35.550> up<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:37.820> this<00:00:38.820> one<00:00:39.030> is

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
already finish up and this one is

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.340 
already finish up and this one is
running<00:00:39.829> Android<00:00:41.300> 2.3<00:00:42.300> point<00:00:42.809> six<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.320> think

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
running Android 2.3 point six I think

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.420 
running Android 2.3 point six I think
yes<00:00:46.550> but<00:00:47.550> goddamn<00:00:48.110> why<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.680> android<00:00:50.010> 4.2

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
yes but goddamn why is the android 4.2

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.540 
yes but goddamn why is the android 4.2
point<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.149> slow<00:00:51.649> could<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.829> because<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
point one so slow could be because the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.600 
point one so slow could be because the
quadrant<00:00:53.969> probably<00:00:54.539> isn't<00:00:54.809> optimized<00:00:55.460> if<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
quadrant probably isn't optimized if you

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.990 
quadrant probably isn't optimized if you
ask<00:00:56.760> me<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.199> could<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.530> case

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
ask me I think that could be the case

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.950 
ask me I think that could be the case
it's<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.300> interesting<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.660> see<00:01:00.870> this

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
it's going to be interesting to see this

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.500 
it's going to be interesting to see this
course

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.510 

so<00:01:08.170> I'm<00:01:08.230> gonna<00:01:08.440> say<00:01:08.680> to<00:01:08.710> score<00:01:09.040> here<00:01:09.280> pretty

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
run to his optimized for ice cream

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.130 
run to his optimized for ice cream
sandwich<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.690> got<00:01:34.880> 3,000<00:01:35.880> let's<00:01:36.780> see<00:01:36.960> here

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
does is because it's not optimizing
