there was still pretty good chance of
Jacobi<00:01:33.240> catches<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.020> strolls

into the end zone

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.910 
into the end zone
yes<00:01:36.000> that's<00:01:36.240> besides<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> point<00:01:36.920> overall

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.969 
atrocious secondary play I can remember
in<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.930> recent<00:01:43.530> Broncos<00:01:43.979> watching<00:01:44.369> history

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
in the recent Broncos watching history

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.350 
in the recent Broncos watching history
really<00:01:46.979> painful<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.549> say<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.939> as<00:01:48.119> well

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
really painful to say that as well

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.380 
really painful to say that as well
because<00:01:48.750> for<00:01:49.290> me<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.950> Broncos<00:01:50.369> secondary<00:01:50.880> was

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
because for me the Broncos secondary was

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.569 
because for me the Broncos secondary was
the<00:01:51.540> best<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.960> league<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.350> season

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
the best in the league this season

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.999 
the best in the league this season
across<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.790> board<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.659> Torrey<00:01:55.079> Smith<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.799> know

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
across the board but Torrey Smith I know

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.560 
across the board but Torrey Smith I know
he's<00:01:56.310> an<00:01:56.460> upcoming<00:01:56.579> receiver<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> know

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
he's an upcoming receiver and I know

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.330 
he's an upcoming receiver and I know
he's<00:01:57.689> got<00:01:57.810> some<00:01:58.049> wheels<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.469> him<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:58.799> he's

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
he's got some wheels on him but he's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.120 
he's got some wheels on him but he's
straight<00:01:59.700> abused<00:02:00.479> champ<00:02:01.020> today<00:02:01.200> may<00:02:01.799> chant

straight abused champ today may chant

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.980

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
know a lot of that had to do with the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.630 
know a lot of that had to do with the
Patra<00:02:08.610> pass<00:02:08.940> rush<00:02:09.239> being<00:02:09.539> non-existent<00:02:10.640> which

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
Patra pass rush being non-existent which

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.910 
Patra pass rush being non-existent which
I<00:02:11.910> mean

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.850 
I mean
that<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.730> incredible<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.810> me<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.140> think<00:02:15.560> von

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
that is incredible to me I think von

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.920 
that is incredible to me I think von

Miller his name is only mentioned twice

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.390 
Miller his name is only mentioned twice
throughout<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.440> day<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.890> one<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.099> them<00:02:19.250> was

throughout the day and one of them was

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.089

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
was eaten up on almost every play there

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
Joe to get on to his second and third

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.760 
Joe to get on to his second and third
reads<00:02:29.360> made<00:02:30.020> him<00:02:30.140> look<00:02:30.260> like<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.440> elite

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770

quarterback<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.370> he<00:02:31.520> thinks<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.970> he<00:02:32.090> is

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
quarterback that he thinks that he is

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.190 
quarterback that he thinks that he is
overall<00:02:33.950> I'd<00:02:34.370> say<00:02:34.459> that<00:02:34.880> only<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.090> few<00:02:35.480> players

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
overall I'd say that only a few players

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.770 
overall I'd say that only a few players

showed up trimming holiday being the one
I<00:02:38.840> can<00:02:38.989> think<00:02:39.019> of<00:02:39.230> most<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.650> all<00:02:39.769> obviously

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
I can think of most of all obviously

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.400 
I can think of most of all obviously
probably<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.730> game<00:02:40.910> MVP<00:02:41.209> all<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:42.050> that<00:02:42.170> last

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
probably the game MVP all of that last

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.400 
probably the game MVP all of that last
pot<00:02:42.680> return<00:02:43.010> which<00:02:43.459> is<00:02:43.489> pretty<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:45.860> watch

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
pot return which is pretty to watch

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.449 
pot return which is pretty to watch

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600

through<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:53.930> secondary<00:02:54.380> I<00:02:54.650> thought<00:02:55.100> Ronnie

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
through that secondary I thought Ronnie

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.210 
through that secondary I thought Ronnie
Hillman<00:02:55.549> did<00:02:56.360> everything<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.830> was<00:02:57.950> asked

from him and Vincent I also like to get

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.530 
from him and Vincent I also like to get
out<00:03:00.080> of<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.260> way<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:01.040> whole<00:03:01.269> Mannion<00:03:02.269> can't

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
out of the way the whole Mannion can't

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.039 
out of the way the whole Mannion can't
play<00:03:02.840> in<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.049> cold<00:03:03.350> rumors<00:03:03.709> I<00:03:03.890> know<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:05.049> that

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
play in the cold rumors I know that that

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.900 
play in the cold rumors I know that that
was<00:03:06.140> an<00:03:06.260> excruciating<00:03:06.910> excruciating

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
was an excruciating excruciating

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.660 
was an excruciating excruciating
interception<00:03:08.450> in<00:03:08.540> overtime<00:03:09.019> but<00:03:09.980> beyond<00:03:10.580> that

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
interception in overtime but beyond that

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.880 
interception in overtime but beyond that
his<00:03:11.000> play<00:03:11.269> was<00:03:11.480> pretty<00:03:11.870> spectacular<00:03:12.140> I

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
his play was pretty spectacular I

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.410 
his play was pretty spectacular I
thought<00:03:13.250> that<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.519> touchdown<00:03:13.910> pass<00:03:14.120> that

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
thought that the touchdown pass that

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.809 
thought that the touchdown pass that
know<00:03:14.870> Sean<00:03:15.110> was<00:03:15.350> about<00:03:15.890> as<00:03:16.100> incredible<00:03:16.730> as

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
know Sean was about as incredible as

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.120 
know Sean was about as incredible as
you'd<00:03:17.000> be<00:03:17.090> throw<00:03:17.269> a<00:03:17.299> football<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.870> thought<00:03:18.739> the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
you'd be throw a football I thought the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.610 
you'd be throw a football I thought the
stuff<00:03:19.880> was<00:03:20.090> passed<00:03:20.359> was<00:03:20.540> probably<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.079> silver

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
stuff was passed was probably the silver

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.280 
stuff was passed was probably the silver
medal<00:03:21.890> incredible<00:03:22.430> football<00:03:22.730> throws<00:03:26.290> it's

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.319 
medal incredible football throws it's
just<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.859> think<00:03:28.190> he<00:03:28.459> was<00:03:28.609> at<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.880> end<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.090> day<00:03:29.180> he

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
just I think he was at the end of day he

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.789 
just I think he was at the end of day he
was<00:03:29.450> probably<00:03:29.630> just<00:03:29.810> trying<00:03:30.109> to<00:03:30.200> do<00:03:30.380> too<00:03:30.560> much

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
was probably just trying to do too much

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.949 
was probably just trying to do too much
that<00:03:31.130> throw<00:03:31.910> across<00:03:32.090> your<00:03:32.329> body<00:03:32.480> doesn't<00:03:32.750> make

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
that throw across your body doesn't make

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.330 
that throw across your body doesn't make
sense<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.320> me<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.440> know<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.650> lot<00:03:33.859> of<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:33.980> promise

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
sense to me I know a lot of you promise

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.280 
sense to me I know a lot of you promise
fans<00:03:34.519> have<00:03:34.640> never<00:03:34.940> ever<00:03:35.450> seen<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:36.049> out<00:03:36.170> of

fans have never ever seen that out of
painting<00:03:36.560> this<00:03:36.650> year<00:03:36.920> but<00:03:37.760> I<00:03:37.970> think<00:03:38.329> it<00:03:38.630> was

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
painting this year but I think it was

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.360 
painting this year but I think it was
called<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.140> game<00:03:39.350> is<00:03:39.500> dragging<00:03:39.859> on<00:03:39.950> he<00:03:40.220> was

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
called the game is dragging on he was

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.490 
called the game is dragging on he was
just<00:03:40.609> trying<00:03:40.910> to<00:03:41.000> end<00:03:41.209> it<00:03:41.390> there<00:03:41.570> and<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:42.260> cost

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
just trying to end it there and it cost

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.170 
just trying to end it there and it cost
him<00:03:42.739> I<00:03:42.950> do<00:03:43.220> think<00:03:43.549> it's<00:03:43.670> important<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:44.030> we

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
him I do think it's important that we

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.120 
him I do think it's important that we
give<00:03:44.329> credit<00:03:44.510> where<00:03:44.870> credit's<00:03:45.200> due<00:03:45.260> because

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.979 
give credit where credit's due because

for me but hopefully you can take
comfort<00:04:07.340> in<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:07.700> fact<00:04:07.930> knowing<00:04:08.930> that<00:04:09.079> this

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
comfort in the fact knowing that this

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.170 
comfort in the fact knowing that this

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
team that we saw today would not it be

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.699 
team that we saw today would not it be
two<00:04:11.359> Texans<00:04:11.780> would<00:04:12.049> not<00:04:12.319> have<00:04:12.500> beat<00:04:12.620> the

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
two Texans would not have beat the

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.289 
two Texans would not have beat the
Patriots<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.280> certainly<00:04:13.730> it<00:04:13.850> would<00:04:13.970> not<00:04:14.150> have

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
Patriots and certainly it would not have

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.729 
Patriots and certainly it would not have
beat<00:04:14.480> any<00:04:14.660> team<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:14.959> made<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.440> Super

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
beat any team that made it to the Super

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.719 
beat any team that made it to the Super
Bowl<00:04:15.769> um<00:04:16.870> looking<00:04:17.870> ahead<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.470> did<00:04:19.250> not<00:04:19.430> think

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
Bowl um looking ahead I did not think

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.699 
Bowl um looking ahead I did not think
that<00:04:19.789> this<00:04:20.000> was<00:04:20.180> here<00:04:20.630> or<00:04:21.049> at<00:04:21.109> least<00:04:21.260> entering

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
that this was here or at least entering

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.260 
that this was here or at least entering
the<00:04:21.799> season<00:04:22.159> I<00:04:22.250> did<00:04:22.400> not<00:04:22.550> think<00:04:22.700> this<00:04:22.849> was<00:04:22.909> year

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
the season I did not think this was year

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.580 
the season I did not think this was year
that<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.479> Broncos<00:04:23.659> would<00:04:24.050> win<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.320> Super

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
that the Broncos would win the Super

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.500 
that the Broncos would win the Super
Bowl<00:04:24.740> as<00:04:24.950> it<00:04:25.430> went<00:04:25.550> along<00:04:25.640> and<00:04:25.970> we<00:04:26.030> saw<00:04:26.180> this

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
Bowl as it went along and we saw this

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.480 
Bowl as it went along and we saw this
grow<00:04:26.870> it<00:04:27.500> kind<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:27.920> hopped<00:04:28.070> on<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.250> bandwagon

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
grow it kind of hopped on the bandwagon

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.310 
grow it kind of hopped on the bandwagon
and<00:04:28.880> thought<00:04:29.030> we<00:04:29.150> might<00:04:29.360> steal<00:04:29.660> one<00:04:29.870> pains

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
and thought we might steal one pains

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.160 
and thought we might steal one pains
first<00:04:30.620> year<00:04:30.950> but<00:04:31.820> ultimately<00:04:32.540> that<00:04:32.810> was<00:04:32.960> not

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
first year but ultimately that was not

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.410 
first year but ultimately that was not
the<00:04:33.290> case<00:04:33.470> I<00:04:33.800> think<00:04:34.280> as<00:04:34.820> long<00:04:34.880> as<00:04:35.060> we<00:04:35.270> do<00:04:35.390> not

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
the case I think as long as we do not

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.170 
the case I think as long as we do not
lose<00:04:35.780> too<00:04:36.080> many<00:04:36.230> coordinators<00:04:36.950> to<00:04:37.430> hirings

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
lose too many coordinators to hirings

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.270 
lose too many coordinators to hirings
and<00:04:38.300> add<00:04:39.230> a<00:04:39.260> couple<00:04:39.560> pieces<00:04:39.800> here<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:40.220> there

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
and add a couple pieces here and there

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.010 
and add a couple pieces here and there
this<00:04:40.790> is<00:04:41.000> going<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.300> be<00:04:41.360> a<00:04:41.390> Super<00:04:41.690> Bowl<00:04:41.840> team

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
this is going to be a Super Bowl team

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.710 
this is going to be a Super Bowl team
for<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.920> next<00:04:43.040> two<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:43.760> three<00:04:43.790> years<00:04:44.000> as<00:04:44.480> long

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
for the next two to three years as long

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.670 
for the next two to three years as long
