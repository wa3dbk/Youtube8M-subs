00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:10.360 

I<00:00:07.900> really<00:00:08.900> really<00:00:09.200> enjoy<00:00:09.680> working<00:00:09.890> with<00:00:10.130> these

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
I really really enjoy working with these

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.740 
I really really enjoy working with these
athletes<00:00:11.950> they<00:00:13.180> like<00:00:14.180> I<00:00:14.210> say<00:00:14.510> they<00:00:14.720> are

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
athletes they like I say they are

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.990 
athletes they like I say they are
dedicated<00:00:15.230> to<00:00:15.710> be<00:00:15.889> being<00:00:16.490> good<00:00:16.730> learners<00:00:17.800> and

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.380 

they<00:00:24.160> support<00:00:25.160> each<00:00:25.220> other<00:00:25.460> so<00:00:25.789> well

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
they support each other so well

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.380 
they support each other so well
I<00:00:27.609> think<00:00:28.990> volleyball<00:00:29.990> is<00:00:30.170> volleyball<00:00:30.769> and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
I think volleyball is volleyball and

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.520 
I think volleyball is volleyball and
that<00:00:32.390> lots<00:00:32.660> of<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:32.930> things<00:00:33.170> that<00:00:33.380> we<00:00:33.470> are

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
that lots of the things that we are

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.900 
that lots of the things that we are
trying<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:33.950> do<00:00:34.250> I<00:00:34.550> would<00:00:34.880> teach<00:00:35.149> whether<00:00:35.750> it's

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
trying to do I would teach whether it's

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.819 
trying to do I would teach whether it's
women's<00:00:37.910> volleyball<00:00:38.149> or<00:00:38.840> men's<00:00:39.079> volleyball<00:00:39.350> a

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
women's volleyball or men's volleyball a

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.920 
women's volleyball or men's volleyball a
lot<00:00:40.130> of<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.370> techniques<00:00:41.090> a<00:00:41.450> lot<00:00:41.660> of<00:00:41.809> the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
lot of the techniques a lot of the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.690 
lot of the techniques a lot of the
tactics<00:00:42.850> but<00:00:43.850> there's<00:00:44.379> sometimes<00:00:45.379> maybe<00:00:46.250> even

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
tactics but there's sometimes maybe even

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.470 
tactics but there's sometimes maybe even
more<00:00:47.149> power<00:00:47.540> in<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:49.370> women's<00:00:50.059> volleyball<00:00:50.270> team

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
more power in a women's volleyball team

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.930 
more power in a women's volleyball team
when<00:00:50.870> they<00:00:51.020> really<00:00:51.410> come<00:00:52.160> together<00:00:52.399> there's<00:00:52.850> a

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
when they really come together there's a

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.790 
when they really come together there's a
great<00:00:53.149> power<00:00:53.450> in<00:00:53.600> fighting<00:00:54.350> for<00:00:54.559> each<00:00:54.649> other

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
great power in fighting for each other

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.350 
great power in fighting for each other
people<00:00:55.309> call<00:00:55.489> it<00:00:55.640> team<00:00:55.910> chemistry<00:00:56.270> team<00:00:58.360> team

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
people call it team chemistry team team

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.850 
people call it team chemistry team team
working<00:00:59.930> together<00:01:00.430> and<00:01:01.430> so<00:01:01.579> we<00:01:01.699> try<00:01:01.910> to<00:01:01.940> help

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
working together and so we try to help

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.639 
working together and so we try to help
foster<00:01:03.860> that<00:01:04.100> generate<00:01:04.819> that<00:01:05.029> I<00:01:05.529> think<00:01:06.529> the

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
foster that generate that I think the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.789 
foster that generate that I think the
women<00:01:07.569> care<00:01:08.569> a<00:01:08.959> little<00:01:09.170> more<00:01:09.469> not<00:01:10.189> only<00:01:10.689> about

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
women care a little more not only about

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.449 
women care a little more not only about
what<00:01:12.799> I'm<00:01:13.069> saying<00:01:13.569> but<00:01:14.569> how<00:01:14.920> how<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:16.130> said

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:16.459 
what I'm saying but how how it said

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:18.580 
what I'm saying but how how it said
maybe<00:01:17.029> they're<00:01:17.359> more<00:01:17.659> intuitive<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.409> they

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
maybe they're more intuitive and they

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.089 
maybe they're more intuitive and they
sense<00:01:19.240> whether<00:01:20.240> they<00:01:20.810> can<00:01:21.020> tell<00:01:21.289> more<00:01:21.740> easily

00:01:22.089 --> 00:01:22.099 
sense whether they can tell more easily

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:24.730 
sense whether they can tell more easily
whether<00:01:22.429> I'm<00:01:22.700> sincere<00:01:23.420> whether<00:01:24.380> I<00:01:24.499> really

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
whether I'm sincere whether I really

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.760 
whether I'm sincere whether I really
mean<00:01:25.039> what<00:01:25.189> I<00:01:25.249> say<00:01:25.609> just<00:01:26.509> they<00:01:26.810> have<00:01:26.990> a<00:01:27.439> little

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
mean what I say just they have a little

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.499 
mean what I say just they have a little
better<00:01:28.009> intuition<00:01:28.429> in<00:01:28.819> that<00:01:28.969> sense<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:29.359> it's

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
better intuition in that sense so it's

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.800 
better intuition in that sense so it's
important<00:01:29.990> for<00:01:30.289> me<00:01:30.499> to<00:01:30.789> speak<00:01:31.789> with<00:01:31.849> honesty

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
important for me to speak with honesty

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.159 
important for me to speak with honesty
and<00:01:33.020> sincerity<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:34.479> to<00:01:35.479> try<00:01:35.659> to<00:01:35.689> treat<00:01:35.990> them

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:36.169 
and sincerity and to try to treat them

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:39.429 
and sincerity and to try to treat them
each<00:01:36.380> as<00:01:36.590> individuals

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.120 

I<00:01:40.240> think<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.499> sense<00:01:42.499> of<00:01:42.770> these

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
I think this sense of these

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.120 
I think this sense of these
relationships<00:01:45.039> has<00:01:46.039> great<00:01:46.609> power<00:01:46.939> to<00:01:48.099> pull<00:01:49.099> a

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
relationships has great power to pull a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.469 
relationships has great power to pull a
team<00:01:49.489> down<00:01:50.139> but<00:01:51.139> also<00:01:51.289> great<00:01:51.709> power<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.819> make<00:01:53.450> a

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
team down but also great power to make a

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.010 
team down but also great power to make a
team<00:01:53.779> better<00:01:53.929> if<00:01:54.619> we<00:01:55.099> if<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:56.270> relationships

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
team better if we if the relationships

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.120 
team better if we if the relationships
can<00:01:57.439> be<00:01:58.270> built<00:01:59.270> on<00:01:59.509> some<00:01:59.959> honesty<00:02:00.559> and<00:02:00.770> trust

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
can be built on some honesty and trust

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.420 
can be built on some honesty and trust
and<00:02:01.369> sincerity<00:02:01.999> and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
and sincerity and

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.700 
and sincerity and
one<00:02:03.909> person<00:02:04.360> knows<00:02:04.600> that<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:05.140> other<00:02:05.170> person

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
one person knows that the other person

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.580 
one person knows that the other person
really<00:02:05.860> cares<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.689> supports<00:02:08.259> for<00:02:08.440> that

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
really cares and and supports for that

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.490 
really cares and and supports for that
player<00:02:08.860> there<00:02:09.759> can<00:02:10.000> be<00:02:10.030> great<00:02:10.330> power<00:02:11.020> in<00:02:11.380> a

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
player there can be great power in a

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.380 
player there can be great power in a
positive<00:02:12.069> way<00:02:12.280> too<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:12.880> I<00:02:12.910> think<00:02:13.030> it's<00:02:13.300> a

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
positive way too so I think it's a

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.070 
positive way too so I think it's a
powerful<00:02:13.569> thing<00:02:14.110> in<00:02:14.380> both<00:02:14.860> directions<00:02:15.430> I

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
powerful thing in both directions I

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.890 
powerful thing in both directions I
think<00:02:17.400> men<00:02:18.750> may<00:02:19.750> be<00:02:19.810> more<00:02:20.170> easily<00:02:22.830> can<00:02:24.900> you

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
think men may be more easily can you

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.960 
think men may be more easily can you
know<00:02:26.050> maybe<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.040> can<00:02:27.340> be<00:02:27.489> on<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.760> same

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
know maybe you and I can be on the same

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.390 
know maybe you and I can be on the same
team<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:29.200> maybe<00:02:29.530> we<00:02:29.739> don't<00:02:29.860> like<00:02:30.069> each<00:02:30.250> other

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
team and maybe we don't like each other

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.570 
team and maybe we don't like each other
very<00:02:30.700> much<00:02:31.260> but<00:02:32.260> when<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> whistle<00:02:32.890> blows<00:02:33.130> I

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
very much but when the whistle blows I

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.270 
very much but when the whistle blows I
can<00:02:34.420> fight<00:02:34.660> for<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:35.860> can<00:02:36.040> fight<00:02:36.250> for

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
can fight for you and you can fight for

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.180 
can fight for you and you can fight for
me<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.880> then<00:02:37.599> when<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.870> game<00:02:38.019> is<00:02:38.200> over<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:38.980> go

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
me and then when the game is over you go

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.190 
me and then when the game is over you go
that<00:02:39.370> way<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.819> go<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.209> way<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:42.010> okay

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
that way and I go this way and it's okay

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.259 
that way and I go this way and it's okay
maybe<00:02:44.200> that's<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.709> little<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.910> doesn't

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
maybe that's a little that doesn't

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.640 
maybe that's a little that doesn't
happen<00:02:46.510> as<00:02:46.810> easily<00:02:47.170> for<00:02:47.650> women<00:02:48.780> but<00:02:49.780> when<00:02:50.380> we

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
happen as easily for women but when we
