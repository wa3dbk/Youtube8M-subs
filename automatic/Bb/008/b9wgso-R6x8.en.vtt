00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.259 
to obviously find a starting point to
try<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.300> match<00:02:46.099> the<00:02:47.099> colors<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.760> film<00:02:48.000> as

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
try to match the colors of the film as

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:56.490 
try to match the colors of the film as
the<00:02:49.190> creative<00:02:50.190> guys<00:02:50.810> intended<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:51.930> be

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.930 

so<00:02:57.130> what<00:02:57.280> we<00:02:57.370> did<00:02:57.550> is<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:58.860> got<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.920> hold<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.460> our

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
so what we did is I got a hold of our

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.580 
so what we did is I got a hold of our
Telus<00:03:01.720> any<00:03:01.870> analysis<00:03:02.410> films<00:03:02.680> called<00:03:02.830> tal<00:03:03.400> and

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
Telus any analysis films called tal and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.800 
Telus any analysis films called tal and
what<00:03:05.590> we<00:03:05.680> do<00:03:05.830> is<00:03:05.950> we<00:03:06.100> align<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.820> Telus<00:03:07.150> city<00:03:07.420> to

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
what we do is we align the Telus city to

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.980 
what we do is we align the Telus city to
match<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.800> color<00:03:09.040> Commission<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:10.450> grayscale

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
match the color Commission the grayscale

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.120 
match the color Commission the grayscale
and<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:12.280> detail<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:12.850> that<00:03:12.880> film

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
and the detail of that film

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.710 
and the detail of that film
now<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:16.410> prints<00:03:17.410> at<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.980> time<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:19.510> had<00:03:19.690> a

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
now the prints at that time you had a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.840 
now the prints at that time you had a
lot<00:03:19.990> of<00:03:20.140> grain<00:03:20.380> but<00:03:20.800> in<00:03:21.070> standard<00:03:21.490> def<00:03:21.700> the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
lot of grain but in standard def the

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.430 
lot of grain but in standard def the
grain<00:03:22.060> was<00:03:22.240> conscious<00:03:22.630> smushed<00:03:22.870> over<00:03:23.170> because

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
grain was conscious smushed over because

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.800 
grain was conscious smushed over because
you<00:03:23.530> didn't<00:03:23.740> really<00:03:23.890> see<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.730> grain<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.540> now

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
you didn't really see the grain and now

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.699 
you didn't really see the grain and now
we're<00:03:26.050> taken<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.440> HD<00:03:27.720> it's<00:03:28.720> looking<00:03:29.230> further

most important things about this project

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.120 
most important things about this project
is<00:03:43.680> trying<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.950> be<00:03:45.310> as<00:03:46.320> true<00:03:47.320> and<00:03:47.590> honest<00:03:48.010> they

of<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.620> spell<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:51.750> feel<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:53.560> we've

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
of a spell I feel that we've

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.580 
of a spell I feel that we've
accomplished<00:03:54.640> making<00:03:55.600> it<00:03:55.690> look<00:03:55.900> as<00:03:56.200> true<00:03:56.530> as

accomplished making it look as true as

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.890 
accomplished making it look as true as
it<00:03:56.740> could<00:03:56.830> possibly<00:03:56.860> look<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:58.480> when<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.780> look

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
it could possibly look and when you look

at this I think you'll be pleasantly
surprised<00:04:02.410> with<00:04:02.739> this<00:04:02.920> version<00:04:03.190> of<00:04:03.519> Dragon

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
surprised with this version of Dragon

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:40.529 
surprised with this version of Dragon
Balls<00:04:07.920> made<00:04:08.920> of

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.760 

the<00:04:41.539> first<00:04:41.780> filter<00:04:41.960> we<00:04:42.139> use<00:04:42.289> is<00:04:42.470> the<00:04:42.590> dust

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
the first filter we use is the dust

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.200 
the first filter we use is the dust
filter<00:04:43.070> because<00:04:43.789> we're<00:04:43.940> working<00:04:44.060> with

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
filter because we're working with

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.180 
filter because we're working with
animated<00:04:44.570> material<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.470> filters<00:04:45.800> kind<00:04:46.130> of

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
animated material the filters kind of

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.580 
animated material the filters kind of
prone<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:46.639> removing<00:04:47.060> stars<00:04:47.539> from<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.900> sky<00:04:48.139> or

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
prone to removing stars from the sky or

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.070 
prone to removing stars from the sky or
people's<00:04:49.430> pupils<00:04:49.850> so<00:04:50.300> we<00:04:50.419> have<00:04:50.570> to<00:04:50.690> remove<00:04:50.900> it

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
people's pupils so we have to remove it

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.360 
people's pupils so we have to remove it
from<00:04:51.169> specific<00:04:51.650> parts<00:04:51.889> those<00:04:51.979> specific

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
from specific parts those specific

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.070 
from specific parts those specific
scenes<00:04:52.610> before<00:04:53.240> we<00:04:53.330> send<00:04:53.539> it<00:04:53.600> onto<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.900> fix

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
scenes before we send it onto the fix

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.180 
scenes before we send it onto the fix
back<00:04:55.870> so<00:04:56.870> after<00:04:57.229> the<00:04:57.320> dust<00:04:57.530> pass<00:04:57.740> we<00:04:57.889> move<00:04:58.070> on

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
back so after the dust pass we move on

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.129 
back so after the dust pass we move on
to<00:04:58.310> doing<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.639> fixed<00:04:58.910> pass<00:04:59.090> painting<00:04:59.750> out<00:04:59.870> any

after<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.199> fix<00:05:40.409> pass<00:05:40.590> we<00:05:40.800> run<00:05:40.949> the<00:05:41.069> steady

after the fix pass we run the steady

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.439 
after the fix pass we run the steady
