the same with the other side fold it
down<00:00:46.940> I'll<00:00:47.940> take<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.329> part<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.840> fold<00:00:49.500> it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
down I'll take this part and fold it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.410 
down I'll take this part and fold it
down<00:00:49.710> again<00:00:52.610> obviously<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> same<00:00:54.270> as

checker fold it down like this

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.780 
checker fold it down like this
and<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> other<00:01:19.770> side<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.430> as<00:01:20.550> well

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.540 

now<00:01:23.790> pinch<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.470> goes<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.800> me<00:01:26.010> pinch

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
now pinch here so that goes on me pinch

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.140 
now pinch here so that goes on me pinch
-<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.270> pinch<00:01:27.510> it<00:01:27.720> down<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.940> cream

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
- like pinch it down you have the cream

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.910 
- like pinch it down you have the cream
around<00:01:30.360> early<00:01:30.600> should<00:01:30.900> be<00:01:31.020> fairly<00:01:31.320> easy<00:01:31.500> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
want to use scissors if you're not

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.960 
want to use scissors if you're not
comfortable<00:02:09.479> with<00:02:09.720> ripping<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.760> I'll<00:02:11.760> take

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
comfortable with ripping it I'll take

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.009 
comfortable with ripping it I'll take
this<00:02:12.120> strip<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.630> fold<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.350> in<00:02:13.470> half<00:02:14.750> this<00:02:15.750> will

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
this strip and fold it in half this will

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.300 
this strip and fold it in half this will
become<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.380> tail<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.860> plane<00:02:19.070> go<00:02:20.070> about

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
become the tail of the plane go about

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.520 
become the tail of the plane go about
2/3<00:02:20.850> down<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.239> frame<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.640> then<00:02:24.350> rip<00:02:25.350> it

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
2/3 down the frame and then rip it

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.750 
2/3 down the frame and then rip it
halfway<00:02:26.310> down<00:02:28.220> what<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.310> want<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.549> do<00:02:29.640> is

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
halfway down what you want to do is

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.250 
halfway down what you want to do is
create<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.269> little<00:02:30.540> tail<00:02:30.930> yes<00:02:31.829> like<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:33.260> rips

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
create a little tail yes like this rips

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.259 
create a little tail yes like this rips
a<00:02:34.440> little<00:02:34.739> bit<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.340> fold<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.790> down<00:02:37.730> this<00:02:38.730> tail

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
a little bit and fold it down this tail

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.289 
a little bit and fold it down this tail
will<00:02:39.480> hold<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.840> plane<00:02:40.079> up<00:02:40.230> when<00:02:40.500> it's<00:02:40.650> fine

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
will hold the plane up when it's fine

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.509 
will hold the plane up when it's fine
take<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.329> other<00:02:42.570> part<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.870> little<00:02:42.959> plane<00:02:43.519> and

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
take the other part a little plane and

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.809 
take the other part a little plane and
fold<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.440> like<00:02:46.440> so

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.580 

in<00:02:49.819> half<00:02:51.069> now<00:02:52.069> fold<00:02:52.400> this<00:02:52.519> back<00:02:52.730> down<00:02:53.290> as<00:02:54.290> much

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
in half now fold this back down as much

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.440 
in half now fold this back down as much
as<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.829> can<00:02:55.040> until<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.489> hit<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.760> thick<00:02:56.180> part

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
as you can until you hit the thick part

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.619 
as you can until you hit the thick part
of<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.599> plane<00:02:57.280> okay<00:03:00.909> now<00:03:01.909> you<00:03:01.969> can<00:03:02.209> select<00:03:02.450> the

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
of the plane okay now you can select the

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.780 
of the plane okay now you can select the
base<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:02.959> claim<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:04.069> want<00:03:04.099> to<00:03:04.310> intercept<00:03:04.670> the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
base you claim you want to intercept the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.289 
base you claim you want to intercept the
tail<00:03:05.000> here

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
tail here

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.110 
tail here
there<00:03:08.299> you<00:03:08.420> go<00:03:09.220> you<00:03:10.220> want<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.430> fold<00:03:10.640> this<00:03:10.879> part

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
there you go you want to fold this part

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.319 
there you go you want to fold this part
up<00:03:11.329> so<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:11.989> you<00:03:12.140> create<00:03:12.319> flat<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:14.120> will

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
up so that you create flat this will

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.339 
up so that you create flat this will
make<00:03:14.450> sure<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.750> plane<00:03:14.959> is<00:03:15.079> flying<00:03:15.200> straight

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
make sure the plane is flying straight

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.819 
make sure the plane is flying straight
there<00:03:18.349> you<00:03:18.439> go

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
there you go

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.750 
there you go
the<00:03:19.189> world's<00:03:19.549> best<00:03:20.000> paper<00:03:20.629> airplane<00:03:21.639> if<00:03:22.639> you

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
the world's best paper airplane if you

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.819 
the world's best paper airplane if you
want<00:03:22.939> to<00:03:23.000> be<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.120> little<00:03:23.299> bit<00:03:23.450> creative<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:24.680> can

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
want to be a little bit creative you can

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:25.360 
want to be a little bit creative you can
do<00:03:24.950> this

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
do this

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.960 
do this
rip<00:03:25.879> it<00:03:26.000> here<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:26.439> here<00:03:27.489> which<00:03:28.489> will<00:03:28.669> create

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
rip it here and here which will create

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.420 
rip it here and here which will create
the<00:03:29.150> first<00:03:29.389> lifts<00:03:29.840> left<00:03:30.049> get<00:03:30.530> on<00:03:30.650> airplanes<00:03:30.919> go

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
the first lifts left get on airplanes go

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.979 
the first lifts left get on airplanes go
they<00:03:31.549> have<00:03:31.700> no<00:03:31.849> fat<00:03:32.180> side<00:03:32.480> lift<00:03:32.659> the<00:03:32.750> plane

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
they have no fat side lift the plane

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.140 
they have no fat side lift the plane
actually<00:03:33.620> is<00:03:34.129> going<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.430> show<00:03:34.549> you<00:03:34.609> the<00:03:34.760> Polish

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
actually is going to show you the Polish

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:44.630 
actually is going to show you the Polish
way<00:03:35.329> up<00:03:35.450> even<00:03:35.989> longer<00:03:36.939> like<00:03:37.939> this

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640
