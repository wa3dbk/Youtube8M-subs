decided<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.930> not<00:01:43.680> go<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> typical<00:01:45.000> mould

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
decided to not go with a typical mould

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.200 
decided to not go with a typical mould
injected<00:01:45.659> body<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.470> went<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> CNC<00:01:47.700> machine

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
injected body we went with a CNC machine

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.749 
injected body we went with a CNC machine
steel<00:01:48.720> body<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.890> actually<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.280> two-piece

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
steel body and it's actually a two-piece

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.350 
steel body and it's actually a two-piece
design<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:53.100> body<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.610> designed<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.210> actually

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
design the body is designed to actually

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.719 
design the body is designed to actually
come<00:01:54.659> apart<00:01:55.009> when<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.040> wear<00:01:56.280> out<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> tool

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
come apart when you wear out the tool

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.600 
come apart when you wear out the tool
you<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.630> unscrew<00:01:58.070> take<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.159> apart<00:01:59.430> and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
you can unscrew take it apart and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.880 
you can unscrew take it apart and
replace<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.149> tool<00:02:00.329> bit<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.200> way<00:02:01.469> you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
replace the tool bit so that way you

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.499 
replace the tool bit so that way you
don't<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.280> throw<00:02:02.729> away<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.060> tool<00:02:03.240> as

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
don't have to throw away the tool as

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.450 
don't have to throw away the tool as
soon<00:02:03.750> as<00:02:03.840> one<00:02:03.990> bit<00:02:04.170> wears<00:02:04.350> out<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.280> nice

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
soon as one bit wears out and the nice

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.639 
soon as one bit wears out and the nice
thing<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.939> we<00:02:06.060> also<00:02:06.240> include<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.899> second<00:02:07.439> set

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
thing is is we also include a second set

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.430 
thing is is we also include a second set
of<00:02:07.680> bits<00:02:07.979> with<00:02:08.399> each<00:02:08.610> tool<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.869> get<00:02:10.200> two

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
of bits with each tool so you get two

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.400 
of bits with each tool so you get two
tools<00:02:10.739> in

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
tools in

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.650 
tools in
one<00:02:11.500> essentially<00:02:12.160> our<00:02:12.730> last<00:02:13.000> tool<00:02:13.240> line<00:02:13.480> that

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
one essentially our last tool line that

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.560 
one essentially our last tool line that
we<00:02:13.780> have<00:02:14.020> is<00:02:14.350> our<00:02:14.530> new<00:02:14.710> two-way<00:02:15.160> tools<00:02:15.490> it<00:02:15.880> is

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
we have is our new two-way tools it is

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.590 
we have is our new two-way tools it is
made<00:02:16.810> up<00:02:16.960> of<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:18.160> cnc<00:02:18.820> rod<00:02:19.030> this<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.570> a

tools<00:02:28.990> what<00:02:29.860> we've<00:02:29.980> done<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.190> we<00:02:30.430> instead<00:02:30.880> of

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
tools what we've done is we instead of

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.820 
tools what we've done is we instead of
having<00:02:31.150> several<00:02:31.690> tools<00:02:32.050> sitting<00:02:32.410> around<00:02:32.590> and

having several tools sitting around and
falling<00:02:33.220> in<00:02:33.310> your<00:02:33.430> tool<00:02:34.210> bag<00:02:34.420> or<00:02:34.720> toolbox<00:02:35.140> we

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
falling in your tool bag or toolbox we

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.410 
falling in your tool bag or toolbox we
integrated<00:02:36.100> two<00:02:36.370> into<00:02:36.610> one<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.270> only

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
integrated two into one so that you only

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.940 
integrated two into one so that you only
have<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.690> use<00:02:37.810> one<00:02:38.080> tool<00:02:38.350> while<00:02:38.770> you're

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
have to use one tool while you're

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.530

up with what we felt was a product line
that<00:03:18.190> filled<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.850> gap<00:03:18.880> within<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:20.590> market<00:03:20.970> many

don't<00:03:29.740> have<00:03:29.860> some<00:03:30.070> of<00:03:30.190> those<00:03:30.250> other

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
don't have some of those other

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.160 
don't have some of those other
higher-end<00:03:30.730> features<00:03:31.360> that<00:03:31.510> people<00:03:31.780> want<00:03:31.990> and

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
higher-end features that people want and

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.260 
higher-end features that people want and
then<00:03:32.590> in<00:03:32.740> order<00:03:32.860> to<00:03:32.980> get<00:03:33.160> those<00:03:33.370> features<00:03:33.760> they

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
then in order to get those features they

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.730 
then in order to get those features they
have<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.690> end<00:03:34.810> up<00:03:34.900> going<00:03:35.020> up<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.410> higher

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
have to end up going up to a higher

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.010 
have to end up going up to a higher
level<00:03:35.770> light<00:03:36.340> that<00:03:36.970> are<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.090> big<00:03:37.360> bulky<00:03:37.840> light

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
level light that are a big bulky light

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.199 
level light that are a big bulky light
systems<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:39.010> are<00:03:39.130> usually<00:03:39.430> 300<00:03:40.000> plus

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
systems that are usually 300 plus

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.840 
systems that are usually 300 plus
dollars<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.870> they<00:03:41.530> are<00:03:41.680> more<00:03:42.459> than<00:03:42.610> what's

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
dollars and they are more than what's

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.140 
dollars and they are more than what's
necessary<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.080> there<00:03:44.230> was<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.350> nice<00:03:44.940> gap<00:03:45.940> in

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
necessary and so there was a nice gap in

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.910 
necessary and so there was a nice gap in
the<00:03:46.239> middle<00:03:46.360> that<00:03:46.510> we<00:03:46.690> said<00:03:46.900> we<00:03:47.110> wanted<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:47.470> go

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
the middle that we said we wanted to go

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.380 
the middle that we said we wanted to go
take<00:03:48.280> our<00:03:48.430> first<00:03:48.610> venture<00:03:48.790> into<00:03:48.940> lighting

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
take our first venture into lighting

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.170 
take our first venture into lighting
there<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.050> so<00:03:50.739> we<00:03:50.860> deliver<00:03:51.550> three<00:03:51.820> models

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
there and so we deliver three models

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.780 
there and so we deliver three models
this<00:03:52.330> year<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:53.100> what's<00:03:54.100> cool<00:03:54.340> about<00:03:54.370> all<00:03:54.760> of

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
this year and what's cool about all of

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
you flip the light over and there's a

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.010 
you flip the light over and there's a
little<00:04:39.520> USB<00:04:39.850> port<00:04:40.240> right<00:04:40.270> there<00:04:40.420> we<00:04:40.840> use<00:04:40.990> a

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
little USB port right there we use a

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.700 
little USB port right there we use a
mini<00:04:41.320> USB<00:04:41.980> a<00:04:42.490> very<00:04:42.730> very<00:04:42.940> common<00:04:43.440> chord<00:04:44.440> that's

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
mini USB a very very common chord that's

mini USB a very very common chord that's
found<00:04:44.920> on<00:04:45.070> many<00:04:45.280> electronics<00:04:45.940> so<00:04:46.090> we<00:04:46.180> didn't

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
found on many electronics so we didn't

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.390 
found on many electronics so we didn't
want<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.570> use<00:04:47.110> anything<00:04:47.380> proprietary<00:04:47.740> the

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
want to use anything proprietary the

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.250 
want to use anything proprietary the
other<00:04:48.520> nice<00:04:48.790> thing<00:04:49.000> about<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.360> is<00:04:49.420> that<00:04:49.630> our

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
other nice thing about this is that our

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.020 
other nice thing about this is that our
battery<00:04:50.680> is<00:04:50.950> not<00:04:51.280> just<00:04:51.550> a<00:04:51.610> lithium-ion
