this you right now you see that this

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.169 
this you right now you see that this
observer<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.009> coming<00:00:14.250> around<00:00:14.400> killing<00:00:15.089> all

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
observer is coming around killing all

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.000 
observer is coming around killing all
those<00:00:15.299> minor<00:00:15.540> fields<00:00:15.990> these<00:00:16.560> tanks<00:00:16.920> are

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
those minor fields these tanks are

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.599 
those minor fields these tanks are
sieged<00:00:17.340> over<00:00:17.580> here<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.970> we<00:00:18.840> see<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> lot<00:00:19.260> of

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
sieged over here and we see a lot of

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.470 
sieged over here and we see a lot of
factories<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.939> up<00:00:21.119> for<00:00:22.640> nada<00:00:23.640> not<00:00:24.359> as

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
factories going up for nada not as

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.279 
factories going up for nada not as
planting<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.930> couple<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.490> mines<00:00:26.490> at<00:00:26.880> his<00:00:27.150> base<00:00:27.359> I

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
planting a couple of mines at his base I

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.109 
planting a couple of mines at his base I
think<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> main<00:00:29.099> reason<00:00:29.160> for<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.880> is

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
think the main reason for this is

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.440 
think the main reason for this is
because<00:00:30.150> he's<00:00:30.570> afraid<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.500> drops<00:00:32.250> these<00:00:33.090> drops

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
because he's afraid of drops these drops

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.010 
because he's afraid of drops these drops
will<00:00:34.290> land<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.329> minefields<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.450> take<00:00:36.780> some

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
will land in minefields and take some

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.540 
will land in minefields and take some
damage<00:00:37.170> before<00:00:37.530> they're<00:00:37.829> going<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.010> be<00:00:38.460> able

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
damage before they're going to be able

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.020 
damage before they're going to be able
to<00:00:38.790> attack<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.590> also<00:00:40.590> these<00:00:41.550> are<00:00:41.820> good

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
to attack and also these are good

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.869 
to attack and also these are good
against<00:00:42.540> he<00:00:43.290> probably<00:00:43.500> thinks<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.160> since

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
against he probably thinks that since

against he probably thinks that since

snake with the shuttle into not his base
very<00:01:03.660> quickly<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.129> will<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.369> these<00:01:05.760> mines

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
very quickly so this will be these mines

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.810 
very quickly so this will be these mines
will<00:01:06.240> be<00:01:06.330> able<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.540> deter<00:01:06.840> those<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:08.670> can

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
will be able to deter those and you can

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.640 
will be able to deter those and you can

that double gas to his advantage because

retreat at this point he has a lot of

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.309 
retreat at this point he has a lot of
gateways<00:02:18.269> right<00:02:18.450> now<00:02:18.569> very<00:02:18.840> good<00:02:19.079> for<00:02:19.230> his

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
gateways right now very good for his

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.890 
gateways right now very good for his
macro<00:02:19.709> since<00:02:20.609> he<00:02:20.760> has<00:02:20.939> that<00:02:21.150> extra<00:02:21.450> base<00:02:21.659> over

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
macro since he has that extra base over

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.559 
macro since he has that extra base over
there<00:02:22.049> right<00:02:22.980> here<00:02:23.250> he<00:02:23.819> is<00:02:23.939> going<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.180> be<00:02:24.480> able

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
there right here he is going to be able

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.149 
there right here he is going to be able
to<00:02:24.719> make<00:02:24.780> her<00:02:25.019> a<00:02:25.109> lot<00:02:25.260> better<00:02:25.409> have<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.769> lot<00:02:26.010> more

to make her a lot better have a lot more

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.009 
to make her a lot better have a lot more
units<00:02:26.489> as<00:02:26.609> you<00:02:26.760> see<00:02:27.060> he<00:02:27.269> has<00:02:27.359> seven<00:02:27.689> gateways

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
units as you see he has seven gateways

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.140 
units as you see he has seven gateways
compared<00:02:28.409> to<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.799> four<00:02:29.250> gateways<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:30.829> nada

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
compared to the four gateways of nada

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.229 
compared to the four gateways of nada
NASA<00:02:33.150> saw<00:02:33.450> nada<00:02:33.659> getting<00:02:33.930> his<00:02:34.140> mineral<00:02:34.470> only

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
NASA saw nada getting his mineral only

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.729 
NASA saw nada getting his mineral only
so<00:02:36.239> there<00:02:36.480> are<00:02:36.510> some<00:02:36.900> zealot<00:02:37.319> bombs<00:02:37.470> right

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
so there are some zealot bombs right

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.679 
so there are some zealot bombs right
here<00:02:38.010> they<00:02:38.189> are<00:02:38.310> going<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.519> try<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.700> force<00:02:39.450> the

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
here they are going to try and force the

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.929 
here they are going to try and force the
tanks<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.290> do<00:02:40.379> friendly<00:02:40.739> fire<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.129> see<00:02:41.340> that

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
tanks to do friendly fire you see that

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.509 
tanks to do friendly fire you see that
the<00:02:42.060> tank<00:02:42.299> didn't<00:02:43.230> get<00:02:43.409> hit<00:02:43.680> by<00:02:43.889> some<00:02:44.219> splash

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
the tank didn't get hit by some splash

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.750 
the tank didn't get hit by some splash
by<00:02:45.269> another<00:02:45.810> tank<00:02:46.109> but<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.220> was<00:02:47.370> not<00:02:47.519> killed

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
by another tank but it was not killed

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.330 
by another tank but it was not killed
the<00:02:48.720> vultures<00:02:49.109> and<00:02:49.349> if<00:02:49.980> there's<00:02:50.159> more

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
vote these zealot bombs will not work

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.929 
vote these zealot bombs will not work
vultures<00:02:56.790> very<00:02:57.359> quickly<00:02:57.750> destroy<00:02:58.500> any<00:02:58.939> sort

oh okay so i think that nada just scan
to<00:03:06.689> the<00:03:06.750> base<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.950> two<00:03:08.189> oh<00:03:08.750> crap<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.470> not<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.680> did

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
to the base the two oh crap so not a did

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.379 
to the base the two oh crap so not a did
see<00:03:11.159> that<00:03:11.189> base<00:03:11.459> he's<00:03:11.669> going<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:11.879> land<00:03:12.150> his

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
see that base he's going to land his

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.780 
see that base he's going to land his
barracks<00:03:13.049> there<00:03:13.290> there's<00:03:13.919> no<00:03:14.280> defense

that there's no defense there and he's
going<00:03:25.199> to<00:03:25.260> try<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.470> do<00:03:25.680> some<00:03:25.949> a<00:03:26.579> sneak<00:03:27.299> attack

by<00:03:28.049> using<00:03:28.349> his<00:03:28.620> barracks<00:03:28.979> to<00:03:29.220> do<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.579> I'm<00:03:30.060> not

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
by using his barracks to do that I'm not

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.899 
by using his barracks to do that I'm not
sure<00:03:30.419> okay<00:03:31.409> so<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.620> fire<00:03:32.220> bat<00:03:32.430> has<00:03:32.609> actually

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
sure okay so a fire bat has actually

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.849 
sure okay so a fire bat has actually
come<00:03:33.000> out<00:03:33.060> these<00:03:33.569> fire<00:03:33.810> bats<00:03:34.019> are<00:03:34.109> even<00:03:34.349> better

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
come out these fire bats are even better

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.770 
come out these fire bats are even better
against<00:03:35.250> pros<00:03:35.519> because<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.299> probes<00:03:36.540> are

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
against pros because the probes are

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.000 
against pros because the probes are
probably<00:03:37.049> going<00:03:37.169> to<00:03:37.260> try<00:03:37.349> and<00:03:37.379> attack<00:03:37.680> but

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
probably going to try and attack but

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.349 
probably going to try and attack but
he's<00:03:38.099> going<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.250> micro<00:03:38.579> this<00:03:38.729> and<00:03:38.940> make<00:03:39.329> sure

some<00:03:47.010> protection<00:03:47.129> at<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.579> base<00:03:47.729> now<00:03:47.940> another

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
some protection at the base now another

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.629 
some protection at the base now another
fire<00:03:48.389> bat<00:03:48.569> has<00:03:48.780> come<00:03:49.139> out<00:03:49.319> and<00:03:49.560> these<00:03:50.159> drones

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
fire bat has come out and these drones

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.039 
fire bat has come out and these drones
over<00:03:50.849> here<00:03:51.060> are<00:03:51.269> starting<00:03:51.449> to<00:03:51.599> take<00:03:51.780> out<00:03:51.930> these

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
over here are starting to take out these

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.509 
over here are starting to take out these
minds<00:03:52.440> they<00:03:52.829> are<00:03:53.010> going<00:03:53.159> to<00:03:53.250> proceed<00:03:53.370> to

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
minds they are going to proceed to

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.420 
minds they are going to proceed to
attack<00:03:53.940> these<00:03:54.479> these<00:03:54.959> uh<00:03:55.040> probes<00:03:56.040> are<00:03:56.250> going

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
attack these these uh probes are going

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.009 
attack these these uh probes are going
to<00:03:56.489> retreat<00:03:56.819> I<00:03:57.000> think<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.299> cannabis<00:03:57.810> being

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
to retreat I think a cannabis being

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.990 
to retreat I think a cannabis being
warped<00:03:58.349> in<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.739> we<00:03:59.250> see<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.459> these<00:03:59.699> vultures

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
warped in and we see that these vultures

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.729 
warped in and we see that these vultures
and<00:04:00.389> tanks<00:04:00.689> are<00:04:00.780> taking<00:04:01.139> cover<00:04:01.319> under<00:04:01.650> the

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
and tanks are taking cover under the

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.939 
and tanks are taking cover under the
trees<00:04:01.979> very<00:04:02.639> good<00:04:02.939> choice<00:04:03.359> of<00:04:03.769> location<00:04:04.769> to

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
trees very good choice of location to

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.189 
trees very good choice of location to
siege<00:04:05.250> because<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.180> trees<00:04:06.659> give<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:06.959> little

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
siege because the trees give a little

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.589 
siege because the trees give a little
bit<00:04:07.409> of<00:04:07.439> protection<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:08.129> we<00:04:08.879> see<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.359> a

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
bit of protection and we see that a

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.710 
bit of protection and we see that a
zealot<00:04:10.530> has<00:04:10.769> come<00:04:11.189> to<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.459> space<00:04:11.579> and<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.239> did

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
zealot has come to the space and it did

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.849 
zealot has come to the space and it did
scout<00:04:13.049> that<00:04:13.290> barracks<00:04:14.419> the<00:04:15.470> zealot<00:04:16.470> bombs<00:04:16.650> are

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:26.990 
to build some turrets these are going to
deflect<00:04:25.830> any<00:04:26.039> sort<00:04:26.340> of<00:04:26.520> new

templar is gonna do some major damage

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.700 
templar is gonna do some major damage
nada<00:04:33.060> has<00:04:33.270> not<00:04:33.420> seen<00:04:33.690> it<00:04:33.870> yet<00:04:33.900> he's<00:04:34.380> not<00:04:34.530> hurt

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
nada has not seen it yet he's not hurt

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.440 
nada has not seen it yet he's not hurt
it<00:04:34.860> possibly<00:04:35.280> he's<00:04:35.520> not<00:04:35.730> scanning<00:04:36.060> it<00:04:36.270> and

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
it possibly he's not scanning it and

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.320 
it possibly he's not scanning it and
this<00:04:36.780> whole<00:04:37.020> army<00:04:37.860> for<00:04:38.250> not<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.550> it's<00:04:38.970> going<00:04:39.240> to

this whole army for not a it's going to

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.720 
this whole army for not a it's going to
go<00:04:39.420> down<00:04:39.450> this<00:04:40.110> dark<00:04:40.290> templar<00:04:40.740> did<00:04:41.010> get<00:04:41.190> four

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
go down this dark templar did get four

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.900 
go down this dark templar did get four
or<00:04:41.790> five<00:04:41.940> kills<00:04:42.560> so<00:04:43.560> i'm<00:04:44.250> not<00:04:44.520> sure<00:04:44.640> if<00:04:44.760> not<00:04:44.850> i

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
or five kills so i'm not sure if not i

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.640 
or five kills so i'm not sure if not i
did<00:04:45.060> see<00:04:45.360> that<00:04:45.390> if<00:04:45.750> he<00:04:45.960> did<00:04:46.170> he's<00:04:46.410> going<00:04:46.590> to

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
did see that if he did he's going to

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.610 
did see that if he did he's going to
need<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:46.980> get<00:04:47.420> definitely<00:04:48.420> need<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.140> get<00:04:49.410> some

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
need to get definitely need to get some

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.310 
need to get definitely need to get some
more<00:04:49.770> minds<00:04:50.220> around<00:04:50.340> here<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.900> take<00:04:52.170> out

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
more minds around here and take out

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.870 
more minds around here and take out
those<00:04:52.470> observers<00:04:52.830> because<00:04:53.220> observers<00:04:53.730> are

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
those observers because observers are

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.290 
those observers because observers are
totally<00:04:54.240> taking<00:04:55.110> out<00:04:55.230> these<00:04:55.380> minefields<00:04:56.070> and

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
totally taking out these minefields and

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.190 
totally taking out these minefields and
that's<00:04:57.300> not<00:04:57.420> going<00:04:57.540> to<00:04:57.630> be<00:04:57.660> very<00:04:57.720> good<00:04:58.050> because

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
that's not going to be very good because

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.870 
that's not going to be very good because
dark<00:04:58.800> templars<00:04:59.190> will<00:04:59.370> then<00:04:59.490> be<00:04:59.640> able<00:04:59.669> to

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
dark templars will then be able to

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.300 
dark templars will then be able to
proceed<00:05:00.150> in<00:05:00.360> you<00:05:00.870> see<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.620> mineral<00:05:02.040> only

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
proceed in you see that the mineral only

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.000 
proceed in you see that the mineral only
for<00:05:02.669> nada<00:05:03.480> is<00:05:03.750> also<00:05:03.990> going<00:05:04.110> to<00:05:04.200> be<00:05:04.260> attacked<00:05:04.560> he

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
for nada is also going to be attacked he

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.230 
for nada is also going to be attacked he
did<00:05:05.130> lift<00:05:05.310> very<00:05:05.610> quickly<00:05:05.850> though<00:05:06.090> I'm<00:05:06.210> not

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
did lift very quickly though I'm not

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.090 
did lift very quickly though I'm not
sure<00:05:06.510> I<00:05:06.630> don't<00:05:06.810> think<00:05:06.960> it'll<00:05:07.110> die<00:05:07.320> it's<00:05:07.980> going

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
sure I don't think it'll die it's going

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.230 
sure I don't think it'll die it's going
to<00:05:08.130> take<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.310> lot<00:05:08.460> of<00:05:08.520> damage<00:05:08.730> he's<00:05:08.970> putting

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
to take a lot of damage he's putting

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.560 
to take a lot of damage he's putting
some<00:05:09.419> SUVs<00:05:10.169> on<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:10.680> other<00:05:10.830> side<00:05:11.040> to<00:05:11.790> repair<00:05:12.390> as

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
some SUVs on the other side to repair as

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.080 
some SUVs on the other side to repair as
soon<00:05:12.720> as<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:12.960> gets<00:05:13.110> over<00:05:13.460> the<00:05:14.460> command<00:05:14.970> center

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
soon as it gets over the command center

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.760 
soon as it gets over the command center
is<00:05:15.360> taking<00:05:15.600> a<00:05:15.660> lot<00:05:15.780> of<00:05:15.810> damage<00:05:16.080> but<00:05:16.440> it<00:05:16.470> looks

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
is taking a lot of damage but it looks

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.330 
is taking a lot of damage but it looks
like<00:05:16.860> it<00:05:17.040> will<00:05:17.130> be<00:05:17.280> saved<00:05:18.230> so<00:05:19.230> we<00:05:20.070> see<00:05:20.310> that

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
like it will be saved so we see that

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.360 
like it will be saved so we see that
right<00:05:20.880> now<00:05:20.940> not<00:05:21.900> it's<00:05:22.200> going<00:05:22.380> to<00:05:22.440> try<00:05:22.710> and<00:05:22.740> wall

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
right now not it's going to try and wall

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.970 
right now not it's going to try and wall
in<00:05:23.610> slightly<00:05:24.150> so<00:05:24.780> that<00:05:24.810> these<00:05:25.110> dark<00:05:25.590> templars
