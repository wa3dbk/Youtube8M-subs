about drawing a rectangle in within our
SVG<00:00:26.910> working<00:00:27.650> area<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.000> go<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> my<00:00:30.570> file<00:00:30.869> and

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
SVG working area so I go to my file and

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:40.660 
SVG working area so I go to my file and
in<00:00:32.520> my<00:00:33.320> SVG<00:00:35.899> tag<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.489> write<00:00:38.489> our<00:00:38.940> ECT<00:00:39.840> direct

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
in my SVG tag I write our ECT direct

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.630 
in my SVG tag I write our ECT direct
which<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.969> reserved<00:00:42.300> world<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:43.399> draw<00:00:44.399> a

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
rectangle within the SVG element and I

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.840 
rectangle within the SVG element and I
give<00:00:50.010> an<00:00:50.219> ID<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:51.059> my<00:00:52.129> rectangle<00:00:53.129> which<00:00:53.610> would

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
give an ID to my rectangle which would

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.840 
give an ID to my rectangle which would
be<00:00:54.030> my<00:00:54.390> act<00:00:54.949> and<00:00:56.180> two<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.629> give<00:00:59.239> the<00:01:00.239> width

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
be my act and two I give the width

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.710 
be my act and two I give the width
property<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:04.350> my<00:01:04.830> rectangle<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.939> I'd<00:01:06.270> say

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
property of my rectangle and I'd say

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
property of my rectangle and I'd say
that<00:01:06.900> my<00:01:07.080> rectangle<00:01:07.530> would<00:01:07.650> be<00:01:07.860> 300<00:01:08.369> pixels

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
that my rectangle would be 300 pixels

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.320 
that my rectangle would be 300 pixels
white<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:11.720> it<00:01:12.720> would<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.520> 100<00:01:14.520> pixels<00:01:14.970> in

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
white and it would be 100 pixels in

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:25.429 
white and it would be 100 pixels in
height<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:18.439> you<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:23.150> your<00:01:24.150> example<00:01:25.049> with

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
that we have got our rectangle in within

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.600 
that we have got our rectangle in within
our<00:01:43.610> SVG<00:01:44.610> tag<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.439> rectangle<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:47.130> black

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
our SVG tag and this rectangle is black

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.770 
our SVG tag and this rectangle is black
in<00:01:47.790> color<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.990> starts<00:01:49.649> from<00:01:49.890> zero<00:01:50.780> point

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780

on the x-axis and zero point on the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.700 
on the x-axis and zero point on the
y-axis<00:01:56.240> let's<00:01:57.240> suppose<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:58.229> would<00:01:58.500> like

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
y-axis let's suppose that we would like

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.609 
y-axis let's suppose that we would like
to<00:01:58.740> change<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.460> color<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.880> our<00:02:00.240> rectangle<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
to change the color of our rectangle and

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.270 
to change the color of our rectangle and
we<00:02:02.100> would<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.210> start<00:02:04.170> from<00:02:04.530> ten

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
we would like it to start from ten

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.670 
we would like it to start from ten
pixels<00:02:05.700> on<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> x-axis<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.750> ten<00:02:07.110> pixels<00:02:07.500> on

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
pixels on the x-axis and ten pixels on

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.840 
pixels on the x-axis and ten pixels on
the<00:02:07.770> y-axis<00:02:08.209> then<00:02:09.209> how<00:02:09.780> can<00:02:10.410> we<00:02:10.739> do

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
the y-axis then how can we do

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:19.160 
the y-axis then how can we do
that<00:02:12.830> for<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.810> just<00:02:16.430> say<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:18.210> my

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
that for that I just say that my

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.190 
that for that I just say that my
exposition<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.510> 10<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.490> want<00:02:24.330> my<00:02:24.690> rectangle

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
exposition is 10 and I want my rectangle

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.690 
exposition is 10 and I want my rectangle
to<00:02:25.320> start<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.430> y-axis<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:27.290> 10<00:02:28.550> points<00:02:29.550> as

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
to start on the y-axis on 10 points as

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.910 
to start on the y-axis on 10 points as
well<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.770> then<00:02:31.770> I<00:02:31.980> say<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.420> use<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.620> fill

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
well and then I say that I use the fill

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.330 
well and then I say that I use the fill
property<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:36.180> tell<00:02:36.840> my<00:02:37.310> browser<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:40.340> want

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
property to tell my browser that I want

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.840 
property to tell my browser that I want
my<00:02:41.790> rectangle<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.870> be<00:02:43.280> blue<00:02:44.280> in<00:02:44.490> color<00:02:44.880> and

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
my rectangle to be blue in color and

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.310 
my rectangle to be blue in color and
then<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:48.120> click<00:02:48.720> on<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.340> Save<00:02:50.340> button<00:02:50.840> go<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.900> my

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
then I click on the Save button go to my

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.090 
then I click on the Save button go to my
browser<00:02:52.790> click<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:54.030> reload<00:02:54.600> this<00:02:55.230> page<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
browser click on reload this page and

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.960 
browser click on reload this page and
now<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:56.970> see<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.570> our<00:02:58.790> rectangle<00:02:59.790> is

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
now you see that our rectangle is

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.130 
now you see that our rectangle is
starting<00:03:00.600> from<00:03:01.170> 10<00:03:01.560> points<00:03:02.010> on<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.250> x-axis

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
starting from 10 points on the x-axis

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.850 
starting from 10 points on the x-axis
and<00:03:04.140> 10<00:03:04.680> points<00:03:04.890> on<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.370> y-axis<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:07.590> is

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
and 10 points on the y-axis and it is

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:15.740 
and 10 points on the y-axis and it is
blue<00:03:08.550> in<00:03:08.850> color<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:12.500> now<00:03:13.760> let's<00:03:14.760> make<00:03:15.390> our

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
blue in color so now let's make our

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.390 
blue in color so now let's make our
square<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.800> front<00:03:17.490> of<00:03:17.670> our<00:03:18.290> blue<00:03:19.400> rectangle

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
square in front of our blue rectangle

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.810 
square in front of our blue rectangle
how<00:03:21.150> can<00:03:21.420> we<00:03:21.570> do<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:21.990> it<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.770> really<00:03:22.950> simple

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
how can we do that it is really simple

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.340 
how can we do that it is really simple
you<00:03:24.150> just<00:03:24.660> copy<00:03:25.700> this<00:03:26.700> line<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.750> code<00:03:28.020> and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
you just copy this line of code and

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.930 
you just copy this line of code and
paste<00:03:31.350> it

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
paste it

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.550 
paste it
I<00:03:32.970> would<00:03:33.930> use<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.680> zoom<00:03:35.160> out<00:03:36.200> button<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.530> zoom

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
I would use the zoom out button to zoom

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.280 
I would use the zoom out button to zoom
out<00:03:38.780> my<00:03:39.980> text<00:03:40.980> so<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:42.000> would<00:03:42.210> be<00:03:42.330> easier<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.960> see

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
out my text so it would be easier to see

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.700 
out my text so it would be easier to see
all<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:44.010> text<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:46.050> now<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.340> see<00:03:47.910> say<00:03:48.690> that<00:03:48.930> the

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
all the text and now I see say that the

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.910 
all the text and now I see say that the
ID<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:50.370> my<00:03:50.760> rectangle<00:03:51.510> number<00:03:52.230> two<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.650> my

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
ID of my rectangle number two is my

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.970 
ID of my rectangle number two is my
elect<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.870> width<00:03:55.430> would<00:03:56.430> be<00:03:57.980> hundred

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
elect to the width would be hundred

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.240 
elect to the width would be hundred
pixels<00:03:59.240> the<00:04:00.240> height<00:04:00.270> would<00:04:00.780> be<00:04:00.840> 100<00:04:01.770> pixels

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
pixels the height would be 100 pixels

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.780 
pixels the height would be 100 pixels
and<00:04:02.520> I<00:04:03.240> want<00:04:03.690> my<00:04:03.990> rectangle<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.800> start<00:04:05.190> from

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
and I want my rectangle to start from

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.050 
and I want my rectangle to start from
here<00:04:06.380> so<00:04:07.380> now<00:04:07.560> on<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:08.010> y<00:04:08.160> exhale<00:04:08.670> on<00:04:08.880> the

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
here so now on the y exhale on the

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.860 
here so now on the y exhale on the
x-axis<00:04:09.330> I<00:04:09.980> have<00:04:10.980> already<00:04:11.670> started<00:04:12.180> my<00:04:12.480> first

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
x-axis I have already started my first

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.830 
x-axis I have already started my first
rectangle<00:04:13.260> at<00:04:13.740> 10<00:04:14.100> pixels<00:04:14.580> and<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.420> total

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
rectangle at 10 pixels and the total

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.699 
rectangle at 10 pixels and the total
width<00:04:16.140> of<00:04:16.380> my<00:04:16.650> rectangle<00:04:16.860> is<00:04:17.430> 300<00:04:18.299> so<00:04:18.530> it<00:04:19.530> is

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
width of my rectangle is 300 so it is

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.220 
width of my rectangle is 300 so it is
taking<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.580> three<00:04:20.850> hundred<00:04:21.330> and<00:04:21.480> ten<00:04:21.750> pixels

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
taking the three hundred and ten pixels

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.280 
taking the three hundred and ten pixels
space<00:04:23.010> so<00:04:23.610> it<00:04:23.700> is<00:04:23.820> ending<00:04:24.180> at<00:04:24.390> unit<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.080> ten

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
space so it is ending at unit and ten

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.980 
space so it is ending at unit and ten
pixel<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:26.010> would<00:04:26.520> like<00:04:26.700> my<00:04:27.060> second<00:04:27.870> rectangle

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
pixel I would like my second rectangle

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.850 
pixel I would like my second rectangle
to<00:04:28.410> start<00:04:28.740> from<00:04:28.980> here<00:04:29.400> so<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:30.690> would<00:04:31.050> add<00:04:31.350> two

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
to start from here so I would add two

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.520 
to start from here so I would add two
hundred<00:04:32.130> and<00:04:32.280> ten<00:04:32.520> plus<00:04:32.940> ten<00:04:33.270> pixels<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:34.500> I

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
hundred and ten plus ten pixels so I

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:43.760 
hundred and ten plus ten pixels so I
would<00:04:34.980> give<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:36.530> exposition<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.710> be<00:04:39.050> 320<00:04:42.770> and

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
would give the exposition to be 320 and

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.570 
would give the exposition to be 320 and
I<00:04:43.800> would<00:04:44.390> like<00:04:45.390> to<00:04:45.750> start<00:04:46.320> my<00:04:46.440> square<00:04:47.220> from

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
I would like to start my square from

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.900 
I would like to start my square from
here<00:04:47.690> therefore<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:49.380> Y<00:04:49.530> position<00:04:49.800> is<00:04:50.250> 10

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
here therefore the Y position is 10

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.750 
here therefore the Y position is 10
pixels<00:04:51.450> so<00:04:52.290> I<00:04:52.320> do<00:04:52.620> not<00:04:52.860> change<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.340> Y<00:04:53.520> position

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
pixels so I do not change the Y position

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.840 
pixels so I do not change the Y position
I<00:04:54.890> change<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:56.190> fill<00:04:56.460> color<00:04:56.490> of<00:04:56.970> my<00:04:57.410> second

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
I change the fill color of my second

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.310 
I change the fill color of my second
rectangle<00:04:59.850> to<00:05:00.810> be<00:05:00.930> green<00:05:01.290> and<00:05:02.690> now<00:05:03.690> I<00:05:04.050> would

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
rectangle to be green and now I would

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.590 
rectangle to be green and now I would
use<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.580> inline<00:05:05.880> style<00:05:06.980> styles<00:05:07.980> to<00:05:08.640> apply<00:05:08.940> the

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
use the inline style styles to apply the

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.690 
use the inline style styles to apply the
stroke<00:05:10.200> or<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:11.690> line<00:05:12.690> to<00:05:13.320> my<00:05:13.530> or<00:05:13.980> the<00:05:14.190> body<00:05:14.430> to

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
stroke or the line to my or the body to

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.600 
stroke or the line to my or the body to
my<00:05:14.850> rectangle<00:05:15.390> and<00:05:15.540> I<00:05:16.170> would<00:05:16.380> change<00:05:17.040> the

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
my rectangle and I would change the

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.020 
my rectangle and I would change the
width<00:05:17.820> and<00:05:18.060> color<00:05:19.050> of<00:05:19.320> that<00:05:19.680> stroke<00:05:20.670> or<00:05:20.970> the

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
width and color of that stroke or the

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.830 
width and color of that stroke or the
border<00:05:21.690> so<00:05:22.590> how<00:05:22.800> can<00:05:22.860> I<00:05:23.190> do<00:05:23.250> that<00:05:23.400> I<00:05:23.840> simply

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
border so how can I do that I simply

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.260 
border so how can I do that I simply
write<00:05:25.050> style<00:05:26.000> equals<00:05:27.000> two<00:05:27.920> stroke

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
write style equals two stroke

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.600 
write style equals two stroke
which<00:05:30.840> would<00:05:31.080> be<00:05:31.669> red<00:05:32.669> in<00:05:32.819> color<00:05:33.060> I<00:05:34.039> end<00:05:35.039> the

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
which would be red in color I end the

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.300 
which would be red in color I end the
statement<00:05:35.940> with<00:05:36.360> a<00:05:36.599> column<00:05:37.229> semicolon<00:05:38.130> and

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
statement with a column semicolon and

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.939 
statement with a column semicolon and
then<00:05:38.370> I<00:05:39.000> say<00:05:39.419> that<00:05:40.139> the<00:05:40.410> stroke<00:05:41.030> weight<00:05:42.949> should

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
then I say that the stroke weight should

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:55.070 
then I say that the stroke weight should
be<00:05:46.099> 5<00:05:47.099> pixels<00:05:47.699> I<00:05:49.340> click<00:05:50.340> on<00:05:50.660> and<00:05:51.800> then<00:05:52.800> I<00:05:54.080> chose

graphic you can see that it is not
losing<00:06:35.399> the<00:06:35.939> quality<00:06:36.469> why<00:06:37.469> because<00:06:38.369> it<00:06:38.669> is<00:06:38.969> in

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:39.439 
losing the quality why because it is in

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:45.409 
losing the quality why because it is in
scalable<00:06:40.439> vector<00:06:41.029> graphics<00:06:42.029> format<00:06:43.490> so<00:06:44.490> this
