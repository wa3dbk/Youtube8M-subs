several studies that there's an audience
effect<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:07.880> some<00:01:08.780> animal<00:01:09.320> species<00:01:09.619> actually

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
effect so some animal species actually

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.510 
effect so some animal species actually
to<00:01:11.210> adjust<00:01:11.690> their<00:01:12.259> calling<00:01:12.770> frequency

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
to adjust their calling frequency

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
to adjust their calling frequency
according<00:01:14.299> to<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.720> audiences<00:01:15.680> around<00:01:16.540> but

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
according to the audiences around but

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.390 
according to the audiences around but
only<00:01:17.900> few<00:01:18.110> studies<00:01:18.409> really<00:01:18.799> looked<00:01:19.040> at<00:01:19.159> the

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
only few studies really looked at the

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.250 
only few studies really looked at the
underlying<00:01:19.729> emotional<00:01:20.570> state<00:01:20.900> of<00:01:20.930> the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
underlying emotional state of the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.580 
underlying emotional state of the
animals<00:01:21.680> then<00:01:22.430> working<00:01:22.760> with<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.119> wolves<00:01:23.390> and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
animals then working with the wolves and

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.140 
animals then working with the wolves and
taking<00:01:24.590> them<00:01:24.740> out<00:01:24.890> for<00:01:25.189> walks<00:01:25.430> we<00:01:25.700> realize

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
taking them out for walks we realize

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.810 
taking them out for walks we realize
that<00:01:26.180> they<00:01:26.630> pay<00:01:26.990> off<00:01:27.140> from<00:01:27.350> trowel<00:01:27.830> almost

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
that they pay off from trowel almost

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.340 
that they pay off from trowel almost
each<00:01:28.939> time<00:01:29.240> when<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.479> take<00:01:29.689> out<00:01:29.869> an<00:01:29.990> animal

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
each time when you take out an animal

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.100 
each time when you take out an animal
for<00:01:30.560> walk<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:31.240> we<00:01:32.240> were<00:01:32.390> interested<00:01:32.689> by<00:01:33.049> the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
for walk and we were interested by the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.440 
for walk and we were interested by the
actually<00:01:33.530> Howard<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.130> for<00:01:34.549> how<00:01:34.939> often<00:01:35.299> they

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
actually Howard so for how often they

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.510 
actually Howard so for how often they
hold<00:01:35.720> is<00:01:35.869> that<00:01:36.049> this<00:01:36.229> dependent<00:01:36.799> for<00:01:37.040> example

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
hold is that this dependent for example

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.109 
hold is that this dependent for example
on<00:01:38.470> who's<00:01:39.470> leading<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:40.040> pack<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:40.790> it<00:01:40.909> could<00:01:41.090> be

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
on who's leading the pack so it could be

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.440 
on who's leading the pack so it could be
that<00:01:41.299> it's<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:42.070> price<00:01:43.070> ranking<00:01:43.580> animal<00:01:44.299> the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
that it's a price ranking animal the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.320 
that it's a price ranking animal the
iphone<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:44.860> leaving<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:45.979> tech<00:01:46.220> then<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.180> rest

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
iphone is leaving the tech then the rest

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.510 
iphone is leaving the tech then the rest
of<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.659> pack<00:01:47.900> is<00:01:48.170> really<00:01:48.710> howling<00:01:49.070> more

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
of the pack is really howling more

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.250 
of the pack is really howling more
because<00:01:49.909> their<00:01:50.119> leader<00:01:50.330> is<00:01:50.450> fun

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:04.820 

Oh

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.170 

we<00:02:05.830> were<00:02:05.980> interested<00:02:06.250> but<00:02:06.610> drives<00:02:06.940> the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
we were interested but drives the

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.109 
we were interested but drives the
howling<00:02:07.630> them<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:08.250> why<00:02:09.250> do<00:02:09.310> they<00:02:09.460> howl<00:02:09.850> and

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
howling them so why do they howl and

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.330 
howling them so why do they howl and
it's<00:02:10.509> other<00:02:10.780> differences<00:02:11.530> in<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.950> amount<00:02:11.980> of

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
it's other differences in the amount of

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.220 
it's other differences in the amount of
holding<00:02:12.820> dependent<00:02:13.390> on<00:02:13.510> who's<00:02:13.810> leaving<00:02:14.050> the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
holding dependent on who's leaving the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.830 
holding dependent on who's leaving the
pack<00:02:14.590> what<00:02:15.460> we<00:02:15.610> did<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:15.940> set<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.330> rules<00:02:16.540> went

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
pack what we did to set the rules went

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.910 
pack what we did to set the rules went
for<00:02:17.080> walks<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.650> each<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.130> I'm<00:02:18.460> going<00:02:19.920> you

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
for walks of each and I'm going you

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.630 
for walks of each and I'm going you
could<00:02:21.130> take<00:02:21.340> out<00:02:21.520> for<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:21.850> walk<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.390> then

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
could take out for a walk and then

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.270 
could take out for a walk and then
measure<00:02:24.810> how<00:02:25.810> much<00:02:26.080> excuse<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.590> rest<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.160> the

we<00:02:35.410> collected<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:37.050> saliva<00:02:38.050> samples<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:38.980> then

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
we collected the saliva samples and then

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.610 
we collected the saliva samples and then
you<00:02:39.820> can<00:02:40.150> analyze<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.690> saliva<00:02:41.050> samples

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
you can analyze the saliva samples

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.310 
you can analyze the saliva samples
afterwards<00:02:42.340> for<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.790> cortisol<00:02:43.300> levels<00:02:43.720> to

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
afterwards for the cortisol levels to

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.500 
afterwards for the cortisol levels to
define<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:45.100> relationship<00:02:45.520> between<00:02:46.180> the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
define the relationship between the

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.449 
define the relationship between the
animals<00:02:46.930> we<00:02:47.080> collected<00:02:47.650> vocal<00:02:48.100> animal

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
animals we collected vocal animal

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.140 
animals we collected vocal animal
samples<00:02:48.940> so<00:02:49.150> we<00:02:49.180> observed<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.900> animals<00:02:50.500> and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
samples so we observed the animals and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.699 
samples so we observed the animals and
then<00:02:52.150> based<00:02:52.450> on<00:02:52.660> these<00:02:52.810> observations<00:02:53.500> we

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
then based on these observations we

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.699 
then based on these observations we
could<00:02:53.950> define<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:55.000> rank<00:02:55.420> hierarchy<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.350> the

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
could define the rank hierarchy and the

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.050 
could define the rank hierarchy and the
social<00:02:57.040> relationships<00:02:57.580> of<00:02:57.730> these<00:02:57.880> animals

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
social relationships of these animals

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.210 
social relationships of these animals
the<00:02:58.810> first<00:02:59.080> result<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.590> we<00:02:59.709> found<00:02:59.860> on<00:03:00.070> the

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
the first result that we found on the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.630 
the first result that we found on the
analyze<00:03:00.580> our<00:03:00.820> data<00:03:00.940> is<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:03.190> wolves<00:03:03.520> are

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
analyze our data is that the wolves are

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.760 
analyze our data is that the wolves are
more<00:03:03.940> stressed<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.660> cortisol<00:03:05.050> levels<00:03:05.500> are

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
more stressed so the cortisol levels are

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.130 
more stressed so the cortisol levels are
higher<00:03:06.160> when<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.299> animals<00:03:07.630> are<00:03:07.720> taken<00:03:07.930> out

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
higher when the animals are taken out

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.080 
higher when the animals are taken out
for<00:03:08.500> walk<00:03:08.769> compared<00:03:09.489> to<00:03:09.580> them<00:03:09.670> they're<00:03:10.000> just

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
for walk compared to them they're just

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.780 
for walk compared to them they're just
in<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.600> Navy<00:03:10.810> inclusions<00:03:11.560> showing<00:03:12.400> us<00:03:12.519> that

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
in the Navy inclusions showing us that

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.270 
in the Navy inclusions showing us that
actually<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.299> test<00:03:13.540> situation<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:14.410> more

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
actually the test situation is more

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.600 
actually the test situation is more
stressful<00:03:15.610> for<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.150> remaining<00:03:17.019> animals<00:03:17.610> so

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
stressful for the remaining animals so

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.550 
stressful for the remaining animals so
they<00:03:18.640> don't<00:03:19.269> like<00:03:19.510> it<00:03:19.690> as<00:03:19.840> much<00:03:19.870> or<00:03:20.320> they<00:03:20.440> are

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
they don't like it as much or they are

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.340 
they don't like it as much or they are
more<00:03:20.769> agitated<00:03:21.760> if<00:03:22.180> an<00:03:22.420> animal<00:03:22.570> without<00:03:22.900> for

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
more agitated if an animal without for

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.530 
more agitated if an animal without for
walk<00:03:23.620> thanassis<00:03:24.160> terminating<00:03:24.940> enclosures

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
walk thanassis terminating enclosures

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.220 
walk thanassis terminating enclosures
but<00:03:25.870> then<00:03:26.080> we<00:03:26.200> looked<00:03:26.380> at<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.620> test<00:03:26.880> condition

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
but then we looked at the test condition

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.289 
but then we looked at the test condition
particularly<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:30.040> parties<00:03:30.400> will<00:03:30.580> ever<00:03:30.790> could

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
particularly the parties will ever could

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.470 
particularly the parties will ever could
not<00:03:31.330> explain<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:33.400> amount<00:03:33.610> of<00:03:33.790> howling<00:03:34.090> that

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
not explain the amount of howling that

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.810 
not explain the amount of howling that
we<00:03:34.630> recorded<00:03:35.019> in<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.470> animals<00:03:35.890> but<00:03:36.519> this

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
we recorded in the animals but this

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
we recorded in the animals but this
amount<00:03:37.660> of<00:03:37.810> howling<00:03:38.110> was<00:03:38.640> dependent<00:03:39.640> on<00:03:40.390> the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
amount of howling was dependent on the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.470 
amount of howling was dependent on the
rank<00:03:41.080> of<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.410> living<00:03:41.799> animal<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.209> higher

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
rank of the living animal so the higher

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.840 
rank of the living animal so the higher
ranking<00:03:43.900> animals<00:03:44.290> cost<00:03:44.650> more<00:03:45.160> howling<00:03:45.670> and

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
ranking animals cost more howling and

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.479 
ranking animals cost more howling and
also<00:03:46.690> on<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.959> relationship<00:03:47.410> that<00:03:48.100> the

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
also on the relationship that the

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.970 
also on the relationship that the
particular<00:03:48.910> individual<00:03:49.780> habits<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.560> that

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
particular individual habits and that

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.280 
particular individual habits and that
end<00:03:51.160> up<00:03:51.370> for<00:03:51.640> walk<00:03:51.850> so<00:03:52.420> with<00:03:52.660> this<00:03:52.780> study<00:03:53.110> we

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
end up for walk so with this study we

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.549 
end up for walk so with this study we
could<00:03:53.470> really<00:03:53.739> show<00:03:53.950> that<00:03:53.980> awesome
