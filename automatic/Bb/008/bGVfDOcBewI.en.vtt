00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.900
 sl with you and in this video we'll talk 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.619
 about the importance of coordination 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.740
 allies excursion in the previous 13 minutes 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:21.340
 battlefield battle 10 levels probability of victory 42 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.430
 percent i stay one to two you 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.800
 pawns 9 and 10 level while the enemies know 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.789
 where i'm so close earlier 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.039
 from here I took 704 objects and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.320
 vaffentragera ninth level look 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.780
 on the upper right corner of time remains 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.960
 very very few that is enemies not 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.579
 have time to get to the base and take the base not 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.410
 can accordingly only 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.380
 option that they have to do it 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.530
 come and destroy the player the more I 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.690
 in the minority and here the guys committed 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.360
 the very mistake that led to 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.829
 the creation of this video namely the absence 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.260
 coordination 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.270
 that is, they had enough time 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.820
 to coordinate your actions well 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.219
 or at least just come at the same time 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.069
 I'm not talking about such an interesting 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:11.499
 a thing like ticks though ticks then not 

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:13.990
 interfered with making the speakers would be enough 

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:16.749
 so what am I quietly shooting 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.810
 waffentreger and recharge 

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:21.299
 recharged and what am i doing right 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.219
 I'm waiting for the face 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.799
 I will have enough cubes to tear down the soil 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.840
 remaining strength points and here 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.469
 no problems are expected here 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.159
 actually watch here actually frag 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:38.319
 the result of the victory of the numerical superiority in 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.990
 the adversary is precisely the lack of coordination 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.389
 the players of the enemy team and led them 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.729
 to defeat them, no one bothers to take 

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:47.859
 pins in ticks or come at least 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.029
 at the same time so that the slayer does not 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.119
 had time to recharge 

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:55.630
 and recharge you issue more than 15 seconds 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.999
 I mean, this is the time they donâ€™t 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.880
 coordinated among themselves and that is exactly 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:02.590
 led them to defeat therefore 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.340
 try to coordinate your actions 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.649
 on the battlefield and put everything on like this 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.069
 subscribe to our channel and good luck in 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.069
