piece has a role and how they all have
their<00:02:35.900> own<00:02:35.930> movements<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:38.060> can<00:02:38.269> also<00:02:38.420> level

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
their own movements you can also level

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.660 
their own movements you can also level
up<00:02:39.049> your<00:02:39.200> monsters<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:40.220> will<00:02:40.400> make<00:02:40.549> them

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
up your monsters this will make them

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.610 
up your monsters this will make them
stronger<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.299> sometimes<00:02:41.870> give<00:02:42.170> them<00:02:42.350> special

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
stronger and sometimes give them special

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.130 
stronger and sometimes give them special
abilities<00:02:43.340> for<00:02:44.060> example<00:02:44.510> if<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:44.989> were<00:02:45.109> to

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
abilities for example if you were to

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.310 
abilities for example if you were to
level<00:02:45.560> up<00:02:45.739> your<00:02:46.010> sewage<00:02:46.790> in<00:02:46.940> level<00:02:47.359> 2<00:02:47.570> you

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
level up your sewage in level 2 you

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.229 
level up your sewage in level 2 you
would<00:02:48.440> get<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.739> water<00:02:49.010> wall<00:02:49.310> ability<00:02:49.850> and

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
would get the water wall ability and

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.300 
would get the water wall ability and
will<00:02:50.420> be<00:02:50.600> able<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:51.019> not<00:02:51.170> be<00:02:51.230> hurt<00:02:51.709> by<00:02:51.920> attack

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
will be able to not be hurt by attack

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.080 
will be able to not be hurt by attack
for<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.670> 1<00:02:52.880> turn<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:54.820> naturally<00:02:55.820> through

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
for a 1 turn and naturally through

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.880 
for a 1 turn and naturally through
leveling<00:02:56.540> up<00:02:56.690> your<00:02:56.900> monsters<00:02:57.079> get<00:02:57.500> stronger

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
leveling up your monsters get stronger

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.539 
leveling up your monsters get stronger
as<00:02:58.160> well<00:02:58.959> your<00:02:59.959> monsters<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.769> evolve<00:03:01.040> too

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
as well your monsters can evolve too

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.270 
as well your monsters can evolve too
like<00:03:02.060> in<00:03:02.209> Pokemon<00:03:02.690> some<00:03:03.320> monsters<00:03:03.829> all<00:03:04.100> you

level and they will

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.390 
level and they will
volve<00:03:07.150> others<00:03:07.810> is<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.050> bit<00:03:08.319> trickier<00:03:08.830> for
