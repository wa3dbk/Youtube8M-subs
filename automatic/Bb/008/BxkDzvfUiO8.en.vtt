 [Music]

 [Music] 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.180
 two 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.030
 look 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.160
 we continue living what happens in these 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.320
 bicentennial celebrations we are with 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.810
 Antonio Birabent has just come out of this 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.630
 wonder this emotion rock star like 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.790
 was to live the Sant Aniol scenario 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.310
 unforgettable because it was the energy of 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.640
 people many colleagues above the 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.250
 stage and a very special night there 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.720
 so it is celebrated by how it 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.720
 celebrated with Argentine songs was a 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.390
 night that overflowed me a bit came 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.590
 prepared but it surpassed me so 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.280
 I am very happy to have formed 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.469
 part of this centennial night of 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.820
 bicentennial and with Argentine rock with 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.920
 your father has blown rock and roll 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.960
 from the cradle what kind of circle 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.030
 you can do from those early years 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.160
 until what we live now opening 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.019
 these celebrations of the bicentennial rock 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.239
 argentinian look today sing a theme of 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.549
 my father's maurice was 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.549
 it was very emotional for me because apart it is 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.860
 a song that he has as a DNA 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.110
 a bit of Argentine rock in the form 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.689
 of using the language there is a lot of tango in 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.340
 his song too and while he was singing 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.830
 that story of a boy who walks 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.799
 for in this case good air and wait 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.929
 the dawn I felt so identified 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.610
 with that way of writing and I think that 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.610
 many of us who do songs 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.149
 in Spanish we owe them a lot 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.429
 enlisted my father to cantil to so many 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.830
 others to the lion then you have to follow that 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.110
 line each one in its own way is for me a 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.520
 pride belong in this case to that 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.869
 movement and in the middle of all the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.159
 wonder they did on stage 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.709
 of the musical plane and all the emotion 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.659
 it was present gustavo cerati not in 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:53.020
 this difficult moment if I believe that 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:56.470
 luck that I remembered and because if not the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.470
 better it happened and it was very nice to be able to 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.300
 wish you in such a big place with 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.580
 so many people 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:09.369
 a good wish to gustavo no and it was 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.050
 special I imagine that some of that is in 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.580

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.750

 as we said to start tree or in 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.160
 a little while longer with all your music there is a 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.810
 moment to open the door to 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.640
 Uruguay we see them out there they are walking 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.620

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.600
 they come to bring all their music and their humor 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.520
 and then well we already have a little bit of 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.020
 festive rock and roll with stellar 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.550
 with viruses with the parakeets with all 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.920
 that they are adding up on this night is 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.380
 enormous the amount of musicians that there is in 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.670
