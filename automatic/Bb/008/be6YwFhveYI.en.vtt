dried food diet so what what you guys
should<00:02:24.200> train<00:02:24.650> them<00:02:24.859> to<00:02:25.040> do<00:02:25.160> what's<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.609> trade

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
should train them to do what's the trade

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.950 
should train them to do what's the trade
how<00:02:26.060> long<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.329> a<00:02:26.359> training<00:02:26.810> process

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
how long is a training process

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.610 
how long is a training process
a<00:02:28.080> dog<00:02:28.710> would<00:02:28.920> come<00:02:29.250> initially<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:30.360> us<00:02:30.540> from<00:02:31.500> a

breeding scheme initially and they would
go<00:02:36.210> on<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.360> basic<00:02:36.720> dog<00:02:37.230> course<00:02:37.560> or<00:02:38.570> eight<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.780> ten

go on a basic dog course or eight to ten
weeks<00:02:40.200> depending<00:02:40.380> on<00:02:40.590> how<00:02:40.770> progress<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.520> made

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
weeks depending on how progress is made

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.090 
weeks depending on how progress is made
and<00:02:42.150> we<00:02:42.690> cover<00:02:42.930> all<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.140> basics<00:02:43.650> it's<00:02:43.890> quite

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
and we cover all the basics it's quite

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.810 
and we cover all the basics it's quite
repetitive<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:46.070> at<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.190> end<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.460> that<00:02:47.640> you've

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
repetitive and at the end of that you've

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.360 
repetitive and at the end of that you've
got<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.030> dog<00:02:48.240> that's<00:02:48.480> trained<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.170> do<00:02:49.370> various

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
got a dog that's trained to do various

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.450 
got a dog that's trained to do various
different<00:02:50.430> aspects<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.120> policing<00:02:52.080> work<00:02:52.460> and

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
different aspects of policing work and

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.580 
different aspects of policing work and
then<00:02:53.940> it's<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.210> case<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.420> converting<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.050> onto

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
then it's a case of converting that onto

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.140 
then it's a case of converting that onto
the<00:02:55.680> street<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.700> doing<00:02:56.880> lots<00:02:57.060> of

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
the street and doing lots of

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.000 
the street and doing lots of
environmental<00:02:57.420> training<00:02:58.110> on<00:02:58.200> top<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.590> so

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
environmental training on top of that so

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.920 
environmental training on top of that so
it's<00:02:59.130> quite<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.310> long<00:02:59.430> process<00:02:59.580> so<00:03:00.120> if<00:03:00.840> you've

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
it's quite a long process so if you've

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.630 
it's quite a long process so if you've
got<00:03:01.050> an<00:03:01.140> exciting<00:03:01.470> store<00:03:02.040> is<00:03:02.280> there<00:03:02.430> any<00:03:02.580> quick

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640
