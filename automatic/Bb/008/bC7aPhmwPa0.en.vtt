00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.310
 gta has been a saga that has given a lot 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.529
 what to talk about whether for good or for 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.540
 bad the saga grand theft auto 'has 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.879
 become one of the most video games 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.330
 famous and successful in the history of the 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.920
 games in this video I selected 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.260
 five of the 15 deliveries of the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.440
 franchise based on the quality of 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.020
 your arguments before starting I want to 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.910
 as always tell them everything 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.490
 I will say below is the result of my 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.950
 opinion as well as that I have played 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.899
 all the games of this top and also 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.239
 those who are not so all the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.010
 posts are justified from some 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.010
 so let's start then 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.950
 Maybe they think I've lost my mind 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.290
 but as the saying goes there is no need 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:02.220
 jump to a book for its cover and grand 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:06.059
 theft auto chinatown wars in this video 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.059
 well, anything 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.619
 imagine that you have been feeling 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.750
 death in the face the cause of man and 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.580
 without leaving that same one that sends you to 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.740
 a mission that is rather a trap 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.810
 to kill you survive if you decide 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.659
 Seize the city by your own 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.850
 months something like this is ahead though vice 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.039
 guys a game that keeps you 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.720
 hooked from righteousness in a 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.670
 entertaining plot and perfectly 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.530
 seat 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.080
 I do not think there is someone who has not 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.740
 smoked vice city but is that no more than 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.740
 the black wolves 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.740
 peggy 18 although grand theft auto 5 was 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.610
 huge I always say a phrase never 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.300
 no game is perfect 75 was not the 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.610
 exception 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.310
 and one of the aspects that for me the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.590
 he left that to wish was the history then 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.480
 it started as a huge balloon but 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.730
 while advancing the story I was going 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.280
 declining more and more until finally 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.380
 stumble on the end of that eye not 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.900
 they create not for a second that an argument 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.030
 of this title is bad in fact it's good 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.580
 mature and innovative is not for nothing 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.470
 I put it above prison and if I 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.330
 I would have developed the story of 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.100
 better way the world and the end 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.650
 could easily have come the 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.580
 put number 8 but you have to say the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.280
 things like they are 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.280
 gta 5 place number 3 on the list 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.910
 yes of course yes in the second place and 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.980
 with silver medal we have the between 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.040
 Quotation very, very close to quotes 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.340
 black sheep of the saga gta grand theft 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.590
 car 4 you have the very well earned this 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.930
 since the story is very deep 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.210
 complete and detailed unlike 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.120
 previous deliveries but the thing improves 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.100
 a thousand more if you play your two expansions 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.900
 it's a unique experience is of the 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.600
 best stories I've seen in what 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.370
 concerns open- world games their 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.290
 characters were also one of the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.970
 great factors that place in this 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.340
 place to this great game 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.340
 grand theft auto 4 place number 2 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.470
 I will be honest it was very difficult to follow 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.630
 between this title and gta 4 but 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.630
 I finally decided that the experience more 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.090
 complete funny dramatic surround 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.940
 and above all superior was the grand theft 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.040
 auto san andreas maybe more than one is 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.240
 I expected it because it was this title that 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.270
 he fell in love with millions of players 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.550
 around the globe the 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.920
 history of cj and the globe street is 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.080
 for me the best story created to the 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.570
 date with intense missions and dialogues 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.910
 well I want to leave you much worse 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.130
 that when you finish with your girlfriend you 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.290
 you can have your own opinion and I the 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.770
 respect because everyone has their tastes 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.319
 and preferences 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.690
 the top has finished I hope there 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:53.000
