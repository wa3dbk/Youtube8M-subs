was putting in 15,000 yards a day and I
never<00:00:12.820> understood<00:00:12.940> the<00:00:13.480> point<00:00:13.720> of<00:00:14.019> why<00:00:14.260> a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
never understood the point of why a

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.640

friends only out of something
because<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:22.150> high<00:00:22.390> yardage<00:00:22.930> they<00:00:23.170> grind

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
because the the high yardage they grind

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.620 
because the the high yardage they grind
the<00:00:23.800> athletes<00:00:24.220> that<00:00:24.430> they<00:00:24.490> tied<00:00:25.029> all<00:00:25.270> the<00:00:25.359> time

I'm a assistance it's crazy practicing
slow<00:00:33.370> swimming<00:00:33.850> does<00:00:34.030> not<00:00:34.239> make<00:00:34.510> a<00:00:34.780> fast

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
slow swimming does not make a fast

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.490 
slow swimming does not make a fast
swimmer<00:00:35.800> so<00:00:36.520> much<00:00:36.700> Dogma<00:00:37.390> in<00:00:37.630> swimming<00:00:38.170> and

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
swimmer so much Dogma in swimming and

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.709 
swimmer so much Dogma in swimming and
it's<00:00:38.649> so<00:00:38.829> hard<00:00:39.250> for<00:00:39.640> people<00:00:39.700> to<00:00:39.969> break<00:00:40.510> away

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
it's so hard for people to break away

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.680 
it's so hard for people to break away
from<00:00:41.020> it<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:42.550> knew<00:00:43.000> that<00:00:43.180> there<00:00:43.329> had<00:00:43.390> to<00:00:43.540> be

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
from it and we knew that there had to be

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.600 
from it and we knew that there had to be
a<00:00:43.780> better<00:00:43.960> way<00:00:44.200> of<00:00:44.230> doing<00:00:44.469> that<00:00:44.739> at<00:00:45.430> any

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
a better way of doing that at any

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.360 
a better way of doing that at any
obviously<00:00:46.030> I<00:00:46.059> didn't<00:00:46.809> think<00:00:47.320> well<00:00:47.649> you<00:00:48.190> could

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
obviously I didn't think well you could

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.550 
obviously I didn't think well you could
just<00:00:48.550> train<00:00:48.850> them

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
just train them

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.700 
just train them
No<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.400> it<00:00:50.520> until<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.660> met<00:00:51.990> dark<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.590> was

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
No and do it until we met dark so it was

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.160 
No and do it until we met dark so it was
really<00:00:52.920> easy<00:00:53.160> for<00:00:53.310> me<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.580> say<00:00:53.820> okay<00:00:54.150> I<00:00:54.360> get<00:00:54.840> it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
really easy for me to say okay I get it

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.900 
really easy for me to say okay I get it
once<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:55.620> started<00:00:55.920> training<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.670> I

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
once we started training like this I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.650 
once we started training like this I
mean<00:00:57.090> our<00:00:57.300> times<00:00:57.810> I<00:00:58.290> improved<00:00:58.860> drastically

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
mean our times I improved drastically

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.880 
mean our times I improved drastically
everything<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:01.020> geared<00:01:01.290> toward<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
everything is geared toward the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.680 
everything is geared toward the
technique<00:01:02.310> if<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.240> don't<00:01:03.480> have<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
technique if you don't have the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.920 
technique if you don't have the
technique<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:05.300> lot<00:01:06.300> of<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.420> other<00:01:06.540> stuff<00:01:06.780> is

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
technique a lot of the other stuff is

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.150 
technique a lot of the other stuff is
not<00:01:07.080> going<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.290> make<00:01:07.410> any<00:01:07.590> difference<00:01:07.710> I

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
not going to make any difference I

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.330 
not going to make any difference I
believe<00:01:09.120> your<00:01:09.750> overuse<00:01:10.290> injuries<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:11.160> gonna

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
believe your overuse injuries are gonna

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.770 
believe your overuse injuries are gonna
go<00:01:11.550> away<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:12.090> know<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.270> long<00:01:12.450> as<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.690> are

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
go away you know as long as you are

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.480 
go away you know as long as you are
still<00:01:13.080> obviously<00:01:13.620> concentrating<00:01:14.430> on

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
still obviously concentrating on

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.910 
still obviously concentrating on
technique<00:01:14.940> because<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.380> know<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.650> swim

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
technique because you know if you swim

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.430 
technique because you know if you swim
properly<00:01:17.160> you<00:01:17.820> save<00:01:18.120> your<00:01:18.240> joints<00:01:18.660> and<00:01:18.780> your

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
properly you save your joints and your

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.200 
properly you save your joints and your
thousands<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.220> thousands<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.610> yards<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.090> an

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
thousands and thousands of yards on an

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.530 
thousands and thousands of yards on an
onion<00:01:21.660> on<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.930> bad<00:01:22.619> motion<00:01:23.550> it's<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> ruin

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
onion on a bad motion it's going to ruin

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.240 
onion on a bad motion it's going to ruin
your<00:01:24.869> rotated<00:01:25.500> captain<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.860> see<00:01:26.010> it<00:01:26.070> all<00:01:26.160> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
your rotated captain you see it all the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.880 
your rotated captain you see it all the
time<00:01:26.310> without<00:01:27.030> training<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.690> mean<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.170> typical

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
time without training I mean a typical

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.980 
time without training I mean a typical
practice<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.460> usually<00:01:29.820> an<00:01:29.910> hour<00:01:30.060> if<00:01:30.720> we're

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
practice is usually an hour if we're

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.380 
practice is usually an hour if we're
lucky<00:01:31.110> maybe<00:01:31.290> an<00:01:31.590> hour<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:31.920> half<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.490> I

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
lucky maybe an hour and a half and I

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.260 
lucky maybe an hour and a half and I
guess<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.220> train<00:01:35.430> twice<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.700> day<00:01:35.970> so

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
guess we do you train twice a day so

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.910 
guess we do you train twice a day so
well<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.600> morning<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.080> evening<00:01:37.110> just

well in the morning in the evening just

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.350 
well in the morning in the evening just
kind<00:01:38.190> of<00:01:38.250> space<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.490> out<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.880> give<00:01:39.000> us<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.090> nut

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
kind of space it out and give us a nut

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.570 
kind of space it out and give us a nut
breast<00:01:39.660> you<00:01:40.380> can<00:01:40.440> go<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.800> meet<00:01:41.070> penny<00:01:41.369> some

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
know we don't need to taper because he's

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.580 
know we don't need to taper because he's
not<00:01:50.820> he's<00:01:51.150> not<00:01:51.180> fatigued<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:52.259> don't<00:01:52.410> get<00:01:52.530> at

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
not he's not fatigued we don't get at

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.650 
not he's not fatigued we don't get at
the<00:01:52.710> pool<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.070> his<00:01:53.190> all<00:01:53.310> water<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.390> know<00:01:54.509> we

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
the pool in his all water you know we

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.109 
the pool in his all water you know we
get<00:01:54.840> too<00:01:55.050> close<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.710> overreaching<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.670> then

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
get too close to overreaching and then

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.440 
get too close to overreaching and then
we<00:01:57.270> rest<00:01:57.509> them<00:01:57.720> so<00:01:57.899> he<00:01:58.020> never<00:01:58.289> goes<00:01:58.619> into<00:01:59.009> a

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
we rest them so he never goes into a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.210 
we rest them so he never goes into a
deteriorated<00:02:00.450> Wayne<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.800> lot<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.009> people

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
deteriorated Wayne and a lot of people

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.950 
deteriorated Wayne and a lot of people
think<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.270> crazy<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.660> mean<00:02:03.840> there's

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
think just that's crazy I mean there's

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.559 
think just that's crazy I mean there's
no<00:02:04.080> way<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.289> can<00:02:04.500> do<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.860> mean<00:02:05.190> cuz<00:02:05.520> let's<00:02:06.390> see<00:02:06.539> I

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
no way you can do I mean cuz let's see I

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.370 
no way you can do I mean cuz let's see I
yardages<00:02:07.289> probably<00:02:08.509> no<00:02:09.509> more<00:02:09.539> than<00:02:09.929> two

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
yardages probably no more than two

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.970 
yardages probably no more than two
thousand<00:02:10.830> or<00:02:10.979> even<00:02:11.569> 1500<00:02:12.569> if<00:02:12.630> we're<00:02:12.780> lucky<00:02:12.980> so

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
thousand or even 1500 if we're lucky so

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.760 
thousand or even 1500 if we're lucky so
I'm<00:02:14.760> going<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.090> see<00:02:15.270> people<00:02:15.600> doing

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
I'm going to see people doing

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.760 
I'm going to see people doing
this<00:02:17.610> makes<00:02:17.850> no<00:02:17.970> sense<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:19.170> mean<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.500> lot<00:02:19.710> of

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
this makes no sense and I mean a lot of

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.260 
this makes no sense and I mean a lot of
people<00:02:20.010> will<00:02:20.250> think<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:20.670> makes<00:02:20.880> no<00:02:21.030> sense

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
people will think this makes no sense

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.020 
people will think this makes no sense
but<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.230> mean<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:22.950> been<00:02:23.070> proven<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.850> it's

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
but I mean it's been proven and it's

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.930 
but I mean it's been proven and it's
scientifically<00:02:24.600> backed<00:02:25.050> up<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.460> data<00:02:26.730> and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
scientifically backed up so the data and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.270 
scientifically backed up so the data and
statistics<00:02:27.570> that<00:02:27.720> we've<00:02:28.530> been<00:02:28.680> shown<00:02:28.980> here

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
statistics that we've been shown here

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.120 
statistics that we've been shown here
has<00:02:29.520> really<00:02:29.880> helped<00:02:30.380> explain<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.650> us<00:02:31.830> the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
has really helped explain to us the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.990 
has really helped explain to us the
details<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.360> how<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.600> implement<00:02:35.000> correctly

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
details of how to implement correctly

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.300 
details of how to implement correctly
and<00:02:36.150> why<00:02:36.300> it's<00:02:36.510> implemented<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.230> way<00:02:37.590> but

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
and why it's implemented in that way but

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.970 
and why it's implemented in that way but
the<00:02:38.580> basic<00:02:39.030> fundamental<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.930> yeah<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.710> don't

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
the basic fundamental of yeah you don't

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.860 
the basic fundamental of yeah you don't
practice<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.670> run<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.880> marathon<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.540> order<00:02:42.750> to

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
practice to run a marathon in order to

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.710 
practice to run a marathon in order to
run<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:43.020> sprint<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.880> something<00:02:44.880> like<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.420> said

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
run a sprint is something like I said

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.040 
run a sprint is something like I said
it's<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.020> reason<00:02:46.320> why<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:46.620> started<00:02:46.680> our<00:02:47.070> club

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
it's the reason why we started our club

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.510 
it's the reason why we started our club
ever<00:02:49.050> since<00:02:49.290> we<00:02:49.410> started<00:02:49.470> changing<00:02:49.890> breaking

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
ever since we started changing breaking

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.820 
ever since we started changing breaking
national<00:02:50.700> records<00:02:51.270> more<00:02:51.780> consistently<00:02:52.560> been

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
national records more consistently been

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.130 
national records more consistently been
I<00:02:53.070> mean<00:02:53.520> closer<00:02:53.790> at<00:02:54.090> times<00:02:54.330> every<00:02:54.690> single<00:02:54.810> meet

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
I mean closer at times every single meet

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.520 
I mean closer at times every single meet
we've<00:02:55.740> been<00:02:55.950> doing<00:02:56.190> tons<00:02:56.540> faster<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.230> what's

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
we've been doing tons faster and what's

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.740 
we've been doing tons faster and what's
nice<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.860> with<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.100> change<00:02:59.340> we<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.330> come<00:03:00.540> in

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
nice is with this change we can come in

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.200 
nice is with this change we can come in
to<00:03:00.930> meet<00:03:01.200> pretty<00:03:01.770> much<00:03:01.920> knowing<00:03:02.400> exactly<00:03:02.550> what

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210

how<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.670> go<00:03:32.850> about<00:03:32.970> doing<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.540> well<00:03:33.960> we've<00:03:34.290> been

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
how to go about doing it well we've been

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.970 
how to go about doing it well we've been
in<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.860> process<00:03:35.070> of<00:03:35.430> implementing<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:37.080> this

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
in the process of implementing the this

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.850 
in the process of implementing the this
type<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.250> swimming<00:03:38.970> into<00:03:39.360> our<00:03:39.450> group<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:40.770> was

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
type of swimming into our group it was

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.220 
type of swimming into our group it was
very<00:03:41.100> encouraging<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.990> we're<00:03:42.990> in<00:03:43.110> the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
very encouraging that we're in the

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.620 
very encouraging that we're in the
ballpark<00:03:43.460> we<00:03:44.460> just<00:03:44.670> needed<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:45.030> little<00:03:45.270> bit<00:03:45.360> of

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
ballpark we just needed a little bit of

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.470 
ballpark we just needed a little bit of
a<00:03:45.660> direction<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.560> how<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:46.920> set<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:47.970> program<00:03:48.150> up

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
a direction of how to set the program up

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.020 
a direction of how to set the program up
and<00:03:48.660> implement<00:03:49.170> in<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.380> if<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.160> need<00:03:50.460> to<00:03:50.610> know

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
and implement in it if you need to know

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.979 
and implement in it if you need to know
how<00:03:51.270> to<00:03:51.330> implement<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:52.140> and

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
how to implement that and

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.440 
how to implement that and
in<00:03:53.049> what<00:03:53.560> way<00:03:53.739> you<00:03:53.799> can<00:03:54.280> lower<00:03:54.730> that<00:03:54.879> yardage

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
in what way you can lower that yardage

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.780 
in what way you can lower that yardage
down<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:56.079> let<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.680> kids<00:03:56.890> have<00:03:57.010> fun<00:03:57.370> let<00:03:57.609> them

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
down and let the kids have fun let them

down and let the kids have fun let them
see<00:03:58.030> improvement<00:03:58.840> in<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:58.989> very<00:03:59.230> quick<00:03:59.560> time<00:04:00.239> in
