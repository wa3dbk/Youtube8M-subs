to<00:02:11.230> my<00:02:11.350> left<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:12.070> cross<00:02:12.670> over<00:02:13.740> I've<00:02:14.740> got<00:02:14.800> a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
to my left I cross over I've got a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.580 
to my left I cross over I've got a
blindside<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:16.510> takes<00:02:16.720> me<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.200> know<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.320> lot<00:02:17.500> of

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
blindside it takes me you know a lot of

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.890 
blindside it takes me you know a lot of
time<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.890> reset<00:02:18.310> my<00:02:18.490> feed<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:19.360> be<00:02:19.630> able<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.810> get

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
time to reset my feed to be able to get

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.580 
time to reset my feed to be able to get
a<00:02:19.930> little<00:02:20.110> bit<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.290> power

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
a little bit of power

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.380 
a little bit of power
so<00:02:21.010> why<00:02:21.160> moving<00:02:21.580> instead<00:02:21.790> where<00:02:22.030> I'll<00:02:22.150> do<00:02:22.270> is

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
so why moving instead where I'll do is

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.950 
so why moving instead where I'll do is
I'll<00:02:22.510> push<00:02:22.780> off<00:02:22.990> one<00:02:23.230> side<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.800> step

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
I'll push off one side and step

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.940 
I'll push off one side and step
explosively<00:02:25.960> you<00:02:26.290> know<00:02:26.410> kind<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.680> put<00:02:26.860> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
explosively you know kind of put the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.140 
explosively you know kind of put the
weight<00:02:27.100> towards<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.490> other<00:02:27.610> way<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.850> load

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
weight towards the other way to load

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.120 
weight towards the other way to load
that<00:02:28.330> up<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:29.170> still<00:02:29.470> make<00:02:29.620> sure<00:02:29.740> I'm<00:02:29.860> facing

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
that up and still make sure I'm facing

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.720 
that up and still make sure I'm facing
my<00:02:30.340> target<00:02:30.850> which<00:02:31.540> what<00:02:31.750> step<00:02:32.680> right<00:02:32.890> behind

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
my target which what step right behind

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
and step wet that's gonna keep me nice

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.390 
and step wet that's gonna keep me nice
and<00:02:37.050> frozen<00:02:38.050> turn<00:02:38.350> on<00:02:38.440> my<00:02:38.560> target<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.100> keep<00:02:39.280> my

and frozen turn on my target and keep my
balance<00:02:39.640> really<00:02:40.060> good<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.570> even<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.500> way

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
balance really good and even so that way

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
balance really good and even so that way
I<00:02:41.650> can<00:02:41.710> strike<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.250> don't<00:02:42.310> really<00:02:42.460> get

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
I can strike and I don't really get

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.970 
I can strike and I don't really get
struck<00:02:42.910> back<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.450> I<00:02:43.720> knew<00:02:44.230> try<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.620> walk<00:02:44.830> in
