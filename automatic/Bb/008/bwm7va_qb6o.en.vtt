is a little bit slower but I needed a

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.109 
is a little bit slower but I needed a
lot<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.039> time<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.340> explain<00:00:23.609> what's<00:00:23.789> going<00:00:23.850> on

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
the fact that it goes first means that

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.460 
the fact that it goes first means that
it<00:00:29.490> has<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.849> be<00:00:29.970> scarf<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.660> nasty<00:00:30.840> maximum

damage<00:00:47.610> calculations<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.800> that's<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> way

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
damage calculations and that's the way

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.430 
damage calculations and that's the way
it<00:00:50.039> works<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.789> vaporeon<00:00:51.480> apparently<00:00:52.320> he's

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
also a max special attack max speed and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.650 
also a max special attack max speed and
scarfed<00:00:55.760> like<00:00:56.760> that's<00:00:56.940> fine<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.420> could<00:00:57.570> be

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
scarfed like that's fine that could be

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.369

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.469 
shedinja so let's just see how this turn
plays<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:26.009> hit<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> yourself<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
plays it I hit the yourself with the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
plays it I hit the yourself with the
table<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.020> does<00:01:28.200> less<00:01:28.500> than<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.799> quarter<00:01:29.189> or

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
table and it does less than a quarter or

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.640 
table and it does less than a quarter or
just<00:01:29.850> about<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> quarter<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.630> means<00:01:30.869> again

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
just about a quarter so that means again

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.190 
just about a quarter so that means again
from<00:01:31.890> doing<00:01:32.070> damage<00:01:32.280> calculations<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.240> he

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
from doing damage calculations that he

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.880 
from doing damage calculations that he
has<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.829> max<00:01:35.220> special<00:01:35.670> defense<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.240> max<00:01:36.540> HP

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
has to be max special defense and max HP

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.920 
has to be max special defense and max HP
that's<00:01:37.890> fine<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.430> could<00:01:38.610> be<00:01:38.700> legit<00:01:39.030> there's

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
that's fine that could be legit there's

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.749 
that's fine that could be legit there's
my<00:01:40.079> sword<00:01:40.290> stance<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.310> know<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.700> he

down is going down and I did sixty

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.999 
down is going down and I did sixty
percent<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.189> don't<00:01:53.640> KO<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.960> barely<00:01:55.710> leave

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
percent and I don't KO it I barely leave

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.160 
percent and I don't KO it I barely leave
it<00:01:56.130> barely<00:01:56.490> alive<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.659> only<00:01:57.840> way

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
it barely alive so that the only way

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.990 
it barely alive so that the only way
again<00:01:58.590> doing<00:01:58.860> damage<00:01:59.130> calculation<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.850> that

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
again doing damage calculation is that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.090 
again doing damage calculation is that
that<00:02:00.149> should<00:02:00.329> be<00:02:00.450> possible<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.799> that

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
that should be possible is if that

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.310 
that should be possible is if that
friggin<00:02:02.490> azelf<00:02:02.790> has<00:02:03.030> max<00:02:03.360> defense<00:02:03.810> too<00:02:04.110> and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
friggin azelf has max defense too and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.980 
friggin azelf has max defense too and
then<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.399> goes<00:02:05.610> ahead<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.000> goes<00:02:06.149> before<00:02:06.390> star

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
then it goes ahead and goes before star

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.889 
then it goes ahead and goes before star
me<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.770> means<00:02:08.099> again<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.420> he's<00:02:09.599> gotta

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
me so that means again that he's gotta

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.640 
me so that means again that he's gotta
be<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> max<00:02:10.379> speed<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:11.069> well<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.849> scarf

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
be a max speed as well and scarf

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.970 
be a max speed as well and scarf
so<00:02:13.650> Dada's<00:02:14.580> elf<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:14.970> max<00:02:15.209> in<00:02:15.510> about<00:02:15.780> in<00:02:16.500> at

his<00:03:32.129> Lucario's<00:03:32.609> be<00:03:32.790> max<00:03:32.970> attack<00:03:33.299> because<00:03:33.629> the

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
his Lucario's be max attack because the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.930 
his Lucario's be max attack because the
amount<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.019> did<00:03:34.230> Lucar<00:03:35.129> I<00:03:35.340> go<00:03:35.699> for<00:03:35.849> another

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
amount it did Lucar I go for another

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.909 
amount it did Lucar I go for another
earthquake<00:03:36.299> when<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.690> scarf<00:03:36.959> on<00:03:37.109> scarf<00:03:37.680> gone

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
earthquake when I scarf on scarf gone

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.170 
earthquake when I scarf on scarf gone
and<00:03:39.919> it's<00:03:40.919> going<00:03:41.069> to<00:03:41.160> get<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.430> crit<00:03:41.699> on<00:03:41.730> Lucario

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
and it's going to get a crit on Lucario

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.110 
and it's going to get a crit on Lucario
but<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:42.870> am<00:03:43.440> fully<00:03:44.310> confident<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:44.940> if<00:03:45.060> i

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
but I am fully confident that if i

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.339 
but I am fully confident that if i
didn't<00:03:45.389> get<00:03:45.449> a<00:03:45.510> crate<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:45.840> would<00:03:45.989> have<00:03:46.079> lived

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
didn't get a crate it would have lived

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.159 
didn't get a crate it would have lived
so<00:03:46.590> it's<00:03:46.859> probably<00:03:47.849> max<00:03:48.239> defense<00:03:48.690> too<00:03:48.930> and

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
so it's probably max defense too and

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.020 
so it's probably max defense too and
then<00:03:49.799> look<00:03:49.949> at<00:03:50.010> this<00:03:50.129> politoed<00:03:50.639> it<00:03:50.819> takes

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
then look at this politoed it takes

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.479 
then look at this politoed it takes
nothing<00:03:51.480> from<00:03:51.720> this<00:03:51.900> stab<00:03:52.709> earthquake<00:03:53.310> from

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
nothing from this stab earthquake from

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.619 
nothing from this stab earthquake from
an<00:03:53.579> adamant<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:55.040> Flygon<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.359> so<00:03:57.599> that

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
an adamant a Flygon so that so that

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.659 
an adamant a Flygon so that so that
pretty<00:03:58.109> much<00:03:58.199> confirms<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:58.919> he<00:03:59.129> is<00:03:59.340> max

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
pretty much confirms that he is max

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.170 
pretty much confirms that he is max
defense<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:01.440> HP<00:04:01.859> but<00:04:02.669> we<00:04:02.819> already<00:04:02.970> know<00:04:03.150> that

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
defense and HP but we already know that

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.930 
defense and HP but we already know that
it's<00:04:03.419> supposed<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.810> be<00:04:03.930> max<00:04:04.400> max<00:04:05.400> speed<00:04:05.730> and

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
it's supposed to be max max speed and

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.300 
it's supposed to be max max speed and
special<00:04:06.299> attack<00:04:06.599> so<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.769> can't<00:04:08.040> have<00:04:08.190> this

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
special attack so it can't have this

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.670 
special attack so it can't have this
many<00:04:08.549> max<00:04:08.819> stats<00:04:09.510> it's<00:04:10.139> just<00:04:10.409> not<00:04:10.530> possible

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
many max stats it's just not possible

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.789 
many max stats it's just not possible
and<00:04:11.069> then<00:04:11.190> he<00:04:11.579> takes<00:04:11.760> that<00:04:12.659> friggin<00:04:13.319> plus<00:04:13.530> once

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
and then he takes that friggin plus once

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.649 
and then he takes that friggin plus once
like<00:04:14.069> a<00:04:14.099> critical<00:04:14.609> hit<00:04:14.879> and<00:04:15.060> he<00:04:15.120> takes<00:04:15.299> fifty

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
like a critical hit and he takes fifty

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.449 
like a critical hit and he takes fifty
percent<00:04:15.930> from<00:04:16.139> it<00:04:16.320> so<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:17.010> means<00:04:17.159> it's<00:04:17.280> max

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
percent from it so that means it's max

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.939 
percent from it so that means it's max
special<00:04:17.909> defense<00:04:18.269> as<00:04:18.539> well<00:04:18.720> so<00:04:19.470> that's<00:04:19.560> all<00:04:19.799> of

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
special defense as well so that's all of

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.339 
special defense as well so that's all of
it<00:04:20.039> starts<00:04:20.430> max<00:04:20.729> right<00:04:21.150> there<00:04:21.419> you<00:04:21.810> can<00:04:22.019> see<00:04:22.049> it

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
it starts max right there you can see it

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.620 
it starts max right there you can see it
plain<00:04:22.590> clears<00:04:23.070> day<00:04:23.310> now<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.060> yourself<00:04:24.389> comes

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
plain clears day now the yourself comes

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.200 
plain clears day now the yourself comes
in<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:24.990> out<00:04:25.080> speeds<00:04:25.409> a<00:04:25.590> scarf

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
in and out speeds a scarf

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.980 
in and out speeds a scarf
flygon<00:04:26.660> so<00:04:26.870> that<00:04:26.960> means<00:04:27.139> cubby<00:04:27.440> machspeed<00:04:27.860> so

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
flygon so that means cubby machspeed so

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.120 
flygon so that means cubby machspeed so
that's<00:04:29.990> going<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.199> wrap<00:04:30.319> up<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:30.620> battle<00:04:30.949> he's

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
that's going to wrap up the battle he's

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.790 
that's going to wrap up the battle he's
gonna<00:04:31.280> KO<00:04:31.669> my<00:04:31.910> guys<00:04:32.090> uh<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:33.199> only<00:04:33.229> way<00:04:33.620> he

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
gonna KO my guys uh the only way he

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.499 
gonna KO my guys uh the only way he
could<00:04:33.919> have<00:04:33.949> ko'd<00:04:34.280> crest<00:04:34.580> from<00:04:34.759> where<00:04:35.150> it's<00:04:35.300> at

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
could have ko'd crest from where it's at

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.570 
could have ko'd crest from where it's at
is<00:04:35.720> if<00:04:35.990> he<00:04:36.169> is<00:04:36.289> max<00:04:36.530> attack<00:04:36.860> with<00:04:37.069> these<00:04:37.220> elf<00:04:37.430> as

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
is if he is max attack with these elf as

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.570 
is if he is max attack with these elf as
well<00:04:37.759> so<00:04:38.650> what<00:04:39.650> can<00:04:39.770> we<00:04:39.830> conclude<00:04:39.919> from<00:04:40.400> all

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
well so what can we conclude from all

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.059 
well so what can we conclude from all
this<00:04:40.759> he's<00:04:41.509> using<00:04:41.660> 255<00:04:42.380> in<00:04:42.590> all<00:04:42.680> stats<00:04:43.449> it's

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
this he's using 255 in all stats it's

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.040 
this he's using 255 in all stats it's
it's<00:04:46.069> quite<00:04:46.789> obvious<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.330> that's<00:04:47.539> exactly

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
it's quite obvious that that's exactly

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.809 
it's quite obvious that that's exactly
what's<00:04:48.229> happening<00:04:48.789> these<00:04:49.789> elf<00:04:50.060> was<00:04:50.360> maxed<00:04:50.810> in

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:51.819 
what's happening these elf was maxed in

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:55.300 
what's happening these elf was maxed in
what<00:04:52.819> visit<00:04:53.090> speed<00:04:53.660> attack<00:04:54.440> special<00:04:55.069> attack

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
what visit speed attack special attack

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.490 
what visit speed attack special attack
special<00:04:55.789> defense<00:04:56.000> and<00:04:56.270> defense<00:04:56.479> and<00:04:56.840> HP<00:04:57.349> so

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
special defense and defense and HP so

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.140 
special defense and defense and HP so
it's<00:04:57.770> definitely<00:04:58.250> maxed<00:04:58.669> in<00:04:58.729> all<00:04:58.849> stats

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
it's definitely maxed in all stats

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.670 
it's definitely maxed in all stats
confirmed<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.229> then<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:01.310> politoed<00:05:02.680> it's

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
confirmed and then the politoed it's

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.230 
confirmed and then the politoed it's
definitely<00:05:03.919> max<00:05:04.280> in<00:05:04.430> all<00:05:04.520> stats<00:05:04.820> as<00:05:05.000> well

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
definitely max in all stats as well

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.270 
definitely max in all stats as well
because<00:05:05.750> just<00:05:06.020> because<00:05:06.080> of<00:05:06.289> the<00:05:06.349> damage<00:05:06.560> low

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
because just because of the damage low

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.920 
because just because of the damage low
damage<00:05:07.490> that<00:05:07.759> it<00:05:07.880> takes<00:05:08.060> and<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:08.449> high<00:05:08.690> damage

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
damage that it takes and the high damage

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.990 
damage that it takes and the high damage
that<00:05:09.199> it<00:05:09.320> deals<00:05:09.530> and<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:10.130> high<00:05:10.280> speed<00:05:10.669> that<00:05:10.880> it

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
that it deals and the high speed that it

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.159 
that it deals and the high speed that it
deals<00:05:11.180> two<00:05:11.389> damage<00:05:11.419> with<00:05:11.870> so<00:05:13.030> that's<00:05:14.030> it<00:05:14.270> he's

deals two damage with so that's it he's

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.969 
deals two damage with so that's it he's
definitely<00:05:15.440> definitely<00:05:16.160> a<00:05:16.460> hacker<00:05:16.820> and<00:05:17.979> like
