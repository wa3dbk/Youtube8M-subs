one<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.500> them<00:02:30.620> for<00:02:30.860> me<00:02:30.890> happened<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.370> be<00:02:31.490> a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
one of them for me happened to be a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.540 
one of them for me happened to be a
Daedric<00:02:31.880> command<00:02:32.300> staff<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:33.770> think<00:02:34.190> that's

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
Daedric command staff I think that's

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.590 
Daedric command staff I think that's
just<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.790> name<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.240> don't<00:02:35.300> think<00:02:35.480> it's

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
just the name I don't think it's

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.110 
just the name I don't think it's
actually<00:02:35.750> like<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.200> Daedric<00:02:36.590> staff<00:02:36.890> but<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.030> is

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
actually like a Daedric staff but it is

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.240 
actually like a Daedric staff but it is
really<00:02:38.300> cool<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.690> had<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.840> good<00:02:39.020> effect<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.590> was

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
really cool it had a good effect I was

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.820 
really cool it had a good effect I was
happy<00:02:40.550> with<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.880> but<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.930> items<00:02:42.230> are<00:02:42.410> random

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
happy with it but the items are random

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.580 
happy with it but the items are random
from<00:02:43.010> Player<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.340> Player<00:02:44.410> pretty<00:02:45.410> much

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
from Player to Player pretty much

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.290 
from Player to Player pretty much
whatever<00:02:46.100> your<00:02:46.280> character<00:02:46.610> skill<00:02:46.850> level<00:02:47.090> is

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
whatever your character skill level is

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.330 
whatever your character skill level is
will<00:02:47.840> decide<00:02:48.230> what<00:02:48.470> kind<00:02:48.709> of<00:02:48.739> random<00:02:49.040> items

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
will decide what kind of random items

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.160 
will decide what kind of random items
you<00:02:49.430> will<00:02:49.550> be<00:02:49.640> able<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.850> obtain<00:02:50.270> in<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.900> chest

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
you will be able to obtain in the chest

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.030 
you will be able to obtain in the chest

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
so I found that to be really cool and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.199 
so I found that to be really cool and
this<00:02:55.040> trip<00:02:55.250> will<00:02:55.489> definitely<00:02:55.910> be<00:02:56.000> worthwhile

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
this trip will definitely be worthwhile

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.720 
this trip will definitely be worthwhile

I<00:03:15.500> found<00:03:16.459> this<00:03:16.549> combo<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:16.940> be<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:18.140> best<00:03:18.410> way<00:03:18.680> to

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
I found this combo to be the best way to

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.680 
I found this combo to be the best way to
actually<00:03:18.980> reach<00:03:19.340> these<00:03:19.610> chests<00:03:20.030> without

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
actually reach these chests without

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.110 
actually reach these chests without
being<00:03:21.019> like<00:03:21.200> hurt<00:03:21.470> or<00:03:21.650> anything<00:03:21.890> like<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.190> so

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
being like hurt or anything like that so

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.800 
being like hurt or anything like that so
use<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.630> stone<00:03:23.840> flesh<00:03:24.430> max<00:03:25.430> power<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.030> then

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
use the stone flesh max power and then

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.259 
use the stone flesh max power and then
go<00:03:27.320> over<00:03:27.530> here<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.070> without<00:03:28.700> opening<00:03:29.060> up<00:03:29.180> the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
me I feel like the very first chest

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.250 
me I feel like the very first chest
since<00:04:12.220> its<00:04:12.400> most<00:04:12.700> difficult<00:04:13.420> one<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:14.079> actually

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
since its most difficult one to actually

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.029 
since its most difficult one to actually
get<00:04:14.650> to<00:04:14.859> it<00:04:15.459> has<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:16.150> better<00:04:16.329> items<00:04:17.039> but

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
get to it has the better items but

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.710 
get to it has the better items but
that's<00:04:18.400> how<00:04:18.519> you<00:04:18.579> get<00:04:18.699> the<00:04:18.850> second<00:04:19.299> chest

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
that's how you get the second chest

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.509 
that's how you get the second chest
now<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:20.139> third<00:04:20.410> chest<00:04:20.709> is<00:04:20.889> on<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.130> right<00:04:21.310> side

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
now the third chest is on the right side

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.900 
now the third chest is on the right side
instead<00:04:22.000> of<00:04:22.120> being<00:04:22.389> on<00:04:22.509> the<00:04:22.600> left<00:04:23.100> so<00:04:24.100> just
