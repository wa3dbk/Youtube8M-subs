 with the touch from asus that 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.800
 we can use directly 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.180
 interact with the product on the screen 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.950
 it is 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.350
 is proposed on the market with the 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.770
 corain typology process up to 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.910
 heart server that allows you to have all 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.890
 those that can be different 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.140
 expectations from end users 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.699
 by the more traditional user 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.140
 fully the most demanding 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.320
 the second product we are going to see 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.000
 today it is called s550 and also in this 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.860
 case it is a live book of the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.320
 asus family that the characteristic of 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.270
 to be able to be readable at last as 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.130
 for lightness by the assessor e 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.340
 energy saving meets the 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.290
 characteristics precisely of this 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.479
 if so what are we going to have as in 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.550
 turin family of the s 300 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.560
 the situation of the back in 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.800
 this case is not very well taken care of where 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.149
 but we have a removable battery 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.920
 while always regarding it 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.550
 screen we have the screen solution 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.740
 touch with keyboard isolate starting from 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.560
 99 that we can use both allo 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.149
 screen as an interface that you the 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.130

 those are the gestor commands of 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.940
 morrison a very characteristic 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.130
 interesting of this product is that 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.440
 although I feel compact it can be 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.210
 ultrabook readable comes with 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.909
 what is an optical drive then 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.979
 we have very thin chassis 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.500
 in this case also an optical unit that 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.600
 it can go to satisfy more users 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.090
 demanding who still want to use 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.530
 this type is reported to come 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.900
 introduced on this typology of 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.400
 also produced the graphics card e 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.900
 so we can mount an nvidia 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.900
 geforce at 635
