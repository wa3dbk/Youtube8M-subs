00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.819 
the other ones are just too small and
when<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.160> try<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.519> scale<00:02:20.940> down<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.480> much<00:02:21.829> it

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
when you try to scale down that much it

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.130 
when you try to scale down that much it
just<00:02:23.010> doesn't<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.730> doesn't<00:02:24.329> translate<00:02:24.870> all

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
just doesn't it doesn't translate all

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.349 
just doesn't it doesn't translate all
that<00:02:25.170> well<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:26.549> other<00:02:26.730> thing<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.329> that

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
that well the other thing is is that

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:31.250 
that well the other thing is is that
with<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:28.010> small<00:02:29.010> burn<00:02:29.370> time<00:02:29.870> by<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.959> time

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
with this small burn time by the time

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.289 
with this small burn time by the time
you<00:02:31.440> were<00:02:31.530> able<00:02:31.799> to<00:02:31.829> grill<00:02:32.340> anything<00:02:32.910> with<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
you were able to grill anything with the

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.670 
you were able to grill anything with the
amount<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.720> coals<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.109> you're<00:02:34.350> gonna<00:02:34.440> have

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
amount of coals that you're gonna have

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.550 
amount of coals that you're gonna have
in<00:02:34.739> there<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.280> mean<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.870> just<00:02:37.410> doesn't

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
in there I mean it just just doesn't

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.310 
in there I mean it just just doesn't
make<00:02:37.890> sense<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.489> at<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:39.030> scale<00:02:39.480> with<00:02:40.079> those

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
make sense on at this scale with those

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.680 
make sense on at this scale with those
accessories<00:02:41.100> I'm<00:02:41.910> going<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.120> have<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.269> little

as I was saying the real nice thing

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.960 
as I was saying the real nice thing
about<00:02:47.840> this<00:02:48.260> is<00:02:48.470> how<00:02:48.680> easy<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.460> to<00:02:49.760> light<00:02:49.940> a

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
about this is how easy it is to light a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.840 
about this is how easy it is to light a
fire<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.870> can<00:02:51.050> use<00:02:51.290> natural

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
fire and that you can use natural

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.840 
fire and that you can use natural
occurring<00:02:52.850> materials<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.720> boil<00:02:53.990> your<00:02:54.230> water

now the stainless model again it's a

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.860 
now the stainless model again it's a
little<00:02:58.250> bit<00:02:58.400> heavy<00:02:58.670> but<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.270> got<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.570> think<00:02:59.720> of

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
little bit heavy but you got to think of

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.950 
little bit heavy but you got to think of
what<00:03:00.050> you're<00:03:00.230> getting<00:03:00.700> for<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.730> pound<00:03:02.030> 10

what<00:03:19.280> does<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.640> leader<00:03:19.850> of<00:03:20.090> fuel<00:03:20.420> way<00:03:20.690> by

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
what does the leader of fuel way by

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.920 
what does the leader of fuel way by
itself<00:03:21.620> with<00:03:21.890> no<00:03:22.100> container<00:03:22.520> one<00:03:23.360> liter<00:03:23.630> is<00:03:23.750> a

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
itself with no container one liter is a

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.490 
itself with no container one liter is a
kilogram<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.860> a<00:03:25.459> kilogram<00:03:25.910> is<00:03:26.090> 2.2<00:03:26.300> pounds<00:03:27.050> so

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
just with the fuel there you've already

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.710 
just with the fuel there you've already
carried<00:03:31.670> more<00:03:31.880> weight<00:03:31.940> than<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.510> Kelly

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
carried more weight than the Kelly

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.840 
carried more weight than the Kelly
Kettle<00:03:33.020> and<00:03:33.380> of<00:03:34.190> course<00:03:34.400> there<00:03:34.610> are<00:03:34.640> other

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
Kettle and of course there are other

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.760 
Kettle and of course there are other
twig<00:03:35.209> stoves<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:35.930> can<00:03:36.080> try<00:03:36.350> in<00:03:36.410> things

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
twig stoves that you can try in things

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.140 
twig stoves that you can try in things
and<00:03:36.950> those<00:03:37.100> are<00:03:37.280> all<00:03:37.430> fine<00:03:38.330> too

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
but this is it's really a pretty elegant

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.610 
but this is it's really a pretty elegant
design<00:03:44.180> it's<00:03:44.510> pretty<00:03:44.780> fun<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:45.290> we're<00:03:45.410> almost

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
design it's pretty fun and we're almost

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.320 
design it's pretty fun and we're almost
boiling<00:03:46.160> just<00:03:46.550> with<00:03:46.700> that<00:03:46.730> little<00:03:47.209> bit<00:03:47.300> of

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330
