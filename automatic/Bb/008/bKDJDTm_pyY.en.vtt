00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.890
 let's go the first one said in our pot 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.399
 two tablespoons of chili 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.399
 special 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:17.950
 and then we're going to subtract 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.950

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:48.070
 right away we're going to throw the onion 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.239
 they are short 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.239
 because all the security 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.800
 we are also going to 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.570
 we look good 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.820
 then we are fighting in the salt 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.820
 a spoon 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.830

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.329

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.070
 and our species 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.800
 cumin 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.430
 our pepper 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.530
 i 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.250
 and in that area 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.460
 our chicha de jora 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.460
 the rate more 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.659
 we mix 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.270
 as we see 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.260
 a good that all loves mix 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.370
 I have mixed well let's proceed to 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.370
 place in the boxes 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.950
 As you can see, the generous pieces are 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.950
 for four people 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:51.150
 in the same way we will continue mixing 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:54.760
 good so that everything we see 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.930
 previously separated 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.890
 get together with the card and the meat goes 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.210
 to acquire 2 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.720
 all flavors 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.400
 what we have stopped this maceration that 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.390
 we are doing what we are going to stop 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.390
 overnight 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:20.930
 well that's all we leave the wax 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.960
 we cover our footprint 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.790
 and we will not stop overnight 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.220
 after having spent all night and 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.140
 have closed all the preparation that 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.010
 we did 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.040
 then let's give a little mix and 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:43.150
 you can feel the pains all that 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:48.430
 it mixes where all the ingredients and 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:51.640
 Let's put it to maximum fire once 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.060
 it starts to boil and we're going to lower it 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.390
 minimum this will be more or less than 40 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.390
 minutes 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.250
 good cooking time has passed 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:10.890
 and we see that the meat already with its point 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.710
 let's throw the laurel leaves 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.920
 the little leaves this is going to give you a taste 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:20.760
 more enhance the flavor of one and our 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.370
 peppers that are the balls or 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.270
 the peppers veneers that is also 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:31.409

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.589
 come together and we are going to give 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:37.129
 of cooking about 67 more minutes 

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:37.129
 action 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.080
 It is a complement to the flavors 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.939
 to 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:10.009
