00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.450 

I'm<00:01:01.600> going<00:01:01.720> to<00:01:01.810> guess<00:01:01.990> this<00:01:02.380> is<00:01:02.530> basically<00:01:02.920> I'm

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
I'm going to guess this is basically I'm

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.910 
I'm going to guess this is basically I'm
gassing<00:01:03.970> them<00:01:04.000> out<00:01:04.180> this<00:01:04.809> is<00:01:04.989> a<00:01:05.019> non-contact

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
gassing them out this is a non-contact

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.250 
gassing them out this is a non-contact
killer<00:01:06.340> it<00:01:07.000> doesn't<00:01:07.420> leave<00:01:07.540> any<00:01:07.720> residual

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
killer it doesn't leave any residual

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.200 
killer it doesn't leave any residual
right<00:01:08.470> now<00:01:08.620> but<00:01:09.520> it's<00:01:09.610> going<00:01:09.790> to<00:01:09.850> stir<00:01:10.060> up<00:01:10.090> the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
right now but it's going to stir up the

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.060 
right now but it's going to stir up the
nest<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:10.750> pull<00:01:10.960> off<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.170> lot<00:01:11.500> of<00:01:11.620> them<00:01:11.740> before<00:01:11.890> I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
nest and pull off a lot of them before I

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.350 
nest and pull off a lot of them before I
go<00:01:12.280> inside<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:12.760> deal<00:01:12.940> with<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.180> main<00:01:13.360> thing

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.219 

this<00:01:19.360> will<00:01:19.510> make<00:01:19.600> them<00:01:19.750> so<00:01:19.960> mad<00:01:20.170> inside<00:01:20.530> there

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
this will make them so mad inside there
