at my computer later so yeah this go
it's<00:02:53.860> pretty<00:02:54.510> decent<00:02:55.510> i<00:02:55.660> guess<00:02:55.690> it's<00:02:56.170> not

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
it's pretty decent i guess it's not

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.449 
it's pretty decent i guess it's not
anything<00:02:57.670> special<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.980> looks<00:02:59.980> pretty<00:03:00.190> good

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
anything special that looks pretty good

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.010 
anything special that looks pretty good
on<00:03:00.520> this<00:03:00.850> gun<00:03:02.459> stock<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:04.300> stock<00:03:04.330> took

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
on this gun stock the stock took

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.290 
on this gun stock the stock took
probably<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.770> was<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.040> longest<00:03:06.280> part<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.120> make

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
probably it was the longest part to make

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.780 
probably it was the longest part to make
just<00:03:07.600> because<00:03:08.110> like<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:10.510> weird<00:03:11.110> shape<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.980> the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
just because like the weird shape of the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.780 
just because like the weird shape of the
m24<00:03:13.690> stock<00:03:15.270> yeah<00:03:16.270> i'm<00:03:16.840> out<00:03:17.020> the<00:03:17.350> mag<00:03:17.680> it's<00:03:18.250> out

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
m24 stock yeah i'm out the mag it's out

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.400 
m24 stock yeah i'm out the mag it's out
of<00:03:18.930> proportion<00:03:19.930> but<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.820> eye<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:23.080> still<00:03:23.380> looks

there's fits five which I believe the

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.290 
there's fits five which I believe the
actual<00:04:09.310> I'm<00:04:09.460> 24<00:04:10.120> if<00:04:10.690> it's<00:04:10.900> five<00:04:11.200> bullets<00:04:11.680> too

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300

actual I'm 24 if it's five bullets too
I'm<00:04:13.300> pretty<00:04:13.600> sure<00:04:19.739> number<00:04:27.990> 34

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:05:01.540

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
ok mag fits in really tightly just

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.490 
ok mag fits in really tightly just
because<00:05:09.890> that's<00:05:10.190> the<00:05:10.490> way<00:05:10.520> it<00:05:10.790> was<00:05:10.880> made

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
because that's the way it was made

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.920
