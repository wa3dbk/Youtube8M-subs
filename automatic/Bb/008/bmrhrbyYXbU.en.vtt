so forth this next ability is called

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.480 
so forth this next ability is called
plasma<00:01:30.210> fission<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.660> sends<00:01:31.619> out<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.979> plasma

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
plasma fission and sends out a plasma

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.570 
plasma fission and sends out a plasma
bolt<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.940> then<00:01:33.360> at<00:01:33.690> the<00:01:33.959> end<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.410> it<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.830> splits

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
bolt and then at the end of it it splits

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.050 
bolt and then at the end of it it splits
off<00:01:35.789> it<00:01:36.060> shoots<00:01:36.360> two<00:01:36.690> balls<00:01:36.959> or<00:01:37.410> two<00:01:37.619> bolts

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
off it shoots two balls or two bolts

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.100 
off it shoots two balls or two bolts
perpendicular<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> line<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.690> you<00:01:39.750> shot

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
perpendicular to the line that you shot

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.529 
perpendicular to the line that you shot
it<00:01:40.289> so<00:01:40.590> at<00:01:40.800> a<00:01:40.830> 90<00:01:41.190> degree<00:01:41.220> angle<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.330> let<00:01:42.479> me

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
it so at a 90 degree angle so let me

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.260 
it so at a 90 degree angle so let me
just<00:01:42.720> demonstrate<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.289> really<00:01:43.500> quick<00:01:44.270> cool

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
just demonstrate it really quick cool

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.449 
just demonstrate it really quick cool
thing<00:01:45.450> about<00:01:45.569> that<00:01:45.810> ability<00:01:46.050> also<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:47.039> you<00:01:47.310> can

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
thing about that ability also is you can

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.940 
thing about that ability also is you can
activate<00:01:47.849> it<00:01:48.030> at<00:01:48.300> any<00:01:48.539> time<00:01:48.869> along<00:01:49.440> that<00:01:49.709> line

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
activate it at any time along that line

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.309 
activate it at any time along that line
so<00:01:50.550> it<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.030> explode<00:01:51.390> early<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.959> can<00:01:52.050> hit

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
so it can explode early so you can hit

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.680 
so it can explode early so you can hit
targets<00:01:52.500> at<00:01:52.860> weird<00:01:53.069> angles<00:01:53.539> hey<00:01:54.539> I<00:01:54.569> just

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
targets at weird angles hey I just

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.010 
targets at weird angles hey I just
activate<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.530> halfway<00:01:55.800> through<00:01:56.780> another<00:01:57.780> cool

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
activate it halfway through another cool

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.080 
activate it halfway through another cool
thing<00:01:58.050> about<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.500> ability<00:01:58.830> is<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.459> also<00:01:59.849> blows

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
thing about the ability is it also blows

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.650 
thing about the ability is it also blows
up<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.630> collision<00:02:01.550> see<00:02:02.550> as<00:02:03.060> soon<00:02:03.239> as<00:02:03.330> it<00:02:03.479> hits

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
up on collision see as soon as it hits

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.389 
up on collision see as soon as it hits
new<00:02:03.899> knew<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.229> blew<00:02:04.440> up<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.830> they<00:02:04.890> shot<00:02:05.190> out

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
new knew it blew up and they shot out

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.960 
new knew it blew up and they shot out
sideways<00:02:06.739> the<00:02:07.739> next<00:02:08.009> ability<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.520> W<00:02:08.849> is

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
sideways the next ability the W is

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.790 
sideways the next ability the W is
called<00:02:09.179> boy<00:02:09.420> drift<00:02:09.690> what<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.410> does<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.770> it

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
called boy drift what it does is it

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.370 
called boy drift what it does is it
sends<00:02:11.190> out<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> rift<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:12.030> straight<00:02:12.300> line<00:02:12.380> it

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
sends out a rift in a straight line it

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.470 
sends out a rift in a straight line it
does<00:02:13.620> initial<00:02:14.310> damage<00:02:14.520> on<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.030> first<00:02:15.270> tick

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
does initial damage on the first tick

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.600 
does initial damage on the first tick
and<00:02:15.690> then<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.290> does<00:02:16.470> another<00:02:16.920> ticket<00:02:17.190> damage

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
and then it does another ticket damage

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.490 
and then it does another ticket damage
that's<00:02:17.849> much<00:02:18.060> more<00:02:18.239> powerful<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.080> second

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
that's much more powerful on the second

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.160 
that's much more powerful on the second
one<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.860> think<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.580> as<00:02:20.760> like<00:02:21.270> Malachi<00:02:22.140> is

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
one I think of it as like Malachi is

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.800 
one I think of it as like Malachi is
sapling<00:02:22.860> it's<00:02:23.489> harder<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.000> hit<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.390> second

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
sapling it's harder to hit the second

about the life-form disintegration ray
is<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:14.850> prox<00:03:15.180> your<00:03:15.420> passive<00:03:15.840> five<00:03:16.140> times<00:03:16.470> so

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
is that prox your passive five times so

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.220 
is that prox your passive five times so
if<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.400> can<00:03:17.520> land<00:03:17.700> one<00:03:17.820> ability<00:03:18.270> that<00:03:19.020> means

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
if you can land one ability that means

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.440 
if you can land one ability that means
you<00:03:19.290> can<00:03:19.440> proc<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.280> passive<00:03:20.700> at<00:03:20.820> level<00:03:21.120> seven

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
you can proc to passive at level seven

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.600 
you can proc to passive at level seven
right<00:03:21.570> now<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:22.230> would<00:03:22.440> mean<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.680> would<00:03:22.950> do<00:03:23.130> 95

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
right now it would mean that would do 95

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.130 
right now it would mean that would do 95
times<00:03:23.880> 2<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.270> true<00:03:24.450> damage<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:24.900> about<00:03:25.110> a

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
times 2 in true damage so about a

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.800 
times 2 in true damage so about a
hundred<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.739> ninety-two<00:03:26.489> damage<00:03:27.060> at<00:03:27.239> level

seven

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.790 

so<00:03:35.120> that's<00:03:35.420> my<00:03:35.630> whole<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:36.110> sends<00:03:36.350> out<00:03:36.440> laser

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
so that's my whole it sends out laser

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.880 
so that's my whole it sends out laser
beam<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.340> it<00:03:37.430> blows<00:03:37.730> people<00:03:38.180> so<00:03:38.510> cuz<00:03:39.470> I<00:03:39.650> saw

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
beam and it blows people so cuz I saw

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.220 
beam and it blows people so cuz I saw
least<00:03:40.220> coming<00:03:40.610> I<00:03:40.730> slowed<00:03:41.120> him<00:03:41.360> so<00:03:41.570> it<00:03:41.810> makes<00:03:42.020> it

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
least coming I slowed him so it makes it

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:51.280 
least coming I slowed him so it makes it
a<00:03:42.500> lot<00:03:42.860> easier<00:03:42.920> for<00:03:43.400> at<00:03:43.760> least<00:03:43.880> up<00:03:49.780> makes<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.960> lot

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
a lot easier for at least up makes a lot

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.920 
a lot easier for at least up makes a lot

you notice gravis had his W on but since

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.660 
you notice gravis had his W on but since
I<00:03:56.540> land<00:03:56.810> through<00:03:57.050> abilities<00:03:57.500> on<00:03:57.680> them<00:03:57.830> my

I land through abilities on them my

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.450 
I land through abilities on them my
passive<00:03:59.240> profit<00:03:59.930> I<00:03:59.960> just<00:04:00.020> hit<00:04:00.350> both<00:04:00.620> loads<00:04:01.280> of

passive profit I just hit both loads of

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.890 
passive profit I just hit both loads of
damage<00:04:01.820> on<00:04:01.970> him

I<00:04:03.099> can<00:04:04.099> throw<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.430> like<00:04:04.579> this<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:06.099> shoot<00:04:07.099> it<00:04:07.250> to

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
I can throw it like this and shoot it to

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.490 
I can throw it like this and shoot it to
the<00:04:07.459> side<00:04:07.730> too<00:04:08.090> so<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:08.510> can<00:04:08.629> always<00:04:08.870> angle<00:04:09.319> and

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
the side too so you can always angle and

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.899 
the side too so you can always angle and
Lane<00:04:09.709> is<00:04:09.980> really<00:04:10.310> good<00:04:10.549> I<00:04:10.790> can<00:04:11.720> angle<00:04:12.110> and<00:04:12.290> lame

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
if you're good at angles you can shoot

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.930 
if you're good at angles you can shoot
at<00:04:17.900> people<00:04:18.049> at<00:04:18.380> weird<00:04:18.620> angles<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:19.220> they're

what's the final verdict on vel Koz I

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.360 
what's the final verdict on vel Koz I
think<00:05:02.910> right<00:05:03.060> now<00:05:03.150> he's<00:05:03.180> a<00:05:03.450> little<00:05:03.780> too<00:05:03.990> strong

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
think right now he's a little too strong

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.120 
think right now he's a little too strong
his<00:05:05.370> problem<00:05:05.870> with<00:05:06.870> being<00:05:07.050> too<00:05:07.290> strong<00:05:07.590> as<00:05:07.770> his

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
his problem with being too strong as his

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.600 
his problem with being too strong as his
mana<00:05:08.400> cost<00:05:08.700> is<00:05:08.940> too<00:05:09.240> low<00:05:09.560> his<00:05:10.560> human<00:05:11.130> w<00:05:11.430> which

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
mana cost is too low his human w which

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.090 
mana cost is too low his human w which
is<00:05:11.730> very<00:05:11.970> spammable<00:05:12.450> is<00:05:12.720> on<00:05:13.320> a<00:05:13.350> really<00:05:13.920> short

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
is very spammable is on a really short

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.250 
is very spammable is on a really short
cooldown<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:15.090> mana<00:05:15.360> cost<00:05:15.660> of<00:05:15.870> ranking<00:05:16.140> ones

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
cooldown the mana cost of ranking ones

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.250 
cooldown the mana cost of ranking ones
only<00:05:16.410> 50<00:05:16.890> and<00:05:17.190> it's<00:05:17.430> only<00:05:17.640> 5<00:05:18.030> mana<00:05:18.360> stealing<00:05:19.080> a

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
only 50 and it's only 5 mana stealing a

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.360 
only 50 and it's only 5 mana stealing a
per<00:05:19.980> level<00:05:20.280> and<00:05:20.700> it<00:05:21.630> gets<00:05:22.370> exponentially

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
per level and it gets exponentially

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.570 
per level and it gets exponentially
stronger<00:05:23.820> as<00:05:24.090> you<00:05:24.270> rank<00:05:24.510> it<00:05:24.660> up<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:25.020> so<00:05:25.800> there

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
stronger as you rank it up and so there

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.730 
stronger as you rank it up and so there
I<00:05:26.940> can<00:05:27.390> definitely<00:05:27.540> see<00:05:27.870> some<00:05:28.020> adjustments<00:05:28.650> in

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
I can definitely see some adjustments in

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.430 
I can definitely see some adjustments in
that<00:05:29.010> area<00:05:29.280> so<00:05:30.270> with<00:05:30.540> the<00:05:30.660> high<00:05:30.870> base<00:05:31.170> damage

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
that area so with the high base damage

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.280 
that area so with the high base damage
that<00:05:31.860> vel<00:05:32.010> Koz<00:05:32.220> has<00:05:32.460> the<00:05:33.210> spam<00:05:33.570> ability<00:05:34.080> and

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
that vel Koz has the spam ability and

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.520 
that vel Koz has the spam ability and
the<00:05:34.650> low<00:05:34.800> mana<00:05:35.070> cost<00:05:35.370> I<00:05:35.640> can<00:05:36.540> see<00:05:36.750> him<00:05:36.960> being<00:05:37.200> a

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
the low mana cost I can see him being a

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.400 
the low mana cost I can see him being a
big<00:05:37.920> bully<00:05:38.430> in<00:05:38.880> a<00:05:39.360> lot<00:05:39.630> of<00:05:39.810> aspects<00:05:40.200> of<00:05:40.290> the

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
big bully in a lot of aspects of the

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.950 
big bully in a lot of aspects of the
game<00:05:40.440> in<00:05:40.770> terms<00:05:40.920> of<00:05:41.130> like<00:05:41.340> seeing<00:05:41.940> or<00:05:42.270> being<00:05:42.900> a

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
game in terms of like seeing or being a

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.560 
game in terms of like seeing or being a
bully<00:05:43.170> in<00:05:43.380> lane<00:05:43.650> so<00:05:44.010> you<00:05:44.520> may<00:05:44.670> see<00:05:45.090> some<00:05:45.300> number

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
bully in lane so you may see some number

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.930 
bully in lane so you may see some number
adjustments<00:05:46.140> other<00:05:46.530> than<00:05:47.010> that<00:05:47.100> I<00:05:47.550> think<00:05:47.580> vel

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
adjustments other than that I think vel

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.600 
adjustments other than that I think vel
Koz<00:05:48.150> is<00:05:48.180> insanely<00:05:48.720> fun<00:05:49.020> to<00:05:49.170> play<00:05:49.410> he<00:05:50.280> has<00:05:50.370> a<00:05:50.400> lot

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
Koz is insanely fun to play he has a lot

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.330 
Koz is insanely fun to play he has a lot
of<00:05:50.640> new<00:05:50.880> mechanics<00:05:51.590> with<00:05:52.590> the<00:05:52.860> 90-degree

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
of new mechanics with the 90-degree

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.570 
of new mechanics with the 90-degree
angle<00:05:53.850> on<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.090> q<00:05:54.420> the<00:05:55.050> double<00:05:55.440> proc<00:05:55.740> on<00:05:56.010> the<00:05:56.100> W

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
angle on the q the double proc on the W

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.360 
angle on the q the double proc on the W
and<00:05:56.960> adding<00:05:57.960> that<00:05:58.140> silver<00:05:58.620> bolt<00:05:58.860> component

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
and adding that silver bolt component

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.860 
and adding that silver bolt component
like<00:05:59.460> van<00:05:59.670> makes<00:05:59.910> it<00:06:00.060> kind<00:06:00.330> of<00:06:00.360> interesting

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
like van makes it kind of interesting

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.040 
like van makes it kind of interesting
and<00:06:01.860> makes<00:06:02.160> it<00:06:02.370> so<00:06:02.760> you<00:06:02.850> have<00:06:03.060> incentive<00:06:03.570> to<00:06:03.750> do

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
and makes it so you have incentive to do

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.800 
and makes it so you have incentive to do
auto<00:06:04.350> attacks<00:06:04.830> on<00:06:05.070> the<00:06:05.880> enemy<00:06:06.060> so<00:06:06.660> I<00:06:06.690> think

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
auto attacks on the enemy so I think

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.060 
auto attacks on the enemy so I think
that's<00:06:06.990> an<00:06:07.170> interesting<00:06:07.650> way<00:06:07.800> of<00:06:07.830> teaching

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
that's an interesting way of teaching

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.710 
that's an interesting way of teaching
people<00:06:08.460> to<00:06:08.490> throw<00:06:08.730> an<00:06:08.820> auto<00:06:09.060> attacks<00:06:09.510> in

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
people to throw an auto attacks in

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.630

between spell cats as well and yeah I

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.570 
between spell cats as well and yeah I
think<00:06:14.910> they'll<00:06:15.210> cause<00:06:15.390> is<00:06:15.540> really<00:06:15.750> fun<00:06:15.990> and
