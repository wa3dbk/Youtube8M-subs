00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.929
 to observe all the people there is xenon and 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.309
 today we find ourselves on black ops 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.470
 2 for a new gameplay so this 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.690
 once we are on the map stand off to 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.310
 lachy as fast charger and viewfinder 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.390
 laser 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.500
 so I was solo because you 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.060
 see that I launched with 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.340
 people of matignon who was globox 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.290
 and ise I think even if I'm not 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.029
 sure and in fact they will get clicked 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.050
 of the game very soon after the start of 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.340
 the unused part I believe it 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.290
 was click at the beginning of the 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.430
 part the box been clicked a little bit 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.350
 after maybe two minutes after the 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.940
 start of the game then finally like 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.230
 I was well in the league and ben 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.400
 I decided to stay to try to 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.480
 try a big score because of any 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.700
 way when I saw the guys who had 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.230
 in front I thought to myself that this is what 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.030
 would be nice it would be nice to try to 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.110
 make a big score especially solo so 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.239
 here we are on this little 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.500
 part of multi that do not leave one or 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.460
 two strategic points multi team 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.570
 it's a gameplay that is a little 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.680
 little moreover you will see that I was 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.590
 sure tragic this morning counts that 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.700
 Japanese at least three months 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.079
 but hey the gameplay was good it's my 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.000
 first over 100 worship on stand off 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.079
 even though its world form the facts and 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.100
 here I wanted to you the post is 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.630
 so I hope the movie you 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.070
 will please and I have not much more to 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.850
 say on it so what am I hoping you 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.340
 enjoy this gameplay 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.720
 finally short today I wanted to 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.000
 tell you about two three things then that 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.640
 regards the stream actually to make 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.170
 a kind of little focus then 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.310
 because there are a lot of questions that 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.390
 come back often and everything and then 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.590
 people who ask me to do stuff 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.119
 finally I'll explain everything 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.280
 that now 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.900
 basically something already the stream my 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.790
 connection does not allow me to stream is 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.670
 normally if I do it it's for the 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.070
 fun except paris are on black ops deus 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.810
 is true that good fun I start to 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.909
 way pretty fast in general when I get 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.110
 hit a bar all the time but that's 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.220
 true that basically the stream I'm trying to 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.869
 do it for fun besides there is 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.000
 gta5 that will come out and I will be able to stream 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.170
 from gta 5 to 480p so it 's really 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.299
 to do good because I would be more 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.100
 dependent on the connection but here I the 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.140
 do it for fun I really 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.430
 not a big connection normally I 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.020
 should not be able to stream and with my 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.180
 connection I'm doing it already here for 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.950
 to try to take a little bit 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.880
 the usual I will not say what once 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.020
 that I will have fiber optics that I 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.159
 really count a lot stream and then 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.810
 same game frankly I love 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.729
 the live interaction with people is 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.500
 much better than comments on 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.970
 videos for example I'm not saying that it does not 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.410
 not happy to have feedback on 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.990
 my videos but let's say that live is 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.090
 immediately much more interactive 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.380
 the myth speak with people as if 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.620
 it was oral and that's what 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.540
 I love 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.580
 so I will try to rage and less of that 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.840
 it's clear because on black ops I 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.120
 know very well that I abuse 1 I spend my 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.470
 life to rage about this game but it's 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.230
 especially because of the connection that 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.940
 is just awful sorry here 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.980
 of rage is like that but hey when you 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.720
 will play with a bar is practically 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.190
 1000 of ping if one day it happens to you 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.780
 I think you will understand what I 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.160
 screw when I stream it's just 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.660
 intolerable to teleport in 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.610
 permanence of having jerks and 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.740
 see my four chargers by beck for 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.950
 in the end get a roll back and do not 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.960
 to have the kilt what in addition to that so that 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.010
 I do not complain about it but it's something 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.720
 thing that is asked me makes a big 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.010
 gameplay live blah blah blah that I 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.600
 will do on ghost when I have the crisis 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.460
 Greek would not be that I will not be 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.540
 not bother the already I do not want to 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.070
 take people with me to play 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.210
 support because I do not want to say 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.620
 to subscribers to the listened to you one 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.670
 supports the cause of virtually finished 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.860
 but I will still piss you off at 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.230
 help me make gameplay there 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.730
 now I only play for here 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.200
 to play with the maximum number of subscribers 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.270
 possible in stream it's true that even 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.270
 if i'm raging on black ops 2 i'm going 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.890
 try to hold me back but 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.210
 let's say that I play to play with 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.430
 subscribers let's say I'm not trying to do 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.290
 of this particular body when I do the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.160
 rtc i'm just trying to patroni that love 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.180
 stage because they are still 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.590
 good enough besides I will do 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.110
 maybe a recap once 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.090
 I will have finished the rtc 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.290
 but let's say I 'm looking for I 'm finally leaving 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.420
 I really looking to make 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.830
 nuclear all to this stuff so 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.240
 you want to make nuclear good with 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.080
 a bar would be hot but I already have 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.180
 do some 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.650
 I would fool myself on a solo account and 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.970
 I'll play alone reason alone 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.980
 because the people I invite in 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.120
 general it's not plots they know 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.430
 play a minimum one is all in or 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.350
 lethal, that is to say microstation h 24 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.090
 so obviously when you have six 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.520
 allies who are there each on a corner of 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.480
 the map to make as soon as they constantly 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.770
 be a little bit of good faith that you 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.050
 do you want me to do kills what 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.220
 I want to chain 2 3 that it is me 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.480
 arrived a moment it will be very hard 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.490
 knowing that people are not here to 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.010
 help me in support i'm not synonymous 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.210
 solo so that's after I'm going 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.820
 answer another question that 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.990
 often comes back on the chat 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.950
 it's the question of twitch why 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.690
 do not stream on twitter 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.220
 so yes the cat on twitch is 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.420
 much more fun it's clear but 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.739
 kitchen promised us they were going 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.130
 change so I hope they do that to me 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.600
 quick 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.850
 at least before the battlefield 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.290
 4 be call of duty ice because 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.120
 that's it 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.880
 cool to have a nice cat for the next 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.870
 gen but the thing is that twitch if 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.490
 you do not have a youtube channel 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.450
 absolutely huge ie all 5000 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.820
 subscribers you can not be 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.140
 partner with them and when you are 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.850
 no partner with tweet schema one must 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.110
 absolutely anything with you from 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.300
 channels put the pub in full 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.350
 middle of the parties is wise and absolutely 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.210
 do not want this to happen 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.080
 so if I stay on eclipse jaser 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.930
 simply to have control 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.490
 total of mach is not typing twitch 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.170
 who does a little what he wants what they 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.310
 want with task is born so here 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.910
 you have not a hundred thousand subscribers is a little 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.500
 their slaves 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.390
 so that's why I stay on 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.250
 eclipse to me wade will soon change the 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.930
 chat so I hope they will do that in 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.100
 as soon as possible and that will be 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.340
 immediately much more user-friendly 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.560
 is a lot nicer finally last 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.420
 question always about the stream 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.250
 with regard to reruns so 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.210
 that's something we're going to be doing a lot of 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.740
 world and on youtube is what you 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.780
 will put reruns live etc 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.090
 so I do not want to mess with my chain 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.450
 by putting a lot of retransmission in 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.340
 live 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.330
 the only thing I will do is if I 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.830
 really do a very good gameplay in 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.300
 live behind I have one on a doubled 3 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.370
 you should see in a short time that 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.810
 I did with subscribers but apart 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.820
 this kind of gameplay a little bit 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.800
 exceptional that I will post well 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.800
 obviously 720p I would have gone ricort 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.660
 in the studio but otherwise crappy 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.700
 stream I can have them only in 360p 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.020
 because the 360 pc because of my 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.970
 connection that's just crappy 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.950
 that's why all the people 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.360
 who ask me my 480 but the 720 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.410
 it will happen but when I get the 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.960
 fiber optic for now I can not 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.080
 not go above 360 for call of 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.370
 duty battlefield and that 's 480 for 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.610
 julie play online I was a who 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.440
 will be 495 e stream rsa but that's it for 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.700
 regarding the reruns I 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.650
 found how to do only this will be 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.200
 in 360p finally it will be as if it was 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.550
 the normal stream of the shot it will be on the 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.310
 chain i cube that and I wanted to know 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.600
 simply if you wanted me 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.830
 warns you when I put the 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.910
 reruns because it's not a trick 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.520
 that I can not but very hard there when 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.410
 same as I put that on my pc as if 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.400
 the stream is normally what is 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.600
 you want to warn you when I 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.920
 repeat, stating that 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.760
 it's a replay on twitter 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.590
 facebook etc 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.490
 as I usually do or is that 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.630
 you want me to put them and then 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.370
 you will see if you fall on it 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.450
 it's good if not too bad 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.250
 tell me what you think about them in 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.210
 comments i will do what 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.070
 come back most often and then that's it 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.720
 so on that I hope the gameplay 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.080
 you will have more site and allow a small 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.300
 lake 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.500
 if the video that most aptly to you 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.500
 subscribe to the channel if it's not yet 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.300
 made me follow on twitter facebook and 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.500
 the stream because if you want if 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.580
 you want to see the stream just 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.690
 to subscribe to the channel for this 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.360
 that you will be notified by mail or 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.560
 bullshit like that here is the source and I 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.770
 I tell you next time you are wearing 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.240
 well 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.240
 phi phi phi phi phi
