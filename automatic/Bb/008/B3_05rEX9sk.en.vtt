00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 I may be back on my feet until 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.400
 the ultimate and fragile zac practicality neither 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.019
 always is synonymous with health juices 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.240
 can give less work 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.340
 than the natural ones during the preparation 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:20.279
 but do they just have the same 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.100
 nutrients would work inside and 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.789
 out of home 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:31.070
 in the midst of so much agitation that 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:35.340
 thirst for a lot of cold juice 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.850
 he dp sleeve according to him of mixture of 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.850
 tropical fruits 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.760
 many people exchange the natural for the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.289
 more practical 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.840
 before modern life , right? 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.570
 to 85 percent of our population 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.879
 consumes and our industrialized juices 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.800
 country is so rich in fruit, huh? 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.820
 and suddenly people give up but 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.190
 generally because of this practicality with 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.790
 flavors of the most common to the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.000
 exotic industrialized juices 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.000
 conquered consumers 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.549
 for me it's just the problem that because soybeans 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.530
 people have cholesterol and everything else is 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.280
 by the taste only to experience a 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.280
 different thing 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.770
 concentrated in bottles and fires 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.220
 Sacks ready to drink in the boxes 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.830
 long life you have to be careful in 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.940
 time to choose the difference between these 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.680
 products goes far beyond the packaging is 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.820
 that china is coming soon, which is more 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.130
 easy 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.530
 usually I buy a little powder that 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.690
 it is easier to hand you have the validity is 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.040
 greater risk 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.260
 we have to observe with regard to 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.630
 buying at the option of buying a juice 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.450
 industrialized is the amount of sodium 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.960
 sodium is an element of 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.149
 durability to products 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.590
 industrialized and as such is the juice is 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.840
 one of these products 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.170
 it also has high concentration of 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.630
 sodium and especially powdered juices 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.790
 that are made is actually consul with 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.400
 dehydrated fruits and are the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.810
 present on the analysis of 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.300
 higher amount of sodium because of 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.510
 sodium that has high blood pressure or 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.970
 in the kidneys can not overdo the juices of 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.470
 the nutritionist explains that 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.930
 some options are healthier 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.570
 I would say that the juice already ready to drink 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.239
 and presents in the great majority is that 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.200
 today there is a greater wealth of 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.140
 other nutrients than the rest of 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.690
 powder concentrates 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.030
 it is important to observe everything that is in the 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.620
 label to compensate for the loss of 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.959
 nutrients and flavor in the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.049
 industrialization of juices receive 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.340
 preservatives and additives and flavorings 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.070
 artificial 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.489
 these excess substances can 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.489
 bad health 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.450
 always gives preference to juices 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.360
 industrialized countries that have lower 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.670
 amount of dyes and additives and 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.450
 preservatives and today already exist in 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.390
 market some juices as they have the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.750
 natural comfort vants will then 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.880
 preference for them what the 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.800
 Brazilians take into account the 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.240
 time to compare juice or taste 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.180
 the flavors that the most 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.210
 They like fats, right? 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.720
 the carbohydrate-speaking proteins all 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.700
 This takes a look and it does not even look like it has 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.709
 this preservative business when you look 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.810
 gives us preference for organic to see if 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.220
 It has no sugar today the city not 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.990
 preservative to many mothers have the 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.890
 Box juice is the best option 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:04.250
 for the children's snack to look at 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.050
 she takes juice from a natural box she does not 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.810
 send you take you are sending the 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.640
 natural juice, and then it gets bad with 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.650
 time does not always speak full technique 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.019
 so I have found that weaker 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:20.900
 put is the one who already comes the straw 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:23.150
 It's important that you really know 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.120
 choose the best juice to give to the 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.950
 your child to take to school if 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.350
 that you can not give the natural juice 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.660
 because even with the loss that we have 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.130
 with the oxidation of the fruits you have 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.300
 that taking a certain juice would be you 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.070
 ingest on time 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.250
 the loss for the time you have 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.450
 light is much better than a 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.910
 industrial juice 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.800
 but in case we always buy 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.290
 preference process against juices 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.979
 natural juices that you are looking for 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.260
 also those juices that have 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:57.260
 vitamin and mineral enrichment 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:00.430
 of fiber to power then is to give a juice 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.380
 best quality for your child 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.010
 future moms also need to stay 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.200
 Attention moss juices contain sweeteners 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.430
 which should be avoided in order to 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.229
 baby health 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.479
 the presence of phenylalanine in 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.160
 certain juices with the presence of 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.319
 can be a problem 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.879
 especially for pregnant women 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.590
 this is important because the child has 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:27.069
 a life ahead so much less 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.530
 is is minus ingredients - substances 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:36.400
 chemicals it can consume throughout the 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:38.470
 her life is going to really be the 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.840
 Natural juice is unbeatable 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.500
 today as much as the industry has people 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.590
 approaching the natural juice is the people 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.470
 can not compare the nutritional value of 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.819
 own fruit the fruit juice made in the 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.819
 hour with industrialized juices
