00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:11.720
 is a mixed use rather mass of basically 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.660
 one is difficult 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:19.640
 the six floors of residence is 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:25.960
 small but extending to a height that 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.960
 that's how it's almost at the edge of buildings 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.250
 It's like an apartment with two 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.340
 nucleus one where the room of the 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.949
 children 's children there that is 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.620
 practically almost a department of the 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:49.519
 apartment and the other half where the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:54.100
 bedroom and these two things in 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:57.199
 coexist to see that it is not as a division 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.570
 social area 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.969
 they are mixing in another way 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.810
 is what we did for example the level 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:08.750
 technician is a level has an office that 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.950
 there is more it has a particularity that 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.929
 opens to two streets on levels 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.899
 slightly different things from a meter 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:20.539
 in a difference of one against the other and 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:25.360
 people have always imagined that as a 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.360
 place of open passage and such 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:35.729
 the slabs are all flat shops is and 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.000
 without say 30 cm thick one 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.100
 thickness that comes not only from a 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.550
 structural requirement but also by the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.280
 insulation performance requirement 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.960
 from one floor to another but to 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.330
 to be sure to carry the pillars 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.600
 they are only committed to 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:03.600
 receive vertical loads so much 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:08.670
 the facade all made with 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:14.430
 material which thus transmits this 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.800
 lightness and that are opaque and transparent 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.750
 but what is glass and wood is a glass 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:25.590
 white is that it preserves privacy 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:30.110
 because it is a minimal translucency in the 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:33.900
 truth the slab is concrete in apparent 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.829
 all cabinets are like these thing 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.870
 that mdf plaques of mdf there is not a wall 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:44.700
 made inside the apartments are 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.400
 Mind boys cabinets make 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.700
 people 11 and another care that people 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:56.690
 had to make a facade made 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.690
 with lightweight panels is not to do box 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:06.930
 the elevation is the highest energy consumption 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:10.540
 for a building there like here in 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.819
 refrigeration ends up being two 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.510
 energy consumption that soon will not 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:20.379
 case of the win building to a professional 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.459
 who stayed in Switzerland is known as soon as 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:27.489
 they love the physics of building eli 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.829
 from our drawing would be and 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.099
 defining the walls with orientation 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:36.040
 north should have the insulation level a 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:39.760
 factor so many to see the walls of 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:44.010
 the same geothermal system serves to 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.010
 also in summer this is interesting 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:54.299
 Beauty, I think doing a project is out. 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:58.510
 from brazil to a trained architect 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:03.389
 based here you are not acting as a 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:06.310
 ceiling x you be a brazilian athlete 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:10.410
 talking to that repertoire is this 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.410
 here is grace, right?
