00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.390 
with a ton of sugar I'll probably use
one<00:01:37.110> serving<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.590> that's<00:01:37.740> only<00:01:37.860> about<00:01:38.040> six

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
one serving so that's only about six

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.249 
one serving so that's only about six
grams<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.790> carbs<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.750> I'll<00:01:39.869> throw<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.229> on

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
grams of carbs but I'll throw that on

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.660 
grams of carbs but I'll throw that on
there<00:01:41.899> but<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.590> know<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> truth<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.250> with<00:01:44.430> pre

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
there but you know the truth is with pre

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.609 
there but you know the truth is with pre
workout<00:01:44.970> nutrition<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.780> know<00:01:45.869> as<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.200> sit<00:01:46.439> down

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
for my actual workout and that just

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.670

boils down to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
boils down to

something like dextrose something like

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.970 
something like dextrose something like
sugar<00:02:59.419> something<00:02:59.689> a<00:02:59.750> lot<00:02:59.900> quicker<00:03:00.109> to<00:03:00.829> hit

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
sugar something a lot quicker to hit

your<00:03:01.069> system<00:03:01.489> if<00:03:01.819> you<00:03:01.969> take<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.150> little<00:03:02.299> bit

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
your system if you take a little bit

your system if you take a little bit
longer<00:03:02.629> for<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:03.019> to<00:03:03.200> be<00:03:03.409> broken<00:03:03.560> down<00:03:03.769> if

longer for that to be broken down if

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.709 
longer for that to be broken down if

that<00:03:05.750> take<00:03:05.989> hours<00:03:06.379> that's<00:03:06.650> why<00:03:06.739> digestion

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
that take hours that's why digestion

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.339 
that take hours that's why digestion
takes<00:03:07.430> hours<00:03:07.939> and<00:03:08.200> utilization<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.230> these

train that's what I want you to think so

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.490 
train that's what I want you to think so
my<00:03:51.379> mindset<00:03:51.739> is<00:03:52.540> say<00:03:53.540> got<00:03:53.689> a<00:03:53.720> big<00:03:53.959> leg<00:03:54.169> workout

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
my mindset is say got a big leg workout

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.780 
my mindset is say got a big leg workout
coming<00:03:54.769> out<00:03:54.859> you<00:03:55.009> know<00:03:55.099> big<00:03:55.280> muscle<00:03:55.609> groups

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
coming out you know big muscle groups

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.119 
coming out you know big muscle groups
like<00:03:55.909> a<00:03:55.939> leg<00:03:56.180> or<00:03:56.389> back<00:03:56.629> workout<00:03:56.989> is<00:03:57.079> usually<00:03:57.500> to

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
like a leg or back workout is usually to

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.969 
like a leg or back workout is usually to
the<00:03:58.280> most<00:03:58.459> demanding<00:03:58.609> workouts<00:03:59.180> I<00:03:59.979> would

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:00.979 
the most demanding workouts I would

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.069 
the most demanding workouts I would
probably<00:04:01.189> stand<00:04:02.090> this<00:04:02.269> i<00:04:02.540> usually<00:04:02.810> train<00:04:02.959> at

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
probably stand this i usually train at

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.499 
probably stand this i usually train at
night<00:04:03.229> right<00:04:03.430> eight<00:04:04.430> o'clock<00:04:04.579> stay<00:04:05.359> right

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:05.509 
night right eight o'clock stay right

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:06.969 
night right eight o'clock stay right
around<00:04:05.629> that<00:04:05.870> range<00:04:06.019> I<00:04:06.259> would<00:04:06.470> probably<00:04:06.859> try

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:06.979 
around that range I would probably try

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.460 
around that range I would probably try
to<00:04:07.040> have<00:04:07.250> a<00:04:07.280> big<00:04:07.609> meal<00:04:07.909> as<00:04:08.180> like<00:04:08.840> my<00:04:08.959> last<00:04:09.229> meal

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
to have a big meal as like my last meal

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.189 
to have a big meal as like my last meal
the<00:04:09.590> day<00:04:09.680> before<00:04:09.909> so<00:04:10.909> really<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:11.989> whole

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
the day before so really the whole

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.399 
the day before so really the whole
mindset<00:04:12.709> is<00:04:13.449> it's<00:04:14.449> not<00:04:14.599> just<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.930> meal<00:04:15.079> before

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
mindset is it's not just the meal before

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.219 
mindset is it's not just the meal before
you<00:04:15.439> train<00:04:15.769> it's<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.639> meals<00:04:16.909> and<00:04:17.239> meals<00:04:17.750> and

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
you train it's the meals and meals and

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.319 
you train it's the meals and meals and
meals<00:04:18.590> before<00:04:18.859> so<00:04:19.430> if<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:19.940> really<00:04:20.150> want<00:04:20.299> to

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
meals before so if you really want to

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.250 
meals before so if you really want to
optimize<00:04:21.219> pre<00:04:22.219> workout<00:04:22.490> nutrition<00:04:23.080> it's<00:04:24.080> not

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
optimize pre workout nutrition it's not

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.750 
optimize pre workout nutrition it's not
just<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.529> meal<00:04:24.680> one<00:04:25.250> meal<00:04:25.400> isn't<00:04:25.520> going<00:04:25.700> to

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
just the meal one meal isn't going to

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.530 
just the meal one meal isn't going to
make<00:04:25.820> or<00:04:25.969> break<00:04:26.090> you

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540
