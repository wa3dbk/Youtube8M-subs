version of the organza and I really like
using<00:00:24.089> it<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.509> collage

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109

house or something like that I believe
it's<00:00:31.259> also<00:00:31.439> called<00:00:31.800> dry<00:00:32.279> waxed<00:00:32.880> paper

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
it's also called dry waxed paper

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.720 
it's also called dry waxed paper
so<00:00:34.260> you're<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.010> want<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.460> get<00:00:35.579> your

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
so you're going to want to get your

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.189 
so you're going to want to get your
hands<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.059> something<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.719> what<00:00:36.989> we're<00:00:37.110> going

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
hands on something and what we're going

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.250 
hands on something and what we're going
to<00:00:37.260> use<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.949> with<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.520> jelly<00:00:38.969> plate<00:00:39.449> which

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
to use it with is this jelly plate which

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.330 
to use it with is this jelly plate which
allows<00:00:40.770> us<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.280> do<00:00:42.090> some<00:00:42.480> monoprinting<00:00:43.350> so

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
allows us to do some monoprinting so

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.849 
allows us to do some monoprinting so
first<00:00:45.120> thing<00:00:45.390> I'm<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> do<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.680> show

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
first thing I'm going to do is just show

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.860 
first thing I'm going to do is just show
you<00:00:46.920> how<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.190> plate<00:00:47.519> works<00:00:47.789> without<00:00:48.210> stencils

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
you how the plate works without stencils

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.770 
you how the plate works without stencils
so<00:00:49.079> we'll<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.280> put<00:00:50.489> some<00:00:50.519> paint<00:00:51.390> right<00:00:51.750> on

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
so we'll just put some paint right on

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.360 
so we'll just put some paint right on
the<00:00:52.019> plate<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:55.940> lay<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> deli<00:00:57.329> paper<00:00:57.690> down

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
the plate and lay the deli paper down

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.779 
the plate and lay the deli paper down
pull<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.550> up<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:01.370> immediately<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.489> this

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
pull it up and you immediately have this

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.870 
pull it up and you immediately have this
cool<00:01:03.210> result<00:01:03.629> now<00:01:04.290> what<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.680> always<00:01:04.980> do<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
cool result now what I always do is I

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.530 
cool result now what I always do is I
keep<00:01:06.450> pulling<00:01:07.350> prints<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.460> these<00:01:09.180> are<00:01:09.360> called

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
keep pulling prints and these are called

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
keep pulling prints and these are called
ghost<00:01:10.080> prints<00:01:10.980> now<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.510> basically<00:01:12.660> I<00:01:13.110> just

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
ghost prints now but basically I just

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.100 
ghost prints now but basically I just
keep<00:01:13.740> pulling<00:01:14.040> prints<00:01:14.520> until<00:01:15.330> there's<00:01:15.930> no

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
keep pulling prints until there's no

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.030 
keep pulling prints until there's no
more<00:01:16.140> paint<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.180> plate<00:01:18.450> because<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.590> just

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
more paint on the plate because it just

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.690 
more paint on the plate because it just
gives<00:01:20.550> you<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> cool<00:01:21.360> effect<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:22.640> this<00:01:23.640> merger

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
gives you a cool effect of this merger

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.550 
gives you a cool effect of this merger
of<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:26.250> plate<00:01:26.550> with<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.240> paint<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.170> paper

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
of the plate with the paint in the paper

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.800 
of the plate with the paint in the paper
and<00:01:29.190> if<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.550> keep<00:01:29.760> going<00:01:29.940> it<00:01:30.300> gets<00:01:30.510> more<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and if you keep going it gets more and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.530 
and if you keep going it gets more and
more<00:01:31.020> interesting<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.640> let's<00:01:33.030> say<00:01:33.390> you're

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
more interesting so let's say you're

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.160 
more interesting so let's say you're
going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> put<00:01:33.900> some<00:01:34.110> paint<00:01:34.350> down<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:36.170> and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
going to put some paint down here and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.150 
going to put some paint down here and
you're<00:01:37.290> still<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:37.860> use<00:01:38.010> the

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
you're still not going to use the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.790 
you're still not going to use the
stencil<00:01:38.430> yet<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.270> use<00:01:39.450> anything<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.560> just

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
stencil yet you can use anything to just

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.150 
stencil yet you can use anything to just
draw<00:01:41.130> into<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> paint<00:01:42.300> and<00:01:42.720> make<00:01:43.500> marks

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
draw into the paint and make marks

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.300 
draw into the paint and make marks
anything<00:01:45.120> that's<00:01:45.330> not<00:01:45.540> super<00:01:46.260> pointy<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.950> do

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
anything that's not super pointy you do

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.600 
anything that's not super pointy you do
not<00:01:47.520> want<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.330> gouge<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:49.650> jelly<00:01:49.950> plate

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
not want to gouge the jelly plate

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.770 
not want to gouge the jelly plate
because<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:52.250> it's<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.790> slightly<00:01:54.390> delicate

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
because it's it's just slightly delicate

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.410 
because it's it's just slightly delicate
and<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.470> want<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.800> store<00:01:56.190> it<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.820> clam<00:01:57.120> box

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and you want to store it in the clam box

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.580 
and you want to store it in the clam box
it<00:01:57.810> comes<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.650> in<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.640> flat<00:02:00.000> position<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.560> that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it comes in in a flat position so that

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.560 
it comes in in a flat position so that
it<00:02:01.890> doesn't<00:02:02.250> get<00:02:02.370> dented<00:02:02.880> because<00:02:03.210> if<00:02:03.330> it<00:02:03.450> gets

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it doesn't get dented because if it gets

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.360 
it doesn't get dented because if it gets
dented<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.380> would<00:02:04.620> come<00:02:04.860> out<00:02:05.010> in<00:02:05.220> your

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
dented that would come out in your

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.119 
dented that would come out in your
printing<00:02:05.820> process<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:07.350> there's<00:02:07.590> one<00:02:07.890> that's

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
printing process so there's one that's

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.859 
printing process so there's one that's
just<00:02:08.220> very<00:02:08.429> random<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.360> see<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.690> little

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
just very random you can see the little

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.790 
just very random you can see the little
scribble<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.530> made<00:02:10.769> there<00:02:11.159> well<00:02:12.090> jelly<00:02:12.510> plates

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
scribble I made there well jelly plates

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.770 
scribble I made there well jelly plates
and<00:02:13.950> stencils<00:02:15.050> are<00:02:16.050> made<00:02:16.410> for<00:02:16.770> one<00:02:16.860> another

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
and stencils are made for one another

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.010 
and stencils are made for one another
you<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:18.810> get<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.320> cleanest<00:02:20.510> cleanest<00:02:21.510> result

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
you can get the cleanest cleanest result

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.130 
you can get the cleanest cleanest result
ever<00:02:22.400> when<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.520> use<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:24.000> stencil<00:02:24.450> with<00:02:24.960> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
ever when you use a stencil with the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.990 
ever when you use a stencil with the

jelly Play and I'm going to show you how
I<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.630> this<00:02:27.900> stencil<00:02:28.200> I'll<00:02:28.590> just<00:02:28.800> lay<00:02:28.980> it

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
I have this stencil I'll just lay it

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.980 
I have this stencil I'll just lay it
down<00:02:29.160> here<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.320> just<00:02:32.180> stuck<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.840> the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
down here and it is just stuck to the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.160 
down here and it is just stuck to the
play<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.610> mean

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
play I mean

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.250 
play I mean
stuck<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.070> play<00:02:38.480> which<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.660> awesome

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
stuck to the play which is awesome

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.140 
stuck to the play which is awesome
because<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.830> means<00:02:41.040> there<00:02:41.850> will<00:02:41.970> be<00:02:42.030> no

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
because that means there will be no

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.340 
because that means there will be no
paint<00:02:42.840> seeping<00:02:43.620> under<00:02:43.770> there<00:02:44.070> whatsoever<00:02:45.350> and

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
I'm going to just sort of blend up my

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:59.180 
I'm going to just sort of blend up my
colors<00:02:48.480> randomly<00:02:49.260> go<00:02:50.160> right<00:02:50.370> across<00:02:50.640> here<00:02:58.190> I'm

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
colors randomly go right across here I'm

going to peel this off now that looks
amazing<00:03:03.480> right<00:03:03.930> on<00:03:04.080> there<00:03:04.320> but<00:03:04.560> I've<00:03:04.710> also<00:03:05.310> got

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550

amazing right on there but I've also got
paint<00:03:05.820> on<00:03:05.910> here<00:03:06.240> so<00:03:06.660> I'm<00:03:07.290> going<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.470> lay<00:03:07.620> this

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
paint on here so I'm going to lay this

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.830 
paint on here so I'm going to lay this
down<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.490> see<00:03:08.850> if<00:03:08.970> any<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.240> this<00:03:09.390> paint<00:03:09.690> will

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
down and see if any of this paint will

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.480 
down and see if any of this paint will
come<00:03:10.050> off<00:03:10.080> here<00:03:10.470> like<00:03:10.650> we<00:03:10.800> did<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:11.070> before<00:03:11.400> in

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
come off here like we did it before in

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.940 
come off here like we did it before in
the<00:03:11.550> reverse<00:03:11.880> something<00:03:12.350> because<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.560> surely

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
the reverse something because you surely

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.500 
the reverse something because you surely
don't<00:03:14.070> want<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.340> waste<00:03:14.490> any<00:03:14.700> painting<00:03:15.150> and

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
don't want to waste any painting and

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.190 
don't want to waste any painting and
there<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.710> we<00:03:16.830> pulled<00:03:17.070> one<00:03:17.220> print<00:03:17.580> there<00:03:18.200> then

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
there so we pulled one print there then

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.890 
there so we pulled one print there then
let's<00:03:19.470> go<00:03:19.680> ahead<00:03:19.710> and<00:03:20.160> pull<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:23.300> and<00:03:24.300> you<00:03:24.660> get

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
let's go ahead and pull this and you get

let's go ahead and pull this and you get
such<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.320> beautiful<00:03:26.100> result<00:03:28.670> I've<00:03:29.670> got<00:03:29.880> more

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
such a beautiful result I've got more

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.850 
such a beautiful result I've got more

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
paint laughs so I'm going to just keep

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.820 
paint laughs so I'm going to just keep
pulling<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.640> prints<00:03:33.180> until<00:03:34.050> I<00:03:34.080> run<00:03:34.590> out<00:03:34.650> of

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
pulling the prints until I run out of

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.810 
pulling the prints until I run out of
paint<00:03:35.900> I'm<00:03:36.900> using<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.530> 6-inch<00:03:38.100> jelly<00:03:38.490> plate

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
paint I'm using a 6-inch jelly plate

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.110 
paint I'm using a 6-inch jelly plate
here<00:03:39.300> it's<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:40.050> little<00:03:40.200> baby<00:03:40.500> one<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.160> one<00:03:42.000> of

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
here it's a little baby one and one of

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.330 
here it's a little baby one and one of
the<00:03:42.210> things<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.600> like<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.960> do<00:03:43.110> is<00:03:43.410> ink<00:03:43.770> up<00:03:43.950> the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
the things I like to do is ink up the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.050 
the things I like to do is ink up the
edges<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:47.250> can<00:03:47.460> get<00:03:47.640> these<00:03:47.850> little

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
edges of it and you can get these little

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.090 
edges of it and you can get these little
frameworks<00:03:50.960> like<00:03:51.960> it<00:03:52.140> instantly<00:03:52.710> gives<00:03:52.950> you

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
frameworks like it instantly gives you

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.530 
frameworks like it instantly gives you
this<00:03:53.280> little<00:03:53.580> framework<00:03:54.650> design<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.550> just

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
this little framework design and I just

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.880 
this little framework design and I just
think<00:03:57.720> that's<00:03:57.870> kind<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.230> cool<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.680> create

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
think that's kind of cool to create

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.940 
think that's kind of cool to create
these<00:03:59.160> little<00:03:59.400> linear<00:03:59.880> parts<00:04:00.480> in<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:01.650> know<00:04:01.770> in

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
these little linear parts in you know in

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
these little linear parts in you know in
the<00:04:01.980> midst<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.580> your<00:04:02.790> other<00:04:02.970> printmaking<00:04:06.650> so

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
the midst of your other printmaking so

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.300 
the midst of your other printmaking so
you<00:04:08.970> could<00:04:09.180> keep<00:04:09.390> doing<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:09.930> all<00:04:10.200> day<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.800> am

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
you could keep doing this all day I am

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.890 
you could keep doing this all day I am
just<00:04:11.610> slightly<00:04:11.760> obsessed<00:04:12.720> with<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:14.900> they're

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
just slightly obsessed with it they're

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.270 
just slightly obsessed with it they're
probably<00:04:16.080> going<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:16.410> have<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.739> come<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:16.980> pull

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
probably going to have to come and pull

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.900 
probably going to have to come and pull
the<00:04:17.400> plate<00:04:17.670> away<00:04:17.790> from<00:04:17.940> me<00:04:18.390> and<00:04:18.540> make<00:04:18.690> me<00:04:18.870> stop

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
the plate away from me and make me stop

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:29.830 
the plate away from me and make me stop
because<00:04:20.910> it's<00:04:21.120> so<00:04:21.330> much<00:04:21.480> fun

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.409 

it<00:04:30.840> dries<00:04:31.230> super<00:04:31.950> fast<00:04:31.980> also<00:04:32.580> on<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.210> Delhi

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
it dries super fast also on the Delhi

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.330 
it dries super fast also on the Delhi
paper<00:04:33.720> that's<00:04:34.020> another<00:04:34.290> big<00:04:34.530> advantage<00:04:34.710> we'll

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
paper that's another big advantage we'll

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.340 
paper that's another big advantage we'll
put<00:04:35.550> this<00:04:35.700> crackle<00:04:36.360> stencil<00:04:36.900> down<00:04:39.139> let's<00:04:40.139> add

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
put this crackle stencil down let's add

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.080 
put this crackle stencil down let's add
a<00:04:40.380> little<00:04:40.590> white<00:04:40.889> and<00:04:40.919> parents<00:04:41.669> see<00:04:41.790> how<00:04:41.940> this

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
a little white and parents see how this

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:59.420 
a little white and parents see how this
looks<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:57.750> parts<00:04:58.110> of<00:04:58.260> this<00:04:58.410> crackle<00:04:58.889> stencil

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
looks the parts of this crackle stencil

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.820 
looks the parts of this crackle stencil
are<00:04:59.580> very<00:04:59.910> small<00:05:00.540> but<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.050> brayer<00:05:01.290> is<00:05:01.320> still

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
are very small but the brayer is still

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.330 
are very small but the brayer is still
going<00:05:02.010> down<00:05:02.280> in<00:05:02.490> there<00:05:02.580> quite<00:05:02.850> nicely<00:05:06.919> hmm<00:05:07.919> you

bring it up it looks so cool I wish we
could<00:05:10.260> just<00:05:10.290> preserve<00:05:10.979> that<00:05:11.250> right<00:05:11.520> there<00:05:11.729> now

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
could just preserve that right there now
