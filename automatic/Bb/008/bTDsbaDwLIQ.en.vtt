00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
reasons that this could happen one was

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.600 
reasons that this could happen one was
just<00:00:41.340> recently<00:00:41.610> Infinity<00:00:42.540> Blade<00:00:42.690> 2<00:00:43.610> dropped

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
app back up there in the top so it

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.849 
app back up there in the top so it
should<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.629> top<00:01:00.809> really<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.620> one

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
should be in the top really this is one

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860
