define anything I think my bars run
about<00:05:07.920> close<00:05:08.920> to<00:05:09.040> six<00:05:09.250> ounces<00:05:09.400> or<00:05:09.790> so<00:05:09.910> I<00:05:12.060> have

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
about close to six ounces or so I have

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.580 
about close to six ounces or so I have
another<00:05:13.270> slicer<00:05:13.570> that<00:05:13.720> I<00:05:13.870> can<00:05:14.080> get<00:05:14.230> up<00:05:14.260> and

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
another slicer that I can get up and

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.890 
another slicer that I can get up and
work<00:05:14.740> position<00:05:15.700> a<00:05:15.760> precision<00:05:16.150> slice<00:05:16.510> with<00:05:16.780> it

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
work position a precision slice with it

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.900 
work position a precision slice with it
but<00:05:17.890> I'm<00:05:17.980> also<00:05:18.130> like<00:05:18.340> cutting<00:05:18.610> through<00:05:18.730> so

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
but I'm also like cutting through so

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:34.470 
but I'm also like cutting through so
that's<00:05:19.150> just<00:05:19.240> kind<00:05:19.540> of<00:05:19.570> a<00:05:19.660> weird<00:05:19.990> thing

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.480
