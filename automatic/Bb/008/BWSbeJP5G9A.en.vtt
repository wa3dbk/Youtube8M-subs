00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
or anything like that it's not that fast

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.600 
or anything like that it's not that fast
and<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.720> works<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.229> okay<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.040> said<00:01:20.400> it's

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
and it works just okay like I said it's

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.780 
and it works just okay like I said it's
experimental<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:22.220> would<00:01:23.220> only<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> if

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
experimental so I would only do it if

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.160 
experimental so I would only do it if
you're<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.150> show<00:01:24.390> pictures<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.990> people

I mean if you're watching a web video it

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.539 
I mean if you're watching a web video it
might<00:01:28.020> be<00:01:28.200> ok<00:01:28.590> or<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> video<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.400> your<00:01:29.490> computer

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
apps that'll do a better job than just

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.649
