00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.220
 and very good and to fuck is ok and 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.809
 commenting I bring you a gameplay of 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.270
 this stage to vary a little and 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.060
 you have a gameplay with the shotgun plus 7 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.860
 is a semi-automatic shotgun and in the 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.960
 playing classic casual game mode 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.040
 the same as the favorite game and that's good 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.240
 I wanted to do it is also a brief 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.650
 valuation about this shotgun like 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.539
 you'll see right now if you get hit by jce 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.420
 near that semiautomatic shotgun that 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.820
 matte shot close to this as you 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.530
 I give a final saw I give another and I'll 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.760
 have to give him the last one to finish it off 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.320
 there is the mousse the good thing is that it was 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.750
 a pretty bad bot so I can 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.510
 give good and as you see no shotgun that 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.030
 It has 5 chargers and I automatic by 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.260
 what of a couple of shots normally 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.210
 usually fall even from one as you have 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.570
 seen if hooks from very close I've seen 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.220
 I how is it going, I do not either 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.900
 but from this game I'm not normal 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.890
 and I for people who are very machine with 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.780
 this shotgun that I have seen that it 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.600
 I found even 16-0 games 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.010
 because you have a lot more advantage 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.930
 if you are try that with this shotgun 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.600
 not being able to point 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.670
 in this game he has a lot more 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.440
 advantage over other types of weapons what 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.360
 bad to play on the console this 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.130
 video game is that you can not point 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.410
 so as I said, it's very 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.610
 difficult many times to fit the uncle 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.260
 inside the crosshead you know that if you 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.670
 do also the little things besides 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.610
 small as if you have a small 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.020
 targeted but it's very difficult to try 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.090
 Uncle put the crosshairs as you 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.460
 you move because in this game when you 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.890
 you move to bigger contentions what 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.810
 good thing is that with the shotgun the size 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.979
 of the crosshead I think it does not increase if 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.509
 you want close you also have a little bit 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.369
 more than advantage is also a shotgun 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.869
 that 'the like others that is cartridge 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.700
 but it has a rifle- type charger 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.680
 assault rifle since I gassed by 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.910
 example the five shots you remember in a 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.200
 moment the five bullets is not like in 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.119
 all kinds of shotgun you have to 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.440
 put all the cartridges again and 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.320
 you have to count the recharge because it is 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.050
 to the other guy for example here you see how 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.660
 in a plis to put five bullets and without more 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.700
 not good and they have stolen it and as 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.890
 you will see is also a shotgun that 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.990
 although in lenses and saltillo from far away 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.490
 now I'm going to put that it stands on that 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.110
 the hitch is relatively far 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.369
 Well, if you hit him in the head, it kills him 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.410
 at this distance is a distance 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.970
 quite far to be a shotgun and 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.290
 if you hit him in the head, that's what 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.630
 that has this game the head is only 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.910
 Death above all with a shotgun is 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.650
 well I'll kill a couple more and I'll 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.050
 cut here 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.370
 until another piece of departure because it is a 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.940
 very short example of a game 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.920
 started and just because that round wins 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.420
 we go to a bomb and then already a 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.310
 couple of rounds more than nothing 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.860
 special this is good I preferred 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.910
 cut and so put this round of another 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.190
 2d dust map with the galil playing in 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.770
 the terrorist team and it's a round in 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.410
 the one that makes me almost one and leixÃ³es is 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.270
 say I almost gave them to the five but 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.000
 what good if more I was very close is 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.430
 as it is an alternative not to the house is 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.380
 a weapon that I particularly prefer the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.300
 here but this weapon I see it as a 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.580
 little more accurate not so preposterous no 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.170
 as crazy as the los progres the ak-47 is 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.200
 here disc passed camera fast a little 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.420
 the subject of which exploded only against two 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.739
 there's just one who serves is pulled what 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.380
 it was worth so good I'm going to place the 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.940
 pump and wait what is it that has 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.260
 to come them there is just be 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.209
 accustomed the heat 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.280
 all the X and when you release the 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.049
 consult the pump to run but here if 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.090
 you run to jump the bomb not 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.980
 put it then why do you see how 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.560
 I do a little bit of fail but good here 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.360
 I'm going to hide and wait for him to come 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.239
 not if they are not going to take much longer to come 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.620
 and I'm going to grab the two of you and if I think 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.879
 that did not even hit them in the 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.819
 head there was one that was touched 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:40.400
 up you have the ones that are alive 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.640
 puts the time and puts the life that 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.349
 has so good on my disk I have left 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.879
 pretty little health was scared 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.319
 saying that this one is going to bust me like 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.209
 I touched the head of the bush and gave him 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.659
 away and then do not go but you have to 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.400
 come on here comes a little Manco 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.870
 so we can not kill you see him as 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.819
 Counts partner assistance like this 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.079
 that was touched so good I hope 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.000
 who would like to explain i explained tennis wolf 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.000
