00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
whether I can come back racing or not

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.410 
whether I can come back racing or not
it's<00:01:48.439> I<00:01:48.679> broke<00:01:49.219> my<00:01:49.369> neck<00:01:49.549> at<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.819> same<00:01:50.119> time

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
it's I broke my neck at the same time

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.999 
it's I broke my neck at the same time
and<00:01:50.659> there's<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.869> vertebrae<00:01:51.409> up<00:01:51.590> there<00:01:51.799> that's

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
and there's a vertebrae up there that's

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.419 
and there's a vertebrae up there that's
that's<00:01:53.560> deciding<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.709> it<00:01:54.860> doesn't<00:01:55.219> want<00:01:55.310> to

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
that's deciding that it doesn't want to

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.340 
that's deciding that it doesn't want to
take<00:01:55.670> calcium<00:01:55.969> at<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.509> rate<00:01:56.659> of<00:01:56.689> speed<00:01:57.079> that<00:01:57.259> I

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
take calcium at the rate of speed that I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.399 
take calcium at the rate of speed that I
would<00:01:57.560> like<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.340> make<00:01:58.549> it<00:01:58.959> safe<00:01:59.959> to<00:01:59.990> race

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
would like it to to make it safe to race

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.039 
would like it to to make it safe to race
again<00:02:00.829> right<00:02:01.039> now<00:02:01.219> it<00:02:01.399> is<00:02:01.549> not<00:02:01.700> safe<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:02.569> it

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
again right now it is not safe and it

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.109 
again right now it is not safe and it
would<00:02:03.200> be<00:02:03.350> stupid<00:02:03.619> for<00:02:04.009> me<00:02:04.039> to<00:02:04.159> race<00:02:04.459> even<00:02:04.759> if<00:02:04.969> I

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
would be stupid for me to race even if I

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.569 
would be stupid for me to race even if I
was<00:02:05.329> physically<00:02:05.750> ready<00:02:06.049> which<00:02:06.350> I<00:02:06.500> am<00:02:06.619> NOT<00:02:06.890> but

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
was physically ready which I am NOT but

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.039 
was physically ready which I am NOT but
I<00:02:07.609> don't<00:02:07.880> know<00:02:08.090> if<00:02:08.239> it's<00:02:08.360> going<00:02:08.569> to<00:02:08.630> heal<00:02:08.869> or

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
I don't know if it's going to heal or

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.350 
I don't know if it's going to heal or
not<00:02:09.200> we'll<00:02:09.440> just<00:02:09.619> have<00:02:09.739> to<00:02:09.799> wait<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.190> see<00:02:10.360> good

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
not we'll just have to wait and see good

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.470 
not we'll just have to wait and see good
to<00:02:11.420> see<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.810> thank<00:02:12.319> you
