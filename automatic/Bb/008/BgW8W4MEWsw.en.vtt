00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
especially I mean considering it's an

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.680 
especially I mean considering it's an
all-electric<00:02:25.920> vehicle<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.490> insane<00:02:27.420> and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
all-electric vehicle that is insane and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.560 
all-electric vehicle that is insane and
hilariously<00:02:28.470> insane<00:02:29.070> one<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.940> drive<00:02:30.210> mode

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
hilariously insane one of the drive mode

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.270

that<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.050> can<00:02:31.200> actually<00:02:31.380> put<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.920> car<00:02:32.100> in

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
that you can actually put the car in

that you can actually put the car in
that<00:02:32.550> isn't<00:02:32.820> reading<00:02:33.030> notes<00:02:33.450> available<00:02:33.600> which

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.560 
are normal sport and insane next will be
ludicrous<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:40.260> we<00:02:40.440> have<00:02:41.150> hardware<00:02:42.150> including

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
ludicrous so we have hardware including

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.300

we thought that we would be talking more
about<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:52.520> Model<00:02:53.520> X<00:02:53.760> which<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.470> SUV<00:02:55.950> but

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.010 
is not gonna be inexpensive to get a
Tesla<00:03:45.840> Model<00:03:46.170> D<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.710> to<00:03:47.010> get<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.190> D<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:48.240> just

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
Tesla Model D I to get a D and I just

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.830 
Tesla Model D I to get a D and I just
really<00:03:49.410> love<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.160> concept<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:51.450> the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
really love this concept of the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.480 
really love this concept of the
autonomous<00:03:52.470> driving<00:03:52.860> you're<00:03:53.100> saying<00:03:53.340> he

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
autonomous driving you're saying he

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.640 
autonomous driving you're saying he
wants<00:03:53.820> to<00:03:54.000> get<00:03:54.180> Tesla<00:03:54.540> cars<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:55.320> ninety

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
wants to get Tesla cars to ninety

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.800 
wants to get Tesla cars to ninety
percent<00:03:55.800> autonomy<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.820> think<00:03:57.060> with

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
percent autonomy and I think with

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.510 
percent autonomy and I think with
self-driving<00:03:58.230> cars<00:03:58.620> Google's<00:03:59.100> really<00:03:59.340> made<00:03:59.490> a

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
self-driving cars Google's really made a

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.720 
self-driving cars Google's really made a
lot<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.790> strides<00:04:00.780> in<00:04:01.140> that<00:04:01.410> arena<00:04:01.710> and<00:04:02.100> I<00:04:02.490> think

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
lot of strides in that arena and I think

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.610 
lot of strides in that arena and I think
Elon<00:04:03.180> Musk<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.540> really<00:04:03.840> hoping<00:04:04.110> he<00:04:04.290> can<00:04:04.410> also

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
Elon Musk is really hoping he can also

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.100 
Elon Musk is really hoping he can also
do<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.010> same<00:04:05.040> thing<00:04:05.460> some<00:04:06.450> of<00:04:06.540> these<00:04:06.600> features

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
do the same thing some of these features

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.420 
do the same thing some of these features
that<00:04:07.350> they're<00:04:07.530> saying<00:04:07.830> that<00:04:07.950> you're<00:04:08.160> gonna<00:04:08.280> be

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
that they're saying that you're gonna be

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.310 
that they're saying that you're gonna be
able<00:04:08.460> to<00:04:08.640> do<00:04:08.850> some<00:04:09.480> of<00:04:09.570> them<00:04:09.690> don't<00:04:09.780> seem<00:04:09.930> legal

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
able to do some of them don't seem legal

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.020 
able to do some of them don't seem legal
at<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:10.770> point<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.250> we're<00:04:11.400> working<00:04:11.550> toward

at this point and we're working toward

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.300 
at this point and we're working toward
legalization<00:04:12.420> can<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.040> let's<00:04:14.040> talk<00:04:14.160> more

legalization can you let's talk more

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.229

the carriage house let me just get my

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.620 
the carriage house let me just get my
Tesla<00:04:30.650> but<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:32.340> car<00:04:32.580> he<00:04:32.970> says<00:04:33.150> on<00:04:33.419> your

private property you'll be able to some

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.700 
private property you'll be able to some
in<00:04:35.759> the<00:04:35.850> car<00:04:36.030> you<00:04:36.210> can't<00:04:36.449> do<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:36.930> like<00:04:37.320> if<00:04:37.500> you

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
in the car you can't do that like if you

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.010 
in the car you can't do that like if you
for<00:04:38.070> example<00:04:38.270> park<00:04:39.270> your<00:04:39.389> car<00:04:39.570> on<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.690> streets

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
for example park your car on the streets

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.870 
for example park your car on the streets
of<00:04:40.139> Los<00:04:40.289> Angeles<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.100> then<00:04:41.250> walk<00:04:41.490> out<00:04:41.669> of<00:04:41.699> a

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
of Los Angeles and then walk out of a

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.460 
of Los Angeles and then walk out of a
restaurant<00:04:42.030> you<00:04:42.389> can't<00:04:42.600> just<00:04:42.810> summit<00:04:43.229> it<00:04:43.320> like

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
restaurant you can't just summit it like

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.710 
restaurant you can't just summit it like
the<00:04:43.620> Batmobile<00:04:43.889> that<00:04:44.639> will<00:04:44.970> not<00:04:45.210> be<00:04:45.240> a<00:04:45.449> legal

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
the Batmobile that will not be a legal

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.890 
the Batmobile that will not be a legal
thing<00:04:45.900> probably<00:04:46.470> for<00:04:46.889> a<00:04:46.919> while<00:04:47.360> no<00:04:48.360> yeah<00:04:48.870> I

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
thing probably for a while no yeah I

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.930 
thing probably for a while no yeah I
just<00:04:49.169> imagined<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:49.770> many<00:04:49.949> scenarios<00:04:50.370> with

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
just imagined so many scenarios with

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.080 
just imagined so many scenarios with
valets<00:04:51.449> getting<00:04:51.960> run<00:04:52.229> over<00:04:52.259> and<00:04:52.919> just<00:04:53.610> traffic

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
valets getting run over and just traffic

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.180 
valets getting run over and just traffic
accident<00:04:54.570> it<00:04:54.690> seems<00:04:55.020> like<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.229> terrible<00:04:55.740> idea

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
accident it seems like a terrible idea

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.490 
accident it seems like a terrible idea
to<00:04:56.940> let<00:04:57.150> I<00:04:57.360> mean<00:04:57.539> although<00:04:57.810> if<00:04:58.289> there's

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
to let I mean although if there's

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.689 
to let I mean although if there's
anybody<00:04:58.710> who<00:04:58.949> could<00:04:59.070> do<00:04:59.190> it<00:04:59.220> I<00:04:59.400> would<00:04:59.520> imagine

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
anybody who could do it I would imagine

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.640 
anybody who could do it I would imagine
it<00:04:59.940> would<00:04:59.970> either<00:05:00.180> be<00:05:00.300> google<00:05:00.780> or<00:05:00.930> Tesla<00:05:01.380> so<00:05:01.620> I

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
it would either be google or Tesla so I

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.680 
it would either be google or Tesla so I
like<00:05:02.010> there<00:05:02.160> are<00:05:02.340> companies<00:05:03.180> that<00:05:03.300> I<00:05:03.449> feel

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
like there are companies that I feel

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.779 
like there are companies that I feel
like<00:05:03.780> I<00:05:03.930> could<00:05:04.139> trust<00:05:04.410> to<00:05:04.919> implement<00:05:05.669> that

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
like I could trust to implement that

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.060 
like I could trust to implement that
type<00:05:06.000> of<00:05:06.030> tech<00:05:06.389> I<00:05:06.630> mean<00:05:07.020> we<00:05:07.139> they<00:05:07.380> are<00:05:07.530> able<00:05:07.770> to

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
type of tech I mean we they are able to

will help you do that and there's our

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.920 
will help you do that and there's our
there's<00:05:23.310> you<00:05:23.759> know<00:05:23.789> Mercedes<00:05:24.030> I<00:05:24.389> believe<00:05:24.720> has

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
there's you know Mercedes I believe has

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.270 
there's you know Mercedes I believe has
that<00:05:25.199> I<00:05:25.229> there's<00:05:25.530> a<00:05:25.590> lot<00:05:25.740> of<00:05:25.770> cars<00:05:26.039> out<00:05:26.250> there

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
that I there's a lot of cars out there

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.800 
that I there's a lot of cars out there
there's<00:05:26.639> a<00:05:26.699> ford<00:05:26.940> model<00:05:27.210> that<00:05:27.330> does<00:05:27.449> that<00:05:27.630> yeah

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
there's a ford model that does that yeah

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.060 
there's a ford model that does that yeah
yeah<00:05:28.169> there's<00:05:28.410> a<00:05:28.470> lot<00:05:28.560> of<00:05:28.620> cars<00:05:28.860> out<00:05:29.039> there

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
yeah there's a lot of cars out there

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.310 
yeah there's a lot of cars out there
that<00:05:29.340> have<00:05:29.520> this<00:05:30.030> type<00:05:30.270> of<00:05:30.300> technology<00:05:30.539> and<00:05:31.260> I

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
that have this type of technology and I

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.779 
that have this type of technology and I
think<00:05:31.560> he's<00:05:31.710> just<00:05:31.949> looking<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.280> sort<00:05:32.490> of<00:05:32.520> make

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
think he's just looking to sort of make

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.450 
think he's just looking to sort of make
it<00:05:32.820> more<00:05:33.030> sophisticated<00:05:33.720> and<00:05:34.080> also<00:05:34.440> add<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:35.340> it

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
it more sophisticated and also add to it

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.089 
it more sophisticated and also add to it
so<00:05:35.639> this<00:05:35.789> is<00:05:35.940> just<00:05:36.180> kind<00:05:37.050> of<00:05:37.139> amplifying<00:05:37.770> these

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
so this is just kind of amplifying these

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.460 
so this is just kind of amplifying these
sort<00:05:38.340> of<00:05:38.370> automated<00:05:38.789> processes<00:05:39.720> so<00:05:40.110> overall

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
sort of automated processes so overall

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.990 
sort of automated processes so overall
how<00:05:40.500> do<00:05:40.740> you<00:05:40.889> feel<00:05:41.130> about<00:05:41.280> this<00:05:41.580> announcement

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
how do you feel about this announcement

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.750 
how do you feel about this announcement
from<00:05:42.210> elon<00:05:42.479> musk<00:05:42.750> and<00:05:42.930> also<00:05:43.770> his<00:05:43.979> big<00:05:44.400> picture

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
from elon musk and also his big picture

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.120 
from elon musk and also his big picture
idea<00:05:45.090> I<00:05:45.360> think<00:05:45.870> this<00:05:46.199> is<00:05:46.380> really<00:05:46.740> impressive

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
idea I think this is really impressive

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.450 
idea I think this is really impressive
the<00:05:47.760> d<00:05:47.970> model<00:05:48.449> actually<00:05:48.889> increased<00:05:49.889> the

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
the d model actually increased the

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.279 
the d model actually increased the
efficiency<00:05:50.580> of<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.510> car<00:05:51.720> so<00:05:52.050> it<00:05:52.139> actually

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
efficiency of the car so it actually

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.740 
efficiency of the car so it actually
gets<00:05:52.560> 10<00:05:52.919> more<00:05:53.159> miles<00:05:53.460> on<00:05:53.880> its<00:05:54.090> range<00:05:54.419> as

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
gets 10 more miles on its range as

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.750 
gets 10 more miles on its range as
opposed<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.320> decreasing<00:05:55.889> it<00:05:55.979> which<00:05:56.130> is<00:05:56.280> kind

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
opposed to decreasing it which is kind

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.129 
opposed to decreasing it which is kind
of<00:05:56.820> what<00:05:56.970> you<00:05:57.090> would<00:05:57.210> expect<00:05:57.570> if<00:05:57.840> you're<00:05:57.990> as

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
of what you would expect if you're as

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:59.779 
of what you would expect if you're as
it's<00:05:58.289> so<00:05:58.440> high<00:05:58.590> performance<00:05:59.159> right<00:05:59.460> it's<00:05:59.669> so

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
it's so high performance right it's so

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.159 
it's so high performance right it's so
high<00:05:59.909> performance<00:06:00.360> you<00:06:00.419> would<00:06:00.510> imagine<00:06:00.720> okay

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
high performance you would imagine okay

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:02.779 
high performance you would imagine okay
I'm<00:06:01.320> probably<00:06:01.560> going<00:06:01.740> to<00:06:01.830> lose<00:06:02.039> some<00:06:02.310> range<00:06:02.550> on

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
I'm probably going to lose some range on

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.850 
I'm probably going to lose some range on
this<00:06:02.970> I'm<00:06:03.270> probably<00:06:03.510> know<00:06:04.169> and<00:06:04.440> not<00:06:04.530> the<00:06:04.710> case

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
this I'm probably know and not the case

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.350 
this I'm probably know and not the case
at<00:06:05.039> all<00:06:05.099> it<00:06:05.250> actually<00:06:05.580> increased<00:06:06.060> the<00:06:06.210> range

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
at all it actually increased the range

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.950 
at all it actually increased the range
by<00:06:06.630> 10<00:06:06.870> miles<00:06:07.139> to<00:06:07.520> 275<00:06:08.520> miles<00:06:08.820> which<00:06:09.150> is<00:06:09.180> really

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
by 10 miles to 275 miles which is really

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.439 
by 10 miles to 275 miles which is really
impressive<00:06:10.380> and<00:06:10.800> so<00:06:10.979> I<00:06:11.010> think<00:06:11.340> they've<00:06:12.270> got

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
impressive and so I think they've got

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.570 
impressive and so I think they've got
this<00:06:12.599> new<00:06:12.810> battery<00:06:13.289> factory<00:06:13.590> spinning<00:06:14.220> up<00:06:14.370> in

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
this new battery factory spinning up in

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.510 
this new battery factory spinning up in
Nevada<00:06:15.270> I<00:06:15.690> think<00:06:16.289> they're<00:06:16.409> really<00:06:16.620> kind<00:06:17.460> of

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
Nevada I think they're really kind of

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.370 
Nevada I think they're really kind of
ramping<00:06:18.030> up<00:06:18.120> at<00:06:18.330> this<00:06:18.419> point<00:06:18.690> kind<00:06:19.110> of<00:06:19.199> thing

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
ramping up at this point kind of thing

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.909 
ramping up at this point kind of thing
make<00:06:19.590> a<00:06:19.620> run<00:06:19.889> at<00:06:19.919> it<00:06:20.070> more<00:06:20.520> for<00:06:21.110> the<00:06:22.110> the<00:06:22.560> three

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
make a run at it more for the the three

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.640 
make a run at it more for the the three
which<00:06:23.250> is<00:06:23.400> supposed<00:06:23.699> to<00:06:23.820> be<00:06:23.970> you<00:06:24.300> know

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
which is supposed to be you know

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.100 
which is supposed to be you know
the<00:06:24.970> cheaper<00:06:25.970> oil<00:06:26.000> is<00:06:26.360> definitely<00:06:26.720> cheaper

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
the cheaper oil is definitely cheaper

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.770 
the cheaper oil is definitely cheaper
economy<00:06:28.009> just<00:06:28.699> look<00:06:28.910> I<00:06:29.060> know<00:06:29.150> we've<00:06:29.419> really

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
economy just look I know we've really

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.070 
economy just look I know we've really
has<00:06:29.960> economy<00:06:30.770> as<00:06:30.919> sort<00:06:31.190> of<00:06:31.220> it's<00:06:31.610> a<00:06:31.699> weird<00:06:32.080> 35

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
has economy as sort of it's a weird 35

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.420 
has economy as sort of it's a weird 35
thousand<00:06:33.560> dollar<00:06:33.710> starting<00:06:34.160> it's<00:06:34.310> not

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
thousand dollar starting it's not

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.340 
thousand dollar starting it's not
exactly<00:06:34.789> an<00:06:34.910> economy<00:06:35.360> car<00:06:35.419> to<00:06:35.750> Alliance<00:06:36.169> to

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
exactly an economy car to Alliance to

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.100 
exactly an economy car to Alliance to
most<00:06:36.620> people<00:06:37.160> myself<00:06:37.580> included<00:06:37.970> yeah<00:06:38.479> but

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
most people myself included yeah but

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.590 
most people myself included yeah but
like<00:06:39.979> I<00:06:40.070> think<00:06:40.310> yeah<00:06:40.550> I'd<00:06:40.970> I<00:06:41.000> agree<00:06:41.449> i<00:06:41.479> think

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
like I think yeah I'd I agree i think

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.560 
like I think yeah I'd I agree i think
this<00:06:41.930> Factory<00:06:42.440> is<00:06:42.530> really<00:06:42.949> kind<00:06:43.130> of<00:06:43.310> the<00:06:43.820> start

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
this Factory is really kind of the start

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.070 
this Factory is really kind of the start
of<00:06:44.810> them<00:06:44.990> ramping<00:06:45.830> up<00:06:45.949> and<00:06:46.220> really<00:06:47.210> pushing

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
of them ramping up and really pushing

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.760 
of them ramping up and really pushing
for<00:06:48.680> a<00:06:49.460> full<00:06:49.970> you<00:06:50.360> know<00:06:50.389> not<00:06:50.810> dealerships<00:06:51.500> but

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
for a full you know not dealerships but

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.360 
for a full you know not dealerships but
really<00:06:52.610> getting<00:06:52.639> the<00:06:52.910> Tesla<00:06:53.690> into<00:06:54.320> you<00:06:55.250> know

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
really getting the Tesla into you know

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.050 
really getting the Tesla into you know
mass<00:06:56.320> adoption<00:06:57.320> this<00:06:58.070> is<00:06:58.250> this<00:06:58.580> is<00:06:58.820> the

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
mass adoption this is this is the

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.790 
mass adoption this is this is the
tipping<00:06:59.720> point<00:06:59.750> I<00:07:00.139> would<00:07:00.199> imagine<00:07:00.410> this

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
tipping point I would imagine this

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.260 
tipping point I would imagine this
Factory<00:07:01.250> is<00:07:01.340> like<00:07:01.550> the<00:07:01.699> start<00:07:01.940> of<00:07:02.090> that

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
Factory is like the start of that

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.750 
Factory is like the start of that
tipping<00:07:02.690> point<00:07:02.720> so<00:07:03.380> I<00:07:03.440> think<00:07:03.530> the<00:07:03.710> X<00:07:03.889> first<00:07:04.430> and

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:04.760 
tipping point so I think the X first and

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.939 
tipping point so I think the X first and
