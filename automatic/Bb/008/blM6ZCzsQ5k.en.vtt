to go about treating a room for bedbugs

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.980 
to go about treating a room for bedbugs
this<00:00:10.230> bedbugs<00:00:10.860> do<00:00:11.280> not<00:00:11.460> fly<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.269> they<00:00:12.570> do<00:00:12.630> not

this bedbugs do not fly and they do not

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.560 
this bedbugs do not fly and they do not
jump<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.769> only<00:00:14.009> thing<00:00:14.250> they<00:00:14.759> get<00:00:14.969> around<00:00:15.240> is

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
jump the only thing they get around is

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.260 
jump the only thing they get around is
crawling<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.619> we'll<00:00:16.800> move<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.220> slack<00:00:17.580> over

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
crawling so we'll move the slack over

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.050 
crawling so we'll move the slack over
and<00:00:19.039> the<00:00:20.039> first<00:00:20.279> thing<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.609> knees<00:00:20.760> going<00:00:20.939> to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
and the first thing the knees going to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.700 
and the first thing the knees going to
do<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.210> create<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.510> perimeter<00:00:21.840> around<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.439> legs

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
do is create a perimeter around the legs

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.700 
do is create a perimeter around the legs
of<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> bed<00:00:23.279> around<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.180> floor<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:25.320> see<00:00:25.529> if

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
of the bed around on the floor so see if

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.410 
of the bed around on the floor so see if
you<00:00:25.859> notice<00:00:26.039> she's<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.699> making<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.240> little

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
you notice she's just making a little

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.359 
you notice she's just making a little
cloud<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.109> now<00:00:28.320> get<00:00:28.560> around<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.980> legs<00:00:29.220> a

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
cloud and now get around the legs a

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.019 
cloud and now get around the legs a
little<00:00:29.400> bit<00:00:29.730> better

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
little bit better

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.500 
little bit better
down<00:00:30.359> below<00:00:30.539> okay<00:00:31.279> very<00:00:32.279> good<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.790> inside<00:00:33.329> as

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
down below okay very good and inside as

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.360 
down below okay very good and inside as
well<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.930> then<00:00:34.500> she'll<00:00:34.710> go<00:00:34.860> right<00:00:34.890> down<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
well and then she'll go right down the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.549 
well and then she'll go right down the
frame<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.059> bed<00:00:36.239> if<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.930> notice<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.350> keep

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
frame of the bed if you notice you keep

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.910 
frame of the bed if you notice you keep
the<00:00:38.300> tilt<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.629> bottle<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the tilt of the bottle so that the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.830 
the tilt of the bottle so that the
bottom<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> bottle<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:42.629> lower

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
bottom of the bottle is a little lower

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.110 
bottom of the bottle is a little lower
than<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> top<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.950> bottle<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.910> way

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
than the top of the bottle and that way

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.090 
than the top of the bottle and that way
it<00:00:45.390> creates<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.870> perfect<00:00:46.140> cloud<00:00:46.700> of<00:00:47.700> product

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
it creates a perfect cloud of product

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.290 
it creates a perfect cloud of product
see<00:00:50.100> there's<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> little<00:00:50.430> cloud<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:50.969> she<00:00:51.030> just

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
see there's a little cloud so she just

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.910 
see there's a little cloud so she just
wait<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> minute<00:00:51.840> let<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.170> dust<00:00:52.440> settle<00:00:52.770> so

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
wait a minute let that dust settle so

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.529 
wait a minute let that dust settle so
she<00:00:52.980> doesn't<00:00:53.250> breathe<00:00:53.520> any<00:00:53.730> only<00:00:54.180> takes<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
she doesn't breathe any only takes a

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.970 
she doesn't breathe any only takes a
minute<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:54.989> very<00:00:55.170> heavy<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.590> will<00:00:55.739> settle

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
minute it's very heavy and will settle

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.400 
minute it's very heavy and will settle
down<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.910> now<00:00:57.030> she's<00:00:57.239> doing<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> bed<00:00:58.109> frame

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
down but now she's doing the bed frame

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.260 
down but now she's doing the bed frame
itself<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.340> she's<00:00:59.609> probably<00:00:59.820> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.180> go<00:01:00.239> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
itself so she's probably going to go a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.000 
itself so she's probably going to go a
little<00:01:00.449> bit<00:01:00.660> heavier<00:01:00.840> because<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.559> wood<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
little bit heavier because it's wood and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.429 
little bit heavier because it's wood and
we're<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:03.750> mattress<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.379> a

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
we're going to have the mattress and a

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.940 
we're going to have the mattress and a
box<00:01:04.680> spring<00:01:04.830> setting<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.489> there<00:01:06.619> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.770> see

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
box spring setting in there you can see

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.100 
box spring setting in there you can see
it<00:01:08.040> looks<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.640> bit<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.360> dust<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it looks just like a bit of dust in the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.590 
it looks just like a bit of dust in the
bed<00:01:10.439> frame<00:01:10.710> around<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.369> nightstand<00:01:12.330> over

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
bed frame around the nightstand over

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.480 
bed frame around the nightstand over
there<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.409> wall<00:01:13.619> you're<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.310> have

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the same thing we try not to shoot it on

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.080 
the same thing we try not to shoot it on
the<00:01:17.009> wood<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.460> should<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> don't<00:01:17.880> know<00:01:17.970> what

she's<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:33.270> creating<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.720> little<00:01:33.750> cloud<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.500> I

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
she's just creating a little cloud and I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.370 
she's just creating a little cloud and I
will<00:01:35.729> try<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.150> zoom<00:01:36.360> right<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.229> now

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
will try and zoom right on that now

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.800 
will try and zoom right on that now
you've<00:01:37.590> seen<00:01:37.860> her<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.490> almost<00:01:39.360> cannot

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
you've seen her do it you almost cannot

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.499 
you've seen her do it you almost cannot
see<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.170> at<00:01:40.290> all<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:41.400> then<00:01:41.579> what<00:01:41.790> we<00:01:41.909> do<00:01:42.150> just

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
to make it actually more effective she's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.030 
to make it actually more effective she's
going<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.390> use<00:01:45.600> her<00:01:45.659> feet<00:01:46.170> or<00:01:46.350> her<00:01:46.470> fingers<00:01:46.860> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
a day or two let that sit there any bugs

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.550 
a day or two let that sit there any bugs
that<00:02:00.299> are<00:02:00.390> already<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:01.020> there<00:02:01.259> or

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
simple it is to open up the corner of

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.860 
simple it is to open up the corner of
the<00:02:10.619> mattress<00:02:11.039> these<00:02:11.550> are<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:12.060> put<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.330> with

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
the mattress these are just put on with

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.860 
the mattress these are just put on with
basically<00:02:13.790> staples<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.150> all<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.540> they<00:02:15.690> just

basically staples so all it is they just
staple<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.319> cheesecloth<00:02:16.739> on<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.250> keep<00:02:17.430> dust

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
staple the cheesecloth on to keep dust

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.330 
staple the cheesecloth on to keep dust
from<00:02:18.239> getting<00:02:18.300> inside<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.709> we<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:19.950> take<00:02:20.160> out

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
from getting inside so we just take out

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.300 
from getting inside so we just take out
two<00:02:20.880> or<00:02:21.000> three<00:02:21.030> pop<00:02:21.959> those<00:02:22.230> out<00:02:22.440> then<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.069> take

your bye-bye bugs give it a little shake

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.809 
your bye-bye bugs give it a little shake
just<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.260> loosen<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.769> up<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:28.920> it's<00:02:29.220> all<00:02:29.340> powdery

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
furniture and we've set up several

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.960 
furniture and we've set up several
perimeters<00:03:03.660> we've<00:03:03.989> also<00:03:04.200> dusted<00:03:04.830> inside<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
perimeters we've also dusted inside the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.449 
perimeters we've also dusted inside the
going<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.299> dust<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.780> right<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.890> where<00:03:08.340> the

going to dust it right in to where the

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.550 
going to dust it right in to where the
fabric<00:03:08.910> has<00:03:09.120> little<00:03:09.390> folds<00:03:09.900> on<00:03:10.079> the<00:03:10.109> corners

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
fabric has little folds on the corners

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.180 
fabric has little folds on the corners
and<00:03:10.739> also<00:03:11.579> where<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.120> top<00:03:12.769> part<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:13.950> box

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
and also where the top part of the box

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.330 
and also where the top part of the box
spring<00:03:14.609> is<00:03:15.019> fabricated<00:03:16.019> there<00:03:16.200> stitching<00:03:16.769> so

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
spring is fabricated there stitching so

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.819 
spring is fabricated there stitching so
just<00:03:17.579> all<00:03:17.760> along<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.390> stitching<00:03:18.840> she's<00:03:19.470> going

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
just all along the stitching she's going

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.490 
just all along the stitching she's going
to<00:03:20.069> just<00:03:20.760> dust<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.209> in<00:03:21.359> there<00:03:21.870> same<00:03:22.170> as<00:03:22.319> before

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
to just dust it in there same as before

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.960 
to just dust it in there same as before
and<00:03:22.940> then<00:03:23.940> if<00:03:24.239> it's<00:03:24.810> too<00:03:25.290> heavy<00:03:25.500> she<00:03:25.980> can<00:03:26.220> you

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
and then if it's too heavy she can you

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.610 
and then if it's too heavy she can you
know<00:03:27.000> rub<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.510> with<00:03:27.630> our<00:03:27.750> fingers<00:03:28.109> smooth<00:03:28.380> if

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
know rub it with our fingers smooth if

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.800 
know rub it with our fingers smooth if
she<00:03:28.799> wants<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.549> that<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.420> just<00:03:30.660> do<00:03:30.750> all

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
she wants to and that is it just do all

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.809 
she wants to and that is it just do all
four<00:03:31.139> corners<00:03:31.380> like<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:31.889> and<00:03:32.220> you're<00:03:32.670> good

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
four corners like that and you're good

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.300 
four corners like that and you're good
so<00:03:33.690> we've<00:03:33.840> done<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.230> boxspring<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:35.010> frame

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
so we've done the boxspring the frame

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.819 
so we've done the boxspring the frame
the<00:03:35.880> room<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.420> perimeters<00:03:37.019> multiple

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
the room the perimeters multiple

on the fabric and you just go around the
whole<00:04:05.349> mattress<00:04:05.650> just<00:04:06.129> like<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.579> and<00:04:06.819> also

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
whole mattress just like that and also

if you show wear see where she is right

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.710 
if you show wear see where she is right
now<00:04:09.250> she's<00:04:09.610> between<00:04:09.909> the<00:04:10.209> boxspring<00:04:10.510> and

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
now she's between the boxspring and

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
on your shoes on clothes occasionally so

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.850 
on your shoes on clothes occasionally so
what<00:04:34.150> we<00:04:34.300> do<00:04:34.510> is<00:04:34.720> we<00:04:34.870> create<00:04:35.080> multiple

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
what we do is we create multiple

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.879 
what we do is we create multiple
perimeters<00:04:36.850> because<00:04:37.419> they<00:04:37.539> don't<00:04:37.750> fly<00:04:38.080> they

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
perimeters because they don't fly they

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.189 
perimeters because they don't fly they
don't<00:04:39.130> jump<00:04:39.490> so<00:04:39.940> they're<00:04:40.150> going<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.449> crawl<00:04:40.870> to

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
don't jump so they're going to crawl to

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.040 
don't jump so they're going to crawl to
where<00:04:41.410> you<00:04:41.620> are<00:04:41.650> so<00:04:42.130> we<00:04:42.880> create<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.419> perimeter

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
where you are so we create a perimeter

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.279 
where you are so we create a perimeter
around<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:45.070> bed<00:04:45.250> frame<00:04:45.580> perimeter<00:04:46.510> around

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
around the bed frame perimeter around

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.010 
around the bed frame perimeter around
the<00:04:47.470> bed<00:04:47.740> itself<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.400> perimeter<00:04:48.820> around<00:04:49.240> the

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
the bed itself a perimeter around the

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.010 
the bed itself a perimeter around the
molding<00:04:50.500> we<00:04:51.310> treat<00:04:51.669> in<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:52.330> molding<00:04:52.750> if<00:04:52.870> we

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
molding we treat in the molding if we

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.140 
molding we treat in the molding if we
can<00:04:53.199> pull<00:04:53.440> it<00:04:53.560> back<00:04:53.740> or<00:04:54.340> if<00:04:54.400> there's<00:04:54.580> cracks<00:04:54.910> we

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
can pull it back or if there's cracks we

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.110 
can pull it back or if there's cracks we
treat<00:04:55.389> around<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.050> door<00:04:56.289> around<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.490> closets

there will always be a little bit that

there will always be a little bit that
will<00:05:13.120> remain<00:05:13.510> we're<00:05:13.840> going<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.050> treat<00:05:14.260> the

distribute and create a cloud when you

distribute and create a cloud when you
squeeze<00:05:27.220> it<00:05:27.360> it's<00:05:28.360> a<00:05:28.419> lot<00:05:28.570> better<00:05:28.750> than<00:05:28.960> a<00:05:29.110> 400

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
reason that this works better is because

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.680 
reason that this works better is because

this will last this treatment here will

this will last this treatment here will
last<00:05:37.930> probably<00:05:38.199> six<00:05:38.860> months<00:05:38.949> when<00:05:39.760> bedbugs
