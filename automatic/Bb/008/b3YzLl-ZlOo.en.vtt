00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
marks right here are from me using this

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.900 
marks right here are from me using this
to<00:01:35.450> hammer<00:01:36.110> nails<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:37.010> works<00:01:37.280> for<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.610> too

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
to hammer nails it works for that too

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.990 
to hammer nails it works for that too
but<00:01:38.540> as<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:38.900> saw<00:01:39.170> in<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:39.380> clip<00:01:40.000> the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
but as you saw in that clip the

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.390 
but as you saw in that clip the
trajectory<00:01:41.720> kept<00:01:42.020> dropping<00:01:42.410> lower<00:01:42.979> than<00:01:43.310> I

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
trajectory kept dropping lower than I

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.430 
trajectory kept dropping lower than I
wanted<00:01:43.790> it<00:01:43.940> to<00:01:44.150> it<00:01:44.270> was<00:01:44.390> hitting<00:01:44.780> like<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:44.960> foot

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
wanted it to it was hitting like a foot

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.359 
wanted it to it was hitting like a foot
lower<00:01:45.710> or<00:01:46.369> so<00:01:46.960> that<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:48.020> wanted<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.920> the

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
lower or so that I wanted to and the

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.050 
lower or so that I wanted to and the
reason<00:01:49.729> for<00:01:49.910> that<00:01:49.970> is<00:01:50.300> because<00:01:50.330> this<00:01:51.320> is<00:01:51.560> come

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
reason for that is because this is come

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.390 
reason for that is because this is come
this<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.240> one<00:01:53.540> solid<00:01:53.869> piece<00:01:54.290> of<00:01:54.320> metal<00:01:54.500> alright

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
this is one solid piece of metal alright

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.130 
this is one solid piece of metal alright
this<00:01:55.550> is<00:01:55.790> metal<00:01:56.030> all<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.330> way<00:01:56.450> down<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.930> here

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
this is metal all the way down to here

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.770 
this is metal all the way down to here
that's<00:01:57.320> just<00:01:57.560> you<00:01:58.250> know<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.550> grip<00:01:58.790> is<00:01:59.030> over

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
that's just you know the grip is over

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.980 
that's just you know the grip is over
the<00:01:59.930> metal<00:02:00.670> but<00:02:01.670> because<00:02:02.060> this<00:02:02.210> is<00:02:02.420> one<00:02:02.690> solid

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
the metal but because this is one solid

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.270 
the metal but because this is one solid
hunk<00:02:03.470> of<00:02:03.619> metal<00:02:04.000> it's<00:02:05.000> actually<00:02:05.690> heavier<00:02:06.280> than

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
hunk of metal it's actually heavier than

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.740 
hunk of metal it's actually heavier than
most

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
most

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.160 
most
tomahawks<00:02:09.619> of<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.280> same<00:02:10.610> length<00:02:11.600> okay<00:02:12.080> I'm

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
tomahawks of the same length okay I'm

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.100 
tomahawks of the same length okay I'm
used<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.530> like<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:13.160> metal<00:02:14.090> tomahawk<00:02:14.630> head<00:02:14.930> and

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
used to like a metal tomahawk head and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.949 
used to like a metal tomahawk head and
then<00:02:15.230> like<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.440> wooden<00:02:15.860> shaft<00:02:16.400> or<00:02:16.880> an<00:02:16.970> FRN<00:02:17.540> shaft

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
then like a wooden shaft or an FRN shaft

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.830 
then like a wooden shaft or an FRN shaft
that's<00:02:18.200> very<00:02:18.470> lightweight<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:19.630> because<00:02:20.630> of

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
that's very lightweight so because of

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.780 
that's very lightweight so because of
that<00:02:21.110> this<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:21.890> heavier<00:02:22.430> than<00:02:22.610> I'm<00:02:22.760> used

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
that this is just heavier than I'm used

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.250 
that this is just heavier than I'm used
to

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
to

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.020 
to
that's<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.890> reason<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.280> was<00:02:25.370> dropping<00:02:25.820> down

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
that's the reason it was dropping down

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.910 
that's the reason it was dropping down
because<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.390> wasn't<00:02:26.600> throwing<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.530> hard<00:02:27.739> enough

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
because I wasn't throwing it hard enough

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.540 
because I wasn't throwing it hard enough
but<00:02:28.519> in<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.820> second<00:02:29.330> series<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.900> Clips<00:02:30.550> you're

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
but in the second series of Clips you're

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.699 
but in the second series of Clips you're
going<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.760> see<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:31.970> do<00:02:32.090> much<00:02:32.480> better<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.410> reason

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
going to see I do much better the reason

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.259 
going to see I do much better the reason
for<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:33.950> is<00:02:34.220> because<00:02:34.250> I<00:02:34.489> changed<00:02:34.910> up<00:02:35.060> my

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
for that is because I changed up my

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.350 
for that is because I changed up my
technique<00:02:35.900> in<00:02:36.170> these<00:02:36.799> clips<00:02:37.239> instead<00:02:38.239> of

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
technique in these clips instead of

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.120 
technique in these clips instead of
throwing<00:02:38.840> with<00:02:39.019> my<00:02:39.170> throwing<00:02:39.620> hand<00:02:39.830> in<00:02:39.980> the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
throwing with my throwing hand in the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.610 
throwing with my throwing hand in the
lead<00:02:40.400> my<00:02:41.060> throwing<00:02:41.540> hand<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.140> rear

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
lead my throwing hand is to the rear

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.509 
lead my throwing hand is to the rear
this<00:02:43.220> allows<00:02:43.610> me<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.320> rotate<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.799> shoulder

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
this allows me to rotate the shoulder

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.199 
this allows me to rotate the shoulder
into<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:47.000> more<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.630> get<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.870> little<00:02:48.250> more<00:02:49.250> waist

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
into it more to get a little more waist

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.310 
into it more to get a little more waist
rotation<00:02:50.690> into<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.620> basically<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.700> generate

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
rotation into it basically to generate

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.350 
rotation into it basically to generate
more<00:02:54.320> force<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:55.010> throw<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.459> harder<00:02:55.910> which

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
more force and throw it harder which

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.880 
more force and throw it harder which
obviously<00:02:56.810> makes<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.320> trajectory

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
obviously makes the trajectory

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.880 
obviously makes the trajectory
straighter<00:02:58.340> alright<00:02:59.180> so<00:02:59.420> check<00:02:59.450> out<00:02:59.900> session

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
straighter alright so check out session

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.020 
straighter alright so check out session
number<00:03:01.040> two<00:03:02.230> throwing<00:03:03.230> this<00:03:03.790> harder<00:03:04.790> and

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
number two throwing this harder and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:35.740 
number two throwing this harder and
straighter

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.240 

okay<00:03:36.750> YouTube<00:03:36.959> hope<00:03:37.379> you<00:03:37.530> like<00:03:37.709> that

black ego yeah you can but your it's

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:46.339 
black ego yeah you can but your it's
going<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.840> be<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.930> little<00:03:46.200> more<00:03:46.290> challenging

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
going to be a little more challenging

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.160 
going to be a little more challenging
than<00:03:47.190> most<00:03:48.000> traditional<00:03:48.180> Hawks<00:03:48.840> you're<00:03:49.050> going

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
than most traditional Hawks you're going

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.809 
than most traditional Hawks you're going
to<00:03:49.260> have<00:03:49.349> to<00:03:49.500> throw<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.190> harder<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:52.819> basically

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
to have to throw it harder and basically

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.860 
to have to throw it harder and basically
I<00:03:54.480> would<00:03:54.900> rate<00:03:55.349> it<00:03:55.379> as<00:03:55.730> medium<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:57.120> medium<00:03:57.540> hard

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
I would rate it as medium to medium hard

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.630 
I would rate it as medium to medium hard
in<00:03:58.220> difficulty<00:03:59.330> relative<00:04:01.129> to<00:04:02.129> most<00:04:02.280> other

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
in difficulty relative to most other

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.050 
in difficulty relative to most other
Hawks<00:04:03.030> right<00:04:03.750> but<00:04:03.959> yeah<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:05.310> can<00:04:05.549> throw<00:04:05.879> it

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
Hawks right but yeah you can throw it

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.720 
Hawks right but yeah you can throw it
just<00:04:06.720> takes<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:07.049> little<00:04:07.170> practice<00:04:07.799> hope<00:04:08.610> you
