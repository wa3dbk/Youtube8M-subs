a<00:00:44.749> vending<00:00:44.929> machine<00:00:45.350> for<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:45.710> long<00:00:45.890> I<00:00:45.949> had<00:00:46.370> it

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
a vending machine for so long I had it

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.040 
a vending machine for so long I had it
how<00:00:46.670> did<00:00:46.819> you<00:00:46.909> work<00:00:47.030> it<00:00:47.210> how<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:47.359> do<00:00:47.539> it<00:00:47.659> well

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
how did you work it how to do it well

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.329 
how did you work it how to do it well
this<00:00:48.319> is<00:00:48.469> the<00:00:48.530> only<00:00:48.620> machine<00:00:48.800> of<00:00:49.039> its<00:00:49.129> kind

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
this is the only machine of its kind

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.189 
this is the only machine of its kind
being<00:00:49.670> dual<00:00:49.940> zone<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.420> by<00:00:50.539> dual<00:00:50.719> zone<00:00:50.960> what<00:00:51.109> we

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
being dual zone and by dual zone what we

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.719 
being dual zone and by dual zone what we
mean<00:00:51.379> is<00:00:51.620> there's<00:00:51.800> four<00:00:52.010> shelves<00:00:52.280> of<00:00:52.489> frozen

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
mean is there's four shelves of frozen

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.180 
mean is there's four shelves of frozen
two<00:00:53.479> shelves<00:00:53.839> are<00:00:53.929> refrigerated<00:00:54.170> it<00:00:54.920> can<00:00:55.069> be

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
two shelves are refrigerated it can be

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.770 
two shelves are refrigerated it can be
reconfigured<00:00:55.550> for<00:00:55.879> whatever<00:00:56.179> you<00:00:56.389> want<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:56.659> do

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
reconfigured for whatever you want to do

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.629 
reconfigured for whatever you want to do
but<00:00:56.989> right<00:00:57.170> now<00:00:57.319> we've<00:00:57.499> got<00:00:57.679> four<00:00:57.920> frozen<00:00:58.489> and

00:00:58.629 --> 00:00:58.639 
but right now we've got four frozen and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:00.819 
but right now we've got four frozen and
two<00:00:58.699> refrigerated<00:00:59.389> okay<00:00:59.839> the<00:01:00.260> real<00:01:00.559> key<00:01:00.799> is

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
two refrigerated okay the real key is

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.500 
two refrigerated okay the real key is
controlling<00:01:01.429> the<00:01:01.519> temperature<00:01:01.819> there's

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
controlling the temperature there's

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.719 
controlling the temperature there's
actually<00:01:02.899> a<00:01:02.929> barrier<00:01:03.440> zone<00:01:03.710> right<00:01:03.979> here<00:01:04.010> that

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
actually a barrier zone right here that

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.370 
actually a barrier zone right here that
using<00:01:05.180> a<00:01:05.299> concept<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.840> heating<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:06.200> cooling

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
using a concept of heating and cooling

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.710 
using a concept of heating and cooling
can<00:01:07.130> keep<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.549> zones<00:01:07.790> within<00:01:08.120> two<00:01:08.270> degrees<00:01:08.390> of

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
can keep the zones within two degrees of

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.749 
can keep the zones within two degrees of
each<00:01:08.810> other<00:01:08.990> fantastic<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.280> of<00:01:10.369> course<00:01:10.579> in

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
each other fantastic and of course in

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.429 
each other fantastic and of course in
the<00:01:10.850> US<00:01:11.119> I'm<00:01:11.360> sure<00:01:11.600> that<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:11.840> lot<00:01:12.140> of<00:01:12.229> places

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
the US I'm sure that a lot of places

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.230 
the US I'm sure that a lot of places
have<00:01:12.710> these<00:01:12.890> bait<00:01:13.189> vending<00:01:13.670> machines<00:01:14.000> you

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240
