 quality really pile that finally a 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.570
 perfect stove what are you going to see a 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.369
 little little himer voice in the video it's 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.740
 as if you had your farming on 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.710
 your screen and that it was you who 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.040
 July because there you know very 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.440
 although with your screen at you on 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.570
 farming and when I do it is hardly 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.039
 followed all that in hd but sometimes that 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.619
 pixelate a little bit and now 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:37.250
 five pixels and reads rap all thanks to 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.770
 this 2160p simply 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.479
 so I tell myself can start part 1 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.250
 you can see and they are con and 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.429
 on haagensen you can see that it's 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.920
 really just gorgeous 1.5 at these 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:54.319
 sailboats it's really hop really 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.319
 very very beautiful 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.789
 in any case the less I find is so a 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.810
 zoom here now obviously this 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.040
 is not a little bit on your side 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.219
 you really have connection of 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.650
 really threatens the little hungry 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.840
 really very this connection I you 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:15.120
 I do not recommend a meter in 2100 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:18.660
 60 but well here it is here I go in 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.130
 a tractor and really see it 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.170
 really like if you were on the game 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.190
 have bent you're playing in ultra 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.930
 because those who do not play in 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.110
 ultra low and limit their north tower 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.910
 their own game and a quality and less 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.370
 good on their own game that on the 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.920
 video to me so that was really what 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.180
 I wanted to send you 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.740
 it's been a long time trying to do that 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.360
 and I finally know how to do it but 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.670
 frankly I'm really very very 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.220
 content and hence safe as a software 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.010
 blow live it will not be in 1440 around 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.870
 1160 and cranberries video wins 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.980
 obviously auxonne will not be so so goes 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.970
 it was a little bit of a video 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.870
 test a little bit show you all that 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.190
 so here is a little bit rolled in 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.120
 tractor one can go frankly that 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.450
 the quality is nickel 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.450
 frankly beautiful 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.890
 frankly it's really very 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.890
 very beautiful 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.000
 and it's going nickel 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.599
 so see the friends of frankly I 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.950
 would be the first youtuber business of 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.200
 2160 maximois sofa round 2013 because 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.250
 usually except farming every month 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.300
 endless videos mine whether it's in 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.989
 English or French 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:35.470
 I saw them in 1080p maximum and here 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.180
 we have not only 1440 is also 2160 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.560

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.030
 happy to be the first to do that 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.069

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.170
