working on this painting now and just
letting<00:00:31.380> things<00:00:31.890> dry<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.850> taking<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.239> break

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
letting things dry just taking a break

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.670 
letting things dry just taking a break
but<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:35.100> was<00:00:35.850> thinking<00:00:36.300> I've<00:00:36.870> been<00:00:37.050> doing<00:00:37.320> my

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
but I was thinking I've been doing my

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.470 
but I was thinking I've been doing my
paintings<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.100> little<00:00:38.280> bit<00:00:38.399> different<00:00:38.790> lately

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
paintings a little bit different lately

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.740 
paintings a little bit different lately
I've<00:00:40.200> been<00:00:40.440> adding<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.129> lot<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> texture<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.420> my

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
I've been adding a lot of texture to my

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.069 
I've been adding a lot of texture to my
paintings<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.410> used<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.520> hate<00:00:44.700> adding<00:00:45.629> texture

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
paintings I used to hate adding texture

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.139 
paintings I used to hate adding texture
I'm<00:00:46.590> not<00:00:46.710> sure<00:00:46.890> why<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.129> always<00:00:47.399> wanted<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.910> just

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
I'm not sure why I always wanted to just

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.720 
I'm not sure why I always wanted to just
make<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.539> really<00:00:48.690> flat<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.469> really<00:00:50.250> blended

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
make it really flat and really blended

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.400 
make it really flat and really blended
so<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.180> didn't<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.480> any<00:00:51.629> bumps<00:00:52.110> or<00:00:52.230> anything

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
so you didn't see any bumps or anything

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.770 
so you didn't see any bumps or anything
like<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:54.350> but<00:00:55.789> my<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:57.030> trapped<00:00:57.329> out<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.570> New

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
like that but my are trapped out of New

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.459 
like that but my are trapped out of New
York<00:00:58.309> was<00:00:59.309> telling<00:00:59.609> me<00:00:59.760> once<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.719> lot<00:01:01.379> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
York was telling me once that a lot of

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.959 
York was telling me once that a lot of
times<00:01:01.649> when<00:01:01.859> people<00:01:01.890> go<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.219> buy<00:01:02.460> paintings

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
times when people go to buy paintings

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.840 
times when people go to buy paintings
they<00:01:03.750> look<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:04.949> how<00:01:05.100> much<00:01:05.250> paint<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.729> on

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
they look to see how much paint is on

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.929 
they look to see how much paint is on
the<00:01:05.939> canvas<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.770> kind<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> determined<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the canvas and kind of determined that a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.560 
the canvas and kind of determined that a
painting<00:01:09.689> has<00:01:09.960> more<00:01:10.229> value<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:11.330> there's<00:01:12.330> more

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
painting has more value if there's more

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.140 
painting has more value if there's more
paint<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> canvas<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.070> got<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> lot

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
paint on the canvas or if it's got a lot

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.560 
paint on the canvas or if it's got a lot
more<00:01:15.299> texture<00:01:15.659> which<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.500> find<00:01:16.770> interesting

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
more texture which I find interesting

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.940 
more texture which I find interesting
because<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.840> look<00:01:18.900> at<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.380> lot<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> old

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
because if you look at a lot of the old

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.359 
because if you look at a lot of the old
masters<00:01:20.310> from<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> Renaissance<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:23.070> things

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
masters from the Renaissance and things

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.039 
masters from the Renaissance and things
like<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.549> everything<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.750> ever<00:01:24.869> seen

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
like that everything have you ever seen

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.780 
like that everything have you ever seen
one<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.200> their<00:01:25.350> paintings<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.070> glass

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
one of their paintings it's like glass

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.850 
one of their paintings it's like glass
there's<00:01:27.299> no<00:01:27.570> texture<00:01:28.229> at<00:01:28.380> all<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.740> really

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
there's no texture at all it's really

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.230 
there's no texture at all it's really
really<00:01:29.189> smooth<00:01:31.340> but<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.610> asked<00:01:32.850> me<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
really smooth but so you asked me you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.969 
really smooth but so you asked me you
know<00:01:33.390> would<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.689> try<00:01:34.020> painting<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.710> some

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
know would you try painting with some

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.630 
know would you try painting with some
texture<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:36.200> at<00:01:37.200> first<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.560> said<00:01:37.619> no<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.340> then

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
texture and at first I said no and then

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.130 
texture and at first I said no and then
I<00:01:38.939> said<00:01:39.299> I'll<00:01:39.450> try<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.950> but<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> that's<00:01:42.960> what

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
I said I'll try it but so that's what

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.300 
I said I'll try it but so that's what
I'm<00:01:43.200> doing<00:01:43.500> I'm<00:01:43.649> doing<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.009> little<00:01:44.100> more

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
I'm doing I'm doing a little more

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.340 
I'm doing I'm doing a little more
texture<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.850> I'm<00:01:44.909> actually<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.420> kind<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.170> like

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
texture and I'm actually I kind of like

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.980 
texture and I'm actually I kind of like
it<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:47.130> kind<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.399> neat<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.780> go<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it it's kind of neat to go up to the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.780 
it it's kind of neat to go up to the
painting<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.680> kind<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.549> feel<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
painting and you can kind of feel the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.499 
painting and you can kind of feel the
texture<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:52.140> canvas<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.149> it<00:01:54.149> does<00:01:54.329> give

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
texture on the canvas and it does give

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.160 
texture on the canvas and it does give
it<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.840> different<00:01:55.259> quality<00:01:56.299> kind<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> 3d

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
it a different quality kind of like a 3d

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.120 
it a different quality kind of like a 3d
sculpture<00:01:58.619> effect<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.820> a<00:02:00.060> way<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.950> can<00:02:02.100> see

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
sculpture effect in a way and I can see

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.020 
sculpture effect in a way and I can see
the<00:02:02.880> point<00:02:03.119> where<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:05.130> might<00:02:05.430> look<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.880> it

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
the point where it might look like it

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.700 
the point where it might look like it
has<00:02:06.180> more<00:02:06.479> value<00:02:06.659> because<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.079> was<00:02:07.229> more<00:02:07.409> paint

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
has more value because I was more paint

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.089 
has more value because I was more paint
on<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.729> I'm<00:02:09.420> still<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.050> still<00:02:10.410> really<00:02:10.649> would

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
on it but I'm still I still really would

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.449 
on it but I'm still I still really would
rather<00:02:11.250> paint

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
rather paint

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.640 
rather paint
nice<00:02:13.030> flat<00:02:13.420> paintings<00:02:13.930> but<00:02:14.080> something<00:02:14.560> I'm

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
nice flat paintings but something I'm

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.020 
nice flat paintings but something I'm
experimenting<00:02:15.129> with<00:02:16.560> but<00:02:17.560> I'm<00:02:17.650> using<00:02:18.030> this

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
experimenting with but I'm using this

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.270 
experimenting with but I'm using this
golden<00:02:19.599> gel<00:02:20.290> medium<00:02:20.680> because<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.980> paint<00:02:21.190> with

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
golden gel medium because I paint with

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.610 
golden gel medium because I paint with
acrylics<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.260> acrylics<00:02:23.260> dry<00:02:23.349> really<00:02:23.830> flat<00:02:24.190> so

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
acrylics and acrylics dry really flat so

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.930 
acrylics and acrylics dry really flat so
you<00:02:26.620> kind<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.890> need<00:02:27.069> something<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.819> add

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
you kind of need something to add

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.170 
you kind of need something to add
texture<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.500> painting<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.069> so<00:02:31.000> I've<00:02:31.090> been

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
texture to the painting and so I've been

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.640 
texture to the painting and so I've been
using<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.150> heavy<00:02:34.390> gel<00:02:34.870> medium

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
using this it's the heavy gel medium

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.870 
using this it's the heavy gel medium
which<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.250> pretty<00:02:36.459> cool<00:02:36.760> it's<00:02:37.090> just<00:02:38.640> see<00:02:39.640> like

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
which is pretty cool it's just see like

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.789 
which is pretty cool it's just see like
grab<00:02:40.180> my<00:02:40.360> pallet<00:02:41.019> knife<00:02:41.170> here<00:02:41.410> one<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.680> them

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
grab my pallet knife here one of them

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.039 
grab my pallet knife here one of them
it's<00:02:42.730> just<00:02:42.819> kind<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.239> like<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.390> almost<00:02:45.720> like<00:02:46.720> a

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
it's just kind of like a almost like a

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.699 
it's just kind of like a almost like a
paste<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.799> guess<00:02:47.950> it's<00:02:48.130> gel<00:02:48.549> but<00:02:49.480> in<00:02:50.019> it<00:02:50.200> dries

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
paste I guess it's gel but in it dries

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.059 
paste I guess it's gel but in it dries
clear<00:02:51.280> so<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.329> have<00:02:53.230> paint<00:02:53.500> all<00:02:53.650> through<00:02:53.890> mine

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
clear so I have paint all through mine

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.289 
clear so I have paint all through mine
but<00:02:55.030> when<00:02:55.840> you<00:02:55.930> mix<00:02:56.079> it<00:02:56.230> in<00:02:56.349> with<00:02:56.470> your<00:02:56.709> paint

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
but when you mix it in with your paint

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.970 
but when you mix it in with your paint
it<00:02:58.299> takes<00:02:58.630> on<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.019> same<00:02:59.200> color<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.829> does

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
it takes on the same color it does

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.380 
it takes on the same color it does
lighten<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.459> little<00:03:00.670> bit<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.940> says<00:03:01.060> it's<00:03:01.239> not

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
lighten it a little bit it says it's not

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.690 
lighten it a little bit it says it's not
supposed<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:01.810> but<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.709> does<00:03:02.950> lighten<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.459> a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
supposed to but it does lighten it a

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.890 
supposed to but it does lighten it a
little<00:03:04.360> bit<00:03:05.010> but<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.099> can<00:03:06.250> extend<00:03:06.780> like<00:03:07.780> if

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
little bit but you can extend like if

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.630 
little bit but you can extend like if
you<00:03:07.959> have<00:03:08.079> a<00:03:08.110> really<00:03:08.380> expensive<00:03:08.680> paint<00:03:09.190> like

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
you have a really expensive paint like

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.080 
you have a really expensive paint like
cadmium<00:03:10.390> red<00:03:10.840> or<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.890> true<00:03:12.790> cerulean<00:03:13.690> blue

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
cadmium red or a true cerulean blue

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.550 
cadmium red or a true cerulean blue
those<00:03:16.090> are<00:03:16.209> expensive<00:03:16.660> paints<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.139> can<00:03:17.170> mix

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
those are expensive paints you can mix

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.110 
those are expensive paints you can mix
in<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.799> medium<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.370> make<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.670> paint<00:03:18.880> go

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
in the medium and make the paint go

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.479 
in the medium and make the paint go
further<00:03:19.810> or<00:03:20.260> you<00:03:20.410> can<00:03:20.560> make<00:03:20.739> it<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.340> have

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
further or you can make it so you have

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.960 
further or you can make it so you have
texture<00:03:21.850> because<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.389> it<00:03:22.780> dries<00:03:23.079> with<00:03:23.290> Peaks

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
texture because it it dries with Peaks

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.580 
texture because it it dries with Peaks
which<00:03:24.970> means<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.420> just<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:26.019> know<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.200> stands

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
which means it just you know it stands

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.289 
which means it just you know it stands
out<00:03:26.799> from<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.010> canvas<00:03:27.340> rather<00:03:27.730> than<00:03:27.970> drying

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
out from the canvas rather than drying

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.979 
out from the canvas rather than drying
flat<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:30.670> I've<00:03:31.090> been<00:03:31.239> using<00:03:31.389> that<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.930> I'm

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
flat so I've been using that and I'm

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.479 
flat so I've been using that and I'm
working<00:03:32.290> on<00:03:32.350> this<00:03:32.500> painting<00:03:32.889> now<00:03:33.010> trying<00:03:33.459> to
