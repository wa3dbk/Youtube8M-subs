00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.220
 I have my first boar 1963 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.470
 I lured with an army created lord 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.570
 just have the grunt of a pig 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.800
 Mimicking one's mouth just like one gets 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.480
 little child says how does that make 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.359
 Pig then makes the little kid 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.340
 So I did that there at that time 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.110
 not so easy as I have that 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.970
 imitated by the ruler and the 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:43.809
 Sounds like this is this famous 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:45.280
 eifel created here are two sows of 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.050
 the five before disappeared in the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.030
 cover are two sound out again and 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.530
 then I experienced one of them 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.820
 I knew that you were always enticing 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.010
 although he accompanied me 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.460
 a professional hunter could only be told 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.649
 with corn lure but hereby you could 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.620
 also because I now the Hirschhof in the 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.160
 I do not have the hand to agree 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.250
 because I have so much to talk about 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.420
 I 'm following the principle of Graf Georg 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.929
 the mÃ¼nster has a searching gentleman 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.920
 schmidt wrong and has so easy 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:22.179
 and the long drawn ah in pushed 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.929
 that does not sound bad 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.929
 For example 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.869
 that's so middle of the fifth head 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.430
 maybe and a sprouts tens can 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.000
 not every same capitals ago 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.640
 shoot 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.280
 but we have on our dvd too 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.310
 after that overlap where the konrad is 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.560
 the stag dad then calls me on this call 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.470
 responds and the one on the eighth 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:56.740
 he should go that necessarily 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:02:02.860
 then look this book fast 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:06.310
 spoken one can also irritate with 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.000
 otherwise this is absolute 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.220
 to tackle a stag properly 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.290
 in the brunft you know that karl 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.970
 Wild can spoil so much and it will 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.600
 Mostly broken more than us good 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.600
 is done
