00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.889 
players are playing with a racquet head
that's<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.550> little<00:00:35.760> too<00:00:35.969> small<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.360> their<00:00:36.690> game

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the best players in the world are

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.799 
the best players in the world are
playing<00:00:38.910> with<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> hundred<00:00:39.420> square<00:00:39.660> inch

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.369 
racquet and I got to think that I'm not
as<00:00:42.120> consistent<00:00:42.719> as<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.899> best<00:00:43.079> I'm<00:00:43.230> nowhere

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
as consistent as the best I'm nowhere

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.869 
as consistent as the best I'm nowhere
near<00:00:43.530> as<00:00:43.920> consistent<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> best<00:00:44.670> players

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
near as consistent as the best players

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.479 
near as consistent as the best players
in<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> world<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.660> know<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.190> 99%<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
in the world I know that 99% of the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.770 
in the world I know that 99% of the
people<00:00:47.640> are<00:00:47.879> not<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.210> be<00:00:48.300> anywhere<00:00:48.629> near

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
people are not going to be anywhere near

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.840 
people are not going to be anywhere near
that<00:00:48.840> consistent<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.700> all

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
that consistent and I like to have all

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.880 
that consistent and I like to have all
the<00:00:50.969> forgiveness<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.530> you

hit any racket dead center in the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.290 
hit any racket dead center in the
strings<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.140> gonna<00:00:55.320> perform<00:00:55.800> great<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:57.149> as

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
strings it's gonna perform great but as

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.060 
strings it's gonna perform great but as
you<00:00:57.449> start<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> get<00:00:57.870> off<00:00:58.079> center<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.620> maybe<00:00:58.890> hit

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
you start to get off center so maybe hit

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.470 
you start to get off center so maybe hit
it<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> little<00:00:59.280> bit<00:00:59.489> more<00:00:59.789> toward<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> frame

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
it a little bit more toward the frame

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.510 
it a little bit more toward the frame
when<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> smaller<00:01:01.770> headed<00:01:02.129> racquet

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
when you have a smaller headed racquet

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.759 
when you have a smaller headed racquet
the<00:01:02.910> frame<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.390> actually<00:01:03.600> gonna<00:01:03.899> twist<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.589> lot

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the frame is actually gonna twist a lot

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.500 
the frame is actually gonna twist a lot
more<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.400> as<00:01:05.519> you're<00:01:05.670> making<00:01:05.760> contact<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
more so as you're making contact if you

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.789 
more so as you're making contact if you
hit<00:01:06.659> toward<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> bottom<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> racket<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
hit toward the bottom of the racket the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.260 
hit toward the bottom of the racket the
heads<00:01:07.979> gonna<00:01:08.100> twist<00:01:08.460> down<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> little<00:01:08.939> bit<00:01:09.090> more

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
heads gonna twist down a little bit more

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.670 
heads gonna twist down a little bit more
same<00:01:09.840> thing<00:01:09.990> if<00:01:10.080> you're<00:01:10.170> hitting<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> top

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
same thing if you're hitting in the top

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.440 
same thing if you're hitting in the top
of<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.920> racket<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.700> really<00:01:11.939> gonna<00:01:12.060> twist

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
of the racket it's really gonna twist

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.730 
of the racket it's really gonna twist
because<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.140> doesn't<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.590> much

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
because it doesn't have as much

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.859 
because it doesn't have as much
perimeter<00:01:14.340> weighting<00:01:14.729> because<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.540> racket

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
perimeter weighting because the racket

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
perimeter weighting because the racket
head<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.320> large<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> hundred<00:01:17.520> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
head in is large with a hundred and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.429 
head in is large with a hundred and
fifteen<00:01:18.030> square<00:01:18.240> inch<00:01:18.509> racket<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
fifteen square inch racket like this I

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.469 
fifteen square inch racket like this I
think<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> average<00:01:20.460> player<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
think for the average player that the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.179 
think for the average player that the
beginning<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.290> low<00:01:22.439> intermediate<00:01:22.799> player

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
beginning to low intermediate player

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.160 
beginning to low intermediate player
this<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.460> fantastic<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.780> gonna<00:01:24.900> give<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
this is fantastic it's gonna give you a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.960 
this is fantastic it's gonna give you a
lot<00:01:25.320> more<00:01:25.350> forgiveness<00:01:25.860> when<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.729> hit<00:01:26.850> those

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
lot more forgiveness when you hit those

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.030 
lot more forgiveness when you hit those
off-center<00:01:27.450> shots<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.049> all<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:28.470> it's

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040

people should be playing in 105 up to

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.690 
people should be playing in 105 up to
115<00:01:58.259> square<00:01:58.560> inch<00:01:58.710> head<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.130> that's<00:01:59.460> exactly

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
115 square inch head and that's exactly

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.819 
115 square inch head and that's exactly
what<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.420> another<00:02:01.409> thing<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.799> really

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
what this is another thing that I really

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.350 
what this is another thing that I really
like<00:02:02.159> about<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.490> racket<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.270> very

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
like about this racket is that it's very

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.539 
like about this racket is that it's very
lightweight<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.860> for<00:02:05.040> people<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.310> don't

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
lightweight so for people that don't

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.370 
lightweight so for people that don't
have<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.729> lot<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.030> strength<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.899> maybe<00:02:07.110> can't

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
have a lot of strength that maybe can't

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.660 
have a lot of strength that maybe can't
swing<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.950> heavier<00:02:08.420> 230<00:02:09.420> or<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.750> 330<00:02:10.500> gram<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:11.039> 350

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
swing a heavier 230 or a 330 gram to 350

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.470 
swing a heavier 230 or a 330 gram to 350
gram<00:02:11.879> racket

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
gram racket

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.360 
gram racket
like<00:02:13.380> you're<00:02:13.530> gonna<00:02:13.620> see<00:02:13.830> with<00:02:13.950> most<00:02:14.099> of<00:02:14.280> the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
like you're gonna see with most of the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.140 
like you're gonna see with most of the
pros<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.540> only<00:02:16.459> 277<00:02:17.459> grams<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.940> think

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
pros this is only 277 grams I think

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.809 
pros this is only 277 grams I think
strung<00:02:18.540> wait<00:02:18.989> so<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.739> very<00:02:19.950> light<00:02:20.250> racket

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
strung wait so it's a very light racket

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.089 
strung wait so it's a very light racket
but<00:02:21.569> what<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.780> like<00:02:22.050> about<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.709> still<00:02:22.950> has

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
but what I like about it is it still has

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.920 
but what I like about it is it still has
a<00:02:23.130> lot<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.400> weight<00:02:23.640> up<00:02:23.940> in<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.300> head<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.810> has

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
a lot of weight up in the head so it has

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.900 
a lot of weight up in the head so it has
a<00:02:24.959> higher<00:02:25.260> swing<00:02:25.680> weight<00:02:25.920> which<00:02:26.459> means<00:02:26.730> you're

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
a higher swing weight which means you're

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.820 
a higher swing weight which means you're
gonna<00:02:26.970> get<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.239> lot<00:02:27.390> more<00:02:27.450> power<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.650> what<00:02:28.800> I

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
gonna get a lot more power so what I

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.490 
gonna get a lot more power so what I
mean<00:02:29.069> by<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.280> is<00:02:29.750> where<00:02:30.750> your<00:02:30.930> racket<00:02:31.319> weight

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
mean by this is where your racket weight

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.290 
mean by this is where your racket weight
is<00:02:31.620> distributed<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.459> going<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.790> have<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.940> lot<00:02:33.180> to

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
is distributed is going to have a lot to

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.630 
is distributed is going to have a lot to
do<00:02:33.420> with<00:02:33.510> how<00:02:33.660> much<00:02:33.780> power<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.350> racket<00:02:34.680> has<00:02:34.830> so

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
do with how much power the racket has so

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.910 
do with how much power the racket has so
if<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:35.910> racket<00:02:36.239> is<00:02:36.300> 277<00:02:37.110> grams<00:02:37.590> that's<00:02:37.770> a

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
if this racket is 277 grams that's a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.890 
if this racket is 277 grams that's a
very<00:02:38.100> lightweight<00:02:38.370> racket<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.630> lot<00:02:39.870> of

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
very lightweight racket but a lot of

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.080 
very lightweight racket but a lot of
that<00:02:40.140> weight<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.560> up<00:02:40.739> here<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.400> tip<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.849> the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
that weight is up here in the tip of the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.600 
that weight is up here in the tip of the
head<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:43.050> means<00:02:43.230> as<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.650> swing<00:02:44.010> there's

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
head and that means as you swing there's

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.210 
head and that means as you swing there's
a<00:02:44.700> lot<00:02:44.880> of<00:02:45.030> momentum<00:02:45.470> kicking<00:02:46.470> out<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.010> tip

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
a lot of momentum kicking out in the tip

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.770 
a lot of momentum kicking out in the tip
of<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.400> racket<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.000> that's<00:02:48.390> going<00:02:48.569> to<00:02:48.630> get

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
of this racket and that's going to get

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.300 
of this racket and that's going to get
you<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.930> lot<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.260> speed<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.860> lot<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:50.069> power

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
you a lot of speed and a lot of power

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.039 
you a lot of speed and a lot of power
doing<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:50.760> that's<00:02:51.030> even<00:02:51.600> though<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.019> a

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
doing this that's even though this is a

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.900 
doing this that's even though this is a
lightweight<00:02:52.350> racket<00:02:53.010> because<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.640> swing

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
lightweight racket because the swing

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.070 
lightweight racket because the swing
weight<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.330> pretty<00:02:54.510> high

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
weight is pretty high

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.900
