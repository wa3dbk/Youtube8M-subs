takedown<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.769> like<00:03:58.950> I<00:03:59.070> said<00:03:59.130> it's<00:03:59.370> going<00:03:59.549> to

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
takedown and like I said it's going to

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.060 
takedown and like I said it's going to
overlap<00:04:00.150> with<00:04:00.180> 7<00:04:00.570> &amp;<00:04:00.690> 7<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:01.230> anything<00:04:01.890> that<00:04:01.920> I

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
overlap with 7 &amp; 7 so anything that I

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.699 
overlap with 7 &amp; 7 so anything that I
read<00:04:02.430> between<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.880> 27th<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.140> 2nd<00:04:04.590> I'm

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
read between the 27th and the 2nd I'm

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.770 
read between the 27th and the 2nd I'm
going<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.160> count<00:04:05.370> as<00:04:05.670> one<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.269> seven<00:04:06.480> books

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
going to count as one of the seven books

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.449 
going to count as one of the seven books
for<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.109> 7<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:07.530> 7<00:04:07.890> read-a-thon

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
for the 7 and 7 read-a-thon

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.620 
for the 7 and 7 read-a-thon
obviously<00:04:08.910> I'm<00:04:09.000> gonna<00:04:09.090> have<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.420> read<00:04:09.600> a

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
obviously I'm gonna have to read a

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.180 
obviously I'm gonna have to read a
little<00:04:09.930> bit<00:04:10.170> more<00:04:10.410> than<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.769> books<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.100> are

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
little bit more than the books that are

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.160 
little bit more than the books that are
behind<00:04:11.700> me<00:04:11.820> in<00:04:12.150> order<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.630> achieve<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:12.989> goal

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
behind me in order to achieve that goal

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.470 
behind me in order to achieve that goal
so<00:04:13.350> I<00:04:13.980> have<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.280> few<00:04:14.519> other<00:04:14.549> books<00:04:14.850> picked<00:04:15.269> out

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
so I have a few other books picked out

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.360 
so I have a few other books picked out
and<00:04:15.750> whatever<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.440> decide<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.890> read<00:04:17.190> at<00:04:17.340> that

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
and whatever I decide to read at that

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.759 
and whatever I decide to read at that
time<00:04:17.789> I<00:04:18.090> will<00:04:18.329> read<00:04:18.539> that<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:19.049> basically<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.590> so
