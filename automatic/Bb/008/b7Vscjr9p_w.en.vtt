00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.890
 This is my theme is this 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.299
 Can be attacked continuously even if moved greatly 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.369
 How to move jumping with regard to how to jump 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.710
 Explanation of what kind of movement is good 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.260
 If I can hit it in a row immediately after jumping 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.670
 I would like to do it with the goal of 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.070
 The practice method this time is a roundabout 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.000
 I'm a big vacancy, so I'll jump well 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.540
 I'm a case I jump here 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.880
 I went around the back and next 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.620
 After that, send me one to middle 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.790
 Because I jumped once and got on my weight 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.410
 I think it is difficult to attack continuously 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.690
 The ball that has come to this middle level is firmly on the forehand 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.860
 I think it would be ok if you can hit Gern 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.600
 If you're waiting to hit here in the foreground 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.930
 It is easy to react even when you come back more distant 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.010
 The attitude that this middle can hit is 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.100
 When I come back though I can not do it 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.810
 I think it's so tight, so I'm going to the middle 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.420
 I'll be able to hit continuously after being caught 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.310
 I would like to practice aiming for such a place 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.970
 Then please watch the play video 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.350
 I saw you a bad example ahead of time 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.869
 After jumping and hitting in the bad example 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.049
 My weight is completely on my right 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.259
 I can't move as soon as my weight gets on the right 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.400
 I get stuck even if I try to move 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.170
 Just like riding back 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.920
 It is a situation that I have no choice but to put out my hand 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.000
 Be careful not to do this 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.810
 I saw a good example now 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.840
 In the case of a good example, the right foot is the last after hitting 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.510
 Even though you are landing, your body's center of gravity is 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.010
 I feel like I'm riding on my left foot 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.129
 It is very important to ride on the left foot 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.650
 It's like a quick turn around by riding on the left foot 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.739
 You can start the movement 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.010
 Those who have repeatedly made repeated side jumps as an image 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.180
 I think there are people who don't 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.959
 I imagine the movement once a little 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.090
 I want it, but in the case of repeated side jumps 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.690
 If you make a movement that leaves the body's head centered 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.319
 I have heard that it will be very fast 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.879
 I think there is no, but the same is true 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.510
 Even after this jump and big movement 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.709
 It is the center of table tennis stand We leave the center of gravity in the center of table tennis stand 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.810
 The point is if I leave the center of gravity on my left foot 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.620
 I can jump back quickly 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.879
 I can go back and hit it soon 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.060
 If this gets on here I can not help anymore 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.599
 If you get on your right foot it is a form that you can not help 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.260
 Please be aware of this a little
