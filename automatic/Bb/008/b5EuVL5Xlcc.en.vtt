00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
softened whatever I can do that with

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.500 
softened whatever I can do that with
these<00:02:11.300> because<00:02:11.570> they're<00:02:11.810> about<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.290> same

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
these because they're about the same

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.630 
these because they're about the same
density<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:14.810> guess<00:02:15.250> but<00:02:16.250> if<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.520> were<00:02:16.610> doing

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
density I guess but if you were doing

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.160 
density I guess but if you were doing
onions<00:02:17.150> probably<00:02:17.570> want<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.720> put<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.930> onions

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
onions probably want to put the onions

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.220 
onions probably want to put the onions
in<00:02:18.320> before<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.340> softer<00:02:19.670> things<00:02:19.850> or<00:02:20.480> like<00:02:21.140> you

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
in before the softer things or like you

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.900 
in before the softer things or like you
could<00:02:21.380> even<00:02:21.500> do<00:02:21.650> broccoli<00:02:22.070> but<00:02:22.280> again<00:02:22.640> put

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
could even do broccoli but again put

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.550 
could even do broccoli but again put
that<00:02:23.060> in<00:02:23.210> before<00:02:23.570> you<00:02:23.900> put<00:02:24.050> in<00:02:24.140> something<00:02:24.470> like

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
that in before you put in something like

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.460 
that in before you put in something like
mushrooms<00:02:24.980> it's<00:02:25.220> softer<00:02:25.610> or<00:02:26.180> greens<00:02:26.840> you

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
mushrooms it's softer or greens you

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.840 
mushrooms it's softer or greens you
could<00:02:27.590> also<00:02:27.740> use<00:02:28.010> some<00:02:28.160> spinach<00:02:28.550> or<00:02:28.730> some

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
could also use some spinach or some

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.710 
could also use some spinach or some
chard<00:02:29.290> whatever<00:02:30.290> that's<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.770> beauty<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.130> it

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
chard whatever that's the beauty of it

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.540 
chard whatever that's the beauty of it
okay<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:32.780> these<00:02:33.050> are<00:02:33.230> all<00:02:33.380> getting<00:02:33.890> really

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
okay so these are all getting really

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.400 
okay so these are all getting really
soft<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:34.970> nice<00:02:35.150> I'm<00:02:35.450> gonna<00:02:35.630> turn<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.260> heat

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
soft and nice I'm gonna turn the heat

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.230 
soft and nice I'm gonna turn the heat
down<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.650> low<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:38.140> take<00:02:39.140> this<00:02:39.320> time<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:40.240> spread

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
down to low and take this time to spread

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.310 
down to low and take this time to spread
it<00:02:41.360> out<00:02:41.480> all<00:02:41.720> evenly<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.080> in<00:02:45.230> our

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
it out all evenly so that in our

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.160 
it out all evenly so that in our
finished<00:02:45.890> thing<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:47.060> know<00:02:47.180> it's<00:02:47.570> pretty<00:02:47.780> even

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
finished thing you know it's pretty even

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.590 
finished thing you know it's pretty even
okay<00:02:49.070> mix<00:02:49.400> up<00:02:49.520> our<00:02:49.640> little<00:02:50.000> egg<00:02:50.240> ease<00:02:50.420> again

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
okay mix up our little egg ease again

00:02:50.600 --> 00:03:02.440 
okay mix up our little egg ease again
well<00:02:51.530> bet<00:02:57.010> that<00:03:00.280> just<00:03:01.280> just<00:03:01.820> right<00:03:02.239> on<00:03:02.420> top

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
well bet that just just right on top

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.600 
well bet that just just right on top
like<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.470> if<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.739> got<00:03:03.920> in<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.160> uneven

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
egg under there but after like the first

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.220 
egg under there but after like the first
I<00:03:27.320> don't<00:03:28.040> know<00:03:28.570> sixty<00:03:29.570> seconds<00:03:29.930> or<00:03:30.019> so<00:03:30.200> you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
I don't know sixty seconds or so you

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.740 
I don't know sixty seconds or so you
want<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.560> just<00:03:30.709> kind<00:03:30.950> of<00:03:31.010> leave<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.280> alone<00:03:31.750> all

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
want to just kind of leave it alone all

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.949

right
so<00:03:33.170> this<00:03:33.320> is<00:03:33.470> getting<00:03:33.620> pretty<00:03:33.950> well<00:03:34.190> set

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
so this is getting pretty well set

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.090 
so this is getting pretty well set
around<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.600> edges<00:03:35.959> and<00:03:36.230> even<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.709> top<00:03:36.920> is

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
around the edges and even the top is

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.130 
around the edges and even the top is
pretty<00:03:37.280> good<00:03:37.400> I'm<00:03:37.670> gonna<00:03:37.790> turn<00:03:38.630> my<00:03:38.720> broiler<00:03:39.080> on

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
pretty good I'm gonna turn my broiler on

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.390 
pretty good I'm gonna turn my broiler on
because<00:03:39.440> that's<00:03:39.530> how<00:03:39.680> we're<00:03:39.800> gonna<00:03:39.920> finish<00:03:40.160> it

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
because that's how we're gonna finish it

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.070 
because that's how we're gonna finish it
and<00:03:40.489> just<00:03:40.640> let<00:03:40.760> this<00:03:40.880> sit<00:03:41.150> over<00:03:41.450> low<00:03:41.600> heat<00:03:41.630> for

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
and just let this sit over low heat for

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.620 
and just let this sit over low heat for
a<00:03:42.590> few<00:03:42.890> minutes<00:03:43.310> while<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.940> broiler<00:03:44.239> preheats

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
a few minutes while the broiler preheats

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.000 
a few minutes while the broiler preheats
and<00:03:44.840> then<00:03:44.930> we'll<00:03:45.050> all<00:03:45.140> finish<00:03:45.470> cooking<00:03:45.680> it<00:03:45.860> and

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
and then we'll all finish cooking it and

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.729 
and then we'll all finish cooking it and
then<00:03:46.100> we'll<00:03:46.340> eat<00:03:46.820> the<00:03:47.540> out<00:03:47.690> of<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:47.930> all

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
then we'll eat the out of it all

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.890 
then we'll eat the out of it all
right<00:03:48.890> just<00:03:49.310> put<00:03:49.670> that<00:03:49.850> under<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:50.720> broiler

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
right just put that under the broiler

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.100
