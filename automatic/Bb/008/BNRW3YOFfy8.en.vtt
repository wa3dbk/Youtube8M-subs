00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:06.859
 Hello Kitty This is the product to look at Lace Foam Pad Seven at 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.310
 is 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:17.030
 It's been a long time. 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:21.259
 The hs foam pad is simple to unseal for 7l t 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:24.349
 I need you to give me a little something about the pad pad Seven. 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:27.980
 Let's take one at a time from its open innovation 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:32.390
 Gas may not be able to design. 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:37.100
 4 If you look you could see that the Intel Inside yoge some point 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:41.629
 Well, once again, the noodles now look like 7m of blood. 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:46.879
 In other words, there is a contradiction in the nose and adapter usb 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:48.440
 And it 's in front of you. You can use it as a cradle . Give me the fact . 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.440
 I liked it. 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:58.539
 I think it will be more than nothing. 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.539
 More simply, it's basically a package like this. 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.100
 I'm sorry about the vacuum. 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:15.040
 In brief, 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.600
 The front is 7 inches ips anyway . Resolution is 1280 * 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.090
 800 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.840
 Then I got a dual speaker on the top and bottom on both sides of the yo-yo. 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.420
 this 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:33.070
 Sonic master who claims to shape or always emphasizes in the ace 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:37.640
 The hardware that can implement the solution 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:42.620
 What used slip square 1.2 MP camera 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.440
 And the indicator now has a 500-megapixel camera, hs mark. 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:51.140
 Oh why the power button 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:55.880
 Then two volume buttons and micro sd cards could'm cd itself 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:59.960
 4, the audio jack into this, like the iPhone yeogieda 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.220
 If you like me now big ppyo protrude reliever that can be attached to idealistic idealistic Cao 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.950
 He comes in. 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.190
 The size of fish oil 10 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:13.700
 It's a micro-worm. 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:17.720
 I do not think so. 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:22.459
 I think it's a little sophisticated. 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.050
 Uh buiIding so now briefly look jujeori thumb is that the silver jujeori 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.050
 silver 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.970
 The biggest feature is the home pad 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:37.400
 The biggest feature Air 7art getji only know after you see 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:40.880
 Yobark is also a product with Intel's popular chips 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.780
 Intel chip comes in and tells me what a great product 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.820
 But it could also be the fact I kid has to know the title and are 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.810
 It can is said to have a title 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:55.250
 Mobile devices that support billing 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:59.060
 It is the first in Korea . 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:03.560
 I mean, there's an Intel chip coming in. 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:08.870
 I have never been in Korea when I used smartphone or laptop. 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:13.730
 In 2, the foam pad 7art is now a form what the tablet is anyway 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:17.180
 Since the phone features may be referred to, also known as PHABLET anyway in the country 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:22.130
 The released Intel chip has a call-in capability 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.820
 The control panel oyster products Throughout the entire product Mobile smartphone products 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:30.840
 It is the first 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:34.860
 Well, at first, I should be getting a nice kid. 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:39.690
 Fixed some cool little Oya Kane gwaenchange 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:43.740
 Especially , I would like to see the products with the next generation of Atom 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:48.330
 In the 4p, 7l t went into 7t 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:52.440
 Intel Cloverlee 's Chief Clover Trail Jet dreams Lee Hyo Lee 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:57.030
 Yesterday I went example, a dream since I'm a bit this fact is not it three models 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:01.020
 1 The Jet 3500 series is a hot product these days. 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.160
 Uh, that's a little unfortunate, but I do not know who he is. 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.830
 For 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:10.840
 This is the power vr gpu'm enters the Nation Madge has spread to the next 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.959
 Maybe the modem is an 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:19.449
 5 modem is thought to be xml 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:20.470
 The memory in the memory is 16 gb. 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:25.000
 There is 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.520
 And internally, the ace is also very much at Computex 2014 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.630
 Jen ui stressing 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.370
 I've heard it all the time. 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:39.580
 It has changed dramatically . 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:41.169
 The operating system first eocho 4.3 Jelly Bean and so if no one on the farm 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.340
 Firmware upgrade support 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.330
 So, as the 4-point car key case becomes the upgrade, new fun ui 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:52.240
 Come in. 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:54.190
 So if you are sure that if the envoys who firmware upgrade 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:59.260
 We recommend 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:02.800
 The price of the product was set at 339,000 won, 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:06.520
 Sometimes it comes out cheaply. 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:12.610
 And finally, one more word touches renamed 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:18.250
 Domestic great deal lt Technology Network Technology dwaetneunde 3 What often lt 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:20.139
 Then lte-a broadband lt I guess losing to the sight I was thinking recently 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.770
 There is 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:29.199
 I'll move the wheel , but I do not have the same lt technology anyway 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.729
 Anyway , after all that, the technology that the foam pad 7l d supports is 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:36.069
 The first of 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:37.810
 Basic lp downshift up to 75 megabits per second bps supported by basic lp 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:41.440
 Only supports 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:46.569
 lt does not support 1 splash of audience 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:49.569
 So white saturation is a product that could have caught 75 backup and ps opportunities 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:55.000
 So I 've been looking at the opener up to here. 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:59.910
 What about haetguyo about dokdori according liver then I walk through a few Zen ui 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.910
 Let's take a look at some of the features behind Ace Foam Pad 7l.
