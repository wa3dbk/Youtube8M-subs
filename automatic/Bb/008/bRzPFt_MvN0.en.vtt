more<00:01:34.640> horseradish<00:01:34.939> next<00:01:35.450> year<00:01:35.630> probably<00:01:35.899> more

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
more horseradish next year probably more

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.560 
more horseradish next year probably more
than<00:01:36.560> you'll<00:01:36.710> know<00:01:36.859> what<00:01:37.039> to<00:01:37.159> do<00:01:37.280> with<00:01:37.490> so<00:01:38.299> a

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
than you'll know what to do with so a

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.630 
than you'll know what to do with so a
couple<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:38.929> things<00:01:39.079> before<00:01:39.350> I<00:01:39.799> release<00:01:40.399> what's

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
couple of things before I release what's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.940 
couple of things before I release what's
going<00:01:40.909> on<00:01:41.060> here<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:42.079> things<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.679> make

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
going on here the things that make

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.319 
going on here the things that make
horseradish<00:01:44.679> horseradish<00:01:45.679> is<00:01:45.859> it's<00:01:46.729> not<00:01:46.939> so

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
horseradish horseradish is it's not so

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.499 
horseradish horseradish is it's not so
much<00:01:47.450> heat<00:01:47.869> as<00:01:48.100> it's<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.249> pungency<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.090> those

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
much heat as it's a pungency and those

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.590 
much heat as it's a pungency and those
pungency<00:01:50.929> comes<00:01:51.409> from<00:01:51.799> this<00:01:52.670> chemical<00:01:52.999> called

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
pungency comes from this chemical called

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.910 
pungency comes from this chemical called
thiocyanates

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
thiocyanates

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.510 
thiocyanates
and<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:56.149> thiocyanates<00:01:57.049> are<00:01:57.520> hydrophobic

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
and the thiocyanates are hydrophobic

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.669 
and the thiocyanates are hydrophobic
which<00:01:58.670> means<00:01:59.030> they<00:01:59.240> repel<00:01:59.569> water<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.499> what's

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
which means they repel water so what's

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.529 
which means they repel water so what's
good<00:02:00.859> and<00:02:00.889> this<00:02:01.490> is<00:02:01.609> a<00:02:01.639> root<00:02:01.880> it's<00:02:02.149> full<00:02:02.389> of

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
good and this is a root it's full of

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.179 
good and this is a root it's full of
water<00:02:02.659> and<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.170> what's<00:02:03.439> going<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.619> happen<00:02:04.009> here

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
water and so what's going to happen here

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.529 
water and so what's going to happen here
is<00:02:04.369> as<00:02:04.939> soon<00:02:04.969> as<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:05.359> start<00:02:05.630> releasing<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:07.539> the

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
is as soon as I start releasing the the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.199 
is as soon as I start releasing the the
plant<00:02:09.050> tissue<00:02:09.259> here<00:02:09.950> in<00:02:10.069> this<00:02:10.190> root<00:02:10.460> then

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
plant tissue here in this root then

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.330 
plant tissue here in this root then
those<00:02:11.420> thiocyanates<00:02:11.930> are<00:02:12.440> going<00:02:12.709> to<00:02:12.770> run<00:02:13.010> from

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
those thiocyanates are going to run from

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.940 
those thiocyanates are going to run from
the<00:02:13.520> water<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:14.090> those<00:02:14.630> cells<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.709> first

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
the water in those cells and the first

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.320 
the water in those cells and the first
place<00:02:16.130> they're<00:02:16.280> going<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.459> run<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.819> is<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.120> air

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
place they're going to run to is the air

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.790 
place they're going to run to is the air
so<00:02:17.660> there's<00:02:17.900> thiocyanates

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
so there's thiocyanates

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.680 
so there's thiocyanates
which<00:02:19.220> give<00:02:19.400> horseradishes<00:02:19.940> pungency<00:02:20.390> are

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
which give horseradishes pungency are

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.330 
which give horseradishes pungency are
going<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.900> take<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.350> air<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.800> they<00:02:22.250> are

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
going to take to the air and they are

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.100 
going to take to the air and they are
going<00:02:22.490> to<00:02:22.580> wreak<00:02:22.850> havoc<00:02:22.880> on<00:02:23.450> your<00:02:23.750> mucus

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
going to wreak havoc on your mucus

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.890 
going to wreak havoc on your mucus
membranes<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:25.220> keep<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.150> mind<00:02:26.450> when

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
membranes so keep that in mind when

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.089 
membranes so keep that in mind when
you're<00:02:27.020> doing<00:02:27.140> this

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
you're doing this

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.130 
you're doing this
if<00:02:28.189> you<00:02:28.879> got<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.150> do<00:02:29.239> this<00:02:29.390> outside<00:02:29.599> or<00:02:30.019> in<00:02:30.109> the

if you got to do this outside or in the
garage<00:02:30.319> or<00:02:30.769> something<00:02:31.099> if<00:02:31.189> you're<00:02:31.340> trying<00:02:31.370> not

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
saying

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.569 
saying
so<00:02:40.939> we've<00:02:41.090> got<00:02:41.299> grated<00:02:41.749> horseradish<00:02:41.780> now<00:02:42.590> but

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
so we've got grated horseradish now but

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.059 
so we've got grated horseradish now but
it's<00:02:43.700> not<00:02:43.879> done<00:02:44.299> we<00:02:45.049> really<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.650> mean<00:02:45.799> we<00:02:45.859> have

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
it's not done we really I mean we have

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
these nice little fine shreds that would

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.059 
these nice little fine shreds that would
be<00:02:47.719> nice<00:02:47.870> we're<00:02:48.200> putting<00:02:48.439> horseradish<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:49.010> a

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
be nice we're putting horseradish on a

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.399 
be nice we're putting horseradish on a
salad<00:02:49.370> but<00:02:49.670> we're<00:02:50.209> not<00:02:50.329> we're<00:02:50.569> preparing<00:02:51.200> it

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
salad but we're not we're preparing it

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.069 
salad but we're not we're preparing it
so<00:02:51.980> I<00:02:52.310> got<00:02:52.969> some<00:02:53.120> stuff<00:02:53.269> stuck<00:02:53.629> up<00:02:53.810> in<00:02:53.930> here

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
so I got some stuff stuck up in here

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.750 
so I got some stuff stuck up in here
that's<00:02:54.200> okay<00:02:54.590> I'll<00:02:54.859> probably<00:02:55.159> run<00:02:55.459> a<00:02:55.519> knife

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
that's okay I'll probably run a knife

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.580 
that's okay I'll probably run a knife
through<00:02:56.030> this<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.419> put<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.930> back<00:02:57.079> in<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.409> bin

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
through this and put it back in the bin

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.860 
through this and put it back in the bin
so<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.010> can<00:02:58.219> process<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.669> properly<00:02:59.030> but<00:02:59.689> now

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
so I can process it properly but now

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.970 
so I can process it properly but now
what<00:03:00.049> I'm<00:03:00.139> going<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.319> do<00:03:00.469> is<00:03:00.650> I'm<00:03:00.769> going<00:03:00.919> to

what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.580 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
switch<00:03:01.549> around<00:03:01.669> the<00:03:02.060> blades<00:03:02.299> so<00:03:02.780> when<00:03:03.530> you

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
switch around the blades so when you

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.309 
switch around the blades so when you
take<00:03:03.739> this<00:03:03.889> top<00:03:04.159> off<00:03:04.340> be<00:03:04.909> careful<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:05.959> stuff

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
take this top off be careful this stuff

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.069 
take this top off be careful this stuff
is<00:03:06.500> going<00:03:06.829> to<00:03:06.949> knock<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:07.549> on<00:03:07.730> your<00:03:07.870> rear<00:03:08.870> end

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
is going to knock you on your rear end

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.830 
is going to knock you on your rear end

for all this horseradish right here we
are<00:03:11.959> just<00:03:12.139> adding<00:03:12.260> two<00:03:12.709> tablespoons<00:03:12.889> of<00:03:13.430> white
