00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.110 

I<00:00:07.410> have<00:00:08.410> removed<00:00:08.889> the<00:00:09.420> intake<00:00:10.420> box<00:00:11.879> oxygen<00:00:12.879> box

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
I have removed the intake box oxygen box

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.710 
I have removed the intake box oxygen box
from<00:00:13.450> it<00:00:13.629> about<00:00:13.870> the<00:00:14.139> battery<00:00:15.480> battery<00:00:16.480> set

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
from it about the battery battery set

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.200 
from it about the battery battery set
right<00:00:16.930> there<00:00:17.170> I'm<00:00:18.160> making<00:00:18.460> a<00:00:18.520> custom<00:00:18.850> intake

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
right there I'm making a custom intake

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.330 
right there I'm making a custom intake
for<00:00:19.420> this<00:00:19.539> thing<00:00:19.890> clicking<00:00:20.890> off<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.130> holes

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
for this thing clicking off the holes

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.090 
for this thing clicking off the holes
already<00:00:21.730> see<00:00:22.150> all<00:00:22.240> this<00:00:22.360> stuff<00:00:22.600> so

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
already see all this stuff so

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.160 
already see all this stuff so
self-explanatory<00:00:24.100> so<00:00:24.760> it<00:00:24.910> doesn't<00:00:25.840> take<00:00:25.960> much

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
self-explanatory so it doesn't take much

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.080 
self-explanatory so it doesn't take much
to<00:00:26.350> do<00:00:26.530> i<00:00:26.940> I<00:00:27.990> got<00:00:28.990> it<00:00:29.140> off<00:00:29.290> and<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.760> intake

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
to do i I got it off and the intake

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.500 
to do i I got it off and the intake
codes<00:00:31.420> here<00:00:31.660> that<00:00:31.870> goes<00:00:32.020> under<00:00:32.259> the<00:00:32.349> manifold

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
codes here that goes under the manifold

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.390 
codes here that goes under the manifold
appears<00:00:34.510> to<00:00:34.750> be<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:34.899> little<00:00:35.230> small<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:36.130> fit<00:00:36.280> in

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
appears to be a little small to fit in

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.030 
appears to be a little small to fit in
my<00:00:36.520> three<00:00:36.790> inch<00:00:36.970> PVC<00:00:37.840> pipe<00:00:38.410> that<00:00:38.440> I<00:00:38.650> made<00:00:38.920> it

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
my three inch PVC pipe that I made it

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.970 
my three inch PVC pipe that I made it
out<00:00:39.130> of<00:00:39.310> so<00:00:40.030> I<00:00:40.060> use<00:00:40.510> some<00:00:40.540> electrical<00:00:41.380> tape<00:00:41.410> put

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
out of so I use some electrical tape put

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.020 
out of so I use some electrical tape put
it<00:00:42.070> on<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.370> outside<00:00:42.640> there

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.110 

that's<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.750> right<00:00:45.930> there<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.760> got<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.970> whole

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
I got a drill hold open it to o2 sensor

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.050 
I got a drill hold open it to o2 sensor
now<00:01:04.020> I'm<00:01:04.920> drawing<00:01:05.160> a<00:01:05.369> little<00:01:05.520> bit<00:01:05.760> smaller

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
now I'm drawing a little bit smaller

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.540 
now I'm drawing a little bit smaller
because<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.990> drill<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.320> too<00:01:07.470> big<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:08.040> don't

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
because if I drill it too big I don't

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.730 
because if I drill it too big I don't
want<00:01:08.910> to<00:01:09.290> make<00:01:10.290> sure<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:12.200> make<00:01:13.200> sure<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.440> fits

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
will be right back just drawn the whole

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:56.070 
will be right back just drawn the whole
else<00:01:40.800> draw<00:01:41.190> go

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:03.790 

good<00:01:57.080> Isabella<00:01:57.650> oh<00:01:58.750> he<00:01:59.750> knows<00:01:59.960> in<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.710> engine

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.160 

I<00:02:03.890> drilled<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.730> hole<00:02:04.940> purposely<00:02:05.660> a<00:02:05.900> little

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
I drilled the hole purposely a little

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.500 
I drilled the hole purposely a little
bit<00:02:06.260> small<00:02:06.650> just<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:07.520> make<00:02:07.700> sure<00:02:07.730> that<00:02:08.030> see<00:02:08.360> the

bit small just to make sure that see the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.390 
bit small just to make sure that see the
sole<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.050> fence<00:02:09.260> or<00:02:09.440> fit<00:02:09.590> snugly<00:02:10.070> in<00:02:10.190> there

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
sole to fence or fit snugly in there

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.160 
sole to fence or fit snugly in there
without<00:02:11.060> any<00:02:11.390> air<00:02:11.630> getting<00:02:11.990> out<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:14.720> we<00:02:15.110> are

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
without any air getting out so we are

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:25.530 
without any air getting out so we are
going<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.590> test<00:02:15.860> it

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:43.870

snug<00:02:59.400> the<00:03:00.299> o2<00:03:00.599> sensor<00:03:01.049> it's<00:03:01.560> in<00:03:01.680> there<00:03:01.830> tight

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
snug the o2 sensor it's in there tight

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.750 
snug the o2 sensor it's in there tight
thanks<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.790> some<00:03:03.030> tough<00:03:03.180> on<00:03:03.420> tape

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
we've got air filter right down here

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.759 
we've got air filter right down here
next<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.510> battery<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.739> box<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.250> removed

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
bigger throttle response on this thing

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.509 
bigger throttle response on this thing
and<00:03:24.319> not<00:03:25.319> only<00:03:25.530> does<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.739> look<00:03:25.950> cool<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.340> sounds
