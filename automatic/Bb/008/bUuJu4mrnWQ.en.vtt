00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 you have the link on the screen right now 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.359
 of the video that I did on how to install and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.370
 solve the installation problem 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.200
 of disk 2 that according to the warning of 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.210
 rockstar recommended not installing the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.830
 second record because of the popping that 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.109
 generated on the screen is therefore 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.480
 this video an extension to the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.250
 information to complement the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.689
 information from the other video I'm going to split 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.789
 this video in two parts in the first 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.320
 I'm going to teach some information about 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.240
 to the hard drive and the drive and the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.460
 part two I will show parts of 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.679
 the animations and gameplay in game 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.450
 of the game to see these effects of 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.280
 popping to have installed the second 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.989
 we go there then with the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.570
 hard drive or unit differences 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.670
 usb either of the two systems is 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.440
 valid to install the game but I 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.110
 I want to leave the information very clear 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.539
 important I advise installation in 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.579
 the hard drive for the console because 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.699
 because because the connection as it is 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.680
 watching is different from the usb's I 've 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.289
 removed the lid as we see this is a 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.120
 usb and that's a much better connection 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.760
 specific to the console of the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.650
 Modern models of black version 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.880
 slim and the later that has come out this 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.590
 year usually comes 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.840
 and you can also buy a 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.850
 external expansion that is different 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.229
 presentation to this are more squares of 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.850
 black guy who we already explained in the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.920
 previous video but in this what 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.539
 I want to leave as a clear idea is that if 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.880
 you are going to install the game that you are 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:25.020
 asking many in a flash drive 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.450
 usb of minimum 16 gb once formatted 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.179
 I recommend you to be careful with 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.939
 the type of usb drive because inside 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.799
 has a chip that varies depending on the 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.380
 distributed brand are not equal all 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.849
 you will have 16 GB some are more 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.679
 faster than others therefore the 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:42.360
 construction of this device is 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.729
 different what makes the good the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.899
 The best is usually the most expensive 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.349
 therefore we must be very careful 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.630
 with the 16gb versions of 32 of 64 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:54.959
 hard drives and so on is much better 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.599
 to play the game the most fluid 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.099
 possible a hard drive of the console if 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.479
 you can not buy it in the case of a 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:02.640
 person who has commented to me in the other 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.170
 video that was from venezuela that only 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.380
 can pull a usb flash drive 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.450
 is a fix is ​​fine but in many 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.760
 cases gives problems depending on whether it is 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.830
 of the first 16GB versions more 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.660
 old who had worse worst speed 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.880
 construction and so on my advice 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.709
 try to get a hard drive and the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.110
 that you have the slim version if it was of the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.630
 first that came out I had 4 gigs not 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.250
 it's worth it because it 's a minimum of 8 gigas already for 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.989
 end with this several people I 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.300
 they ask if with the extraction of the disc 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.890
 2 occupies more space because in principle I 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.840
 I have not seen anything remarkable 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.310
 install files in hidden the truth is 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.370
 that is not visible because everything is left 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.170
 compacted and the environment informs that it occupies 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.090
 7.7 gigas is why I'm just going to 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.799
 go to show on the screen these 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.239
 paper differences so you can see that 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.400
 although it can be annoying if you know 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.900
 live with it before I take out the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.330
 update I think it's late few 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.430
 megas is better from my point of view and 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.170
 preferable to install the second disk 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.670
 to take advantage of all that amount of 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.650
 superior polygons that you will see in 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.870
 screen giving the graphic definition 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.489
 many times higher than we were installed 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.980
 the second disc very well is there been 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.600
 all evil often requires good and 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.730
 in this case there is no harm that good 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.800
 come 'to be able to take advantage of this 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.480
 of popping that does not become a 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.400
 serious problem not even under my point 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.349
 from sight to mild but it is simply 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.940
 an inconvenience an annoyance for the 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.040
 occurrence that can sometimes take a 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.510
 second to show each object now 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.430
 you will see it on the screen and you know 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.319
 live with it and it will stay with you 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.790
 choice to install it or not 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.250
 equally the problem will remain 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.500
 solved and corrected later 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.879
 with the update that will be released so 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.879
 without saying goodbye until later 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.299
 bye 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.320
 ah 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.659
 and 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.009
 or not
