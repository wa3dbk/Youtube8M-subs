00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hey guys this is Austin and today in use

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.670 
hey guys this is Austin and today in use
the<00:00:03.179> video<00:00:03.419> talking<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.929> bit<00:00:04.049> about<00:00:04.110> battery

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
the video talking a bit about battery

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.920 
the video talking a bit about battery
life<00:00:04.850> batteries<00:00:05.850> are<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.120> lot<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.450> devices<00:00:06.870> that

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
life batteries are a lot of devices that

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.660 
life batteries are a lot of devices that
we<00:00:07.080> use<00:00:07.109> on<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.500> day-to-day<00:00:07.740> basis<00:00:08.370> whether<00:00:08.550> it

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
we use on a day-to-day basis whether it

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.390 
we use on a day-to-day basis whether it
be<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> phone<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.540> tablet<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:10.410> laptop<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.830> name<00:00:11.219> it

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
be a phone a tablet a laptop you name it

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.919 
be a phone a tablet a laptop you name it
now<00:00:11.580> obviously<00:00:12.030> pretty<00:00:12.240> much<00:00:12.450> any<00:00:12.630> kind<00:00:12.870> of

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
now obviously pretty much any kind of

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.720 
now obviously pretty much any kind of
electronic<00:00:13.049> device<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.040> use<00:00:14.309> will<00:00:14.519> draw

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
electronic device that we use will draw

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.519 
electronic device that we use will draw
power<00:00:15.000> now<00:00:15.719> for<00:00:15.990> example<00:00:16.289> if<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.410> have

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
power now for example if you have

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.320 
power now for example if you have
something<00:00:16.740> like<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.160> desktop<00:00:17.760> or<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.090> game

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
something like a desktop or a game

mercy of their batteries and well sure
there<00:00:29.880> are<00:00:30.029> some<00:00:30.060> devices<00:00:30.599> such<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:31.019> ereader

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
there are some devices such as ereader

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.139 
there are some devices such as ereader
they<00:00:32.009> can<00:00:32.160> actually<00:00:32.250> last<00:00:32.579> quite<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> while<00:00:33.000> a

they can actually last quite a while a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.580 
they can actually last quite a while a
lot<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.329> charge<00:00:33.660> for<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.170> most<00:00:34.320> part<00:00:34.469> you're

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
lot of charge for the most part you're

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.630 
lot of charge for the most part you're
going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.800> be<00:00:34.860> constrained<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> few<00:00:35.610> hours

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
going to be constrained to a few hours

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.760 
going to be constrained to a few hours
before<00:00:36.210> your<00:00:36.270> battery<00:00:36.600> hits<00:00:36.870> zero<00:00:37.260> if<00:00:37.649> you

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
before your battery hits zero if you

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.959 
before your battery hits zero if you
take<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> look<00:00:38.129> at<00:00:38.219> how<00:00:38.340> technology<00:00:38.940> is

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
take a look at how technology is

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.330 
take a look at how technology is
advanced<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> past<00:00:39.899> 10<00:00:40.230> 20<00:00:40.649> years<00:00:40.680> you'll

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
advanced in the past 10 20 years you'll

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.799 
advanced in the past 10 20 years you'll
see<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> batteries<00:00:41.969> really<00:00:42.300> haven't<00:00:42.629> done

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
see the batteries really haven't done

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.529 
see the batteries really haven't done
much<00:00:43.079> for<00:00:43.770> example<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.280> 1999<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.300> could<00:00:45.420> go

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
much for example in 1999 you could go

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.990 
much for example in 1999 you could go
buy<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> powerbook<00:00:46.320> g3<00:00:46.559> from<00:00:46.980> Apple<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:47.850> going

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
buy a powerbook g3 from Apple it's going

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.660 
buy a powerbook g3 from Apple it's going
to<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> 333<00:00:49.200> megahertz<00:00:49.649> processor<00:00:49.860> and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
to have a 333 megahertz processor and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.830 
to have a 333 megahertz processor and
yet<00:00:50.760> still<00:00:50.969> going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.390> about<00:00:51.539> five<00:00:51.809> hours

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
yet still going to get about five hours

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.049 
yet still going to get about five hours
of<00:00:52.199> battery<00:00:52.530> life<00:00:52.670> contrast<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
of battery life contrast this was a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.060 
of battery life contrast this was a
brand<00:00:54.480> new<00:00:54.600> MacBook<00:00:54.960> Pro<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.170> buy<00:00:55.379> today<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
brand new MacBook Pro you buy today and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.160 
brand new MacBook Pro you buy today and
while<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.610> has<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> 2.5<00:00:57.629> gigahertz<00:00:57.930> quad-core

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
while it has a 2.5 gigahertz quad-core

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.319 
while it has a 2.5 gigahertz quad-core
processor<00:00:59.160> which<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.460> about<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.670> hundred<00:00:59.760> times

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
processor which is about a hundred times

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.060 
processor which is about a hundred times
faster<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.289> yet<00:01:01.559> you're<00:01:01.680> not<00:01:01.710> really<00:01:01.890> going

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
faster and yet you're not really going

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.799 
faster and yet you're not really going
to<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.250> much<00:01:02.399> better<00:01:02.579> battery<00:01:03.000> life<00:01:03.030> well<00:01:03.719> you

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
to get much better battery life well you

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.119 
to get much better battery life well you
can<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.110> trace<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.500> all<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> way<00:01:04.830> back<00:01:04.979> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
can really trace it all the way back to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.399 
can really trace it all the way back to
the<00:01:05.220> 1960s<00:01:05.790> when<00:01:06.180> Moore's<00:01:06.540> law<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:06.960> invented

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
the 1960s when Moore's law was invented

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.109 
the 1960s when Moore's law was invented
basically<00:01:08.189> what<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.430> means<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:08.970> every

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
basically what this means is that every

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.600 
basically what this means is that every
18<00:01:09.810> months<00:01:09.960> integrated<00:01:10.770> circuits<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.340> this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
18 months integrated circuits in this

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.880 
18 months integrated circuits in this
case<00:01:11.790> CPUs<00:01:12.270> need<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> double<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.260> speed<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
case CPUs need to double in speed and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.410 
case CPUs need to double in speed and
this<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.460> actually<00:01:14.610> happened<00:01:15.150> pretty<00:01:15.270> much

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
this is actually happened pretty much

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.910 
this is actually happened pretty much
consistently<00:01:15.990> over<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.320> past<00:01:16.590> 50<00:01:16.890> years

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
consistently over the past 50 years

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.550 
consistently over the past 50 years
every<00:01:17.700> 18<00:01:18.030> months<00:01:18.210> or<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:19.020> see<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> pretty

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
every 18 months or so you see a pretty

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.320 
every 18 months or so you see a pretty
major<00:01:19.740> job<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.430> everything<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.909> about<00:01:21.090> twice

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
major job and everything is about twice

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.570 
major job and everything is about twice
as<00:01:21.570> fast<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> was<00:01:22.259> 18<00:01:22.680> months<00:01:22.770> previous<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
as fast as it was 18 months previous and

of course all this trickles down into

of course all this trickles down into
phones<00:01:25.830> tablets<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.759> pretty<00:01:26.970> much<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.270> other

course<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.340> still<00:01:35.549> works<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.970> still<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> great

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
course it still works is still a great

are still taking off at an incredible
pace<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.650> imagine<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> battery

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
pace but just imagine if the battery

pace but just imagine if the battery
didn't<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.000> take<00:01:42.180> up<00:01:42.299> such<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> huge

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
didn't have to take up such a huge

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
amount what else like it add more memory

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.499 
amount what else like it add more memory
could<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.229> faster<00:01:46.799> etc<00:01:47.220> etc<00:01:47.280> course<00:01:48.030> every<00:01:48.299> few

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
could be faster etc etc course every few

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.789 
could be faster etc etc course every few
months<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:48.780> hear<00:01:48.899> about<00:01:49.049> some<00:01:49.259> major<00:01:49.560> new
