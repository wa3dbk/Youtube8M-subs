00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
to know more about antimatter I've made

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.079 
to know more about antimatter I've made
a<00:00:52.440> video<00:00:52.739> about<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.280> which<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.790> link<00:00:54.000> to

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
a video about to which you can link to

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.110 
a video about to which you can link to
hear<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.470> know<00:00:55.650> for<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.519> rockets

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
hear but so that you know for a rockets

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.140 
hear but so that you know for a rockets
maximum<00:00:57.870> speed<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:58.830> two<00:00:59.070> main<00:00:59.309> factors<00:00:59.640> are

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
maximum speed the two main factors are

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.390 
maximum speed the two main factors are
the<00:01:00.570> mass<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.839> the<00:01:01.049> exhaust<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.070> speed

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
the mass of the exhaust and the speed

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.009 
the mass of the exhaust and the speed
that<00:01:02.580> the<00:01:02.729> exhaust<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.239> traveling<00:01:03.720> so

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
that the exhaust is traveling so

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.230 
that the exhaust is traveling so
obviously<00:01:04.769> if<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.220> either<00:01:05.549> increase<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
obviously if you either increase the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.030 
obviously if you either increase the
mass<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.720> exhaust<00:01:07.170> or<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.590> speed<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
mass of the exhaust or the speed of the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.219 
mass of the exhaust or the speed of the
exhaust<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.299> rocket<00:01:09.659> will<00:01:09.869> travel

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
exhaust then the rocket will travel

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.170 
exhaust then the rocket will travel
faster<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.310> case<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.760> primarily

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
faster and in this case it's primarily

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.000 
faster and in this case it's primarily
looking<00:01:12.479> at<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> speed<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.350> exhaust<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.890> how

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
looking at the speed of exhaust and how

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.770 
looking at the speed of exhaust and how
that<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.520> increased<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> case

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
that can be increased now in the case

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.660 
that can be increased now in the case
that<00:01:15.960> was<00:01:16.290> looked<00:01:16.560> at<00:01:16.740> they<00:01:16.950> were<00:01:17.010> simulating

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that was looked at they were simulating

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.550 
that was looked at they were simulating
the<00:01:17.700> collisions<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.750> proton<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.410> an

you've noticed in the bottom right of my
last<00:04:38.790> two<00:04:39.240> videos<00:04:39.270> including<00:04:40.200> this<00:04:40.320> one

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
last two videos including this one

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.170 
last two videos including this one
there's<00:04:41.160> been<00:04:41.370> an<00:04:41.550> annotate

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
there's been an annotate

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.629 
there's been an annotate
allowing<00:04:42.690> you<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:43.139> skip<00:04:43.800> ahead<00:04:44.009> into<00:04:44.610> the

allowing you to skip ahead into the

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.430 
allowing you to skip ahead into the
video<00:04:45.030> and<00:04:45.240> you'll<00:04:45.389> see<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.720> annotation<00:04:46.320> to

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
video and you'll see the annotation to

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.770 
video and you'll see the annotation to
skip<00:04:46.650> around<00:04:46.860> here<00:04:47.220> now<00:04:47.880> should<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:48.389> keep<00:04:48.570> that

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
skip around here now should I keep that

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.930 
skip around here now should I keep that
in<00:04:48.960> as<00:04:49.139> it<00:04:49.500> allows<00:04:49.800> you<00:04:49.949> to<00:04:50.160> skip<00:04:50.370> anything

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
in as it allows you to skip anything

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.999 
in as it allows you to skip anything
that<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:51.360> don't<00:04:51.600> find<00:04:51.870> interesting<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:52.650> just

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
that you don't find interesting and just

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.800 
that you don't find interesting and just
go<00:04:53.160> straight<00:04:53.520> on<00:04:53.699> to<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:53.940> next<00:04:54.150> topic<00:04:54.389> and

go straight on to the next topic and

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.620 
go straight on to the next topic and
I've<00:04:55.199> also<00:04:55.320> tried<00:04:55.620> its<00:04:55.889> out<00:04:56.100> to<00:04:56.250> invite<00:04:56.630> video

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
I've also tried its out to invite video

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.620 
I've also tried its out to invite video
about<00:04:57.960> e<00:04:58.320> equals<00:04:58.889> MC<00:04:59.009> squared<00:04:59.300> also<00:05:00.300> several

this<00:05:04.020> is<00:05:04.080> annoying<00:05:04.470> because<00:05:04.650> it<00:05:05.039> means<00:05:05.190> that

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
this is annoying because it means that

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.580 
this is annoying because it means that

been a new comment on a video which

been a new comment on a video which

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
last did a news video and I think I'm on

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.920 
last did a news video and I think I'm on
about<00:05:28.620> equal<00:05:29.340> numbers<00:05:29.729> of<00:05:29.759> what<00:05:30.509> is<00:05:30.720> videos

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
about equal numbers of what is videos

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.969 
about equal numbers of what is videos
and<00:05:31.110> news<00:05:31.650> videos<00:05:32.340> now<00:05:32.580> so<00:05:33.240> unless<00:05:33.800> you<00:05:34.800> would

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979

all<00:05:35.130> prefer<00:05:35.310> otherwise<00:05:35.849> i'm<00:05:36.240> probably<00:05:36.509> going

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
all prefer otherwise i'm probably going

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.800 
all prefer otherwise i'm probably going
to<00:05:36.900> alternate<00:05:37.759> weekly<00:05:38.759> between<00:05:39.180> what<00:05:39.630> is<00:05:39.660> a

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
to alternate weekly between what is a

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.140 
to alternate weekly between what is a
news<00:05:40.169> videos<00:05:40.590> until<00:05:41.070> my<00:05:41.220> exams<00:05:41.520> over<00:05:41.940> and

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
news videos until my exams over and

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.180 
news videos until my exams over and
after<00:05:42.660> that<00:05:42.750> i'll<00:05:42.960> probably<00:05:43.199> do<00:05:43.470> one<00:05:43.680> news<00:05:43.949> and

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
after that i'll probably do one news and

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.149 
after that i'll probably do one news and
one<00:05:44.400> what<00:05:44.880> is<00:05:45.060> each<00:05:45.840> week<00:05:46.229> and<00:05:46.500> for<00:05:46.979> at<00:05:47.039> least

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
one what is each week and for at least

one what is each week and for at least
the<00:05:47.280> next<00:05:47.550> couple<00:05:47.760> of<00:05:47.880> weeks<00:05:48.270> i<00:05:48.479> think<00:05:48.690> my

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
the next couple of weeks i think my

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.080 
the next couple of weeks i think my

what's<00:07:18.470> being<00:07:18.710> called<00:07:18.980> a<00:07:19.310> new<00:07:19.640> light<00:07:19.880> on

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:19.910 
what's being called a new light on

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.680 
what's being called a new light on
quantum<00:07:20.660> dynamics<00:07:21.760> quantum<00:07:22.760> dynamics<00:07:22.970> or<00:07:23.510> one

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:23.690 
quantum dynamics quantum dynamics or one

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.080 
quantum dynamics quantum dynamics or one
that's<00:07:23.960> quite<00:07:24.920> big<00:07:25.190> quantum<00:07:25.730> electrodynamics

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.090 
that's quite big quantum electrodynamics

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:38.560 
that's quite big quantum electrodynamics
I<00:07:26.660> presume<00:07:27.050> but<00:07:27.350> now<00:07:27.620> we<00:07:27.680> didn't<00:07:31.360> nope<00:07:32.360> oh<00:07:37.570> god

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:38.570 
I presume but now we didn't nope oh god

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.330 
I presume but now we didn't nope oh god
it's<00:07:38.720> so<00:07:38.900> hot<00:07:38.930> in<00:07:39.260> here<00:07:39.290> in<00:07:39.680> a<00:07:39.860> new<00:07:40.070> killer

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.340 
it's so hot in here in a new killer

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.260 
it's so hot in here in a new killer
fusion<00:07:40.850> yet<00:07:41.440> well<00:07:42.440> that<00:07:42.620> intro<00:07:43.220> oversold<00:07:43.880> me<00:07:44.090> I

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.270 
fusion yet well that intro oversold me I

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.340 
fusion yet well that intro oversold me I
think<00:07:45.110> it's<00:07:45.290> over<00:07:46.190> this<00:07:46.280> way
