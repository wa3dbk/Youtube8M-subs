00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
raw amber strung on beads but most of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.090 
raw amber strung on beads but most of
the<00:00:35.309> amber<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.300> here<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:37.170> not<00:00:37.440> long

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the amber that you see here is not long

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.350 
the amber that you see here is not long
it's<00:00:38.840> natural<00:00:40.280> genuine<00:00:41.300> pure<00:00:42.829> Baltic<00:00:43.829> amber

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
it's natural genuine pure Baltic amber

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.990 
it's natural genuine pure Baltic amber
but<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.600> beyond<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.260> raw<00:00:46.440> stage<00:00:46.829> I'll<00:00:47.670> take

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
but it is beyond the raw stage I'll take

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.770 
but it is beyond the raw stage I'll take
you<00:00:48.180> through<00:00:48.320> certain<00:00:49.320> ideas<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.600> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
you through certain ideas here this is a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.459 
you through certain ideas here this is a
polished<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.579> gemstone<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.260> not

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
polished and with gemstone it is not

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.760 
polished and with gemstone it is not
what<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.949> find<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:58.230> has<00:00:58.530> an

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
what you find this is one it has an

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.029 
what you find this is one it has an
inclusion<00:00:59.190> an<00:00:59.730> insect<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.530> more<00:01:01.770> typical

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
inclusion an insect this is more typical

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.420 
inclusion an insect this is more typical
of<00:01:02.640> something<00:01:03.449> dredged<00:01:03.899> out<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> forest

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
of something dredged out of the forest

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.260 
of something dredged out of the forest
but<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.360> only<00:01:06.540> useful<00:01:06.840> really<00:01:07.590> for<00:01:08.340> slicing

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
but it's only useful really for slicing

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.109 
but it's only useful really for slicing
and<00:01:09.450> cutting<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.350> making<00:01:10.890> some<00:01:11.159> unifications

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
and cutting and making some unifications

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.899 
and cutting and making some unifications
now<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.140> picture<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.580> same

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
now in this picture we see that same

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.780 
now in this picture we see that same
stone<00:01:15.240> along<00:01:16.020> side<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:17.299> counterfeit<00:01:18.299> amber<00:01:19.170> peg

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
stone along side a counterfeit amber peg

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.030 
stone along side a counterfeit amber peg
and<00:01:20.790> think<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.509> right<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:22.040> amber

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
and think that the right is amber

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.390 
and think that the right is amber
colored<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.330> only<00:01:24.630> resin<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.619> not<00:01:26.009> at

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
colored but it's only resin it's not at

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.149 
colored but it's only resin it's not at
all<00:01:26.640> amber<00:01:27.210> too<00:01:27.780> many<00:01:27.990> people<00:01:28.409> fall<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:28.829> this

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
all amber too many people fall for this

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.780 
all amber too many people fall for this
crap<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.119> learn<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.799> typical<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
crap we have to learn this is typical of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.649 
crap we have to learn this is typical of
raw<00:01:33.390> amber<00:01:34.049> people<00:01:34.860> walk<00:01:35.310> by<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.450> beach

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
raw amber people walk by it on the beach

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.050 
raw amber people walk by it on the beach
and<00:01:36.990> they<00:01:37.259> don't<00:01:37.470> even<00:01:37.619> realize<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.549> amber

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
and they don't even realize it's amber

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.440 
and they don't even realize it's amber
it<00:01:39.509> takes<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.869> trained<00:01:40.229> eye<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.979> recognize<00:01:41.640> what

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
it takes a trained eye to recognize what

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.560 
it takes a trained eye to recognize what
it<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.740> what<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.310> buy<00:01:44.549> when<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it is and this is what you buy when you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.889 
it is and this is what you buy when you
look<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.350> amber<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.270> stones<00:01:48.600> like

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
look for amber you get the stones like

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.330 
look for amber you get the stones like
this<00:01:49.549> sent<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.270> bulk<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.950> minimum

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
this sent to you in bulk and the minimum

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.450 
this sent to you in bulk and the minimum
orders<00:01:53.790> are<00:01:54.060> typically<00:01:54.570> one<00:01:55.409> kilogram<00:01:55.890> of

orders are typically one kilogram of

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.260 
orders are typically one kilogram of
amber<00:01:57.420> because<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.920> does<00:01:59.430> not<00:01:59.610> pay<00:01:59.939> the

much get the run of the mill it will be

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.800 
much get the run of the mill it will be
amber<00:02:39.799> gravel<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.459> what<00:02:41.030> you'll<00:02:41.209> have<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.629> do
