how<00:00:33.329> there's<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.630> ground<00:00:33.870> reaction<00:00:34.140> force

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
how there's a ground reaction force

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.290 
how there's a ground reaction force
everything<00:00:35.280> begins<00:00:35.670> from<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> ground

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
everything begins from the ground

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.790 
everything begins from the ground
oftentimes<00:00:36.960> not<00:00:37.290> everything<00:00:37.620> there's<00:00:37.739> no

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
oftentimes not everything there's no

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.590 
oftentimes not everything there's no
hard<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.340> fast<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:39.059> but

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
hard and fast with this one but

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.100 
hard and fast with this one but
oftentimes<00:00:40.200> begins<00:00:41.160> from<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> ground<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.910> and

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
oftentimes begins from the ground up and

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.660 
oftentimes begins from the ground up and
he<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.469> he's<00:00:43.590> found<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.489> really

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
and this is how the kinetic chain works

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.290 
and this is how the kinetic chain works
folks<00:00:57.620> it's<00:00:58.620> pretty<00:00:58.859> cool<00:00:59.039> basically<00:00:59.969> his

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
ankle cannot cannot bend so it just

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.800 
ankle cannot cannot bend so it just
stays<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.189> know<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.580> my<00:01:14.670> foot<00:01:14.970> right<00:01:15.570> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
stays you know this is my foot right it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.359 
stays you know this is my foot right it
just<00:01:15.990> stays<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.650> can't<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.130> bend

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
just stays like this I can't really bend

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.480 
just stays like this I can't really bend
at<00:01:17.580> my<00:01:17.729> ankle<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.600> can't<00:01:18.840> flex<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.100> ankle

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
at my ankle I can't flex at the ankle

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.440 
at my ankle I can't flex at the ankle
right<00:01:22.460> so<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:23.520> that's<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.880> case<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.390> can

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
right so if that's the case but I can

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.630 
right so if that's the case but I can
flex<00:01:24.990> at<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.619> ankle<00:01:26.009> my<00:01:26.100> left<00:01:26.310> my<00:01:26.460> left

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
flex at this this ankle my left my left

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.800 
flex at this this ankle my left my left
ankle<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.270> bend

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
ankle can bend

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.230 
ankle can bend
what's<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.740> happen<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.220> I'm<00:01:29.520> going<00:01:30.150> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
what's going to happen is I'm going to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.179 
what's going to happen is I'm going to
shift<00:01:30.600> into<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> side<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.920> bend

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
shift into the side that can bend

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.940 
shift into the side that can bend
because<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.240> can't<00:01:33.630> bend<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.439> move<00:01:34.680> out

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
because this I can't bend you move out

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.920 
because this I can't bend you move out
of<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.430> restriction<00:01:36.060> always<00:01:36.450> remember<00:01:36.900> that

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
of the restriction always remember that

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.030 
of the restriction always remember that
especially<00:01:37.409> when<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.590> comes<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> lower

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
especially when it comes to the lower

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.190 
especially when it comes to the lower
body<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.460> move<00:01:38.850> out<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.150> your<00:01:39.600> restriction

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
body you move out of your restriction

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.380 
body you move out of your restriction
wherever<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.100> tightness<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.790> your

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
wherever you have tightness you your

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.350 
wherever you have tightness you your
body<00:01:42.600> tends<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.200> move<00:01:43.350> away<00:01:43.470> from<00:01:44.240> into<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
body tends to move away from into the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.330 
body tends to move away from into the
area<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.810> allows<00:01:46.140> range<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.740> motion<00:01:47.159> you're

area that allows range of motion you're

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.190 
area that allows range of motion you're
just<00:01:47.759> your<00:01:48.180> body<00:01:48.390> takes<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> path<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.079> least

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
just your body takes the path of least

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.499 
just your body takes the path of least
resistance<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:50.009> there's<00:01:50.549> range<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.000> motion<00:01:51.360> on

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
resistance so there's range of motion on

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.039 
resistance so there's range of motion on
this

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
this

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.020 
this
there's<00:01:52.469> none<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.250> side<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.670> ankle<00:01:53.969> in

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
there's none on this side the ankle in

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.789 
there's none on this side the ankle in
particular<00:01:54.299> what's<00:01:54.869> going<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.020> happen<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.530> as

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
particular what's going to happen is as

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.940

you<00:01:56.539> squat<00:01:57.539> you're<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.590> you're<00:01:58.859> going

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
you squat you're going to you're going

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.429 
you squat you're going to you're going
to<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.340> right<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.719> hip<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.229> going<00:02:01.289> to

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
to do this right this hip is going to

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.859 
to do this right this hip is going to
start<00:02:01.710> shifting<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.700> way<00:02:02.880> shifting<00:02:03.750> away

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
start shifting that way shifting away

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.899 
start shifting that way shifting away
from<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.320> resistance<00:02:04.770> now<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:05.520> he's<00:02:05.670> also

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
from the resistance now what he's also

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.940 
from the resistance now what he's also
experiencing<00:02:06.569> and<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.319> is<00:02:07.439> all<00:02:07.560> documented

that you know bodybuilding or anything

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.030 
that you know bodybuilding or anything
of<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.750> nature<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:55.230> it's<00:02:55.440> understanding

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
of that nature it's it's understanding

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.920 
of that nature it's it's understanding
the<00:02:56.069> muscular<00:02:56.489> system<00:02:56.750> understanding<00:02:57.750> the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
the muscular system understanding the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.780 
the muscular system understanding the
four<00:02:58.109> layers<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.470> strength<00:02:58.889> really<00:02:59.220> now<00:02:59.609> we're

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
four layers of strength really now we're

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.120 
four layers of strength really now we're
interconnected<00:03:00.150> we<00:03:00.630> are<00:03:00.799> the<00:03:01.799> kinetic<00:03:02.100> chain

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
interconnected we are the kinetic chain

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.479 
interconnected we are the kinetic chain
is<00:03:02.400> one<00:03:02.700> basic<00:03:03.000> idea<00:03:03.959> associated<00:03:04.769> with<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
is one basic idea associated with the

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.280 
is one basic idea associated with the
neuromuscular<00:03:05.970> system<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:06.540> check<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.079> out<00:03:07.139> it

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
neuromuscular system so check it out it

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.900 
neuromuscular system so check it out it
goes<00:03:07.410> even<00:03:07.590> further<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.310> he<00:03:08.370> doesn't<00:03:08.579> writes

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
goes even further and he doesn't writes

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.039 
goes even further and he doesn't writes
us<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.209> his<00:03:09.329> email<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.950> he's<00:03:11.069> restricted<00:03:11.400> here

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
us in his email so he's restricted here

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.900 
us in his email so he's restricted here
he<00:03:13.049> leans<00:03:13.350> right<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.130> we've<00:03:14.220> got<00:03:14.250> eight<00:03:14.609> pain

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
he leans right so we've got eight pain

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.220 
he leans right so we've got eight pain
here<00:03:15.120> because<00:03:15.389> in<00:03:15.540> order<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.840> stay<00:03:16.049> upright

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
here because in order to stay upright

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.780 
here because in order to stay upright
just<00:03:16.950> think<00:03:17.130> about<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.400> what<00:03:17.489> do<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:17.609> have<00:03:17.700> to

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
just think about it what do you have to

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.460 
just think about it what do you have to
do<00:03:17.910> otherwise<00:03:18.480> your<00:03:18.780> whole<00:03:18.810> body<00:03:19.139> is<00:03:19.260> going<00:03:19.380> to

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
do otherwise your whole body is going to

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.100 
do otherwise your whole body is going to
be<00:03:19.530> tilted<00:03:19.889> in<00:03:19.980> your<00:03:20.100> body<00:03:20.280> does<00:03:20.549> everything

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
be tilted in your body does everything

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.650 
be tilted in your body does everything
in<00:03:21.470> order<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.740> keep<00:03:21.830> your<00:03:22.010> eyes<00:03:22.460> level<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.570> the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
in order to keep your eyes level to the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.290 
in order to keep your eyes level to the
horizon<00:03:24.170> so<00:03:24.920> you're<00:03:25.040> gonna<00:03:25.130> do<00:03:25.280> this<00:03:25.430> boom<00:03:25.910> now

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.450 
neck muscles are going to fall in line
right<00:04:28.370> cuz<00:04:29.780> rolls<00:04:29.960> downhill

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
right cuz rolls downhill

you fix this then you'll be a little bit

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.500 
you fix this then you'll be a little bit
more<00:04:33.890> upright<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.520> then<00:04:34.910> you<00:04:35.030> stretch<00:04:35.240> that's

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
more upright and then you stretch that's

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
not only corrective stretching but

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.540 
not only corrective stretching but
exercise<00:04:56.390> modalities<00:04:57.110> that<00:04:57.140> that<00:04:57.830> require

speak evenly throughout the entire body
say<00:06:57.300> for<00:06:57.509> example<00:06:57.899> it's<00:06:58.019> a<00:06:58.079> bucks<00:06:58.289> one<00:06:58.529> way<00:06:58.680> and

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
say for example it's a bucks one way and

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.609 
say for example it's a bucks one way and
then<00:06:59.369> you<00:06:59.430> get<00:06:59.669> like<00:06:59.849> maybe<00:07:00.110> seven<00:07:01.110> seventy

00:07:01.609 --> 00:07:01.619 
then you get like maybe seven seventy

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:03.230 
then you get like maybe seven seventy

an imbalance at the nervous system level

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.179 
an imbalance at the nervous system level
or<00:07:14.610> them<00:07:14.789> it's<00:07:15.449> it's<00:07:15.749> neuromuscular<00:07:16.469> but<00:07:16.680> it's

to feed the muscular system and the

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.790 
to feed the muscular system and the

this<00:07:26.099> funk

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 
this funk

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.779

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.130 
the Atlas so so that's it gave you guys

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.879 
the Atlas so so that's it gave you guys
a<00:07:32.160> lot<00:07:32.280> of<00:07:32.430> ideas<00:07:33.180> in<00:07:33.810> this<00:07:33.990> video<00:07:34.229> hopefully

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:34.889 
a lot of ideas in this video hopefully
