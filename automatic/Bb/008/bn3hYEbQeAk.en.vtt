guys<00:00:39.910> so<00:00:40.910> we've<00:00:41.120> begun<00:00:41.270> insulating<00:00:42.050> with<00:00:42.199> the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
guys so we've begun insulating with the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.009 
guys so we've begun insulating with the
raxil<00:00:42.859> insulation<00:00:43.609> and<00:00:43.879> it's<00:00:44.780> going<00:00:44.929> pretty

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
raxil insulation and it's going pretty

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.630 
raxil insulation and it's going pretty
good<00:00:45.320> but<00:00:45.589> we<00:00:45.800> got<00:00:45.920> a<00:00:45.949> bit<00:00:46.159> ahead<00:00:46.309> of<00:00:46.460> ourselves

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
good but we got a bit ahead of ourselves

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.189 
good but we got a bit ahead of ourselves
and<00:00:47.239> I<00:00:47.870> forgot<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.289> nail<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:49.339> three<00:00:50.019> chunks<00:00:51.019> of

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
and I forgot to nail the three chunks of

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.649 
and I forgot to nail the three chunks of
floor<00:00:51.440> framing<00:00:51.800> to<00:00:52.159> each<00:00:52.339> other<00:00:52.550> so<00:00:53.269> I'm<00:00:53.539> going

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
floor framing to each other so I'm going

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.299 
floor framing to each other so I'm going
to<00:00:53.690> do<00:00:53.780> that<00:00:53.929> now<00:00:54.109> before<00:00:54.499> we<00:00:54.589> get<00:00:54.679> too<00:00:54.859> far<00:00:54.890> and

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.000

we also finished off putting all the
sill<00:01:13.260> gasket<00:01:13.800> on<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.950> trailer<00:01:14.610> we've<00:01:15.300> just

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
sill gasket on the trailer we've just

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.210 
sill gasket on the trailer we've just

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
pulled it back from the edge here so

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.450 
pulled it back from the edge here so
that<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:18.290> actually<00:01:19.290> pull<00:01:19.800> this<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460

poke through when I drill and it will

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.100 
poke through when I drill and it will
pass<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.100> hardware<00:02:08.399> through<00:02:08.670> so

did along the side here and then along
this<00:03:32.680> side<00:03:32.980> here<00:03:33.010> which<00:03:33.670> doesn't<00:03:33.970> have<00:03:34.270> the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
this side here which doesn't have the

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.280 
this side here which doesn't have the
flange<00:03:34.860> we<00:03:35.860> can<00:03:35.980> just<00:03:36.190> lay<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.520> bottom<00:03:36.910> plate

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
flange we can just lay the bottom plate

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.920 
flange we can just lay the bottom plate
right<00:03:38.290> onto<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:38.890> lumber<00:03:39.250> here<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:40.180> nail

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
right onto the lumber here and nail

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.160 
right onto the lumber here and nail
through<00:03:41.260> at<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.709> bit<00:03:41.950> of<00:03:41.980> an<00:03:42.130> angle<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:43.180> catch<00:03:43.420> it

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.410 

alright<00:03:47.170> so<00:03:47.320> we've<00:03:47.470> finished<00:03:47.940> securing<00:03:48.940> the

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
alright so we've finished securing the

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.930 
alright so we've finished securing the
floor<00:03:49.690> framing<00:03:50.020> to<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.530> trailer<00:03:50.920> so<00:03:51.820> you've

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
floor framing to the trailer so you've

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.870 
floor framing to the trailer so you've
tightened<00:03:52.330> down<00:03:52.510> all<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.320> big<00:03:54.220> bolts

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
tightened down all the big bolts

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.699 
tightened down all the big bolts
there's<00:03:55.720> 16<00:03:56.380> in<00:03:56.590> total<00:03:56.620> eight<00:03:57.220> down<00:03:57.430> each<00:03:57.670> side

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
there's 16 in total eight down each side

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.160 
there's 16 in total eight down each side
and<00:03:59.709> each<00:04:00.459> of<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.060> three<00:04:01.330> sections<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:02.020> floor

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
and each of the three sections of floor

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.640 
and each of the three sections of floor
framing<00:04:02.560> have<00:04:03.250> been<00:04:03.400> nailed<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:03.790> each<00:04:03.970> other

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
framing have been nailed to each other

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.460 
framing have been nailed to each other
so<00:04:05.880> these<00:04:06.880> are<00:04:07.060> nailed<00:04:07.360> together<00:04:07.510> they're

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
so these are nailed together they're

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.650 
so these are nailed together they're
connected<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.100> trailer<00:04:09.550> it's<00:04:10.300> ain't

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
connected to the trailer it's ain't

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.300 
connected to the trailer it's ain't
going<00:04:10.900> anywhere<00:04:11.110> it's<00:04:11.380> all<00:04:11.530> part<00:04:12.130> of<00:04:12.220> the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
going anywhere it's all part of the

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.570 
going anywhere it's all part of the
trailer<00:04:12.520> now<00:04:13.380> and<00:04:14.380> another<00:04:15.130> thing<00:04:15.340> I<00:04:15.430> wanted

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
trailer now and another thing I wanted

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.390 
trailer now and another thing I wanted
to<00:04:15.640> mention<00:04:15.790> was<00:04:16.030> that<00:04:16.180> we<00:04:16.630> made<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.830> spacing

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
to mention was that we made the spacing

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.680 
to mention was that we made the spacing
in<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.299> floor<00:04:19.890> 16<00:04:20.890> inches<00:04:21.220> on<00:04:21.370> center<00:04:21.690> which

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
in the floor 16 inches on center which

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.270 
in the floor 16 inches on center which
made<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.050> easy<00:04:23.200> to<00:04:23.320> put<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.620> insulation<00:04:24.130> in

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
made it easy to put the insulation in

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.540 
made it easy to put the insulation in
because<00:04:24.490> these<00:04:24.640> bats<00:04:25.630> come<00:04:26.250> with<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.370> right

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
because these bats come with the right

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.450 
because these bats come with the right
width<00:04:27.850> to<00:04:28.210> fit<00:04:28.390> into<00:04:28.540> that<00:04:28.660> size<00:04:29.620> of<00:04:29.890> spacing

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
width to fit into that size of spacing

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.360 
width to fit into that size of spacing
so<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:31.360> is<00:04:31.480> really<00:04:31.720> easy<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:32.470> do<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:32.830> now<00:04:33.310> we

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
so this is really easy to do and now we

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.250 
so this is really easy to do and now we
just<00:04:33.610> need<00:04:33.700> to<00:04:33.880> fill<00:04:34.120> in<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.660> wider<00:04:34.960> edge

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
just need to fill in the wider edge

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.540 
just need to fill in the wider edge
pieces<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.910> fill<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.419> all<00:04:37.510> in
