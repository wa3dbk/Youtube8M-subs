that<00:02:37.170> just<00:02:37.380> really<00:02:37.560> gets<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.310> baking

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
that just really gets you in the baking

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.310 
that just really gets you in the baking
mood<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.210> makes<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.540> want<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.780> try<00:02:39.990> out<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
mood and makes you want to try out the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.100 
mood and makes you want to try out the
kit<00:02:40.500> even<00:02:40.650> more<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.880> kit<00:02:42.120> itself<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.780> really

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
kit even more the kit itself is really

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.350 
kit even more the kit itself is really
helpful<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.830> think<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.400> pan<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.850> amazing

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
helpful I think that the pan is amazing

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.180 
helpful I think that the pan is amazing
because<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.810> has<00:02:45.930> circles<00:02:46.380> as<00:02:46.530> guidelines<00:02:46.800> on

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
because it has circles as guidelines on

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.190 
because it has circles as guidelines on
the<00:02:47.220> baking<00:02:47.670> mat<00:02:47.880> so<00:02:48.209> all<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.540> your<00:02:48.660> macaroons

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the baking mat so all of your macaroons

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.320 
the baking mat so all of your macaroons
will<00:02:49.410> be<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.620> same<00:02:49.860> size<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.490> lot<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.060> people

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
will be the same size a lot of people

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.880 
will be the same size a lot of people
when<00:02:51.450> making<00:02:51.660> macaroons<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.320> start<00:02:52.680> out<00:02:52.770> with

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
when making macaroons to start out with

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.890 
when making macaroons to start out with
they<00:02:53.100> use<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.280> template<00:02:53.850> on<00:02:54.120> their<00:02:54.630> parchment

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
they use a template on their parchment

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.780 
they use a template on their parchment
paper<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.530> they<00:02:55.650> actually<00:02:55.950> draw<00:02:56.250> on<00:02:56.550> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
paper and they actually draw on the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.530 
paper and they actually draw on the
macaroons

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
macaroons

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.690 
macaroons
but<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.110> pan<00:02:58.380> just<00:02:58.620> eliminates<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.400> step

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
but the pan just eliminates that step

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.540 
but the pan just eliminates that step
makes<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.150> really<00:03:00.300> easy<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.870> really<00:03:00.959> simple

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
makes it really easy and really simple

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.100 
makes it really easy and really simple
so<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.670> cool<00:03:02.850> thing<00:03:03.060> about<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.420> mat<00:03:03.630> is<00:03:03.870> that

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
so the cool thing about the mat is that

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.840 
so the cool thing about the mat is that
it's<00:03:04.260> made<00:03:04.440> from<00:03:04.650> silicone<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.520> doesn't

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
it's made from silicone so it doesn't

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.760 
it's made from silicone so it doesn't
need<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.180> pan<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.810> be<00:03:06.900> placed<00:03:07.140> underneath<00:03:07.470> it

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
need a pan to be placed underneath it

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.110 
need a pan to be placed underneath it
when<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.040> goes<00:03:08.190> into<00:03:08.400> your<00:03:08.580> oven

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
when it goes into your oven

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.510 
when it goes into your oven
however<00:03:09.959> I'd<00:03:10.260> actually<00:03:10.680> recommend<00:03:10.800> putting

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
however I'd actually recommend putting

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.490 
however I'd actually recommend putting
it<00:03:11.640> on<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:12.030> baking<00:03:12.270> tray<00:03:12.600> because<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.260> fact

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
it on a baking tray because of the fact

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.140 
it on a baking tray because of the fact
that<00:03:13.620> it's<00:03:13.830> helpful<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.340> bang<00:03:14.520> your<00:03:14.700> macaroon

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
that it's helpful to bang your macaroon

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.330 
that it's helpful to bang your macaroon
tray<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:16.110> eliminate<00:03:16.470> all<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.800> air<00:03:16.920> bubbles

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
tray to eliminate all the air bubbles

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.310 
tray to eliminate all the air bubbles
prior<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.760> putting<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.300> oven<00:03:18.450> plus<00:03:19.170> it

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
prior to putting it in the oven plus it

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.350 
prior to putting it in the oven plus it
probably<00:03:19.739> helps<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.130> have<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.520> extra<00:03:20.700> layer

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
probably helps to have that extra layer

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.840 
probably helps to have that extra layer
of<00:03:21.680> heat-resistant<00:03:22.680> see<00:03:22.860> underneath<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.640> pan

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
of heat-resistant see underneath the pan

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.060 
of heat-resistant see underneath the pan
before<00:03:24.060> putting<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.660> in<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:25.050> found<00:03:25.830> that<00:03:25.950> the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
before putting it in I found that the

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.890 
before putting it in I found that the
silicone<00:03:26.549> was<00:03:26.760> really<00:03:27.030> great<00:03:27.299> for<00:03:27.540> baking

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
silicone was really great for baking

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.900 
silicone was really great for baking
because<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.320> didn't<00:03:28.860> need<00:03:28.980> any<00:03:29.280> parchment

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
because I didn't need any parchment

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.880 
because I didn't need any parchment
paper<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.450> macaroons<00:03:30.900> came<00:03:31.260> straight<00:03:31.620> off<00:03:31.830> of

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
paper the macaroons came straight off of

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.100 
paper the macaroons came straight off of
the<00:03:32.070> tray<00:03:32.400> as<00:03:32.640> soon<00:03:32.820> as<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.090> was<00:03:33.239> done<00:03:33.540> there

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
the tray as soon as I was done there

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.810 
the tray as soon as I was done there
wasn't<00:03:34.260> any<00:03:34.560> sticking<00:03:35.040> or<00:03:35.160> any<00:03:35.280> issues<00:03:35.670> with

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
wasn't any sticking or any issues with

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.259 
wasn't any sticking or any issues with
that

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
that

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.390 
that
so<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:36.750> really<00:03:37.320> like<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.680> aspect<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
so I really like that aspect of the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.550 
so I really like that aspect of the
product<00:03:38.690> another<00:03:39.690> thing<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:40.080> really<00:03:40.260> liked

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
product another thing I really liked

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.259 
product another thing I really liked
about<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.980> kit<00:03:41.190> was<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.549> fact<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:42.030> comes

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
about the kit was the fact that it comes

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.140 
about the kit was the fact that it comes
with<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.900> called<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.590> D<00:03:43.799> Co<00:03:44.010> Mac<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.670> thought

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
with this called the D Co Mac I thought

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.550 
with this called the D Co Mac I thought
it<00:03:45.269> was<00:03:45.390> really<00:03:45.540> amazing<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.170> didn't<00:03:46.380> really

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
it was really amazing I didn't really

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.259 
it was really amazing I didn't really
expect<00:03:46.980> something<00:03:47.459> like<00:03:47.489> this<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.940> come<00:03:48.120> with

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
expect something like this to come with

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.420 
expect something like this to come with
the<00:03:48.390> kit<00:03:48.600> it's<00:03:49.080> useful<00:03:49.799> for<00:03:49.830> many<00:03:50.190> other

the kit it's useful for many other
things<00:03:50.730> as<00:03:51.000> well<00:03:51.209> because<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.840> fact<00:03:52.080> that

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
things as well because of the fact that

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.140

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.710 
or anything like that it's also really
easy<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.250> clean<00:04:08.489> because<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.330> fact<00:04:09.600> that

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
easy to clean because of the fact that

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.199 
easy to clean because of the fact that
it<00:04:09.930> has<00:04:10.110> this<00:04:10.709> opening<00:04:11.310> in<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.580> side<00:04:11.850> rather

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
it has this opening in the side rather

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.479 
it has this opening in the side rather
than<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.780> top<00:04:13.019> I<00:04:13.410> found<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.190> really

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
than on the top I found that a really

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.300 
than on the top I found that a really
useful<00:04:14.670> aspect<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.480> it<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:16.290> deco<00:04:16.620> max<00:04:16.859> has<00:04:17.100> a

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
useful aspect of it the deco max has a

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.340 
useful aspect of it the deco max has a
ton<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.640> other<00:04:17.880> uses<00:04:18.390> I'm<00:04:18.630> thinking<00:04:19.079> that<00:04:19.260> it

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
ton of other uses I'm thinking that it

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.530 
ton of other uses I'm thinking that it
would<00:04:19.500> be<00:04:19.680> great<00:04:20.250> for<00:04:20.669> making<00:04:20.820> those<00:04:21.180> little

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
would be great for making those little

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.840 
would be great for making those little
mini<00:04:21.840> cupcakes<00:04:22.440> because<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.280> always<00:04:23.460> have<00:04:23.700> such

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
mini cupcakes because I always have such

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.610 
mini cupcakes because I always have such
a<00:04:23.880> hard<00:04:24.150> time<00:04:24.210> getting<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.840> batter<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.350> fill

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
a hard time getting the batter to fill

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.650 
a hard time getting the batter to fill
those<00:04:25.830> small<00:04:26.220> little<00:04:26.250> muffin<00:04:26.850> trays<00:04:27.060> so<00:04:27.600> you

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
those small little muffin trays so you

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.210 
those small little muffin trays so you
think<00:04:27.990> something<00:04:28.320> like<00:04:28.440> this<00:04:28.620> would<00:04:28.830> make<00:04:29.040> the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
think something like this would make the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.920 
think something like this would make the
whole<00:04:29.460> process<00:04:29.640> of<00:04:30.090> spooning<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.720> batter

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
whole process of spooning the batter

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.670 
whole process of spooning the batter
inside

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
inside

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.879 
inside
much<00:04:32.160> easier<00:04:32.610> and<00:04:32.850> mess-free<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:34.470> one<00:04:34.680> thing

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
much easier and mess-free the one thing

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.770 
much easier and mess-free the one thing
that's<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.220> little<00:04:35.250> bit<00:04:35.610> difficult<00:04:36.000> about<00:04:36.630> the

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
that's a little bit difficult about the

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.230 
that's a little bit difficult about the
deco<00:04:37.110> max<00:04:37.350> is<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.770> fact<00:04:38.009> that<00:04:38.130> it's<00:04:38.340> made<00:04:38.639> from

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
deco max is the fact that it's made from

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.930 
deco max is the fact that it's made from
silicone<00:04:39.810> on<00:04:39.930> one<00:04:40.169> side<00:04:40.470> but<00:04:40.770> hard<00:04:41.100> plastic<00:04:41.789> on

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
silicone on one side but hard plastic on

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.850 
silicone on one side but hard plastic on
the<00:04:42.090> other<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.900> makes<00:04:43.139> it<00:04:43.320> a<00:04:43.380> little<00:04:43.560> bit

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
the other that makes it a little bit

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.860 
the other that makes it a little bit
tricky<00:04:44.310> when<00:04:44.820> you're<00:04:45.030> squeezing<00:04:45.360> out<00:04:45.690> your

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
tricky when you're squeezing out your

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.510 
tricky when you're squeezing out your
batter<00:04:46.110> just<00:04:46.470> because<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.009> fact<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:47.430> you

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
batter just because of the fact that you

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.909 
batter just because of the fact that you
can't<00:04:47.910> actually<00:04:48.360> squish<00:04:49.080> in<00:04:49.350> this<00:04:49.590> hard

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
can't actually squish in this hard

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.580 
can't actually squish in this hard
plastic<00:04:49.979> side<00:04:50.820> so<00:04:51.449> you're<00:04:51.600> only<00:04:51.810> getting<00:04:52.169> air

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
plastic side so you're only getting air

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.770 
plastic side so you're only getting air
pressure<00:04:52.949> from<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.460> other<00:04:53.580> side<00:04:53.940> and<00:04:54.240> when

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
pressure from the other side and when

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.629 
pressure from the other side and when
you're<00:04:54.930> getting<00:04:55.199> a<00:04:55.440> little<00:04:55.560> bit<00:04:55.770> low<00:04:56.009> on<00:04:56.340> your

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
you're getting a little bit low on your

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.850 
you're getting a little bit low on your
buttercream<00:04:56.940> filling<00:04:57.449> or<00:04:57.900> on<00:04:58.080> your<00:04:58.259> batter<00:04:58.500> it

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
buttercream filling or on your batter it

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.770 
buttercream filling or on your batter it
begins<00:04:59.430> with<00:04:59.520> a<00:04:59.610> little<00:04:59.850> bit<00:05:00.000> tricky<00:05:00.360> to<00:05:00.389> just

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
begins with a little bit tricky to just

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.590 
begins with a little bit tricky to just
push<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.199> out<00:05:01.410> through<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:02.009> top<00:05:02.250> so<00:05:02.669> when<00:05:03.479> you

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
push it out through the top so when you

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.210 
push it out through the top so when you
get<00:05:03.780> down<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.289> last<00:05:04.500> little<00:05:04.830> bits<00:05:05.070> of

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
get down to the last little bits of

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.409 
get down to the last little bits of
batter<00:05:05.430> you<00:05:05.669> might<00:05:05.820> just<00:05:05.970> have<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.270> use<00:05:06.389> a

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
batter you might just have to use a

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.020 
batter you might just have to use a
spoon<00:05:06.840> to<00:05:07.169> scoop<00:05:07.199> the<00:05:07.590> remaining<00:05:08.070> bits<00:05:08.280> that's

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
spoon to scoop the remaining bits that's

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.969 
spoon to scoop the remaining bits that's
the<00:05:09.240> only<00:05:09.449> downside<00:05:09.750> to<00:05:10.110> this<00:05:10.530> part<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:10.919> the

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
the only downside to this part of the

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.189 
the only downside to this part of the
product<00:05:11.430> I<00:05:11.729> also<00:05:12.150> think<00:05:12.449> that<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.690> recipes

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
product I also think that the recipes

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.719 
product I also think that the recipes
that<00:05:13.229> come<00:05:13.620> with<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.889> kit<00:05:14.100> are<00:05:14.280> really<00:05:14.490> great

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
that come with the kit are really great

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.310 
that come with the kit are really great
I<00:05:14.760> haven't<00:05:15.120> actually<00:05:15.360> tried<00:05:15.570> all<00:05:16.080> of<00:05:16.110> the

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
I haven't actually tried all of the

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.350 
I haven't actually tried all of the
different<00:05:16.680> variations<00:05:17.370> but<00:05:17.580> there's<00:05:18.150> quite<00:05:18.330> a

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
different variations but there's quite a

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.300 
different variations but there's quite a
few<00:05:18.479> to<00:05:18.720> choose<00:05:18.780> from<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.800> only<00:05:19.949> thing<00:05:20.190> is

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
few to choose from the only thing is

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.070 
few to choose from the only thing is
that<00:05:20.340> I<00:05:20.490> wish<00:05:20.699> it<00:05:20.850> came<00:05:21.060> with<00:05:21.539> a<00:05:21.570> few<00:05:21.930> more

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
that I wish it came with a few more

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.080 
that I wish it came with a few more
instructions<00:05:22.800> with<00:05:22.979> exactly<00:05:23.430> how<00:05:23.580> to<00:05:23.639> use<00:05:23.910> the

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
instructions with exactly how to use the

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.089 
instructions with exactly how to use the
mat<00:05:24.270> I<00:05:24.539> was<00:05:24.930> a<00:05:24.960> little<00:05:25.199> bit<00:05:25.320> unsure<00:05:25.500> if<00:05:25.979> I

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
mat I was a little bit unsure if I

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:27.650 
mat I was a little bit unsure if I
should<00:05:26.280> put<00:05:26.430> it<00:05:26.550> directly<00:05:26.880> in<00:05:27.090> the<00:05:27.120> oven<00:05:27.539> or

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
should put it directly in the oven or

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.990 
should put it directly in the oven or
not<00:05:27.810> but<00:05:28.470> based<00:05:28.710> on<00:05:28.889> the<00:05:29.010> pictures<00:05:29.400> inside<00:05:29.639> the

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
not but based on the pictures inside the

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.060 
not but based on the pictures inside the
book<00:05:30.180> I<00:05:30.419> think<00:05:30.810> that<00:05:31.050> should<00:05:31.470> be<00:05:31.500> perfectly

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
book I think that should be perfectly

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.120 
book I think that should be perfectly
safe<00:05:32.460> I<00:05:32.759> also<00:05:33.300> wasn't<00:05:33.630> entirely<00:05:34.050> sure<00:05:34.560> if<00:05:34.860> I

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
safe I also wasn't entirely sure if I

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.850 
safe I also wasn't entirely sure if I
should<00:05:35.430> use<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:36.120> entire<00:05:36.630> circle<00:05:37.320> on<00:05:37.560> the

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
should use the entire circle on the

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.070 
should use the entire circle on the
making<00:05:38.190> mat<00:05:38.340> as<00:05:38.580> my<00:05:38.820> guide<00:05:39.090> or<00:05:39.449> the<00:05:39.750> smaller

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
making mat as my guide or the smaller

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.379 
making mat as my guide or the smaller
circle<00:05:40.680> within<00:05:40.919> the<00:05:41.370> mat<00:05:41.550> so<00:05:41.910> because<00:05:42.210> of<00:05:42.360> that

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
circle within the mat so because of that

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.600 
circle within the mat so because of that
I<00:05:42.750> ended<00:05:43.139> up<00:05:43.199> doing<00:05:43.380> kind<00:05:43.740> of<00:05:43.860> halfway<00:05:44.099> in

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
I ended up doing kind of halfway in

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.550 
I ended up doing kind of halfway in
between<00:05:44.639> the<00:05:45.150> two<00:05:45.330> hoping<00:05:45.810> that<00:05:45.960> my<00:05:46.080> macaroons

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
between the two hoping that my macaroons

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.950 
between the two hoping that my macaroons
would<00:05:46.740> expand<00:05:47.280> to<00:05:47.490> fill<00:05:47.820> the<00:05:48.030> entire<00:05:48.389> circle

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
would expand to fill the entire circle

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.689 
would expand to fill the entire circle
they<00:05:49.530> didn't<00:05:49.770> actually<00:05:50.070> expand<00:05:50.370> quite<00:05:50.610> as

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
they didn't actually expand quite as

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.339 
they didn't actually expand quite as
much<00:05:50.880> as<00:05:51.030> I<00:05:51.150> wanted<00:05:51.539> to<00:05:51.750> so<00:05:51.990> they<00:05:52.110> were<00:05:52.320> a

that but the second time they ended up
