00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
actually a rail it's just a bar on the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.980 
actually a rail it's just a bar on the
model<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.030> real<00:02:06.180> life<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.600> actually<00:02:06.750> a

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
model but in real life it's actually a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.260 
model but in real life it's actually a
rail<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.310> got<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.489> hollow<00:02:08.700> behind<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.239> a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that bar the reason there's less

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.900 
that bar the reason there's less
actual<00:02:13.770> stowage<00:02:14.069> on<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.400> side<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.850> the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
turret is that there is only actually a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.920 
turret is that there is only actually a

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
done it with minimal effort

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.250 
done it with minimal effort
the<00:02:38.520> only<00:02:38.640> let<00:02:38.850> down<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.300> decals<00:02:39.750> they

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
the only let down is the decals they

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.820 
the only let down is the decals they
were<00:02:40.520> particularly<00:02:41.520> bad<00:02:42.020> in<00:02:43.020> terms<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.709> other

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
were particularly bad in terms of other

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.770 
were particularly bad in terms of other
weathering<00:02:44.280> normally<00:02:44.970> I'd<00:02:45.060> start<00:02:45.570> on<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
weathering normally I'd start on the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.199 
weathering normally I'd start on the
streaks<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.700> various<00:02:47.700> other<00:02:47.850> bits<00:02:48.030> and

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
streaks and various other bits and

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.940 
streaks and various other bits and
pieces<00:02:48.300> but<00:02:48.810> as<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.019> started<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.440> see<00:02:49.590> leave<00:02:49.800> it

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
pieces but as I started to see leave it

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.400 
pieces but as I started to see leave it
as<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.700> think<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.390> overall<00:02:51.660> effects<00:02:52.110> pretty

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
as is I think the overall effects pretty

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.490 
as is I think the overall effects pretty
good<00:02:52.680> didn't<00:02:53.370> want<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.580> go<00:02:54.120> overkill<00:02:54.630> on<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.930> so

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
good didn't want to go overkill on it so

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.930 
good didn't want to go overkill on it so
apart<00:02:56.160> from<00:02:56.480> just<00:02:57.480> fixing<00:02:58.230> some<00:02:58.440> sand<00:02:58.940> spills
