00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
because if they could have done it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.260 
because if they could have done it
without<00:01:18.150> having<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> disable<00:01:19.290> windows<00:01:19.590> backup

just<00:03:10.820> good<00:03:11.390> vibes<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:12.080> trackpad<00:03:12.380> it's

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
just good vibes that the trackpad it's

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.100 
just good vibes that the trackpad it's
got<00:03:13.460> little<00:03:13.580> dimples<00:03:14.090> on<00:03:14.240> it<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:14.600> you<00:03:14.660> think<00:03:14.990> it

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
got little dimples on it so you think it

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.300 
got little dimples on it so you think it
doesn't<00:03:15.320> stick<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.710> it<00:03:15.740> which<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:15.980> think's

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
doesn't stick to it which I think's

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.770 
doesn't stick to it which I think's
great<00:03:16.820> if<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.090> business<00:03:17.420> what<00:03:17.660> you're

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
great if you business what you're

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.750 
great if you business what you're
getting<00:03:17.990> or<00:03:18.170> something<00:03:18.530> but<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:19.610> our

getting or something but the our

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.150 
getting or something but the our
left-click<00:03:20.330> does<00:03:20.960> stick<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.290> bit<00:03:21.530> down<00:03:21.770> which

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
left-click does stick a bit down which

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.870 
left-click does stick a bit down which
kind<00:03:22.490> of<00:03:22.580> shows<00:03:23.390> its<00:03:23.660> price<00:03:24.350> but<00:03:24.740> overall<00:03:25.670> I

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
kind of shows its price but overall I

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.040 
kind of shows its price but overall I

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
before is that it can you have it just

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.970 
before is that it can you have it just
tick<00:03:59.210> a<00:03:59.240> box<00:03:59.330> and<00:04:00.170> it<00:04:00.290> just<00:04:00.470> charges<00:04:00.680> the
