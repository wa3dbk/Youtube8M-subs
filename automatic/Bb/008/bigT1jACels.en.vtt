thing<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.530> really<00:03:27.800> hard<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.430> find<00:03:28.670> this<00:03:28.790> that

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
thing it's really hard to find this that

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.420 
thing it's really hard to find this that
this<00:03:29.150> mixture<00:03:29.630> comes<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.650> leg<00:03:30.830> between

late I run about 28 ounces is how it

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.770 
late I run about 28 ounces is how it
usually<00:03:34.040> ends<00:03:34.340> up<00:03:34.520> so<00:03:34.730> it's<00:03:34.819> normally<00:03:35.209> its<00:03:35.360> way

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
usually ends up so it's normally its way

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.930 
usually ends up so it's normally its way
to<00:03:35.840> make<00:03:36.170> for<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.410> regular<00:03:36.830> size<00:03:37.069> glass<00:03:37.489> and

to make for a regular size glass and
it's<00:03:38.569> very<00:03:38.840> hard<00:03:39.170> to<00:03:39.260> find<00:03:39.620> a<00:03:39.950> good<00:03:40.000> size<00:03:41.050> glass

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
it's very hard to find a good size glass
