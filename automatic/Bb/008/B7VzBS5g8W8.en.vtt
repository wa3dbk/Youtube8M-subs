about<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.939> but<00:00:27.240> since<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.960> played<00:00:28.140> them<00:00:28.439> before

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
about it but since we played them before

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.190 
about it but since we played them before
so<00:00:29.960> it<00:00:30.960> was<00:00:31.140> not<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.380> hard<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.550> was

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
so it was not that hard and it was

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.299
