Smith<00:01:21.040> run<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.610> just<00:01:21.730> go<00:01:22.660> forward<00:01:23.110> or

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
Smith run and just go forward or

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.550 
Smith run and just go forward or
whatever<00:01:26.910> you<00:01:27.910> got<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.180> make<00:01:28.300> sure<00:01:28.540> you<00:01:29.200> hit

whatever you got and make sure you hit

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.500 
whatever you got and make sure you hit
your<00:01:29.710> back<00:01:29.920> wheels<00:01:30.190> with<00:01:30.490> enough<00:01:31.000> force<00:01:31.270> to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
your back wheels with enough force to

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.410 
your back wheels with enough force to
bring<00:01:31.750> your<00:01:31.930> board<00:01:32.140> like<00:01:32.290> up<00:01:32.770> onto<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.310> deck

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
bring your board like up onto the deck

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:42.539 
bring your board like up onto the deck
instead<00:01:34.420> of<00:01:34.570> just<00:01:34.750> like<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.830> know

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.219 

once<00:01:43.549> you<00:01:43.700> pop<00:01:43.939> you're<00:01:44.509> probably<00:01:44.780> going<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:45.110> be

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
once you pop you're probably going to be

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.690 
once you pop you're probably going to be
locked<00:01:45.500> in<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:45.799> little<00:01:46.039> bit<00:01:46.130> different<00:01:46.490> than<00:01:46.610> a

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
locked in a little bit different than a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.279 
locked in a little bit different than a
frontside<00:01:47.060> grind<00:01:47.360> you're<00:01:47.719> probably<00:01:47.990> going<00:01:48.200> to

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
frontside grind you're probably going to

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.280 
frontside grind you're probably going to
walk<00:01:48.469> in<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.829> a<00:01:48.920> little<00:01:49.100> more<00:01:49.340> of<00:01:49.430> an<00:01:49.520> angle

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.990 

so<00:01:55.290> it'll<00:01:55.470> probably<00:01:55.500> even<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:56.190> easier<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.820> come

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
so it'll probably even be easier to come

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.490 
so it'll probably even be easier to come
in<00:01:57.150> a<00:01:57.180> normal<00:01:57.690> time<00:01:57.840> say<00:01:58.020> grind<00:01:58.290> because

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
in a normal time say grind because

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.650 
in a normal time say grind because
you're<00:01:58.650> not<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.980> lock<00:01:59.160> up<00:01:59.340> at<00:01:59.550> all<00:01:59.670> so

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
you're not going to lock up at all so

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.900 
you're not going to lock up at all so
yeah<00:02:00.900> it's<00:02:01.080> just<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.680> know<00:02:01.800> leaning<00:02:02.550> leaning

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
yeah it's just you know leaning leaning

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.180 
yeah it's just you know leaning leaning
a<00:02:03.120> little<00:02:03.150> bit<00:02:03.390> forward<00:02:03.510> and<00:02:03.960> dropping

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.880 

so<00:02:09.940> yeah<00:02:10.300> once<00:02:10.570> you<00:02:10.720> got<00:02:10.870> the<00:02:10.990> motion<00:02:11.380> down<00:02:11.590> of

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
so yeah once you got the motion down of

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.950 
so yeah once you got the motion down of
just<00:02:12.160> popping<00:02:13.000> your<00:02:13.120> back<00:02:13.270> wheels<00:02:13.600> and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
just popping your back wheels and

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.900 
just popping your back wheels and
locking<00:02:14.380> in<00:02:14.560> there's<00:02:15.370> all<00:02:15.550> kinds<00:02:15.850> of

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
locking in there's all kinds of

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.790 
locking in there's all kinds of
different<00:02:16.150> variations<00:02:16.420> once<00:02:17.320> you're<00:02:17.500> locked

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
different variations once you're locked

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.680 
different variations once you're locked
in<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.160> grinding<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.640> can<00:02:18.850> turn<00:02:19.510> your

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
in and grinding you can turn your

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.360 
in and grinding you can turn your
shoulders<00:02:20.080> front<00:02:20.350> side<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.560> get<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.250> know

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
shoulders front side to get the you know

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.960 
shoulders front side to get the you know
