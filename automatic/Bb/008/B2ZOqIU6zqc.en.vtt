noticed<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.830> even<00:01:44.010> when<00:01:44.100> there's<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> movie<00:01:44.700> on

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
noticed but even when there's a movie on

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.670 
noticed but even when there's a movie on
that<00:01:45.060> you've<00:01:45.150> got<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.450> your<00:01:45.600> closet<00:01:45.870> on<00:01:46.230> DVD

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that you've got in your closet on DVD

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.890 
that you've got in your closet on DVD
you'd<00:01:47.370> rather<00:01:47.670> watch<00:01:47.940> it<00:01:48.150> on<00:01:48.270> TV<00:01:48.420> then<00:01:48.810> you'd

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
you'd rather watch it on TV then you'd

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.330 
you'd rather watch it on TV then you'd
rather<00:01:49.080> go<00:01:49.290> get<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.530> movie<00:01:49.830> if<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.130> lower

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
rather go get the movie if it's lower

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.910 
rather go get the movie if it's lower
lower<00:01:51.210> video<00:01:51.570> quality<00:01:51.870> if<00:01:52.440> there<00:01:52.590> are<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.770> lot

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
lower video quality if there are a lot

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.500 
lower video quality if there are a lot
of<00:01:52.950> commercials<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.580> middle<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.300> just

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
of commercials in the middle you just

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.820 
of commercials in the middle you just
stay<00:01:54.690> there<00:01:54.870> you<00:01:55.020> get<00:01:55.110> kind<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.350> sucked<00:01:55.620> in<00:01:55.770> a

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
stay there you get kind of sucked in a

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.490 
stay there you get kind of sucked in a
TV<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.220> I<00:01:56.280> think<00:01:56.340> TV<00:01:56.760> service<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> pretty<00:01:58.320> big

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
TV so I think TV service is a pretty big

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.920 
TV so I think TV service is a pretty big
time-waster<00:01:59.000> but<00:02:00.000> because<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.630> fact<00:02:00.810> that

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
time-waster but because of the fact that

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.570 
time-waster but because of the fact that
you<00:02:01.050> can<00:02:01.229> get<00:02:01.350> all<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> same<00:02:01.890> video<00:02:02.130> content

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
you can get all the same video content

you can get all the same video content
