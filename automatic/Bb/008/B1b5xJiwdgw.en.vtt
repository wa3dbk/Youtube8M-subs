00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
something different this the first time

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.170 
something different this the first time
I<00:01:45.840> ever<00:01:46.350> ran<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.039> race<00:01:47.340> where<00:01:47.610> my<00:01:47.789> goal<00:01:47.970> was<00:01:48.119> to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I ever ran a race where my goal was to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.450 
I ever ran a race where my goal was to
finish<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.750> not<00:01:48.930> win<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.770> we're<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
finish and not win so we're going to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.529 
finish and not win so we're going to
leave<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> line<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.149> we're<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.390> go

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
leave the line and we're going to go

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.200 
leave the line and we're going to go
fast<00:01:51.810> we're<00:01:52.140> going<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.409> conservative<00:01:52.740> and

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
fast we're going to be conservative and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.950 
fast we're going to be conservative and
even<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.390> don't<00:01:54.570> even<00:01:54.600> know<00:01:54.750> what<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.869> is

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
even that I don't even know what that is

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.609 
even that I don't even know what that is
we<00:01:55.229> don't<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.310> any<00:01:56.429> miles<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> truck<00:01:57.090> so

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
we don't have any miles on the truck so

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.350 
we don't have any miles on the truck so
as<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.159> race<00:01:59.340> progresses<00:01:59.970> we'll<00:02:00.119> probably

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
as the race progresses we'll probably

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.050 
as the race progresses we'll probably
get<00:02:00.630> more<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:00.990> more<00:02:01.049> aggressive<00:02:01.560> with<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:02.060> and

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
get more and more aggressive with it and

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.800 
get more and more aggressive with it and
if<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.899> get<00:02:04.159> two<00:02:05.159> mile<00:02:05.429> 800<00:02:06.240> we<00:02:06.420> might<00:02:06.600> run

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
if we can get two mile 800 we might run

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.570 
if we can get two mile 800 we might run
it<00:02:06.990> balls<00:02:07.319> to<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.590> wall<00:02:07.829> for<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.160> last<00:02:08.369> 200

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
it balls to the wall for the last 200

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.559 
it balls to the wall for the last 200
just<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.239> what<00:02:09.390> happens<00:02:09.440> but<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:11.130> trucks

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569
