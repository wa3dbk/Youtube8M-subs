00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.790
 and up here I 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.190
 main 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.410
 let's go 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.890
 put here 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.680
 and I'll connect the notebook 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.950

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.600
 how good it is 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.800
 The cool mouse 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.380
 a year ago 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.620
 He's going to light a little something. 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 capital and cattle front 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.740
 there has been no delay in detecting 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.740
 If you must be alone. 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:13.089
 It is with the mouse 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.709
 You should stay with Solano. 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.839
 It's hard to find your team. 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.919
 and we will open here a 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.839
 browser 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:24.279
 had opened 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.949
 who would most guanabara with time 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.389
 your daily dose of technology 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:33.179
 of continuous area but or parents that this takes a little bit I apologize 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:34.329
 but let's go 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.499
 so you lie 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.199
 a mouse died 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:43.300
 movement goes badly 100 min he has nothing spectacular about it 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.399
 I have microsoft works exactly the same 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.489
 he is a little heavier 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.819
 from microsoft 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.599
 more like this 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.269
 this is his position in the hand is good, very cool 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.299
 it has a click the read clip 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.339
 it's physical 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.769
 she thought I did not have physical psychic clicks and punches 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.019
 but he has 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.519
 so do not make this move by simply passing through Teresina 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.269
 the mouse 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.669
 I have a movement 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.959
 I wash 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.129
 then this photo-making movement 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.189
 anywhere on the mouse I can do it down here 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:21.949
 by continuing to do down here 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.239
 Do you see on the screen? 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.759
 the movement is precise 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.469
 and the thing is not is a 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.769
 if the team had functional times it is not quite that 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.659
 I move inside the boot shift - square mind 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:39.579
 to move 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.979
 and he is there for example clicking 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.979
 in some team link 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.949
 for example 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.259
 then with the movement of 2010 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:58.009
 it vettel cute zer with which the page returns what the page before his 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:59.960
 collapse two of them here 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.620
 he will return to inner peace 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.810
 two fingers here 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.729
 he's going to have to amputate part 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.709
 the framework here 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.639
 He already came back with the previous page. 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.529
 a defeat 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:13.579
 said 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.119
 to my post the comment and what impressed me the most 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.539
 it was here 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.539
 all this incident the whole area is delighted 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.919
 I can not speak from here. 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.919
 so far down 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.090
 is a Mr. Malzahn 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.170
 is thin 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.340
 he came 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.460
 It's beautiful 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.819
 These people are both medical and evil.
