adaptability<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.849> was<00:02:35.000> there<00:02:35.209> with<00:02:35.360> high

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
adaptability that was there with high

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.960 
adaptability that was there with high
jump<00:02:35.930> was<00:02:36.680> very<00:02:36.890> important<00:02:37.400> for<00:02:37.610> us<00:02:37.760> and

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
jump was very important for us and

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.089 
jump was very important for us and
really<00:02:38.330> is<00:02:38.780> what<00:02:39.049> put<00:02:39.290> them<00:02:39.470> over<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.890> top

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
really is what put them over the top

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.460 
really is what put them over the top
versus<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.209> other<00:02:41.360> organizations<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.380> we

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
versus the other organizations that we

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.680 
versus the other organizations that we
looked<00:02:42.680> at<00:02:45.040> we<00:02:46.040> were<00:02:46.160> effectively<00:02:46.790> completely

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
looked at we were effectively completely

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.870 
looked at we were effectively completely
changing<00:02:48.200> how<00:02:48.319> people<00:02:48.400> did<00:02:49.400> their<00:02:49.579> jobs

changing how people did their jobs

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.479 
changing how people did their jobs
inside<00:02:50.329> our<00:02:50.540> facility<00:02:50.890> but<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.040> great<00:02:52.250> thing

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
inside our facility but the great thing

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.240 
inside our facility but the great thing
was<00:02:52.700> 90<00:02:53.390> plus<00:02:53.690> percent<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:54.230> their<00:02:54.380> processes

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
was 90 plus percent of their processes

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.420 
was 90 plus percent of their processes
we<00:02:56.150> were<00:02:56.239> able<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.540> keep<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:57.049> same<00:02:57.410> they<00:02:58.220> just

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
we were able to keep the same they just

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.479 
we were able to keep the same they just
now<00:02:58.579> had<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:59.269> computer<00:03:00.190> directing<00:03:01.190> them<00:03:01.340> with

what they were going to be doing or the
computer<00:03:03.920> was<00:03:04.099> now<00:03:04.280> their<00:03:04.519> interface<00:03:05.090> back

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
computer was now their interface back

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.900 
computer was now their interface back
