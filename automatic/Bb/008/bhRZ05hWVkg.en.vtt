00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello my name is ivan 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.830
 A. Karpenko 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.130
 the topic of today's video is the concept of society 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.179
 society as a system 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:18.480
 what is society and why society 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.920
 defined as a system unlike 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.439
 others let's say the tedx community and what 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.779
 It means to be a system that even though it draws in 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.269
 first of all the system exists 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.410
 many different concepts and definitions 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.200
 society 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.610
 which were invented by various 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.280
 scientists by various specialists 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.600
 by sociologists 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.950
 social science experts 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.140
 so we will not be with you now 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.760
 engage in order to reproduce 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.010
 various definitions 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.610
 you can read them ourselves 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.620
 generate some common definition 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.340
 which allows us to reflect the essence 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.829
 concept of society society as a system 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.890
 can be defined as follows 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.920
 society is a system of elements of which 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.260
 are the people and their social institutions 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.659
 created generally this is the correct definition 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.600
 court can add that society is not 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.070
 just a dynamic system system what 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:21.299
 does this mean that first of all 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.229
 characterizes the system you probably can 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.100
 be seem 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.290
 from which the system binds interactions 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.950
 interconnection of system elements 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.049
 well actually not quite right this 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.329
 also important again 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.909
 first of all the system characterizes 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.720
 orderliness of elements 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.890
 orderliness a certain order 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.579
 Well, for example, imagine chess 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.579
 scattered on the floor there is no 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.659
 agree about the order in principle 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.950
 they can somehow between themselves 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.670
 interact in some way 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.670
 touch each other and again the figures 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.820
 stacked in a chessboard it is already 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.880
 more ordered state and that is 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.819
 system just like a dense forest in 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.069
 grossly sense let's say not ordered 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.670
 regular park he's ordered that's what 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.080
 distinguishes the system refer 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.989
 topics are still more 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.680
 orderliness so here is this society 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.569
 system in the sense that the elements 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.650
 society is orderly elements are people 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.790
 various social institutions 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.350
 social relationships and stuff 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.319
 component of the social structure here 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.989
 proper key concept and 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.780
 definition of content 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.860
 society well of course if some 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.380
 other things you need to know about 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:49.739
 the notion of society which is sufficient 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:52.600
 important and significant well this is of course 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:56.370
 such a moment such a nuance as that 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.410
 society is separate from nature 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.650
 part of the material world this too 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.850
 yes of course but to know in the first place 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.330
 the specifics of society is precisely that 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.370
 some 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.530
 and the dynamic system is specific 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.030
 constantly evolving changing 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.100
 inclusive complex 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.680
 social institutions and analogs of this 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.459
 no animal world 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.079
 but actually what is 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.359
 society as a system 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.530
