00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.440
 we are at the nokia android world stand 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.660
 at the stand it is not an event that maybe 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.570
 always wait for the challenge that you would not have 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.640
 never thought possible and instead here 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.140
 at the mobile word congress 2014 has become 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.849
 reality because here we have before us 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.789
 nokia x9 to hicks we also try nokia x2 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:30.029
 also the fat variant if so 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.850
 we mean xl which has a screen more 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.860
 great all the features yet 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.500
 at the moment when we are here at 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.230
 presentation are not yet known 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.510
 but in short we will insert them in the article 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.149
 the fact is that this is a smartphone 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.539
 nokia nokia android who did not 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.190
 secret of this and stated 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.840
 several times the performance that has a 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.090
 android product supports android apps 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.019
 that you can install them from any 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.609
 alternative store and also via apk 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.210
 here we have a power button of 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.280
 launch of the audio jack volume 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.350
 behind the camera without LED flash e 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.570
 under the micro usb port 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.430
 interface interface well this is 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.980
 obviously the windows interface 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.350
 phone or ash however the heart is 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.689
 absolutely android 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.430
 We will support the dual sim 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.520
 drag from the bottom we have the bar 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.470
 of notifications with these top the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.840
 reporting of wifi networks drags on 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.149
 the page instead downwards yes 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.159
 activates the search field does not appear 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.810
 exactly as responsive as a top of 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.720
 range but it is not a top of the range because 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.310
 it costs just 89 euros 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.009
 the interface we said is that 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.200
 of windows phone or at least similar is 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.690
 You can move all the various tiles and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.520
 you can also resize them for a 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.170
 android user this thing means more 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.390
 or less pass from the icon to his 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.500
 related widget 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.200
 scrolling we see that we have many 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.850
 applications including many that you 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.770
 you have surely learned to know 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.240
 very very well because they are those 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.460
 android standard you even see 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.920
 we have astro which has been installed here 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.110
 to show us how to install apk 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.370
 we have a back button and that's it 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.160
 in the list this is the list of 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.870
 applications all together if we scroll 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.030
 to the right or even to the left 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.710
 instead he had a list of the latter 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.840
 applications started 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.710
 if we try we have no network then no 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.240
 will work 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.770
 but if we try open facebook 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.040
 you will notice immediately how 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.910
 the application is exactly that of 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.240
 Android 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.900
 we have a store with apps 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.190
 obviously android but think from nokia 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.690
 for nokia 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.280
 obviously without a network it is not possible 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.960
 try 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.130
 I'll show you what is possible instead 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.830
 meanwhile we can open the keyboard 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.540
 let you see it show you how these 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.990
 dashes replace the key 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.660
 settings 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.880
 and this is the pastiera there is no tongue 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.180
 Italian this moment but we can 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.180
 also put it 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.159
 I guess there's no auto correction 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.159
 active automatically 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.380
 however there was no self-correction ho 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.240
 I chose the correct word but in short 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.100
 it works pretty well 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.980
 I'll show you the camera too 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.950
 it's the only other thing we can do 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.410
 testing so does not differ almost by 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.640
 nothing from the android cameras 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.610
 standard ok we photographed one 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.940
 beautiful handshake between executives 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.940
 nokia 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.830
 here she is, she does it by sliding towards 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.300
 the lower we have the maps of nokia e 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.420
 we especially have the settings in 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.520
 which I will now go to rummage about for 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.370
 see what's there compared to android 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.220
 the division is almost the same as you see there 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.950
 they are even to the same togos 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.280
 we have a data counter 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.160
 in short, you recognize it is just android 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.280
 let's go to the display 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.280
 no 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.860
 we have this name of what is ok a 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.740
 faslane let's say a little about the homescreen the 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.000
 our of our nokia hicks smartphone 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.710
 obviously all the accounts to be able 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.180
 add we do a song test 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.470
 let's see what it offers us 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.020
 obviously the great absent is missing in 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.090
 this case is google but it will be enough 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.790
 press on the emails to synchronize the 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.600
 calendar and contacts at least this de 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.320
 min about.com to see to get the 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.190
 final test 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.190
 not that it was needed 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.690
 no the final test would be needed 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.910
 because it was actually masked 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.080
 very well 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.030
 just do the euro battery 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.500
 ok no ok although I don't have it 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.360
 said in all ways that this is one 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.360
 Android smartphone then eventually in 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.650
 list of features this thing 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.699
 it was hidden here we have at 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.699
 developer options 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.340
 in short, to conclude this is a nokia 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.960
 x1 more gates than surely will be a 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.860
 interesting product will come in all 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.790
 the world 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.730
 the beginning of marketing 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.200
 however, it will start from the markets 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.850
 emerging however will arrive throughout the 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.750
 world will therefore also come to us 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.970
 nokia x9 ex plus and also nokia xl from 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.040
 this mobile world congress all from 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.300
 nokia stand a textbook greeting cisotti
