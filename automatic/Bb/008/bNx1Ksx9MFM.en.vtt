know how to play the game they pretty
much<00:05:04.760> just<00:05:04.940> run<00:05:05.180> on<00:05:05.300> low<00:05:05.420> sensitivity<00:05:05.780> sit<00:05:06.260> in

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
much just run on low sensitivity sit in

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.080 
much just run on low sensitivity sit in
corners<00:05:06.710> and<00:05:06.890> just<00:05:07.100> fire<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:07.880> know

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
corners and just fire you know

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.760 
corners and just fire you know
recoilless<00:05:08.600> weapons<00:05:08.960> at<00:05:09.110> you<00:05:09.260> and<00:05:09.470> hopes<00:05:09.650> to

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
recoilless weapons at you and hopes to

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.070 
recoilless weapons at you and hopes to
kill<00:05:10.040> you<00:05:10.220> if<00:05:11.210> you're<00:05:11.360> fake<00:05:11.540> if<00:05:11.750> you're<00:05:11.870> doing

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
kill you if you're fake if you're doing

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.240 
kill you if you're fake if you're doing
like<00:05:12.170> a<00:05:12.260> halo<00:05:12.470> style<00:05:12.830> where<00:05:13.070> you're<00:05:13.160> actually

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
like a halo style where you're actually

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.090 
like a halo style where you're actually
facing<00:05:13.670> good<00:05:14.000> people<00:05:14.360> I<00:05:14.890> think<00:05:15.890> that<00:05:16.010> would

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
facing good people I think that would

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.220 
facing good people I think that would
make<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.370> game<00:05:16.520> a<00:05:16.550> much<00:05:16.880> more<00:05:17.060> enjoyable<00:05:17.230> sure

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
make the game a much more enjoyable sure

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.600 
make the game a much more enjoyable sure
it'd<00:05:18.440> be<00:05:18.470> frustrating<00:05:19.130> to<00:05:19.190> begin<00:05:19.430> with

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
it'd be frustrating to begin with

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.160 
it'd be frustrating to begin with
because<00:05:19.760> it<00:05:20.030> wouldn't<00:05:20.240> be<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.420> norm<00:05:20.690> that<00:05:20.990> if

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
because it wouldn't be the norm that if

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.510 
because it wouldn't be the norm that if
you're<00:05:21.350> used<00:05:21.560> to<00:05:21.680> like<00:05:21.830> beasting<00:05:22.220> on<00:05:22.340> bad

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
you're used to like beasting on bad

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.240 
you're used to like beasting on bad
players<00:05:22.930> but<00:05:23.930> eventually<00:05:24.440> you<00:05:24.890> get<00:05:25.040> to<00:05:25.100> the

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
players but eventually you get to the

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.530 
players but eventually you get to the
point<00:05:25.400> where<00:05:25.580> you<00:05:25.640> probably<00:05:25.910> liked<00:05:26.180> it<00:05:26.360> and

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
point where you probably liked it and

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.540 
point where you probably liked it and
like<00:05:26.840> I<00:05:27.020> really<00:05:27.350> did<00:05:27.560> enjoy<00:05:27.740> facing<00:05:28.400> full

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
like I really did enjoy facing full

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.490 
like I really did enjoy facing full
teams<00:05:28.820> and<00:05:29.150> like<00:05:29.240> I<00:05:29.390> do<00:05:29.450> enjoy<00:05:29.780> facing<00:05:30.350> full

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
teams and like I do enjoy facing full

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.530 
teams and like I do enjoy facing full
teams<00:05:30.710> because<00:05:31.010> it<00:05:31.130> makes<00:05:31.280> me<00:05:31.460> use<00:05:31.670> skills

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
teams because it makes me use skills

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.020 
teams because it makes me use skills
that<00:05:33.080> I<00:05:33.110> normally<00:05:33.650> wouldn't<00:05:33.950> use<00:05:34.340> and<00:05:34.670> it

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
that I normally wouldn't use and it

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.550 
that I normally wouldn't use and it
makes<00:05:35.210> me<00:05:35.270> feel<00:05:35.480> emotions<00:05:35.990> that<00:05:36.110> are<00:05:36.230> normally

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
makes me feel emotions that are normally

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.200 
makes me feel emotions that are normally
wouldn't<00:05:36.830> feel<00:05:37.040> other<00:05:37.670> than<00:05:37.790> just<00:05:38.090> being

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
wouldn't feel other than just being

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.100 
wouldn't feel other than just being
mined<00:05:38.810> limiting<00:05:39.230> Lee<00:05:39.350> boring<00:05:39.830> you<00:05:40.460> know

that<00:05:52.010> gonna<00:05:52.190> take<00:05:52.400> advantage<00:05:52.610> of<00:05:52.880> the<00:05:53.030> system

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
that gonna take advantage of the system

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.230 
that gonna take advantage of the system
just<00:05:53.450> like<00:05:53.570> Halo<00:05:53.900> 3<00:05:54.070> but<00:05:55.070> for<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:55.640> most<00:05:55.790> part<00:05:55.910> I

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
just like Halo 3 but for the most part I

just like Halo 3 but for the most part I
I<00:05:56.780> hope<00:05:57.470> they<00:05:57.650> have<00:05:57.860> a<00:05:58.010> system<00:05:58.370> that<00:05:58.490> basically

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
I hope they have a system that basically

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.660 
I hope they have a system that basically
a<00:05:59.060> skill<00:05:59.330> based<00:05:59.540> system<00:05:59.930> that<00:06:00.920> thou<00:06:01.130> put<00:06:01.370> keep

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.670 
a skill based system that thou put keep

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.460 
a skill based system that thou put keep
bad<00:06:01.880> players<00:06:02.210> facing<00:06:02.720> bad<00:06:02.870> players<00:06:03.170> which

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
bad players facing bad players which

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.960 
bad players facing bad players which
make<00:06:03.680> them<00:06:03.800> feel<00:06:04.010> good<00:06:04.220> keep<00:06:04.520> good<00:06:04.700> players

facing<00:06:05.330> good<00:06:05.480> players<00:06:05.720> will<00:06:05.900> make<00:06:06.380> them<00:06:06.590> feel

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
facing good players will make them feel

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.590 
facing good players will make them feel
good<00:06:07.040> and<00:06:07.250> it<00:06:07.730> will<00:06:07.850> better<00:06:07.970> you<00:06:08.180> as<00:06:08.300> a<00:06:08.330> whole

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
but the idea is like how would they

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.160 
but the idea is like how would they
actually<00:06:10.550> implement<00:06:11.090> something<00:06:11.330> like<00:06:11.510> that<00:06:11.930> I

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
actually implement something like that I

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.250 
actually implement something like that I
don't<00:06:13.130> know<00:06:13.220> but<00:06:13.760> you<00:06:13.910> guys<00:06:14.060> voted<00:06:14.390> the<00:06:15.110> other
