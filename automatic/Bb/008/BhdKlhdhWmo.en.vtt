manager for Tamron he's going to show us

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.439 
manager for Tamron he's going to show us
a<00:00:17.140> couple<00:00:17.320> of<00:00:17.470> their<00:00:17.590> more<00:00:17.890> recent<00:00:17.949> models<00:00:18.580> Rob

a couple of their more recent models Rob

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.359 
a couple of their more recent models Rob
what<00:00:19.599> he<00:00:19.660> got<00:00:19.779> to<00:00:19.810> show<00:00:20.050> us<00:00:20.199> basically<00:00:21.189> we<00:00:21.279> have

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
what he got to show us basically we have

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.390 
what he got to show us basically we have
the<00:00:21.490> 18<00:00:22.119> to<00:00:22.359> 270<00:00:23.140> which<00:00:23.320> is<00:00:23.529> the<00:00:23.710> world's<00:00:24.009> first

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
the 18 to 270 which is the world's first

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.720 
the 18 to 270 which is the world's first
15<00:00:25.029> times<00:00:25.420> zoom<00:00:25.990> lens<00:00:26.320> this<00:00:27.070> will<00:00:27.250> shoot<00:00:27.460> wide

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
15 times zoom lens this will shoot wide

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.179 
15 times zoom lens this will shoot wide
angle<00:00:28.179> so<00:00:29.080> you<00:00:29.109> got<00:00:29.289> a<00:00:29.320> good<00:00:29.529> wide<00:00:29.679> angle<00:00:30.070> with

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
angle so you got a good wide angle with

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.190 
angle so you got a good wide angle with
that<00:00:30.400> you<00:00:30.759> have<00:00:30.880> good<00:00:31.119> telephoto<00:00:31.749> with<00:00:31.990> that

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
that you have good telephoto with that

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.709 
that you have good telephoto with that
and<00:00:32.410> then<00:00:32.439> this<00:00:32.680> will<00:00:32.860> also<00:00:33.399> shoot<00:00:33.730> macro<00:00:34.450> at

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
and then this will also shoot macro at

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.350 
and then this will also shoot macro at
approximately<00:00:35.410> 20<00:00:35.770> inches<00:00:36.070> from<00:00:36.309> your<00:00:36.399> eye<00:00:36.610> so

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
approximately 20 inches from your eye so

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.229 
approximately 20 inches from your eye so
it<00:00:37.480> truly<00:00:37.660> is<00:00:37.899> an<00:00:38.050> all-in-one<00:00:38.340> lens<00:00:39.340> I<00:00:39.640> does

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
it truly is an all-in-one lens I does

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.729 
it truly is an all-in-one lens I does
come<00:00:40.449> with<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.660> hood<00:00:40.899> included<00:00:41.350> in<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.530> price

warranty<00:00:51.550> on<00:00:51.579> it<00:00:51.879> and<00:00:52.300> that's<00:00:52.449> every<00:00:52.780> lens<00:00:52.989> of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
warranty on it and that's every lens of

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.720 
warranty on it and that's every lens of
ours<00:00:53.469> we<00:00:53.800> were<00:00:53.890> talking<00:00:54.160> before<00:00:54.190> a<00:00:54.430> little<00:00:54.609> bit

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
ours we were talking before a little bit

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.180 
ours we were talking before a little bit
too<00:00:54.850> but<00:00:55.090> Tim<00:00:55.750> runs<00:00:55.960> image<00:00:56.800> stabilization

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
too but Tim runs image stabilization

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.130 
too but Tim runs image stabilization
technology<00:00:57.609> is<00:00:58.329> a<00:00:58.600> little<00:00:58.809> bit<00:00:58.899> different

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
technology is a little bit different

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.630 
technology is a little bit different
your<00:00:59.230> vibration<00:00:59.649> compensation<00:00:59.800> and<00:01:00.460> what

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
your vibration compensation and what

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.919 
your vibration compensation and what
some<00:01:00.760> of<00:01:00.789> the<00:01:00.879> other<00:01:00.969> manufacturers<00:01:01.480> do<00:01:01.629> yes

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
some of the other manufacturers do yes

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.900 
some of the other manufacturers do yes
our<00:01:02.170> vibration<00:01:02.679> compensation<00:01:02.910> mechanism

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
our vibration compensation mechanism

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.030 
our vibration compensation mechanism
uses<00:01:04.239> three<00:01:04.600> coils<00:01:04.900> instead<00:01:05.439> of<00:01:05.590> two<00:01:05.799> it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
uses three coils instead of two it

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.800 
uses three coils instead of two it
actually<00:01:06.549> doesn't<00:01:06.729> have<00:01:06.939> to<00:01:07.090> process<00:01:07.420> the

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
actually doesn't have to process the

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.990 
actually doesn't have to process the
information<00:01:07.840> to<00:01:08.500> triangulate<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.340> third<00:01:09.610> or

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
information to triangulate the third or

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.450 
information to triangulate the third or
the<00:01:10.060> diagonal<00:01:10.810> movement<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.770> will<00:01:11.950> take<00:01:12.220> care

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
the diagonal movement it will take care

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.010 
the diagonal movement it will take care
of<00:01:12.520> that<00:01:12.670> with<00:01:12.909> the<00:01:12.939> third<00:01:13.270> coil<00:01:13.540> by<00:01:13.750> itself

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
of that with the third coil by itself

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.390 
of that with the third coil by itself
and<00:01:14.259> as<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:14.500> saw<00:01:14.710> when<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:14.920> were<00:01:15.009> using<00:01:15.220> the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
and as you saw when you were using the

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.910 
and as you saw when you were using the
camera<00:01:15.580> it<00:01:15.759> locks<00:01:16.090> right<00:01:16.509> on<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:16.960> subject<00:01:17.500> you

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
camera it locks right on to subject you

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.440 
camera it locks right on to subject you
don't<00:01:18.100> get<00:01:18.220> a<00:01:18.250> floating<00:01:18.700> effect<00:01:19.030> like<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.329> do

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
don't get a floating effect like you do

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.399 
don't get a floating effect like you do
with<00:01:19.570> some<00:01:19.689> of<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.869> other<00:01:19.900> image

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
with some of the other image

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.260 
with some of the other image
stabilization<00:01:20.860> mechanisms<00:01:21.790> that<00:01:21.909> are<00:01:21.970> in<00:01:22.150> the

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
stabilization mechanisms that are in the

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.450 
stabilization mechanisms that are in the
industry<00:01:22.750> so<00:01:23.170> it's<00:01:23.320> real<00:01:23.560> clean<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.070> does<00:01:24.220> lock

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
industry so it's real clean it does lock

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.670 
industry so it's real clean it does lock
on<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:24.700> hold<00:01:25.000> still<00:01:25.299> for<00:01:25.509> you<00:01:25.600> very<00:01:25.960> well<00:01:26.229> yeah

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
on it hold still for you very well yeah

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.960 
on it hold still for you very well yeah
those<00:01:26.860> are<00:01:27.009> myself<00:01:27.159> using<00:01:27.549> a<00:01:27.759> lot<00:01:27.939> of

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
those are myself using a lot of

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.300 
those are myself using a lot of
stabilized<00:01:28.780> lenses<00:01:29.140> it<00:01:29.259> doesn't<00:01:29.500> actually<00:01:29.590> it

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
stabilized lenses it doesn't actually it

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.310 
stabilized lenses it doesn't actually it
doesn't<00:01:30.490> vibrate<00:01:30.759> it<00:01:31.180> doesn't<00:01:31.420> jiggle<00:01:31.600> but<00:01:32.200> it

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
doesn't vibrate it doesn't jiggle but it

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.660 
doesn't vibrate it doesn't jiggle but it
kind<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.560> wanders<00:01:33.009> around<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.369> little<00:01:33.490> bit

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
kind of wanders around a little bit

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.030 
kind of wanders around a little bit
exactly<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.720> this<00:01:34.869> hold<00:01:35.170> still<00:01:35.500> for<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:35.829> and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
exactly and this hold still for you and

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.800 
exactly and this hold still for you and
it<00:01:36.100> perfectly<00:01:36.549> locks<00:01:36.939> on<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.329> first<00:01:37.570> thing

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
it perfectly locks on the first thing

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.420 
it perfectly locks on the first thing
that<00:01:37.840> you<00:01:38.079> lock<00:01:38.290> on<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.829> and<00:01:39.009> doesn't<00:01:39.310> have

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
that you lock on to and doesn't have

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.010 
that you lock on to and doesn't have
that<00:01:39.579> drifting<00:01:40.149> effect<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:40.689> just<00:01:40.899> spoke

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
that drifting effect that you just spoke

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.050 
that drifting effect that you just spoke
about<00:01:41.409> okay<00:01:42.070> and<00:01:42.159> I<00:01:42.220> have<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.399> wide<00:01:42.729> angle<00:01:42.909> zoom

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
about okay and I have a wide angle zoom

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.899 
about okay and I have a wide angle zoom
here<00:01:43.390> too<00:01:43.570> sure<00:01:43.810> do<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.170> 10<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.500> 24<00:01:45.040> over<00:01:45.820> the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
here too sure do the 10 to 24 over the

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.850 
here too sure do the 10 to 24 over the
last<00:01:46.060> few<00:01:46.270> years<00:01:46.329> with<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.930> smaller<00:01:47.229> sensors

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
last few years with the smaller sensors

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.120 
last few years with the smaller sensors
the<00:01:47.979> aps-c<00:01:48.659> sized<00:01:49.659> sensors<00:01:50.290> in<00:01:50.560> cameras

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
the aps-c sized sensors in cameras

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.010 
the aps-c sized sensors in cameras
there's<00:01:51.759> been<00:01:51.909> a<00:01:51.939> lot<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.119> demand<00:01:52.509> for<00:01:52.630> wide

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
there's been a lot of demand for wide

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.139 
there's been a lot of demand for wide
angle<00:01:53.530> it's<00:01:53.649> been<00:01:53.770> very<00:01:53.950> hard<00:01:54.189> to<00:01:54.430> achieve<00:01:54.549> at

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
angle it's been very hard to achieve at

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.539 
angle it's been very hard to achieve at
that<00:01:55.360> so<00:01:55.659> we<00:01:55.780> we<00:01:56.170> listened<00:01:56.649> we<00:01:57.100> came<00:01:57.310> out<00:01:57.460> with

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
that so we we listened we came out with

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.109 
that so we we listened we came out with
the<00:01:57.700> 10<00:01:57.909> to<00:01:58.060> 24<00:01:58.719> lens<00:01:59.680> so<00:01:59.920> basically<00:02:00.460> unlike<00:02:00.880> an

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
the 10 to 24 lens so basically unlike an

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.090 
the 10 to 24 lens so basically unlike an
icon<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:01.899> could<00:02:02.020> be<00:02:02.079> a<00:02:02.140> 15<00:02:02.469> i<00:02:02.500> can<00:02:02.799> it's<00:02:02.979> going

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
icon it could be a 15 i can it's going

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.920 
icon it could be a 15 i can it's going
to<00:02:03.159> be<00:02:03.219> a<00:02:03.250> 16<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.939> start<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:04.450> it<00:02:04.570> will<00:02:04.689> be<00:02:04.810> the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
to be a 16 to start so it will be the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.200 
to be a 16 to start so it will be the
widest<00:02:05.409> angle<00:02:05.680> lens<00:02:06.100> available<00:02:06.610> in<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
widest angle lens available in the

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.249 
widest angle lens available in the
industry<00:02:07.750> this<00:02:08.020> year<00:02:08.080> that's<00:02:08.680> in<00:02:08.890> is

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
industry this year that's in is

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.830 
industry this year that's in is
zoom<00:02:09.379> lens<00:02:09.679> like<00:02:09.920> this<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.549> then<00:02:10.909> at<00:02:11.030> 499<00:02:11.510> it's

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
zoom lens like this and then at 499 it's

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.970 
zoom lens like this and then at 499 it's
certainly<00:02:12.110> going<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.349> be<00:02:12.470> one<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.769> best

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
certainly going to be one of the best

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.490 
certainly going to be one of the best
priced<00:02:13.689> opportunities<00:02:14.689> wow<00:02:14.989> that's<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.409> that's

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
priced opportunities wow that's a that's

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.679 
priced opportunities wow that's a that's
right<00:02:15.650> price<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:16.040> like<00:02:16.400> romo<00:02:16.790> maybe<00:02:17.090> you

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
right price it's like romo maybe you

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:18.940 
right price it's like romo maybe you
know<00:02:17.810> sixty<00:02:18.200> percent<00:02:18.349> of<00:02:18.590> what<00:02:18.680> some<00:02:18.799> of<00:02:18.829> the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
know sixty percent of what some of the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.190 
know sixty percent of what some of the
manufactures<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.459> song<00:02:19.700> exactly<00:02:20.569> you<00:02:20.750> know<00:02:20.870> and

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
manufactures a song exactly you know and

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.350 
manufactures a song exactly you know and
part<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.769> reason<00:02:21.799> is<00:02:22.099> is<00:02:22.250> we<00:02:22.489> just<00:02:22.909> focus

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
part of the reason is is we just focus

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.539 
part of the reason is is we just focus
on<00:02:23.510> lenses<00:02:24.079> that's<00:02:24.349> what<00:02:24.650> we<00:02:24.860> do<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.280> because

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
on lenses that's what we do and because

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.369 
on lenses that's what we do and because
we<00:02:25.700> do<00:02:25.940> that<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.390> we've<00:02:26.810> refined<00:02:27.200> our

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
we do that and we've refined our

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.920 
we do that and we've refined our
technologies<00:02:28.069> over<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.280> long<00:02:28.459> period<00:02:28.489> of<00:02:28.849> time

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
technologies over a long period of time

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.210 
technologies over a long period of time
we<00:02:29.930> are<00:02:30.049> certainly<00:02:30.409> able<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.680> bring<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.040> type

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
we are certainly able to bring the type

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.220 
we are certainly able to bring the type
of<00:02:31.250> savings<00:02:32.000> from<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.480> type<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.840> research

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
of savings from that type of research

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.349 
of savings from that type of research
and<00:02:33.409> development<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.040> consumer<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:35.299> the

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
and development to the consumer and the

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.580 
and development to the consumer and the
thing<00:02:35.569> I<00:02:35.629> found<00:02:35.780> really<00:02:35.870> remarkable<00:02:36.409> about

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
thing I found really remarkable about

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.780 
thing I found really remarkable about
this<00:02:36.650> we<00:02:36.980> were<00:02:37.040> playing<00:02:37.220> with<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.430> off<00:02:37.519> camera

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
this we were playing with it off camera

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.940 
this we were playing with it off camera
beforehand<00:02:38.329> was<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.689> it's<00:02:39.379> amazingly

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
beforehand was that it's amazingly

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.199 
beforehand was that it's amazingly
rectilinear<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.640> mean<00:02:40.760> there's<00:02:40.909> very<00:02:41.120> very

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
rectilinear I mean there's very very

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.819 
rectilinear I mean there's very very
little<00:02:41.420> distortion<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.140> wrecked<00:02:42.379> it<00:02:42.500> out<00:02:42.620> very

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
little distortion I wrecked it out very

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.559 
little distortion I wrecked it out very
well<00:02:43.010> as<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.549> said<00:02:43.790> compared<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.299> some<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.480> the

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
well as you said compared to some of the

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.210 
well as you said compared to some of the
most<00:02:44.690> expensive<00:02:45.140> lenses<00:02:45.620> in<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.829> industry

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
most expensive lenses in the industry

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.920 
most expensive lenses in the industry
it's<00:02:46.370> corrected<00:02:46.790> out<00:02:46.879> real<00:02:47.120> well<00:02:47.299> more

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
it's corrected out real well more

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.780 
it's corrected out real well more
importantly<00:02:48.530> it's<00:02:48.590> optimized<00:02:49.340> for<00:02:49.489> a<00:02:49.609> digital

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
importantly it's optimized for a digital

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.699 
importantly it's optimized for a digital
sensor<00:02:50.450> which<00:02:50.599> is<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.780> wafer<00:02:51.260> instead<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.650> a

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
sensor which is a wafer instead of a

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.039 
sensor which is a wafer instead of a
flat<00:02:51.950> film<00:02:52.280> plane<00:02:52.900> basically<00:02:53.900> what<00:02:54.019> that

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
flat film plane basically what that

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.509 
flat film plane basically what that
means<00:02:54.200> is<00:02:54.500> we're<00:02:54.680> going<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:54.829> achieve<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.340> same

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
means is we're going to achieve the same

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:56.890 
means is we're going to achieve the same
brightness<00:02:55.909> in<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.299> corners<00:02:56.659> and<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.840> edges

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
brightness in the corners and the edges

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.199 
brightness in the corners and the edges
that<00:02:57.319> we<00:02:57.470> do<00:02:57.650> in<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:57.920> center<00:02:58.310> which<00:02:58.730> is<00:02:58.909> a<00:02:58.940> big

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
that we do in the center which is a big

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.059 
that we do in the center which is a big
problem<00:02:59.480> when<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.840> put<00:03:00.049> a<00:03:00.079> film<00:03:00.560> Lant<00:03:00.829> on<00:03:01.040> a

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
problem when you put a film Lant on a

problem when you put a film Lant on a
digital<00:03:01.340> body<00:03:01.819> you<00:03:02.000> have<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.150> lot<00:03:02.299> of<00:03:02.329> fall<00:03:02.720> off

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
digital body you have a lot of fall off

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.869
