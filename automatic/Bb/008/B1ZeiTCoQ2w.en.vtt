00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
in this tutorial what we're going to do

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.889 
in this tutorial what we're going to do
is<00:00:01.890> look<00:00:02.040> at<00:00:02.220> how<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.460> work<00:00:02.970> with<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.270> comic

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
is look at how to work with a comic

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.289 
is look at how to work with a comic
master<00:00:04.470> slide<00:00:04.799> where<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.490> panels<00:00:06.150> are

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
master slide where the panels are

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.480 
master slide where the panels are
actually<00:00:06.420> shapes<00:00:06.960> on<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.350> screen<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:08.099> then

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
actually shapes on the screen and then

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.879 
actually shapes on the screen and then
we're<00:00:08.610> going<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.790> fill<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.360> shapes<00:00:09.710> with<00:00:10.710> an

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
we're going to fill the shapes with an

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.350 
we're going to fill the shapes with an
image<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:12.030> what<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:13.049> have<00:00:13.259> here<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.889> if<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.360> look

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
image so what we have here is if we look

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.170 
image so what we have here is if we look
at<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:16.049> we've<00:00:16.740> got<00:00:17.010> all<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.460> our<00:00:17.609> layouts

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
at this is we've got all of our layouts

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.779 
at this is we've got all of our layouts
built<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.320> actual<00:00:19.710> slides<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.460> not<00:00:20.609> in

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
built on the actual slides and not in

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.290 
built on the actual slides and not in
the<00:00:20.880> master<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.680> then<00:00:22.820> these<00:00:23.820> are<00:00:23.880> actually

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
the master and then these are actually

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.240 
the master and then these are actually
shapes<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.990> what<00:00:25.109> we<00:00:25.199> want<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.529> do<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.010> have<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
shapes and what we want to do is have a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.050 
shapes and what we want to do is have a
panel<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:26.970> fill<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:28.109> shapes<00:00:28.500> with<00:00:29.490> an<00:00:29.670> image

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
panel we fill the shapes with an image

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.200 
panel we fill the shapes with an image
so<00:00:30.689> here's<00:00:31.109> where<00:00:31.489> what<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.610> want<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.090> is

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
so here's where what you want to do is

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.959 
so here's where what you want to do is
think<00:00:33.570> about<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.350> different<00:00:35.070> panels<00:00:35.820> you

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
think about the different panels you

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.510 
think about the different panels you
have<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.960> these<00:00:37.440> panels<00:00:37.890> are<00:00:38.040> all<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.280> same

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
have so these panels are all the same

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.780 
have so these panels are all the same
size<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.719> panel<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.640> is

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
size so this is a one panel here this is

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.600 
size so this is a one panel here this is
another<00:00:42.120> size<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.079> these<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> same<00:00:44.190> here

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
another size and these are the same here

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.340 
another size and these are the same here
this<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> same<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.660> size<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.260> we

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
this is the same as that size so we

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.799 
this is the same as that size so we
basically<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.890> two<00:00:47.070> panels<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.660> all

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
basically have two panels this is all

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.080 
basically have two panels this is all
the<00:00:48.960> same<00:00:49.170> size<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.100> then<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.640> come<00:00:50.850> down<00:00:50.879> to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the same size and then we come down to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.860 
the same size and then we come down to
these<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.530> then<00:00:52.680> there's<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> third<00:00:53.280> size

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
these here so then there's a third size

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.049 
these here so then there's a third size
1/4<00:00:54.870> size<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.739> fifth<00:00:56.010> size<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.670> these<00:00:56.820> are

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
1/4 size and a fifth size and these are

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.599 
1/4 size and a fifth size and these are
basically<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> same<00:00:58.020> as<00:00:58.320> well<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> have

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
basically the same as well so I have

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.119 
basically the same as well so I have
five<00:00:59.969> panels<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.289> what<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.469> want<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> do<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
five panels so what I want to do is

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.799 
five panels so what I want to do is
label<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.640> panel<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> be

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
label the panel so this is going to be

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.899 
label the panel so this is going to be
panel<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> want<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> create<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.830> master

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
panel one so I want to create a master

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.140 
panel one so I want to create a master
PowerPoint<00:01:08.909> slide<00:01:09.299> file<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.850> same

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
PowerPoint slide file that is the same

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.200 
PowerPoint slide file that is the same
aspect<00:01:12.720> ratio<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.520> when<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> click<00:01:15.060> on

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
aspect ratio is this so when I click on

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.380

by 475 so I'm going to go to page setup
I'm<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.680> create<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.270> be

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
I'm going to create this is going to be

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.990 
I'm going to create this is going to be
four<00:01:48.540> point<00:01:48.780> seven<00:01:49.110> five<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.850> going

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
four point seven five and this is going

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.920 
four point seven five and this is going
to<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.240> seven<00:01:51.869> point<00:01:52.320> 17<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.299> now<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.720> a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
to be seven point 17 and so now I have a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.700 
to be seven point 17 and so now I have a
PowerPoint<00:01:55.380> slide<00:01:56.030> that's<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.509> same<00:01:57.840> aspect

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
PowerPoint slide that's the same aspect

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.190 
PowerPoint slide that's the same aspect
ratio<00:01:58.829> as<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.460> panel<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.149> what<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.780> would<00:02:01.020> do

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
ratio as this panel so what I would do

those<00:04:38.320> panels<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.130> so<00:04:39.700> I've<00:04:39.850> got<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.540> bunch<00:04:40.840> of

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
those panels and so I've got a bunch of

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.420

different<00:04:41.290> slides<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:41.890> I<00:04:42.010> can<00:04:42.190> work<00:04:42.370> with

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
different slides that I can work with

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.300 
different slides that I can work with
and<00:04:42.970> so<00:04:43.540> I<00:04:43.570> basically<00:04:43.810> need<00:04:44.320> five<00:04:44.620> master

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
and so I basically need five master

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.790 
and so I basically need five master
slides<00:04:45.610> for<00:04:45.940> each<00:04:46.060> type<00:04:46.450> of<00:04:46.630> panel<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.320> then<00:04:47.710> I

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
slides for each type of panel and then I

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.500 
slides for each type of panel and then I
can<00:04:47.980> build<00:04:48.160> those<00:04:48.430> out<00:04:48.670> save<00:04:49.060> them<00:04:49.240> as<00:04:49.330> images

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
can build those out save them as images

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.290 
can build those out save them as images
and<00:04:49.990> bring<00:04:50.140> those<00:04:50.320> in<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.590> panels<00:04:51.040> and<00:04:51.270> when<00:04:52.270> I

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
and bring those in the panels and when I

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.640 
and bring those in the panels and when I
publish<00:04:52.840> this<00:04:52.990> will<00:04:53.170> actually<00:04:53.440> be<00:04:53.500> a<00:04:53.530> lot

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
publish this will actually be a lot

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.860 
publish this will actually be a lot
faster<00:04:53.950> because<00:04:54.940> it's<00:04:55.270> a<00:04:55.360> single<00:04:55.690> object

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
faster because it's a single object

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.460 
faster because it's a single object
rather<00:04:56.290> than<00:04:56.560> multiple<00:04:56.950> objects
