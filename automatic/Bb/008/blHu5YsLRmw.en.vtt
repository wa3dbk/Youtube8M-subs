works<00:00:23.130> absolutely<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> war<00:00:24.810> story

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
works absolutely so with the war story

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.839 
works absolutely so with the war story
system<00:00:25.470> where<00:00:25.590> we're<00:00:25.710> really<00:00:25.890> focused<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.400> is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
system where we're really focused on is

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.269 
system where we're really focused on is
realism<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:28.140> well<00:00:28.500> as<00:00:28.710> getting<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.039> lot<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
realism as well as getting a lot of

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.429 
realism as well as getting a lot of
complexity<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.150> very<00:00:30.330> simple<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.050> easy<00:00:31.230> to

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
complexity in a very simple and easy to

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.799 
complexity in a very simple and easy to
play<00:00:31.619> package<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.880> starting<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
play package and so starting with the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.680 
play package and so starting with the
the<00:00:34.469> realism<00:00:35.100> we've<00:00:35.610> really<00:00:35.910> focused<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.360> fog

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
the realism we've really focused on fog

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.229 
the realism we've really focused on fog
of<00:00:36.899> war<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.410> game<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.730> start<00:00:39.030> that

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
of war in this game and we start that

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.729 
of war in this game and we start that
with<00:00:39.420> having<00:00:39.690> two<00:00:39.930> different<00:00:40.110> scenario

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
with having two different scenario

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.889 
with having two different scenario
booklets<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> Soviet<00:00:42.420> player<00:00:42.629> has<00:00:42.870> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
booklets so the Soviet player has a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.360 
booklets so the Soviet player has a
booklet<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> german<00:00:43.920> player<00:00:44.129> has<00:00:44.340> a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
booklet and the german player has a

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.569 
booklet and the german player has a
booklet<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.660> framing<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.860> situation

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
booklet and it's framing the situation

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.619 
booklet and it's framing the situation
in<00:00:48.110> in<00:00:49.110> different<00:00:49.710> ways<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.129> only<00:00:50.510> we're<00:00:51.510> both

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
in in different ways so only we're both

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.689 
in in different ways so only we're both
looking<00:00:51.750> at<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.989> same<00:00:52.079> map<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:53.309> only<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
looking at the same map but only the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.240 
looking at the same map but only the
Soviet<00:00:54.270> player<00:00:54.510> knows<00:00:54.870> where<00:00:55.800> they're<00:00:56.039> going

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
Soviet player knows where they're going

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.979 
Soviet player knows where they're going
to<00:00:56.340> deploy<00:00:56.670> from<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:57.360> their<00:00:57.510> objectives

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
to deploy from or what their objectives

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.869 
to deploy from or what their objectives
are<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.170> their<00:00:58.559> units<00:00:58.920> are<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
are what their units are what the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.400 
are what their units are what the
situation<00:01:00.180> looks<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.960> German<00:01:01.320> is

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
situation looks like the German is

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.209 
situation looks like the German is
looking<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.710> from<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> very<00:01:02.100> different

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
looking at from a very different

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.609 
looking at from a very different
perspective<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:03.120> then<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> units<00:01:04.379> are<00:01:04.500> set

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
perspective and then the units are set

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
perspective and then the units are set
up<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:04.830> blocks<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.939> very<00:01:06.240> little

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
up with blocks so you have very little

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.750 
up with blocks so you have very little
idea<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:07.350> what's<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.610> other

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
idea of what's going on on the other

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.340 
idea of what's going on on the other
side<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.330> doing<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.659> game<00:01:09.869> one<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
side and doing this game one of the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.289 
side and doing this game one of the
things<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.280> research<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.180> is

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
things we really research is what is

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.480 
things we really research is what is
real<00:01:12.510> combat<00:01:12.930> life<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:14.070> real<00:01:14.280> life

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
real combat life and in real life

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.499 
real combat life and in real life
soldiers<00:01:14.850> didn't<00:01:15.030> always<00:01:15.119> know<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.420> they

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
soldiers didn't always know what they

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.179 
soldiers didn't always know what they
were<00:01:15.570> shooting<00:01:15.780> at<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.619> things<00:01:16.860> are<00:01:17.009> chaotic

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
were shooting at it's things are chaotic

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.710 
were shooting at it's things are chaotic
and<00:01:17.700> there'd<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:17.939> moments<00:01:18.150> they<00:01:18.420> knew<00:01:18.570> what

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and there'd be moments they knew what

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.880 
and there'd be moments they knew what
vehicle<00:01:19.020> they<00:01:19.110> were<00:01:19.200> shooting<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:19.770> most

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
vehicle they were shooting at but most

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.710 
vehicle they were shooting at but most
of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.070> time<00:01:20.189> they<00:01:20.340> didn't<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:21.299> want<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.540> get

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
of the time they didn't we want to get

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.420 
of the time they didn't we want to get
that<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.320> game<00:01:22.530> what<00:01:22.799> was<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> go

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
that in this game what was it like to go

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.679 
that in this game what was it like to go
through<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.670> field<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.240> not<00:01:24.360> know<00:01:24.540> if<00:01:24.600> you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
through a field and not know if you

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.050 
through a field and not know if you
might<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.869> blown<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.650> next<00:01:25.890> step<00:01:26.130> those

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
might be blown up in the next step those

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.340 
might be blown up in the next step those
are<00:01:27.180> all<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.330> kind<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.570> things<00:01:27.780> we're

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
are all the kind of things we're

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.710 
are all the kind of things we're
achieving<00:01:28.619> here<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:30.210> other<00:01:30.329> thing<00:01:30.600> we're

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
achieving here the other thing we're

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.390 
achieving here the other thing we're
focused<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.259> getting<00:01:31.619> all<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
focused on is getting all of the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.550 
focused on is getting all of the
complexity<00:01:33.030> communicated<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.259> playing

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
complexity communicated in the playing

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.399 
complexity communicated in the playing
pieces<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.970> terrain<00:01:36.360> pieces<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.170> map

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
pieces in the terrain pieces and the map

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.399 
pieces in the terrain pieces and the map
in<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.130> cards<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.820> come<00:01:39.060> with<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.360> game<00:01:39.540> and

in the combat ships that resolve the
combat<00:01:43.909> like<00:01:44.909> these<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:46.110> let's<00:01:46.470> first<00:01:46.770> talk

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
combat like these so let's first talk

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.530 
combat like these so let's first talk
about<00:01:47.040> movement<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:47.939> how<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.270> works

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
about movement and how that works

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.289 
about movement and how that works
movement<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.259> area<00:01:49.710> based<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.939> look<00:01:51.119> at

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
movement is area based so if you look at

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.539 
movement is area based so if you look at
the<00:01:51.390> map<00:01:51.600> you'll<00:01:52.500> see<00:01:52.590> for<00:01:53.009> example<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.490> is

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the map you'll see for example this is

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.310 
the map you'll see for example this is
an<00:01:53.820> area<00:01:54.149> where<00:01:54.329> all<00:01:54.450> these<00:01:54.630> hexes<00:01:55.140> are

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
an area where all these hexes are

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.310 
an area where all these hexes are
bounded<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.070> by<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.790> territory<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.079> one

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
bounded in by this territory so it's one

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.959 
bounded in by this territory so it's one
movement<00:01:58.619> point<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.189> move<00:01:59.340> across<00:01:59.460> that

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
movement point to move across that

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.060 
movement point to move across that
territory<00:02:00.509> because<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.500> very<00:02:01.619> easy<00:02:01.860> to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
territory because it's very easy to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.370 
territory because it's very easy to
traverse<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.540> if<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:03.719> look<00:02:03.869> at<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.110> hill

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
traverse but if we look at this hill

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.590 
traverse but if we look at this hill
over<00:02:04.740> here<00:02:04.920> next<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.310> it

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
over here next to it

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.540 
over here next to it
this<00:02:07.600> is<00:02:07.840> an<00:02:07.960> area<00:02:08.290> on<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.590> hill<00:02:08.800> so<00:02:09.040> it's<00:02:09.190> slow

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
this is an area on the hill so it's slow

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.520 
this is an area on the hill so it's slow
to<00:02:09.610> go<00:02:09.850> up<00:02:10.030> but<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.479> can<00:02:10.630> go<00:02:10.750> laterally<00:02:11.290> pretty

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
to go up but you can go laterally pretty

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.400 
to go up but you can go laterally pretty
quickly<00:02:11.800> this<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:13.080> crest<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.320> hill

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
quickly this is a crest of the hill

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.500 
quickly this is a crest of the hill
where<00:02:15.130> again<00:02:15.310> it's<00:02:15.490> slow<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.850> get<00:02:16.060> up<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.360> once

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
where again it's slow to get up and once

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.270 
where again it's slow to get up and once
you<00:02:16.600> get<00:02:16.720> up<00:02:16.780> there<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.320> can<00:02:17.710> really<00:02:17.920> scoot

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
you get up there you can really scoot

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.660 
you get up there you can really scoot
around<00:02:18.370> pretty<00:02:18.760> quickly<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:20.290> terrain<00:02:20.980> not

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
around pretty quickly so the terrain not

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.580 
around pretty quickly so the terrain not
only<00:02:21.820> does<00:02:21.940> it<00:02:22.000> have<00:02:22.180> all<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.540> unique<00:02:23.080> flavor

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
only does it have all this unique flavor

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.100 
only does it have all this unique flavor
and<00:02:24.100> personality<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:24.940> but<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.870> movement

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
and personality to it but the movement

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.800 
and personality to it but the movement
is<00:02:26.470> trivially<00:02:27.130> simple<00:02:27.370> where<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.450> can<00:02:28.600> say

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
is trivially simple where you can say

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.870 
is trivially simple where you can say
okay<00:02:29.050> I<00:02:29.080> have<00:02:29.260> one<00:02:29.290> movement<00:02:29.800> point<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.790> can

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
okay I have one movement point so I can

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.090 
okay I have one movement point so I can
go<00:02:30.940> anywhere<00:02:31.150> in<00:02:31.330> this<00:02:31.450> area<00:02:31.840> now<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.560> second

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
go anywhere in this area now a second

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.320 
go anywhere in this area now a second
movement<00:02:33.250> point<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.760> can<00:02:33.910> get<00:02:34.030> through<00:02:34.120> this

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
movement point I can get through this

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.780 
movement point I can get through this
dense<00:02:34.720> area<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.920> third<00:02:36.160> movement<00:02:36.400> point

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
dense area and a third movement point

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.070 
dense area and a third movement point
I'm<00:02:36.940> going<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.120> get<00:02:37.210> up<00:02:37.300> on<00:02:37.420> this<00:02:37.570> crust<00:02:37.840> and

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
I'm going to get up on this crust and

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.470 
I'm going to get up on this crust and
get<00:02:38.200> up<00:02:38.290> here<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:39.280> it's<00:02:39.670> really<00:02:39.910> simple<00:02:40.240> in

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
get up here so it's really simple in

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.790 
get up here so it's really simple in
real<00:02:40.600> life<00:02:40.870> soldiers<00:02:41.320> would<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.590> look<00:02:41.680> at

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
real life soldiers would just look at

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.740 
real life soldiers would just look at
the<00:02:41.890> terrain<00:02:42.220> ahead<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.580> them<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:42.730> decide<00:02:43.150> can

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
the terrain ahead of them and decide can

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.510 
the terrain ahead of them and decide can
I<00:02:43.840> make<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.080> can<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.470> sprint<00:02:44.740> across<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.280> am<00:02:45.459> I

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
I make it can I sprint across that am I

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.850 
I make it can I sprint across that am I
going<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.940> know<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.180> too<00:02:46.330> big<00:02:46.480> of<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.660> risk

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
going to you know it's too big of a risk

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.230 
going to you know it's too big of a risk
war<00:02:47.860> stories<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.459> same<00:02:48.670> there's<00:02:48.910> no<00:02:48.970> math

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
war stories is the same there's no math

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.970 
war stories is the same there's no math
there's<00:02:49.540> no<00:02:49.660> charts<00:02:50.140> there's<00:02:50.320> no<00:02:50.440> computing

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
there's no charts there's no computing

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.880 
there's no charts there's no computing
you<00:02:51.550> just<00:02:51.760> look<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:52.330> play<00:02:52.709> then<00:02:53.709> the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
you just look and you play then the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.710 
you just look and you play then the
other<00:02:54.040> thing<00:02:54.160> is<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.790> combat<00:02:55.270> you<00:02:55.570> know

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
other thing is the combat you know

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.300 
other thing is the combat you know
movement<00:02:56.080> in<00:02:56.140> combat<00:02:56.470> are<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.650> two<00:02:56.770> big<00:02:56.950> parts

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
movement in combat are the two big parts

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.030 
movement in combat are the two big parts
of<00:02:57.490> battle<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.260> way<00:02:59.350> combat<00:02:59.800> works

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
of battle and so the way combat works

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.990 
of battle and so the way combat works
we'll<00:03:00.280> pretend<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:00.850> we<00:03:00.970> have<00:03:01.090> this<00:03:01.240> su<00:03:01.690> 122

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
we'll pretend that we have this su 122

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.720 
we'll pretend that we have this su 122
sitting<00:03:04.000> right<00:03:04.209> here<00:03:05.310> shooting<00:03:06.310> at<00:03:06.550> this

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
sitting right here shooting at this

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.050 
sitting right here shooting at this
Panzer<00:03:07.600> Panther<00:03:08.440> d<00:03:08.740> which<00:03:09.580> is<00:03:09.610> sitting<00:03:10.030> right

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
Panzer Panther d which is sitting right

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.540 
Panzer Panther d which is sitting right
here<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:10.750> normally<00:03:11.410> they'd<00:03:11.530> be<00:03:11.590> hidden<00:03:11.980> we're

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
here so normally they'd be hidden we're

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.070 
here so normally they'd be hidden we're
going<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.730> tilt<00:03:12.970> them<00:03:13.120> down<00:03:13.269> for<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.510> example

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
going to tilt them down for the example

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.979 
going to tilt them down for the example
you<00:03:14.709> count<00:03:15.010> how<00:03:15.220> many<00:03:15.280> hexes<00:03:15.850> away<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.600> target

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
you count how many hexes away the target

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.850 
you count how many hexes away the target
is<00:03:17.080> 1<00:03:17.320> 2<00:03:17.530> 3<00:03:17.560> 4<00:03:18.310> 5<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.209> you<00:03:19.840> look<00:03:20.019> at<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.260> gun<00:03:20.500> and

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
is 1 2 3 4 5 and you look at the gun and

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.190 
is 1 2 3 4 5 and you look at the gun and
it<00:03:21.340> has<00:03:21.459> an<00:03:21.610> effective<00:03:22.030> range<00:03:22.090> of<00:03:22.540> five<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.140> a

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
it has an effective range of five and a

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
of the front armor as such you take an

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.839 
of the front armor as such you take an
upshift<00:03:52.840> on<00:03:53.139> the<00:03:53.230> combat<00:03:53.680> so<00:03:54.340> because<00:03:54.670> it's

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
upshift on the combat so because it's

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.059 
upshift on the combat so because it's
such<00:03:54.999> a<00:03:55.030> powerful<00:03:55.299> gun<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:56.290> made<00:03:56.799> what<00:03:57.010> would

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
such a powerful gun it made what would

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.860 
such a powerful gun it made what would
be<00:03:57.189> in<00:03:57.430> an<00:03:57.579> ineffective<00:03:58.030> shot<00:03:58.450> into<00:03:58.840> a

be in an ineffective shot into a

be in an ineffective shot into a
suppression<00:03:59.319> and<00:04:00.280> so<00:04:00.489> then<00:04:00.639> you<00:04:00.730> would<00:04:00.849> handle

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
suppression and so then you would handle

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.699 
suppression and so then you would handle
the<00:04:01.150> suppression<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:02.019> what<00:04:02.170> we've<00:04:02.290> done<00:04:02.319> there

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
the suppression so what we've done there

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.099 
the suppression so what we've done there
is<00:04:02.950> we've<00:04:03.129> replaced<00:04:03.519> a<00:04:03.879> guy<00:04:04.209> role<00:04:04.540> as<00:04:04.840> well<00:04:05.019> as

so<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.270> Germans<00:05:04.479> might<00:05:04.780> be<00:05:04.930> assigned<00:05:05.169> in<00:05:05.349> mg

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
so the Germans might be assigned in mg

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.529 
so the Germans might be assigned in mg
34<00:05:06.009> but<00:05:06.820> they<00:05:06.940> might<00:05:07.120> have<00:05:07.240> been<00:05:07.330> assigned

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
34 but they might have been assigned

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.899 
34 but they might have been assigned
three<00:05:07.840> mg<00:05:08.229> 34<00:05:08.560> s<00:05:08.949> and<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.520> way<00:05:09.610> that<00:05:09.789> that's

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
three mg 34 s and the way that that's

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.390 
three mg 34 s and the way that that's
indicated<00:05:10.630> is<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:11.199> german<00:05:11.560> player<00:05:11.830> has<00:05:12.159> these

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
indicated is the german player has these

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.969 
indicated is the german player has these
markers<00:05:13.080> numbered<00:05:14.080> 1<00:05:14.320> through<00:05:14.349> 10<00:05:14.740> and

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
markers numbered 1 through 10 and

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.020 
markers numbered 1 through 10 and
there's<00:05:15.099> two<00:05:15.250> of<00:05:15.280> them<00:05:15.400> that<00:05:15.610> correspond<00:05:16.000> to

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
there's two of them that correspond to

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.420 
there's two of them that correspond to
each<00:05:16.120> other<00:05:16.300> one<00:05:16.570> and<00:05:16.750> one<00:05:16.960> so<00:05:17.770> behind<00:05:18.009> their

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
each other one and one so behind their

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.700 
each other one and one so behind their
shield<00:05:18.789> this<00:05:19.690> is<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:19.960> Soviet<00:05:20.380> shield<00:05:20.560> of<00:05:20.650> the

german<00:05:21.039> player<00:05:21.190> we<00:05:21.280> also<00:05:21.400> have<00:05:21.550> a<00:05:21.610> shield<00:05:21.849> off

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
would have a one on the mg34 and then

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.249 
would have a one on the mg34 and then
they<00:05:27.729> would<00:05:27.849> have<00:05:27.880> a<00:05:27.969> one<00:05:28.330> next<00:05:28.930> to<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.050> piece

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
they would have a one next to the piece

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:31.860 
they would have a one next to the piece
on<00:05:29.469> the<00:05:29.560> board<00:05:29.740> so<00:05:30.639> is<00:05:30.789> the<00:05:30.909> Soviet<00:05:31.330> player<00:05:31.539> you

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
know that there's something special

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.499 
know that there's something special
about<00:05:33.610> this<00:05:33.789> unit<00:05:34.000> if<00:05:34.060> you<00:05:34.120> don't<00:05:34.300> know<00:05:34.360> what

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
about this unit if you don't know what

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.719 
about this unit if you don't know what
it<00:05:34.630> is<00:05:34.810> and<00:05:35.199> that<00:05:35.800> is<00:05:35.830> helping<00:05:36.219> the<00:05:36.310> German<00:05:36.639> to

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
it is and that is helping the German to

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.760 
it is and that is helping the German to
remember<00:05:37.150> so<00:05:37.360> you<00:05:37.389> could<00:05:37.570> have<00:05:37.599> a<00:05:37.719> two<00:05:37.990> on<00:05:38.710> a

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
remember so you could have a two on a

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.310 
remember so you could have a two on a
different<00:05:39.159> one<00:05:39.250> in<00:05:39.370> a<00:05:39.430> 2<00:05:39.639> and<00:05:39.880> a<00:05:39.909> 3<00:05:39.940> and<00:05:40.240> a<00:05:40.270> 3<00:05:40.449> so

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
different one in a 2 and a 3 and a 3 so

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.550 
different one in a 2 and a 3 and a 3 so
you<00:05:41.380> can<00:05:41.949> really<00:05:42.099> stack<00:05:42.490> two

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
you can really stack two

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.140 
you can really stack two
but<00:05:45.560> then<00:05:45.710> there's<00:05:45.920> other<00:05:46.070> other<00:05:46.460> things<00:05:46.790> like

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
but then there's other other things like

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.330 
but then there's other other things like
the<00:05:47.750> howitzer<00:05:48.230> for<00:05:48.440> example<00:05:48.830> a<00:05:48.890> big<00:05:49.070> artillery

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
the howitzer for example a big artillery

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.520 
the howitzer for example a big artillery
strike<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:50.480> way<00:05:50.600> that<00:05:50.840> works<00:05:51.080> is<00:05:51.260> there's<00:05:51.470> a

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
strike the way that works is there's a

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.410 
strike the way that works is there's a
card<00:05:51.830> of<00:05:51.950> events<00:05:52.340> there's<00:05:52.580> a<00:05:52.670> deck<00:05:53.030> of<00:05:53.060> event

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
card of events there's a deck of event

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.870 
card of events there's a deck of event
cards<00:05:53.720> in<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:53.930> game<00:05:54.080> each<00:05:54.620> turn<00:05:54.980> one<00:05:55.250> event<00:05:55.640> is

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
cards in the game each turn one event is

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.680 
cards in the game each turn one event is
executed<00:05:57.280> this<00:05:58.280> would<00:05:58.670> be<00:05:58.790> secretly<00:05:59.240> put<00:05:59.450> into

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
executed this would be secretly put into

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.360 
executed this would be secretly put into
the<00:05:59.780> event<00:05:59.990> deck<00:06:00.200> by<00:06:00.350> the<00:06:00.380> player<00:06:00.680> who<00:06:00.890> has<00:06:01.070> it

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
the event deck by the player who has it

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.520 
the event deck by the player who has it
and<00:06:01.520> then<00:06:02.240> the<00:06:02.420> deck<00:06:02.750> gets<00:06:02.930> all<00:06:03.050> shuffled<00:06:03.290> up

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
and then the deck gets all shuffled up

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.740 
and then the deck gets all shuffled up
and<00:06:03.830> so<00:06:04.520> as<00:06:04.730> the<00:06:04.880> Germans<00:06:05.330> I<00:06:05.420> know<00:06:05.480> in
