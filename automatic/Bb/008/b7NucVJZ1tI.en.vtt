00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:24.630
 Flying horse is straight Speaking visited the principles in that we need to understand 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:29.189
 Today's day is to touch the factor so that we can understand it. 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.890
 There is not a single word that says wrong in the world 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.449
 This is the right word. 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:41.370
 Maedeon it shatters the world is fashioned way itgekkeum's all you can write the 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:44.430
 It's coming out of the world.

 Do not say it's wrong . 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:55.409
 This is an incredibly useful tool , depending on how you write. 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.210
 Yoreotge did the world is not wrong to be fashioned by 0.1 Future also only be 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.840
 There is no place. 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:06.140
 Well, it's just a way of casting or denting . 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:10.820
 I mean, it's nice to be able to solve some of the things you say outside. 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:14.409
 Do not be the tail of the dragon head that I called Be a Party 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:19.560
 Said ganeunya how loose the horses urine 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.560
 It's all up to you if you want to be head. 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.970
 I called eomchinah be born chicken heads chicken heads that philosophy should strive c 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.110
 I'm talking. 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:35.400
 Head's release of the release of the head per side telling what God Nha Dome Abe heads 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.600
 We'll take this one to become our frog's hind legs. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.400
 I'm here. 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.189
 And if we have to talk about what it means to be a head, 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.320
 Give me a small group of hair. 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:56.200
 The dragon's head is talking about a big group of heads . 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.970
 I am the head of a large group, 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.479
 I'm talking. 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.830
 The story of a chicken head tells the story of going out with a group 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.620
 Will 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:12.350
 So what is Brad Van Dagger 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:14.510
 What are you going to do? 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.420
 It's just the head . 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.420
 There's a couple of guys out there with their heads . 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:28.350
 So in this world 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:31.740
 All from small groups to large groups of land. 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:37.080
 The head is talking about the head . 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:42.650
 Does this retirement qualify to lead the group? 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.650
 Give me a little something . Well , then who is the tail? 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:50.989
 From the mass of the Sun to the simple things that you'll talk Tail 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.200
 The principles must be solved properly. 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:03:00.200
 Uh, I'm going to do something. 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:02.000
 It is intelligent and necessary for many people to lead 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.120
 This man 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.629
 It's sitting in your head, so if you lead without it, you're in trouble here. 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:16.909
 Take this head and pull it back. 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:18.379
 It makes me fall. It does not let me lie. 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:22.459
 I made it. 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.569
 Well, this is where I can lead, but here's another test . 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.370
 Come on. 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:31.639
 This is where you might face two weight not to go anymore to lead you with 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.329
 If it does not work, it's about the party that left it here. 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:38.840
 These groups belong to another. 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:43.310
 No, I made my hair again and it was cracked. 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.459
 Yoreotge Nature is the horse and the exact operation 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.390
 So head and tail 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:54.739
 If you do the simplest thing, you buy the life of the tail. 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.180
 The intelligent one and that one and the center of gravity, which is living with the head 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:02.840
 It is. 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:07.489
 Yogeo life, not who I wanted to be the head What are you doing that you 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:12.409
 Because I have not received such power, I can never go to that position. 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.849
 So you're in the spot , three days, seven days, three years. 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:19.070
 I only have 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:20.870
 You taste the exact spot is not the spot on the form that I 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.039
 That is to sit down 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:29.539
 Do not waste this life, you know well. 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:36.269
 I know where you are and you live there. 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:42.610
 One who brilliantly to head horse should respect me live 

00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:45.460
 I am the one in the best seat and I live in the middle seat 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:50.770
 I respect two minutes. 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:53.580
 So if a person with a notice falls out of my place and I live in shine 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:59.160
 I respect you. 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:00.690
 In the middle, there's no return under me and you shine even if you're good 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.180
 Because I live 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:08.600
 It is a bird that is shining brightly in the notice. 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:13.480
 On top of that, 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.480
 I love life that lives in the light . 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.750
 It's the way it works, so we got it in the middle, 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.590
 So the horns do not love you. 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:31.020
 I'm sweeping the yard from the bottom to the top. 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:35.430
 If you are faithful to your work and live in this life of shining interest 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.430
 I always care about you. 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:42.570
 You should not see your boss at once. 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.220
 I really like you because you gave it up under your unconditional love 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:49.380
 It's not the same. 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:55.380
 I do so merely give a real look at him in sincerity and true self. What 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:58.960
 The person who is working hard with his figure, after some time 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:02.009
 Here I see the light. 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.009
 I love this guy . 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:11.789
 So why do not we use factor 2 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:17.639
 When the scale control what Yongmeori and what charm, what party heads wet 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:24.110
 If you know what you're doing , 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:24.110
 It 's important to factor my position precisely . 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:33.610
 The future of the people now while releasing all the social 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:38.500
 Someone will unlock some place to make sense of it . 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:42.889
 You're gonna let yourself know you. 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:47.160
 No, I 'm going to let you know exactly what you're doing on the scale. 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:51.599
 There's nothing wrong with arguments . 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:58.369
 These basic things are there is little toad spend now technically engaged in society because I come 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:07:03.520
 You 're wandering all the way because you 're not doing it too much . 

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:07.920
 The best place to live is to shine this spot 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.920
 There's nothing more fun and glad than that. 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:16.480
 Now this whole paradigm, from the top to make this future society now 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.480
 You have to catch it all. 

00:07:40.119 --> 00:07:49.970
 Not energy mass. 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:51.890
 Which it is named for stories that measures a huge big mass of energy 

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.440
 It is. 

00:07:51.890 --> 00:08:00.680
 This leads to a huge crowd . 

00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:04.300
 I can turn this off and I can handle this energy to be the first head here . 

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.300
 I have to give this energy.
