00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.900
 do not 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.900
 from how they are and well they are 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.460
 welcome here to the first guide of 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.920
 achievements of the champions 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.140
 4 and well for this occasion 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.090
 I will bring a guide of two achievements two achievements 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.010
 very simple but good some people 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.240
 well you can complicate them ok 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.250
 first of them good let's do the 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.470
 managed to grab the rocket when starting the 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.050
 game on the pitbull or pit map 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.150
 ok and well, this is very simple, 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.370
 requires let's say that the greatest science 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.840
 eye this achievement can be easy and difficult 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.149
 at a time since you have to compete 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.590
 against your team that does not earn you what 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.090
 it's been the rocket ok 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.070
 here I recommend you then start 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.930
 to throw granada lounge loop is the best 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.179
 the best option and good simply 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.739
 they need to grab it is not so nice 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.449
 well I just hold it with the 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.429
 made to do the action of grabbing it is 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.739
 more than enough ok I recommend them 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.480
 run and the grenades ok now we're going 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.609
 here it comes saying the second managed 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.970
 the second one managed for this means 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:06.130
 change the achievement is called parking 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.650
 or something like park the store how to put 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.690
 the store something like that and well then this 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.450
 logo means change or you have to 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.990
 change a minute in one place without 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.820
 die or that this achievement is doomed to me 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.770
 it did not come out on the map of vertigo is not 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.510
 well I do not know if it is judged as such by 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.090
 at least to me the map of vertigo does not 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.200
 it came out ok and the best option that I gave them 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.300
 I recommend it is to put on a 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.580
 corner because where you move tantito 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.950
 the control that moves tantito and 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.330
 let's say the symbol appears in the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.680
 radar because hey you know that good 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.260
 when you're not on the radar or with you 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.970
 still your point does not appear then in 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.860
 some time if that 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.260
 small point in what has been the 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.479
 radar means that the achievement is no longer going 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.220
 to go out and good as I tell you better 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.960
 recommended to be seeing for the wall and 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.700
 grab a game that good is very 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.920
 focused on objectives in the good case 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.570
 here from ricochet it's not good to be 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.300
 killing if they are inserting the 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.570
 ball and in what is still the 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.520
 field or the field to be and good is 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.960
 where you have to take advantage of you to 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.700
 put you to change that is a good place 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.769
 in fact there are better places and good 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.880
 plant the store ok then good 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.630
 people, I hope you have served them 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.310
 remember to give 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.620
 and if they liked it and well then I would 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.620
 dismissal see you next and peace
