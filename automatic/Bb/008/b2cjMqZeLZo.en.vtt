00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.049
 Speech earns rescue by bringing more video 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:18.449
 Gameplay comments from there for you this time 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.269
 with the new gun and buffalo in a paula of 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.099
 h1 each of you 30 I did well 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.900
 fast a good game I would ask for one 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.060
 Bit of buying you leave for having 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.349
 absent in a few videos and a 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.999
 little page 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.439
 Only I 'm not with you lately. 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:34.620
 So much desire to be playing 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.470
 Personal crossfire is do not know why not 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.840
 I lost my free will because I 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.850
 said in the other video last one of the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.590
 things that make me want to play the most 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.600
 after failure when he was given a chance at 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.950
 black market and lately they are not 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.800
 more able to gain nothing in the market 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.080
 black so this so goes weaving 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.420
 a little more down and lately 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.490
 I'm playing more calls even more 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.100
 so I do not know if I'm going to give that 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.420
 routine of always being there, bringing a 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.760
 video for you guys are not playing 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.280
 crossfire but can only rest easy 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.770
 that I will not abandon a channel, it 's just 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.450
 everybody, even there, even today, I 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.960
 I was back here, I decided to bring this 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.280
 I played there for you guys. 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.520
 I guess whoever says to sink I collected the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.909
 17 boxes in the etecs I'm not mistaken 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.070
 she did not appear and then I did not win and 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.880
 had added I think a bpn case I went 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.560
 including buffalo there doing it there 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.810
 This gameplay for you, I will not be 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.390
 making use of the weapon because with certainty 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.759
 For me it will not be so advantageous because 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.890
 there are channels then speak much bigger 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.829
 as today is sure to bring in 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.409
 a level of that weapon then with certainty 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.959
 for them it will be more advantageous because 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.929
 already has a one cube right for that type 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:53.509
 of this type of video then the project 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.849
 I bring it here will not bring much 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.439
 mobilization with my good channel but only 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.599
 I say a little bit about this weapon. 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.920
 she is a revolver and core of several 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:04.069
 I hope you do not have seven more. 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.950
 terrorists are anti aeep type guns 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.799
 Face this gun until a good revolver 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.079
 Good if you're going to shoot her in the head. 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.900
 managed to still kill with cingo de 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:18.110
 a shot but only if you or shoot the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.260
 body then it takes two stretches there 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.799
 to kill dp where you hit it of course and 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.959
 also there is a slow make so on the hour 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.940
 that you take away, you'll realize if you 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.459
 is accustomed to going with jo to play with 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.900
 a desert of life you will soon 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.930
 realize that it 's a brand 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.940
 for you to get used to it. 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.530
 it will take a little bit but only 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.540
 then you're sure to get the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.359
 But how did I tell you to take 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.630
 on the head is a very good weapon a good 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.340
 gun and I just tested it anyway 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.609
 revolver has no star with others 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.980
 weapons in case of suit to to talk to 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.540
 You get in the case with an inep 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.209
 it interferes with something in the clicrbs 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.230
 Blip then I left the next but only 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.810
 that's what I said 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.489
 If it's for you to play in a stole, I'll 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.889
 If only you had a baby 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.160
 Leaving there for sure would be catching on 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:12.740
 Tonight to just try. 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.230
 All right, that 's what I'm going to do, too. 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.610
 realized lately it's kind of 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.070
 quite leg 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.840
 Then you can see that the 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.210
 I'm going to kill you in the video gameplay 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.670
 office and through the shot will not catch him 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.820
 elton playing tell me how colleagues and 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.800
 out of nowhere in a ping of the whole world of 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.750
 room is not just my fifth embezzlement. 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.180
 everyone from room to room rises to 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.950
 200 and a little there almost nobody 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.310
 can play and will have to leave the 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.410
 room sometimes goes back to voting 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.080
 from oleg fifa this is a pretty word 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.090
 boring even though as I said in 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.000
 another video will solve this problem that 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.900
 is recording there with a sexual boy 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.140
 with flex 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.510
 then the fps of the game fall at least this 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.250
 problem they solved but like you 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.320
 They know right staff every update 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.900
 flash for the verb in the future and in the 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.910
 next to me that solves this question 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.220
