00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello everyone with you ester and today i 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.100
 I would like to tell you about how 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.580
 contrite current meta 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.040
 namely snipers bold out of sff 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.660
 trolls and the like to start 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.139
 consider their strengths 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.330
 what they have on the sniper example have 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.789
 quite large mobility especially in 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.910
 case Juggernaut we have trawled 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.769
 huge demage and afterwards if 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.420
 have a lot of frags then get another 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.939
 some sonjon yashu which 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.850
 later gives a lot of health 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.489
 however , how to counter from these heroes I 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.879
 I think not everyone knows about it but still 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.309
 I will try to explain such heroes are afraid 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.980
 the focus is i think is quite understandable then 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.950
 there is if you focus on them 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.930
 then you will naturally endure one of 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.110
 best heroes to do this 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.260
 this is bane he is forgotten now but he is very 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.180
 strong support and i was actually in 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.730
 each game would have sounded like that 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.100
 opportunity because bane has two 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.280
 abilities which design from enemy one 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.330
 of them punches bkb for some 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.909
 there are even cases 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.799
 reduced to damage if you go offline 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.229
 it also helps a lot 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.470
 before I didnâ€™t farm well naturally clean 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.990
 300 to 300 pure demage that too 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.630
 very, very much how it works 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.700
 just bane fits for example gandhi 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.630
 yuzat finn creak in any of these 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.490
 comrades at least then leave all the role here 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.400
 or the sniper is not important anyway 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.530
 kill you you get and principle on this 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.439
 everything would have ended if not for one 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.390
 bane's weakness namely what he is 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.780
 casts ult u can not do anything it 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.409
 easy to shoot down so this hero is probably 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.130
 not the most perfect vadim enter such 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.180
 be quiet do 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.100
 we introduce the father but the hero as I have 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.180
 told not very strong in timfayte 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.310
 if he focuses 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.229
 and therefore there is another hero who 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.729
 the current metrite is very, very strong 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.619
 it likes it comrades very strong 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.349
 hero against all these four 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.060
 characters, I say again that it 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:15.010
 snipers trolls out there sf and things like that 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.569
 he is strong firstly because he has 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.790
 Ulta how many s650 meat and here for these 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.730
 18 seconds while he has an ult 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.370
 the body can calmly run over to these not 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.430
 most enjoyable characters and calm 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.830
 fill their face but if he doesn't have it 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.799
 it turns out that the problem is likely 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.290
 in the player because hatch even having there 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.110
 a little formal can calm yourself 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.380
 buy vladimir bkb or vladimir no edges 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.819
 and go already really break the roof 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.010
 catch the lycans and he will say so wrong 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.019
 just not having any instant 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.290
 Mill well, and even more so if he gathers 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.780
 bkb the principle he has nobody 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.959
 he becomes very strong in this respect 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.430
 and strain the enemy with Roshan is also very 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.500
 nice because 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.139
 and juggernaut troll too i can 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.780
 going to arshana well and do it 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:11.680
 for the first time than I think they will be good 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.290
 bonus for the whole team who else are from 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.560
 dota heroes are very strong right now 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.530
 country plan these are not the most pleasant 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.930
 comrades and the legion commander it 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.480
 probably the last hero is big here 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.799
 I do not remember at the moment but legion 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.350
 commander is also very strong 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.880
 Generally heroes principle any work 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.540
 who have some 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.530
 in the ice that is lycan has a huge with 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.980
 bane has 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.109
 excellent camp legion commander in general 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.930
 collects blink blade mail and go 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.420
 ultuet for example jagernaut that his 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.370
 beats gets damaged ultu hands from 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.680
 blade mail and the whole team switches 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.959
 Immediately on legion and any there 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.229
 enigma flies in and finishes everyone in general 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.209
 Strategic opportunities for at 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:00.720
 least legionnah much more than 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.360
 other heroes and in fact 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.610
 in it very much so if you 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.800
 want to lock in the current meta if you 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.190
 tired of the sniper who you constantly 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.740
 killing is going to blink on those legion 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.459
 fly into him and tell him to give up 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.100
 dates are also very good invisibles 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.840
 against sniper well it's still rare 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.330
 cases because snipers are going 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.330
 sometimes not even fat 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.580
 quite difficult okay everyone thanks for 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.640
 I told you three heroes now 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.000
 who at least in my experience well 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:39.660
 played out against the current meta 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.700
 Naturally there is more but about them you 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.590
 you can guess yourself 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.870
 principle of operation I told you well 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.650
 ok everyone thanks for watching with you 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.130
 was keen 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.130
 until
