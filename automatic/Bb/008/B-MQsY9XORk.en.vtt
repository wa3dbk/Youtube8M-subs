00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.009
 Welcome to your comic world today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.309
 I show you how to make a million from 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.200
 the film I just incorrigible 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:13.820
 draws therefore makes your pencils and 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.820
 forms ready much fun 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.840
 so we put a minimum on the sheet 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:01:04.440
 we can draw magic first 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:01:07.890
 rectangle in the upper quarter we draw 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.050
 a horizontal for his eyes and in 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.320
 the middle a short line for his 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.320
 courage 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.140
 then we round off the corners and set 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:39.050
 his legs with a trapeze and tom 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:42.590
 rectangle right and left we draw 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.440
 his hands with two prizes before his 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.600
 big glasses will be round like a ball 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:54.020
 he draws the eyes and then 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:56.300
 the glasses over it then he still gets 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.200
 a small smile and then 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.200
 his dungarees 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.780
 We still draw under his legs 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.640
 his tiny feet in the middle of the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.950
 dungarees is still a bag 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.950
 on which the logo of pit finds 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.810
 On top of his head we show one more 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:46.299
 a few hairs with a mid-peak that 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.150
 Just a few strokes we are 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.189
 actually as good as done when 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.000
 We have defined his hands 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.000
 we'll go right now 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.620
 We drive the lines with one 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.260
 fineliner and use for one 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.410
 very thin fineliner we only want 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.460
 the lines after newspapers 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.240
 or lift out and the 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.100
 get pencil line away and that 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.960
 we use adjuster pitt matt light 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:40.160
 forget about 0.05 millimeters thick 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.570
 not trace the lines very thinly 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.450
 yes, because we are drawing this 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.980
 Do not want to have any grieving 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.890
 we can trace the drawing 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.540
 again a few comic world news who listens 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.940
 and see I have a sd card again 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.170
 for my camera anyway I will be the 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.600
 next four weeks at the weekend 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.400
 have time to prepare videos 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.830
 since I'm out of the house during the week 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.600
 I will use these two days around 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.000
 to entertain you for a week 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.560
 anyway so that is informed if 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.560
 once a week the week fails 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.990
 so now we start again on the whole 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.220
 3d look and use like 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.220
 for that the capital market 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.479
 lately I often have that 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.070
 get with quite normal wood and 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.199
 pencil out the pictures 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.169
 the comic brand for you much too expensive 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.690
 are and I thought that agent here 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.760
 a nice idea is to show you 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.919
 how to do similar with cheaper pens 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:56.330
 can achieve effects must indeed not 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:58.639
 impossible but I have stop right now 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.590
 very few crayons as I am very 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.510
 rarely work with it but I will 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.800
 very soon which ones grow and you one 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.800
 show some tricks 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.009
 so if we make our lines beautiful 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.659
 set and shocked put 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.270
 At the end we put the shade under 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:22.770
 his feet that with pictures the 3d 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.770
 should appear very much 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.410
 yes that's it already today you know 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.690
 now how to conjure millions of blood 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.900
 now it is up to you to imitate 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:48.820
 So have fun drawing and see you 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.820
 next time a comic will be
