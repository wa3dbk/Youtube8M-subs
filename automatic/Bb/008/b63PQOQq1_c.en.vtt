00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.049
 hi then in with this video I answer 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.810
 to a girl who asks me to help her 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.500
 because he never manages to make one 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.330
 precise tail when using the pencil 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.390
 the pencil in fact always results 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.259
 too soft is when looking for 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.370
 make the lateral codeine comes 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:38.190
 always a stretch that is always too round 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.770
 and not just a little thing defined is 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.310
 thin as she would like then the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.370
 secret what is to trace 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.590
 first the pencil line along the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.370
 upper edge of the eye and then 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.850
 intervene for the external corner with a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.100
 flat brush is angled like this 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.080
 I have already traced my line of 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.460
 pencil now 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:10.460
 I proceed by stretching the codeine holding the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.460
 brush in this sense towards the outside 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:20.990
 so I follow the pencil line I have 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.990
 traced and then pulled outwards 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.710
 how can you see the pencil lines in 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.310
 this way is much more decisive and much more 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.560
 thinner than when the 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.180
 let's draw with the same pencil then 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.250
 I proceed in the same way 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.760
 on the other eye always on the corner 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.760
 external 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.660
 well these are the two little things that 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.220
 we created 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.470
 thanks to this brush then first 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.110
 apply the pencil to the upper edge 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.360
 of the eye and then to realize codeine 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.540
 if we want a little more precise a little 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.220
 thinner helping us precisely with 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.010
 this brush 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.540
 I hope to see you as a helpful of 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.410
 to have been useful to all the girls 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.940
 who wanted to know this little one 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.010
 trick is true I need this 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.280
 help and see you at the next video 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.280
 Hello
