00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.330 
didn't really believe him i'm very
skeptical<00:00:35.880> about<00:00:36.149> people<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.630> claim<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.860> be

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
skeptical about people that claim to be

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.400 
skeptical about people that claim to be
involved<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.180> video<00:00:39.780> game<00:00:39.840> company

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
involved in a video game company

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.440 
involved in a video game company
especially<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.520> reddit<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.120> say<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.300> least

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
especially on reddit to say the least

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.389 
especially on reddit to say the least
because<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.140> very<00:00:43.260> easy<00:00:43.530> pretend<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.250> be

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
because it's very easy pretend to be

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.910 
because it's very easy pretend to be
someone<00:00:44.730> you're<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:45.260> especially<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.289> reddit

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
someone you're not especially on reddit

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100 
someone you're not especially on reddit
because<00:00:47.219> these<00:00:47.670> fake<00:00:47.940> leaks<00:00:48.239> can't<00:00:48.660> really<00:00:48.960> be

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
because these fake leaks can't really be

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.810 
because these fake leaks can't really be
proven<00:00:49.530> wrong<00:00:49.710> until<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> game<00:00:50.399> comes<00:00:50.670> out

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
proven wrong until the game comes out

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.880 
proven wrong until the game comes out
but<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.600> i<00:00:51.750> read<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.230> guy<00:00:52.379> made<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> lot<00:00:52.860> of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
but as i read on this guy made a lot of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.350 
but as i read on this guy made a lot of
sense<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.370> was<00:00:53.460> very<00:00:53.640> professionally<00:00:54.239> written

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
sense it was very professionally written

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.600 
sense it was very professionally written
and<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:55.230> theory<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.620> pretty<00:00:55.890> popular<00:00:56.160> it's

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
and this theory is pretty popular it's

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.700 
and this theory is pretty popular it's
gone<00:00:56.940> around<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.390> thousands<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.289> people<00:00:58.500> seen

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
gone around a thousands of people seen

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.099 
gone around a thousands of people seen
at<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.100> least<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.510> see<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> fact<00:01:01.020> that

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
at the least and to see the fact that

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
at the least and to see the fact that
activision<00:01:01.710> hasn't<00:01:02.010> dignified<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
activision hasn't dignified it with a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.640 
activision hasn't dignified it with a
response<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.329> confirm<00:01:03.780> or<00:01:04.049> denial<00:01:04.409> is

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
response a confirm or denial is

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.740 
response a confirm or denial is
intriguing<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.820> me<00:01:05.850> because<00:01:06.060> typically<00:01:06.479> when

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
intriguing to me because typically when

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.840 
intriguing to me because typically when
someone<00:01:06.780> makes<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.320> fake<00:01:07.530> leak<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.250> cut<00:01:08.430> like

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
someone makes a fake leak the cut like

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.310 
someone makes a fake leak the cut like
the<00:01:08.970> gaming<00:01:09.270> company<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.840> provides<00:01:10.140> that

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the gaming company that provides that

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.020 
the gaming company that provides that
game<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.650> produces<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.189> will<00:01:11.549> come<00:01:11.700> out<00:01:11.820> say

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
game and produces it will come out say

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.429 
game and produces it will come out say
know<00:01:12.299> they'll<00:01:12.540> denied<00:01:12.810> they'll<00:01:13.080> say<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.350> not

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
know they'll denied they'll say it's not

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.690 
know they'll denied they'll say it's not
true<00:01:13.650> or<00:01:13.920> they'll<00:01:14.100> say<00:01:14.250> we're<00:01:14.430> still<00:01:14.520> working

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
true or they'll say we're still working

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.859 
true or they'll say we're still working
on<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.000> game<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.299> haven't<00:01:15.570> gotten<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.810> that

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
on the game we haven't gotten to that

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.469 
on the game we haven't gotten to that
yet<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.310> activision<00:01:17.909> didn't<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.360> that

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
yet but the activision didn't do that

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.850 
yet but the activision didn't do that
they<00:01:18.659> didn't<00:01:18.900> dignify<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.530> response

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
they didn't dignify it with a response

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.649 
they didn't dignify it with a response
and<00:01:20.100> that's<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.580> good<00:01:20.820> sign<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.299> when

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and that's a good sign because when

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.539 
and that's a good sign because when
developers<00:01:22.049> don't<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:22.890> simply

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
developers don't do that it's simply

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.920 
developers don't do that it's simply
because<00:01:23.580> they<00:01:23.880> don't<00:01:24.119> want<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.330> attract<00:01:24.689> any

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
because they don't want to attract any

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.780

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
characters will be in one map that takes

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.050

place<00:04:13.470> near<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:13.920> pyramids<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.370> giza<00:04:14.579> and<00:04:14.910> the

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
place near the pyramids of giza and the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.539 
place near the pyramids of giza and the
Nile<00:04:15.299> I<00:04:15.600> thought<00:04:15.989> that<00:04:16.200> was<00:04:16.380> very<00:04:16.500> very<00:04:16.919> very

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
Nile I thought that was very very very

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.300 
Nile I thought that was very very very
bad<00:04:17.910> ass<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:18.500> finally<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.650> last<00:04:19.680> one<00:04:20.190> he

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
bad ass and finally the last one he

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.460 
bad ass and finally the last one he
described<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:20.880> be<00:04:20.910> an<00:04:21.180> abandoned<00:04:21.780> Germantown

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
described to be an abandoned Germantown

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.770 
described to be an abandoned Germantown
not<00:04:22.830> sure<00:04:23.099> exactly<00:04:23.580> about<00:04:23.849> that<00:04:24.060> but<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.570> still

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
not sure exactly about that but I still

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.200 
not sure exactly about that but I still
think<00:04:24.990> it's<00:04:25.080> cool<00:04:25.229> nevertheless<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:26.070> I<00:04:26.729> think

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
think it's cool nevertheless and I think

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.820 
think it's cool nevertheless and I think
all<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.449> these<00:04:27.600> maps<00:04:27.840> that<00:04:27.990> he<00:04:28.110> described<00:04:28.560> are

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
all of these maps that he described are

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.920 
all of these maps that he described are
very<00:04:29.400> likely<00:04:29.669> to<00:04:30.000> happen<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.569> think<00:04:30.600> that's

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
very likely to happen I think that's

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.300 
very likely to happen I think that's
something<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.229> treyarch<00:04:31.710> would<00:04:31.860> like<00:04:32.009> to<00:04:32.160> go

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
something that treyarch would like to go

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.189 
something that treyarch would like to go
with<00:04:32.460> especially<00:04:33.270> considering<00:04:33.720> their<00:04:33.840> style

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
with especially considering their style

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.040 
with especially considering their style
like<00:04:34.949> I<00:04:35.130> think<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.759> Nile<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.330> Egypt<00:04:36.750> sounds

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
like I think the Nile and Egypt sounds

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.110 
like I think the Nile and Egypt sounds
really<00:04:37.349> fun<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:37.830> I<00:04:37.919> know<00:04:37.979> treyarch<00:04:38.580> would<00:04:39.000> be

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
really fun and I know treyarch would be

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.059 
really fun and I know treyarch would be
down<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.479> do<00:04:39.599> something<00:04:39.810> like<00:04:39.960> that<00:04:40.199> depending

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
down to do something like that depending

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:42.980 
down to do something like that depending
on<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.310> circumstances<00:04:42.000> so<00:04:42.210> it<00:04:42.419> doesn't<00:04:42.810> sound

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
on the circumstances so it doesn't sound

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.320 
on the circumstances so it doesn't sound
completely<00:04:43.319> impossible<00:04:43.800> to<00:04:44.130> me<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:44.430> the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
completely impossible to me and the

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.879 
completely impossible to me and the
silent<00:04:45.750> hill<00:04:45.900> or<00:04:46.169> a<00:04:46.199> theme<00:04:46.500> sounds<00:04:46.800> like

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
silent hill or a theme sounds like

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:47.689 
silent hill or a theme sounds like
they're<00:04:47.009> trying<00:04:47.130> to<00:04:47.280> go<00:04:47.370> for<00:04:47.520> something

they're trying to go for something

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.270
