00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.720
 you may not know it but some 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:07.870
 traders earn a lot of money even in times 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.870
 of crisis let's see more closely their 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:14.080
 secrets to achieve it 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.330
 First, know that the bag is like the 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.850
 Real estate business when prices 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.119
 people go down buy and when the 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:26.250
 prices go up sold unless in the 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.250
 bag there are two ways to make money 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.960
 On the one hand, buy shares and then 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.570
 resell them 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.970
 but as in the real estate business one 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.430
 depends on supply and demand 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.590
 on the other hand simply perform 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.200
 predictions for example downward 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.780
 when precisely the actions fall 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.150
 and this is exactly what this 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.910
 handful of huge earning traders 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.350
 sums of money make predictions with 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.109
 a simple click 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.570
 in a word they are ahead of the market 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.120
 winning the system by hand 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.979
 their strategy is simple they know that 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.530
 the more you lower the price of an action 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.590
 more people will try to get rid of 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.140
 they this necessarily creates much more 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.869
 offer and makes the shares fall still 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.610
 more and that's exactly what the 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.979
 dreams predict downward 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.730
 actions reaching to duplicate any 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:27.190
 sum in less than two minutes 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.590
 on some platforms like the neighborhood 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.930
 option dreams can do with 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.210
 just a few clicks from home 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.210
 since the quotes are official 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.700
 and identical throughout the world nobody can 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.010
 cheating with them as they can 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.500
 get to happen with the casinos or others 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.070
 online lottery games that do not allow 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.700
 see what happens behind the business 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.040
 good 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.600
 theoretically this works but let's see 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.659
 what happens in practice 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.000
 we are facing empar option a site 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.350
 of reference among traders as 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.110
 can see all the feeds are 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.390
 provided by reuters this gives us 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.340
 the assurance that your quotes are 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.190
 identical to those of the bags 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.560
 international here in paro option 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.380
 we also have a choice of 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.450
 Extended graphics that is called pro 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.640
 trader and that will allow us to see the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.890
 long- term trends this is 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.080
 just what we are going to use now 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.940
 First of all, a 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.430
 tell how you can see I'm already 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.489
 registered and I have won more than 5 thousand 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.769
 $ 700 is a very good profit 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.430
 considering that I started only two years ago 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.890
 months with only $ 400 good 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.110
 let's open the next one and we'll study 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.730
 some graphs to verify if 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.430
 some of the assets mark a 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.650
 strong trend and we can see that the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.890
 nasdaq marks a strong tendency to 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.100
 perfect low so let's click 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.470
 in low or put and we will place a 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.060
 $ 100 investment we give you the 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.290
 apply button 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:08.230
 we will look for another asset the oil 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.470
 for example shows a tendency to 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.959
 low so like we did the time 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.420
 previous we will open the option to the low 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.420
 clicking on put with 100 dollars 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.070
 we keep looking for more assets 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.639
 Apple stocks show charts 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.819
 neutral and we do not have bearish tendencies 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:43.370
 or net bulls at this point is 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.749
 important not to despair and follow 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.650
 looking until you find a trend 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:51.379
 well marked in this case as we can 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.019
 see in the ibm chart the curve is 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.489
 clearly upwards then what 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.639
 It is good to do as our friends 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:03.159
 twitters is opening an upward operation 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.159
 or cou with 100 dollars in this asset 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.659
 let's continue 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.970
 the coca-cola actions are 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.060
 beginning to lower this is the time 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.669
 ideal as we did previously 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.060
 we choose to lower and enter our 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.060
 investment 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.230
 let's see the actions of ebay we can see 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.430
 showing a steep decline 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.350
 let's take advantage of this tendency to open 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.350
 an operation of 100 to the downside 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.810
 obviously you should follow 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.940
 looking for other well-defined options 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.940
 but for this example it will be enough 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.110
 Now I'm going to take a break to take 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.590
 a coffee while I wait for the expirations 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.590
 of my dives 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.760
 we are already back in fire option as 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.880
 you can see our operations have already 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.860
 finalized 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.780
 so let's click on the tab 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.780
 of open positions 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.490
 wow not excellent as you can see it here 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:31.629
 our result has been positive already 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:36.110
 that at the beginning of our session we had 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:38.929
 5,730 dollars and now we have 5 thousand 920 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.740
 dollars from the positions we had 

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:44.659
 open 3 were successful and one not but 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.469
 what matters here is that our 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.469
 balance be positive 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.700
 of course to get a 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.220
 Perfect result with 100% success is 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.260
 necessary to achieve mastery of the method 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.230
 very advanced and generate a lot 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.570
 experience this is the operation of 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.240
 this business for those who have the 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.480
 spirit of a tweeter this is without a doubt 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.070

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.470
 experience can serve others
