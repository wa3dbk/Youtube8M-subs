the sessions as well they didn't want

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.840 
the sessions as well they didn't want
her<00:01:39.030> sort<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.920> passing<00:01:40.920> along<00:01:41.100> her<00:01:41.310> views<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
her sort of passing along her views and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.810 
her sort of passing along her views and
infiltrating<00:01:42.810> their<00:01:42.930> agenda<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.490> what<00:01:44.700> it's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
infiltrating their agenda so what it's

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
infiltrating their agenda so what it's
so<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.930> diversion<00:01:46.470> therapy<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:48.329> really<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
so the diversion therapy is is really a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.740 
so the diversion therapy is is really a
client<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.820> well<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.149> meant<00:01:51.390> to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
client is a what and well it's meant to

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.660 
client is a what and well it's meant to
rehabilitate<00:01:52.619> women<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.040> what<00:01:53.189> oftentimes

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
rehabilitate women so what oftentimes

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.760 
rehabilitate women so what oftentimes
what<00:01:53.820> happens<00:01:54.210> when<00:01:54.479> women<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.439> men<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> should

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
what happens when women and men I should

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.219 
what happens when women and men I should
say<00:01:56.189> are<00:01:56.939> arrested<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:57.509> sex<00:01:57.750> work<00:01:57.960> and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
say are arrested for sex work and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.130 
say are arrested for sex work and
trafficking<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.490> the<00:02:00.000> pimp<00:02:00.420> will<00:02:00.840> bill

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
trafficking is that the pimp will bill

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.109 
trafficking is that the pimp will bill
them<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.649> then<00:02:01.950> they'll<00:02:02.549> go<00:02:02.729> back<00:02:02.939> into

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
them out and then they'll go back into

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.550 
them out and then they'll go back into
that<00:02:03.240> lifestyle<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:03.990> they're<00:02:04.110> saying<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.380> want

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that lifestyle so they're saying we want

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.469 
that lifestyle so they're saying we want
to<00:02:04.619> stop<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.130> cycle<00:02:05.549> we<00:02:05.880> want<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.240> take<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
to stop this cycle we want to take the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.630 
to stop this cycle we want to take the
control<00:02:06.780> away<00:02:06.930> from<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.409> pimps<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.009> give

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
control away from the pimps and give

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.400 
control away from the pimps and give
them<00:02:08.819> another<00:02:09.179> opportunity<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.050> think<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
them another opportunity so I think the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.750 
them another opportunity so I think the
program<00:02:10.739> claims<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.250> about<00:02:11.459> thirty<00:02:11.610> five

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
program claims that about thirty five

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.620 
program claims that about thirty five
percent

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
percent

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.610 
percent
the<00:02:12.690> participants<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.290> have<00:02:13.350> gone<00:02:13.560> through

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the participants that have gone through

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.940 
the participants that have gone through
the<00:02:13.890> program<00:02:14.040> since<00:02:14.370> 2011<00:02:14.670> have<00:02:15.420> been

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
the program since 2011 have been

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.020 
the program since 2011 have been
successfully<00:02:16.950> reintegrated<00:02:17.790> into<00:02:17.850> society

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
successfully reintegrated into society

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.330 
successfully reintegrated into society
so<00:02:18.720> that's<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.320> hope<00:02:19.500> here<00:02:19.710> that<00:02:19.830> you're

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
so that's the hope here that you're

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.830 
so that's the hope here that you're
taking<00:02:20.550> them<00:02:20.670> out<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.880> cycle<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.420> while<00:02:21.810> I

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
taking them out of the cycle and while I

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.340 
taking them out of the cycle and while I
do<00:02:22.280> see<00:02:23.280> some<00:02:23.760> sort<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.390> know<00:02:24.420> benefit<00:02:25.260> in

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
do see some sort of you know benefit in

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.810 
do see some sort of you know benefit in
that<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.710> taking<00:02:25.980> them<00:02:26.100> away<00:02:26.220> from<00:02:26.310> pimps<00:02:26.730> I

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
that and taking them away from pimps I

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.130 
that and taking them away from pimps I
think<00:02:27.000> what<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.210> also<00:02:27.330> need<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.630> recognize<00:02:27.750> is

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
think what we also need to recognize is

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.050 
think what we also need to recognize is
that<00:02:28.260> some<00:02:28.500> women<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.950> then<00:02:29.100> consciously

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
that some women and then consciously

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.810 
that some women and then consciously
make<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.110> choice<00:02:31.410> they<00:02:31.950> are<00:02:32.130> proud<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.460> what

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
make this choice they are proud of what

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.460 
make this choice they are proud of what
they<00:02:32.970> do<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.420> they're<00:02:33.570> perfectly<00:02:34.020> okay<00:02:34.440> with

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
they do and they're perfectly okay with

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.860 
they do and they're perfectly okay with
doing<00:02:34.890> sex<00:02:35.190> work<00:02:35.330> here<00:02:36.330> we're<00:02:36.570> essentially

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
doing sex work here we're essentially

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.740 
doing sex work here we're essentially
demonizing<00:02:37.590> them<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.890> program<00:02:38.280> seems<00:02:38.580> to

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
demonizing them and the program seems to

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.210 
demonizing them and the program seems to
imbue<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:40.110> treatment<00:02:40.590> with<00:02:40.710> sort<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.040> a

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
imbue this treatment with sort of a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.090 
imbue this treatment with sort of a
moral<00:02:41.670> compass<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.540> very<00:02:42.890> religious<00:02:43.890> and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
moral compass that is very religious and

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.350 
moral compass that is very religious and
it's<00:02:44.280> undertones<00:02:44.730> right<00:02:45.090> well<00:02:45.240> that<00:02:45.330> was

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
it's undertones right well that was

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.880 
it's undertones right well that was
gonna<00:02:45.540> be<00:02:45.630> our<00:02:45.720> next<00:02:45.840> question<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.560> there's<00:02:46.830> a

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
gonna be our next question so there's a

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.360 
gonna be our next question so there's a
really<00:02:47.820> a<00:02:48.270> religious<00:02:48.990> agenda<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.800> this<00:02:49.950> unlike

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
really a religious agenda to this unlike

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.520 
really a religious agenda to this unlike
other<00:02:50.610> rehab<00:02:51.150> programs<00:02:51.720> where<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.410> know

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
other rehab programs where you know

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.080 
other rehab programs where you know
Alcoholics<00:02:53.130> Anonymous<00:02:53.220> or<00:02:53.610> whatever<00:02:53.910> there

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
Alcoholics Anonymous or whatever there

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.030 
Alcoholics Anonymous or whatever there
is<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.240> belief<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.960> statement<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.710> a

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
is a belief and a statement of in a

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.710 
is a belief and a statement of in a
belief<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.490> higher<00:02:56.520> power<00:02:57.030> but<00:02:57.540> it's<00:02:57.660> not

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
belief in a higher power but it's not

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.650 
belief in a higher power but it's not
overtly<00:02:58.610> religious<00:02:59.610> so<00:02:59.850> presumably<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.420> is

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
overtly religious so presumably this is

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.970 
overtly religious so presumably this is
a<00:03:00.990> particular<00:03:01.470> faith<00:03:01.890> particularly<00:03:03.980> Bible

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
a particular faith particularly Bible

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.290 
a particular faith particularly Bible
Church<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.490> has<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.640> lot<00:03:05.850> of<00:03:05.940> religious

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
Church and it has a lot of religious

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.130 
Church and it has a lot of religious
undertones<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:07.290> sessions<00:03:07.620> take<00:03:07.770> place<00:03:07.830> they

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
undertones the sessions take place they

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.300 
undertones the sessions take place they
physically<00:03:10.140> present<00:03:10.530> there<00:03:10.650> um<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.220> other

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
physically present there um the other

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.710 
physically present there um the other
thing<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.730> found<00:03:11.940> interesting<00:03:12.390> about

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
thing that I found interesting about

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.480 
thing that I found interesting about
this<00:03:12.960> particular<00:03:13.140> program<00:03:13.830> is<00:03:13.980> that

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
this particular program is that

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.970 
this particular program is that
taxpayers<00:03:15.270> foot<00:03:15.570> most<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.930> bill<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
taxpayers foot most of the bill so the

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.710 
taxpayers foot most of the bill so the
program<00:03:17.460> receives<00:03:17.730> three<00:03:17.970> thousand<00:03:18.360> dollars

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
program receives three thousand dollars

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.430 
program receives three thousand dollars
each<00:03:19.260> month<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:21.090> officers<00:03:21.780> conduct<00:03:22.170> to

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
each month so that officers conduct to

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.620 
each month so that officers conduct to

women that are participating in sex work

trafficking<00:03:38.670> what's<00:03:38.910> happening<00:03:39.270> is<00:03:39.390> that

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
trafficking what's happening is that

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.930 
trafficking what's happening is that
they're<00:03:39.660> actively<00:03:40.410> pursuing<00:03:41.100> sex<00:03:41.580> workers

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
they're actively pursuing sex workers

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.610 
they're actively pursuing sex workers
and<00:03:42.180> some<00:03:42.360> are<00:03:42.510> saying<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.959> these<00:03:43.410> sex

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
and some are saying that these sex

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.010 
and some are saying that these sex
workers<00:03:43.920> are<00:03:44.040> being<00:03:44.190> threatened<00:03:44.700> with<00:03:44.760> arrest

workers are being threatened with arrest

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.740 
workers are being threatened with arrest
and<00:03:46.020> coerced<00:03:46.620> into<00:03:47.370> this<00:03:47.640> diversion<00:03:48.330> program

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
and coerced into this diversion program

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.350 
and coerced into this diversion program
so<00:03:48.930> it's<00:03:49.050> not<00:03:49.200> something<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.620> sort<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.360> there

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
so it's not something that sort of there

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.540 
so it's not something that sort of there
to<00:03:51.600> remedy<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.500> situation<00:03:53.100> and<00:03:53.340> they're

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
to remedy a situation and they're

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.790 
to remedy a situation and they're
essentially<00:03:54.300> like<00:03:54.510> using<00:03:55.020> forms<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.530> almost

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
essentially like using forms of almost

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.210 
essentially like using forms of almost
entrapment<00:03:56.400> it's<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.209> very<00:03:57.450> proactive

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
entrapment it's a very proactive

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.270 
entrapment it's a very proactive
assertive<00:03:59.220> aggressive<00:03:59.630> policy<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:00.950> trying<00:04:01.950> to

assertive aggressive policy of trying to

assertive aggressive policy of trying to
I'm<00:04:02.459> assuming<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.390> rationale<00:04:03.840> for<00:04:04.110> it

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
I'm assuming that the rationale for it

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.600 
I'm assuming that the rationale for it
is<00:04:04.380> is<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.650> they're<00:04:04.800> trying<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.070> clean<00:04:05.340> quite

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
is is that they're trying to clean quite

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.760 
is is that they're trying to clean quite
clean<00:04:05.910> up<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.180> streets<00:04:06.360> right<00:04:06.870> but<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.620> your

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
clean up the streets right but to your

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.280 
clean up the streets right but to your
point<00:04:08.010> they're<00:04:08.459> doing<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:08.850> in<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:10.200> know

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
point they're doing it in a you know

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.130 
point they're doing it in a you know
somewhat<00:04:10.890> draconian<00:04:11.540> fashion<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:12.750> it's<00:04:12.900> not

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
somewhat draconian fashion so it's not

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.740 
somewhat draconian fashion so it's not
as<00:04:13.410> though<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:13.830> a<00:04:13.950> sort<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.340> organic<00:04:15.150> process

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
as though it's a sort of organic process

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.660 
as though it's a sort of organic process
of<00:04:15.900> policing<00:04:16.530> it's<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.739> very<00:04:16.980> much<00:04:17.190> more<00:04:17.430> going

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
of policing it's a very much more going

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.820 
of policing it's a very much more going
on<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:17.970> front<00:04:18.180> foot<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:18.690> looking<00:04:19.500> for<00:04:19.650> reds
