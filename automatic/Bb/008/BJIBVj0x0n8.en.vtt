 Once upon a time ... 

00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:21.378
 She's a saint. 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.098

00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:44.155

00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:52.299
 Are you sure it's him? 

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:53.931
 Yeah. 

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:56.730
 And he's in trouble. 

00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:00.104
 Witnesses claim the Wild Hunt is after him. 

00:01:01.204 --> 00:01:02.826
 You have to find him. 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.565
 So, what happens when I find it? 

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:12.302
 I'm gonna give him what he's entitled to.

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:29.481
 "Finally..." 

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:31.435
 You're one of them. 

00:01:32.346 --> 00:01:34.927

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.497
