00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.969
 international to play and I'm looking to

 Craonne Wall beacon that has made this 

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:33.140
 last in Narbonne so make a final 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.219
 from pro d2 to the gold final 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.089
 precisely a thing before by a little 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:36.679
 more ambition 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:38.300
 is what we can know exactly 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:40.100
 little more your personal journey will you 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.059
 have played at the beginning I started at 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.449
 Portugal at what age 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.579
 yeah I started I think with 7 8 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.039
 years south of Portugal after I 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.809
 changeais alise world to play two 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.699
 shareholders and after I left a 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.570
 tree is going order for rugby 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.769
 in Portugal because it's still 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.899
 rather a football country 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.609
 I had seen playing teams at 7 that plays 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.839
 not bad at 7 but is it 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.760
 hard to play rugby when you're 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.289
 Portuguese yeah that's not easy because 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.350
 that already we do not like much at 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.210
 Portugal and that's all the money and everything 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.740
 the young will be played at football so 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.050
 everyone thinks it's possible 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.180
 to be like cristiano ronaldo so here we go 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.800
 all kids want to play football 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.940
 so that's not a lot of money and 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.920
 many young people not played rugby 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.270
 so it's not obvious you are you 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.530
 passed by a tree made us two 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.300
 seasons in Narbonne and especially the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.270
 last season where you scored the 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.560
 minds with your friend from the center 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.900
 fabien grammatico who will also come 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.040
 in carcassonne 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.660
 it's true that I 'm going to arrive this is not 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.670
 not obvious I did not do a lot of 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.650
 matches with the first but the second 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.510
 latest 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.700
 I affirm myself and here I am doing all the 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.960
 season with ramp and that was it was 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.910
 very well spent it's nice to know 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.050
 that he will reoffend to carson and that 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.180
 could lead people seem 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.010
 so precisely if we had to do like 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.240
 all to their victory a memory that has 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.170
 Marked your career as a rugby player 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.720
 that she knows she would be that memory 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.620
 I believe that the first match with the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.210
 Portugal and the half listen we go 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.960
 wish a good season you too from 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.190
 side of carcassonne 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.230
 and then hoping to find each other 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.320
 regularly after the matches thank you 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.320
 a lot
