hey<00:00:39.030> what's<00:00:39.240> going<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.510> guys<00:00:39.720> it's<00:00:39.750> Kate<00:00:40.260> and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
hey what's going on guys it's Kate and

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.910 
hey what's going on guys it's Kate and
here<00:00:41.220> is<00:00:41.400> my<00:00:41.640> review<00:00:41.880> on<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.690> storm<00:00:43.080> crux<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
here is my review on the storm crux the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.390 
here is my review on the storm crux the
crux<00:00:44.880> is<00:00:45.060> using<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.660> brand<00:00:46.140> new<00:00:46.470> core<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.220> the

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
crux is using a brand new core it is the

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.850 
crux is using a brand new core it is the
catalyst<00:00:47.970> core<00:00:48.330> and<00:00:48.630> they<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:49.320> pairing<00:00:49.710> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
catalyst core and they are pairing that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.220 
catalyst core and they are pairing that
with<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.220> ERG<00:00:50.730> hybrid<00:00:51.300> cover<00:00:51.570> stock<00:00:51.900> so<00:00:52.080> it's

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
with the ERG hybrid cover stock so it's

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.500 
with the ERG hybrid cover stock so it's
a<00:00:52.320> hybrid<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.950> pearl<00:00:53.280> solid<00:00:53.880> combination

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
a hybrid of that pearl solid combination

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.090 
a hybrid of that pearl solid combination
that<00:00:54.630> you<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:55.080> in<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:55.410> bite<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.650> the<00:00:55.890> zero

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
that you see in the bite and the zero

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.400 
that you see in the bite and the zero

pad<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:04.620> first<00:01:04.890> thing<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.129> noticed<00:01:05.460> with

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
pad and the first thing I noticed with

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.330 
pad and the first thing I noticed with
this<00:01:05.700> ball<00:01:05.910> is<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.210> how<00:01:06.420> versatile<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.020> is

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
this ball is just how versatile it is

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.700 
this ball is just how versatile it is
because<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.730> that<00:01:09.540> little<00:01:09.810> pocket<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.470> they

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
because of that little pocket that they

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.230 
because of that little pocket that they
show<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> core<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.490> know<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.940> you<00:01:12.090> guys

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
show in the core I know all you guys

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.970 
show in the core I know all you guys
have<00:01:12.450> seen<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.930> promotional<00:01:13.500> video<00:01:13.770> from

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
have seen that promotional video from

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.940 
have seen that promotional video from
storm<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:15.000> allows<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.690> ball<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
storm it allows that ball just the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.040 
storm it allows that ball just the
design<00:01:17.340> intent<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.730> the<00:01:17.850> ball<00:01:18.030> stays<00:01:18.510> intact

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
design intent of the ball stays intact

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.810 
design intent of the ball stays intact
after<00:01:19.620> you<00:01:19.740> drill<00:01:19.980> it<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> doesn't<00:01:20.640> really

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
after you drill it and it doesn't really

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.580 
after you drill it and it doesn't really
matter<00:01:21.060> what<00:01:21.300> layout<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.960> you're<00:01:22.560> not

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
matter what layout it is you're not

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.640 
matter what layout it is you're not
gonna<00:01:23.040> hit<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.550> core<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.210> or<00:01:24.720> you'll<00:01:25.290> hit<00:01:25.500> it

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
gonna hit that core and or you'll hit it

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.410 
gonna hit that core and or you'll hit it
and<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:26.010> barely<00:01:26.340> clip<00:01:26.730> it<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.090> doesn't

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and just barely clip it so it doesn't

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.990 
and just barely clip it so it doesn't
really<00:01:27.540> change<00:01:27.690> migration<00:01:28.650> paths<00:01:29.000> here

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
really change migration paths here

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.360 
really change migration paths here
you're<00:01:30.180> seeing<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.890> compared<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:32.130> zero

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
you're seeing it compared to the zero

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.640 
you're seeing it compared to the zero
gravity<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.060> same<00:01:33.270> layout<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.409> see

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
gravity with the same layout and you see

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.200 
gravity with the same layout and you see
the<00:01:34.770> zero<00:01:34.979> gravity<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.580> a<00:01:35.730> little

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the zero gravity is just a little

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.540 
the zero gravity is just a little
smoother<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.870> little<00:01:37.200> earlier<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.920> little<00:01:38.400> more

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
smoother a little earlier a little more

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.060 
smoother a little earlier a little more
even<00:01:38.970> roll<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.050> these<00:01:40.500> are<00:01:40.650> definitely

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
even roll to it so these are definitely

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.300 
even roll to it so these are definitely
a<00:01:41.100> they're<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> good<00:01:42.090> one-two<00:01:42.690> punch<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:43.410> when

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
a they're a good one-two punch and when

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.770 
a they're a good one-two punch and when
you<00:01:44.400> throw<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.730> bite<00:01:44.910> on<00:01:44.940> top<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.510> that<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
you throw the bite on top of that it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.660 
you throw the bite on top of that it
just<00:01:45.960> makes<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.440> really<00:01:46.830> really<00:01:47.010> good

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
just makes it a really really good

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.060 
just makes it a really really good
combination<00:01:48.150> at<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.690> top<00:01:48.930> three<00:01:49.260> so<00:01:49.830> here's<00:01:50.010> a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
combination at the top three so here's a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.400 
combination at the top three so here's a
bite<00:01:50.550> a<00:01:50.580> layout<00:01:51.240> slightly<00:01:52.080> different<00:01:52.350> but

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
bite a layout slightly different but

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.020 
bite a layout slightly different but
you're<00:01:52.560> gonna<00:01:52.650> see<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.010> balls<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.520> got

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you're gonna see this balls just got

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.560 
you're gonna see this balls just got
much<00:01:54.480> more<00:01:55.010> angled<00:01:56.010> down<00:01:56.190> Lane<00:01:56.550> it<00:01:57.210> pushes

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
much more angled down Lane it pushes

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.940 
much more angled down Lane it pushes
through<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.780> fronts<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.230> little<00:01:58.440> further<00:01:58.680> it

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
through the fronts a little further it

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.710 
through the fronts a little further it
gets<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.190> little<00:01:59.280> more<00:01:59.520> angular<00:01:59.730> down<00:02:00.060> Lane<00:02:00.360> so

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
gets a little more angular down Lane so

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.360 
gets a little more angular down Lane so
this<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.260> this<00:02:01.470> is<00:02:01.620> gonna<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> good<00:02:02.160> ball

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
this is this is gonna be a good ball

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.770 
this is this is gonna be a good ball
that<00:02:02.550> bounced<00:02:02.790> off<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.060> spot<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.510> see<00:02:03.660> it's

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
that bounced off the spot you see it's

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.170 
that bounced off the spot you see it's
just<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.080> small<00:02:04.830> little<00:02:05.130> step<00:02:05.400> right<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:06.030> me

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
just a small little step right for me

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.609 
just a small little step right for me
with<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.690> crux<00:02:06.990> they<00:02:07.830> are<00:02:07.950> all<00:02:08.270> in<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.479> same

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
with the crux they are all in the same

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.110 
with the crux they are all in the same
pretty<00:02:10.619> close<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.280> same<00:02:11.489> general<00:02:11.849> area

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
pretty close to the same general area

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.420 
pretty close to the same general area
for<00:02:12.540> me<00:02:12.629> it's<00:02:12.750> just<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.080> shape<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:13.980> the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
for me it's just the shape of the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.770 
for me it's just the shape of the
reaction<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> little<00:02:15.180> different<00:02:15.660> that's

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
reaction is a little different that's

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.479 
reaction is a little different that's
the<00:02:15.930> biggest<00:02:16.200> thing<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.650> saw<00:02:16.860> between<00:02:17.280> these

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
the biggest thing I saw between these

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.970 
the biggest thing I saw between these
three<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.239> pearl<00:02:18.510> bite<00:02:19.200> being<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.800> longest

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
three the pearl bite being the longest

three the pearl bite being the longest
most<00:02:20.370> angular<00:02:20.819> zero<00:02:21.390> being<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.750> earliest<00:02:22.140> and

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
most angular zero being the earliest and

most angular zero being the earliest and
most<00:02:22.470> even<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.129> that<00:02:23.160> crux<00:02:23.970> being<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.450> more

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
most even and that crux being the more

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.259 
most even and that crux being the more
versatile<00:02:25.019> one<00:02:25.230> now<00:02:26.099> here<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.790> crux<00:02:27.090> I

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
versatile one now here this is a crux I

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.030 
versatile one now here this is a crux I
hit<00:02:27.450> with<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.599> thousand<00:02:28.140> pata<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.650> does<00:02:28.800> have<00:02:28.980> a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
hit with a thousand pata it does have a

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.369 
hit with a thousand pata it does have a
little<00:02:29.250> different<00:02:29.670> layout<00:02:30.000> but<00:02:30.989> it<00:02:31.110> sits

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
little different layout but it sits

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.110 
little different layout but it sits
pretty<00:02:31.860> close<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.550> same<00:02:32.730> loud<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.060> you

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
pretty close to the same loud and you

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.900 
pretty close to the same loud and you
see<00:02:33.330> just<00:02:33.599> how<00:02:34.010> early<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.220> even<00:02:35.519> this<00:02:35.640> thing

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
see just how early and even this thing

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.490 
see just how early and even this thing
gets<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.330> mean<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:36.959> even<00:02:37.200> stronger

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
gets I mean this this is even stronger

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.880 
gets I mean this this is even stronger
and<00:02:37.890> earlier<00:02:38.580> than<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.780> zero<00:02:39.810> gravity<00:02:40.469> was<00:02:40.859> I

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
and earlier than that zero gravity was I

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.890 
and earlier than that zero gravity was I
mean<00:02:41.099> I'm<00:02:41.249> I'm<00:02:41.280> taking<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.999> pretty<00:02:42.329> big<00:02:42.599> step

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
mean I'm I'm taking a pretty big step

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.880 
mean I'm I'm taking a pretty big step
left<00:02:43.140> here<00:02:43.469> so

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
left here so

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.890 
left here so
this<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:44.670> just<00:02:44.910> kind<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.240> shows<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.720> how

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
this is just kind of shows you how

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.440 
this is just kind of shows you how
versatile<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.590> ball<00:02:46.830> can<00:02:47.069> be<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.430> if<00:02:47.970> it

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
versatile this ball can be and if it

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.020 
versatile this ball can be and if it
doesn't<00:02:48.780> quite<00:02:49.040> hook<00:02:50.040> up<00:02:50.220> enough<00:02:50.550> for<00:02:50.880> you

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
doesn't quite hook up enough for you

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.430 
doesn't quite hook up enough for you
right<00:02:51.060> out<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.569> box<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.990> can<00:02:52.140> hit<00:02:52.260> this

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
right out of the box you can hit this

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.140 
right out of the box you can hit this
thing<00:02:52.650> with<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.830> thousand<00:02:53.340> pad<00:02:53.490> whatever<00:02:53.970> you

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
thing with a thousand pad whatever you

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.250 
thing with a thousand pad whatever you
need<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.540> you're<00:02:54.630> going<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.780> get<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:55.110> hook

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
need and you're going to get it to hook

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.720 
need and you're going to get it to hook
if<00:02:55.440> it's<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.830> little<00:02:56.040> too<00:02:56.160> much<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.370> can<00:02:56.610> throw

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
if it's a little too much you can throw

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.850 
if it's a little too much you can throw
some<00:02:56.910> polish<00:02:57.240> on<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.600> now<00:02:58.319> here<00:02:58.620> I'm<00:02:58.709> comparing

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
some polish on it now here I'm comparing

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.770 
some polish on it now here I'm comparing
all<00:02:59.310> four<00:02:59.610> you're<00:02:59.790> going<00:02:59.910> to<00:02:59.970> see<00:03:00.209> like<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.570> said

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
all four you're going to see like I said

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.900 
all four you're going to see like I said
those<00:03:00.959> three<00:03:01.230> are<00:03:01.410> pretty<00:03:01.830> close<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.550> on<00:03:02.700> top

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
those three are pretty close to on top

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.850 
those three are pretty close to on top
of<00:03:03.120> each<00:03:03.240> other<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:04.290> biggest<00:03:04.620> thing<00:03:04.740> is<00:03:04.830> just

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
of each other the biggest thing is just

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.220 
of each other the biggest thing is just
the<00:03:05.100> length

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
the length

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.040
