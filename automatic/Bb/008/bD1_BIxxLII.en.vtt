guy while listening to this album is
that<00:00:38.340> he<00:00:38.579> sounds<00:00:38.820> like<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.329> major<00:00:39.719> record

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140

labels<00:00:40.710> wet<00:00:41.250> dream<00:00:41.910> which<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> good<00:00:43.020> thing

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and a bad thing and what I mean by that

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.900 
and a bad thing and what I mean by that
is<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:46.800> makes<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.280> typical

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
is that it just makes that typical

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.330 
is that it just makes that typical
mainstream<00:00:48.629> music<00:00:48.809> with<00:00:49.559> very<00:00:49.980> little

mainstream music with very little

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.880 
mainstream music with very little
substance<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.809> understand<00:00:52.350> why<00:00:52.559> people

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
substance so I can understand why people

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.220 
substance so I can understand why people
support<00:00:53.309> his<00:00:53.460> music<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.390> also<00:00:54.570> understand

just<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> damn<00:01:47.399> truth<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.060> that's<00:01:48.659> not<00:01:48.840> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
just the damn truth and that's not to

say that they're all that awful but

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.520 
say that they're all that awful but
there's<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.210> nothing<00:01:51.689> unique<00:01:52.049> about<00:01:52.200> these

three beats and they all sound like they

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.230 
three beats and they all sound like they
were<00:01:54.570> made<00:01:54.810> with<00:01:55.290> DJ<00:01:55.710> mustards<00:01:56.189> very<00:01:56.640> shallow

relies<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.459> features<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.270> much<00:02:15.510> because<00:02:16.020> he

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
relies on features so much because he

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.630 
relies on features so much because he
really<00:02:16.590> doesn't<00:02:16.860> bring<00:02:17.040> much<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.489> table

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
requirements and it's all just very

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.339

typical there's not much to this album
and<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.860> me<00:03:11.010> kid<00:03:11.519> ink<00:03:11.549> is<00:03:12.030> basically<00:03:12.780> what<00:03:12.959> you

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
and to me kid ink is basically what you

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.470 
and to me kid ink is basically what you
would<00:03:13.170> get<00:03:13.410> if<00:03:13.590> tyga<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.459> chris<00:03:14.489> brown<00:03:15.060> were

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
would get if tyga and chris brown were

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.810 
would get if tyga and chris brown were
fused<00:03:15.989> together<00:03:16.200> because<00:03:17.040> he<00:03:17.220> raps<00:03:17.489> and<00:03:17.730> sings

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
fused together because he raps and sings

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.509 
fused together because he raps and sings
on<00:03:18.390> mainstream<00:03:19.019> beats<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.500> he<00:03:19.920> even<00:03:20.220> kind<00:03:20.340> of

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
on mainstream beats and he even kind of

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.710 
on mainstream beats and he even kind of
looks<00:03:20.700> like<00:03:20.790> both<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.120> them<00:03:21.390> put<00:03:21.600> together

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
looks like both of them put together

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.170 
looks like both of them put together
which<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.440> little<00:03:22.829> bit<00:03:22.950> creepy<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.430> me<00:03:23.489> it's

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
which is a little bit creepy to me it's

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.840 
which is a little bit creepy to me it's
almost<00:03:24.390> like<00:03:24.660> when<00:03:24.989> Goku<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.500> Vegeta<00:03:25.850> fused

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
almost like when Goku and Vegeta fused

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.180 
almost like when Goku and Vegeta fused
together<00:03:27.060> but<00:03:27.989> it's<00:03:28.170> definitely<00:03:28.410> not<00:03:28.799> near<00:03:29.069> as

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
together but it's definitely not near as

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.490 
together but it's definitely not near as
awesome<00:03:29.340> as<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.720> at<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.959> end<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.319> day

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
awesome as that so at the end of the day

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.800 
awesome as that so at the end of the day
I<00:03:31.739> think<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.430> is<00:03:32.489> an<00:03:32.730> album<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.269> critics

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
I think this is an album that critics

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.569 
I think this is an album that critics
are<00:03:33.900> going<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.140> smash<00:03:34.440> into<00:03:34.620> smithereens<00:03:34.980> and

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
are going to smash into smithereens and

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.759 
are going to smash into smithereens and
I<00:03:35.850> can<00:03:36.000> understand<00:03:36.510> why<00:03:36.750> but<00:03:37.109> at<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.530> same

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
I can understand why but at the same

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.660 
I can understand why but at the same
time<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.370> is<00:03:38.940> adequate<00:03:39.600> for<00:03:39.810> what<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.380> is

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
time it is adequate for what it is

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.250 
time it is adequate for what it is
anyone<00:03:41.670> who<00:03:41.819> just<00:03:42.060> wants<00:03:42.299> some<00:03:42.480> simple<00:03:42.930> music

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
anyone who just wants some simple music

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.890 
anyone who just wants some simple music
to<00:03:43.380> listen<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.739> before<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:44.760> club<00:03:45.030> on<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.720> way

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
to listen to before the club on the way

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.410 
to listen to before the club on the way
to<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.200> club<00:03:46.470> or<00:03:46.709> in<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.370> club<00:03:47.639> will<00:03:48.180> be<00:03:48.209> able

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
to the club or in the club will be able

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.030 
to the club or in the club will be able
to<00:03:48.569> get<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.780> couple<00:03:49.049> spins<00:03:49.380> out<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.650> this<00:03:49.799> album

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
to get a couple spins out of this album

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.819 
to get a couple spins out of this album
so<00:03:50.730> it's<00:03:50.910> not<00:03:51.030> completely<00:03:51.269> useless<00:03:51.840> there's

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
so it's not completely useless there's

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.340 
so it's not completely useless there's
just<00:03:53.040> nothing<00:03:53.609> original<00:03:53.880> happening<00:03:54.600> here<00:03:54.900> the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
just nothing original happening here the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.830 
just nothing original happening here the
rapping<00:03:55.859> isn't<00:03:56.190> engaging<00:03:56.639> and<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.450> beats<00:03:57.690> are

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
rapping isn't engaging and the beats are

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.960 
rapping isn't engaging and the beats are
monotonous<00:03:58.440> so<00:03:58.829> I<00:03:58.859> give<00:03:59.130> this<00:03:59.250> one<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.549> 2<00:03:59.790> out<00:03:59.940> of

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
monotonous so I give this one a 2 out of

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.420 
monotonous so I give this one a 2 out of
