00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.640
 answering another question about the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.189
 modern warfare simon mask 2 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.550
 this one is more created and it gets not 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:28.239
 I got but the reservation in stores 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.250
 from gamestop it was worth it came with the fifa and 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.930
 the mask of sainz 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.180
 what many friends ask here that 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.030
 they have also made the reservation with the top 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.040
 and they have given us so I do not know I think that 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.070
 only only those of 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.870
 xbox having the map parking and everything 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.620
 that so they have to that their 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.449
 exclusivity on the other hand I bring you 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.370
 something exclusive as I said at the beginning 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.610
 from my videos that there are many camouflages 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.110
 hidden here I bring a camouflage 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.269
 that at least to me personally 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.750
 I really like that it's the camouflage of 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:05.260
 certain wire of thorns or wire of 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.540
 mini thorns is what it puts 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.080
 in the detail that they put to move lage well 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.790
 that when something comes out in the ls or 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.710
 when it goes on sale because I do not know if 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.810
 is going to be put on sale or not as 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.580
 they did blank these will be called 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.140
 same so well I bring in 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.220
 exclusive can not be followed with a 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.980
 At least I like it 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.410
 very much and little by little I will go up 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.780
 well this one more hidden camouflage than 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.090
 they are inside the game 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.350
 and also on the other hand I turn to 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:39.159
 repeat a bit of the simon brand that 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.700
 avoided many in the previous ones to 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.399
 how the principle is drawn this is 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.850
 in the game sooner or later what 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.130
 will draw only declared as this is a 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.840
 business is still mixed -which had the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.080
 exclusivity or xbox have the 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.210
 possibility then those of pc 4 of ps3 then 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.650
 we have to put up with it or what it simulates 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.910
 reservation in 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.680
 what's called in game another store does not 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.650
 we have where we will have the most expensive voice 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.500
 abnormal 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.140

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.300
