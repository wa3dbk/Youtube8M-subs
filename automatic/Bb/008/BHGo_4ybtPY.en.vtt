in<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.720> previous<00:01:40.079> video<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.740> will<00:01:40.920> link<00:01:41.250> that

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
in a previous video so I will link that

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.789 
in a previous video so I will link that
here<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.030> down<00:01:42.540> below<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.290> description

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
here and down below in the description

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.679 
here and down below in the description
box<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.280> next<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.149> want<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> remove<00:01:45.630> that

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
box and next you want to remove that

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.960 
box and next you want to remove that
sticky<00:01:46.380> residue<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.189> label's<00:01:47.579> leaves

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
sticky residue that the label's leaves

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.960 
sticky residue that the label's leaves
behind<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.530> take<00:01:49.680> some<00:01:49.950> vinegar<00:01:50.340> onto

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
behind so I just take some vinegar onto

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.749 
behind so I just take some vinegar onto
a<00:01:51.000> cotton<00:01:51.420> pad<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.500> seriously<00:01:53.280> just

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
a cotton pad and this seriously just

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.149 
a cotton pad and this seriously just
dissolves<00:01:54.390> all<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.960> stickiness<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.009> can

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
dissolves all the stickiness and you can

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.090 
dissolves all the stickiness and you can
use<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.909> anything<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.810> has<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.590> sticky

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
use this on anything that has a sticky

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.160 
use this on anything that has a sticky
residue<00:01:59.430> so<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:00.930> annoying

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
residue so it can be really annoying

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.170 
residue so it can be really annoying
sometimes<00:02:01.530> when<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.100> remove<00:02:02.369> labels<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.090> it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
sometimes when you remove labels and it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.270 
sometimes when you remove labels and it
leaves<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.570> gunk<00:02:03.899> behind<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.799> works<00:02:05.100> on

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
leaves that gunk behind this works on

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.249 
leaves that gunk behind this works on
everything<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:06.119> awesome<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.869> once<00:02:07.110> your

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
everything it's awesome and once your

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.960 
everything it's awesome and once your
candle<00:02:07.590> container<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.099> clean<00:02:08.399> you're<00:02:08.789> gonna

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
candle container is clean you're gonna

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.180 
candle container is clean you're gonna
scuff<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.479> up<00:02:09.629> with<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.050> sandpaper<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.860> this

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
scuff it up with the sandpaper and this

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.500 
scuff it up with the sandpaper and this
is<00:02:11.340> why<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.550> need<00:02:11.849> something<00:02:12.239> that's<00:02:12.270> a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
is why you need something that's a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.590 
is why you need something that's a
little<00:02:12.629> bit<00:02:12.780> more<00:02:13.020> abrasive

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
little bit more abrasive

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.510 
little bit more abrasive
because<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.140> needs<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.440> scratch<00:02:14.890> up<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.250> glass

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
because it needs to scratch up the glass

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.060 
because it needs to scratch up the glass
so<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.300> spray<00:02:16.570> paint<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.960> puffy<00:02:17.320> paint<00:02:17.620> won't

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
so the spray paint and puffy paint won't

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.860 
so the spray paint and puffy paint won't
just<00:02:18.310> slide<00:02:18.640> off<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.240> once<00:02:19.690> you're

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
just slide off of it once you're

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.970 
just slide off of it once you're
finished<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.320> should<00:02:20.590> be<00:02:20.680> left<00:02:20.860> with

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
finished you should be left with

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.800 
finished you should be left with
something<00:02:21.490> that<00:02:21.640> looks<00:02:21.820> like<00:02:21.910> this<00:02:22.240> and<00:02:22.510> then

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
something that looks like this and then

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.840 
something that looks like this and then
you<00:02:22.960> can<00:02:23.080> move<00:02:23.230> on<00:02:23.440> into<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.920> painting<00:02:24.370> now

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
you can move on into the painting now

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:25.920 
you can move on into the painting now
you<00:02:24.910> want<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.240> make<00:02:25.390> sure<00:02:25.600> that<00:02:25.750> you're

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
I'm gonna be moving on to my snowflakes

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.400 
I'm gonna be moving on to my snowflakes
so<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.670> still<00:02:46.090> have<00:02:46.270> them<00:02:46.420> attached<00:02:46.840> here<00:02:47.380> to

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
so I still have them attached here to

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.560 
so I still have them attached here to
the<00:02:47.770> original<00:02:48.310> paper<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:49.120> drew<00:02:49.330> them<00:02:49.480> on

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
the original paper that I drew them on

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.750 
the original paper that I drew them on
so<00:02:50.020> I'm<00:02:50.260> just<00:02:50.410> cutting<00:02:50.620> them<00:02:50.860> apart<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.220> each

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
so I'm just cutting them apart so each

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.710 
so I'm just cutting them apart so each
snowflake<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.870> separate<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.530> brown<00:02:57.540> but<00:02:58.540> you

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
snowflake is separate and brown but you

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.480 
snowflake is separate and brown but you
can<00:02:58.960> do<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.320> job<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.680> now<00:02:59.890> all<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.310> have<00:03:00.370> to
