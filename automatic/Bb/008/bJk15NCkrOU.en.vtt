enable<00:00:06.919> the<00:00:07.919> tool<00:00:08.189> we<00:00:08.700> can<00:00:08.880> also<00:00:09.030> use<00:00:09.360> a

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
enable the tool we can also use a

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.990 
enable the tool we can also use a
keyboard<00:00:10.290> shortcut<00:00:10.670> in<00:00:12.259> this<00:00:13.259> case<00:00:13.559> using<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
keyboard shortcut in this case using the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.380 
keyboard shortcut in this case using the

ctrl alt and shift keys in different

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.450 
ctrl alt and shift keys in different
combinations<00:00:18.539> enable<00:00:19.380> different<00:00:19.740> modes<00:00:20.160> of

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
combinations enable different modes of

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.720 
combinations enable different modes of
the<00:00:20.789> tool<00:00:21.109> pressing<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.320> holding<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:23.220> ctrl

the tool pressing and holding the ctrl

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.460 
the tool pressing and holding the ctrl
key<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.180> does<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.689> select<00:00:25.080> mount<00:00:26.779> we<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:28.050> use

key and does the select mount we can use

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.569 
key and does the select mount we can use
this<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:30.289> select<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.560> light<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.099> has<00:00:32.309> the

least and go to the surface normal and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.930 
least and go to the surface normal and
this<00:00:36.600> means<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:37.649> find<00:00:38.460> out<00:00:38.670> which

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
this means that we can find out which

this means that we can find out which
light<00:00:39.239> illuminates<00:00:39.870> that's<00:00:40.770> offers<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> most

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
on the single light to be selected so if

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.150 
on the single light to be selected so if
we<00:01:00.539> select<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:01.109> light<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.379> then<00:01:01.829> try<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
we select one light and then try to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.799 
we select one light and then try to
select<00:01:02.460> another<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> previous<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.660> will

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
select another one the previous one will

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.580 
select another one the previous one will
be<00:01:03.960> deselected<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.850> yet<00:01:05.850> another<00:01:06.150> mode<00:01:07.049> we're

be deselected and yet another mode we're

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.820 
be deselected and yet another mode we're
already<00:01:08.520> selected<00:01:09.030> lights<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.650> not<00:01:10.650> be

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
already selected lights will not be

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.539 
already selected lights will not be
tested<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.900> case<00:01:13.310> they<00:01:14.310> already

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
tested so in this case they already

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.580 
tested so in this case they already
selected<00:01:14.970> light<00:01:15.299> will<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.659> skipped<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.470> you

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
selected light will be skipped or you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.719 
selected light will be skipped or you
can<00:01:16.710> select<00:01:16.860> another<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.670> then

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
can select another one and then

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.080

unselected one which is probably the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.630 
unselected one which is probably the
easiest<00:01:25.110> selection<00:01:25.650> mode<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:26.189> selecting<00:01:26.610> a

always passing through that point in

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.230 
always passing through that point in

about what skis enable which mode we can

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
the vertical z axis and we can also

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.520

anything<00:06:43.170> these<00:06:44.170> are<00:06:44.440> the<00:06:44.560> major<00:06:44.770> features<00:06:45.220> of

but<00:06:51.090> this<00:06:52.090> should<00:06:52.300> be<00:06:52.450> enough<00:06:52.510> for<00:06:52.690> short

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080
