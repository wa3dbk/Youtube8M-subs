00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.480
 make this super eights bracelet 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.320
 we will make this bracelet a little bit 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:26.600
 differently than usually take that row 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.600
 which right itself will take it off and 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.079
 turn the other side so now 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.059
 it will be sent the other way than 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:43.140
 the rest of the rows now take the color 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:47.910
 single base two rubber bands and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.590
 throwing two loops now take 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.559
 rezinochku the color you want 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.239
 make eight 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.840
 we put on rezinochku eight learn how 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.629
 final loop thousand twisted a 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.080
 now take a white rubber band and putting on 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:12.090
 her this vosmerochku gum on 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:17.689
 pegs now add another gum 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:22.740
 and again we make another eight 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:25.909
 so we put on these pegs now 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.909
 just continue on 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.860
 one more eight here 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.870
 we 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.970
 and continue forward 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.030
 again another eight dress up 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.030
 hook 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.119
 on rezinochku with 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.119
 peg length 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.010
 and when you find to the end 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.130
 it is necessary to make sure that this series goes to 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:40.180
 the other side of the neighboring nights and put on 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.380
 rezinochku sciences oh no no first 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.740
 sofa eight 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.910
 and then the eight put on these 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.760
 pegs 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.950
 these two pegs 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.950
 I'm going down now 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:25.939
 if this is a bracelet for baby wrist 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:27.229
 then we stop about here and but 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:30.949
 this last rod 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:33.370
 we put on closing loops that is, we 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:37.009
 take rezinochku simplify eight 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.759
 fold in half and put on here but 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.360
 this rod 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:43.009
 and now we throw a loop and for 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.439
 common but knowing the basics only 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.360
 turns in not as we turned 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.949
 row peg in the other direction we are not 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:56.779
 will have to do anything extra 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:58.430
 throwing loops as usual so 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:04.840
 pick up unity gum which 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.840
 there is no bottom up and push back 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:26.830
 when we get to the season so easy 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:28.690
 throw a loop in the side then 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.669
 turn the machine around so 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.500
 arrows look at you and just 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.500
 throw loops forward as usual 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.920
 carefully and do not lock the loop with 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.920
 eights 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.290
 and getting to the last loop 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.550
 throw yong and neighboring rod 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.030
 we put on this door face shaped 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.030
 clip 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:36.350
 now you can simply remove the bracelet from 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:38.620
 machine and attach one side to 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.620
 to a friend 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:55.180
