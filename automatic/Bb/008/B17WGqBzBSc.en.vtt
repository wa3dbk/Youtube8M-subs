00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:09.910
 the center paris north has for vocation 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.910
 to be a place of entertainment 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.709
 recreation that allows its customers to 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.920
 discover animations throughout 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.150
 year 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.039
 they are big animations 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.170
 like today the neither yes nor no 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.300
 with bleachers with a whole scene 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.400
 dramatized or more animations 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.960
 little the goal for us to organize 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.670
 this game is to allow our customers 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.119
 to come and discover the center while 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.250
 fun 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.559
 there are a lot of participants that this 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.300
 either customers familiar or not 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.800
 shopping center is also 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.800
 traders who lent themselves to gambling 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.929
 for several days an animation 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.850
 pass in the center is strong 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:45.420
 nice customers take pleasure in 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.789
 participate in play and win 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.469
 today I heard that the 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.319
 traders were then for guest 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.620
 to participate in this game of neither yes nor 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.199
 no 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.600
 I told myself to accept the opportunity to 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.280
 participate in my way to this event 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.930
 principle of staying the longest 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.810
 possible without saying yes 200 say no so 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.670
 it's a language skill game on 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.220
 will say 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.990
 and then it's very pleasant and the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.070
 director was friendly but these 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.770
 questions were tough 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.830
 so you had to be careful 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.780
 I tried throughout the game to make 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.990
 attention and a priori it is not too much 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.990
 badly marketed 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.710
 relative 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.710
 m 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:40.420
 give us what's good and that's 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.950
 very simple I am the grand canyon 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.950
 young yes or no 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.470
 and 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.030
 who
