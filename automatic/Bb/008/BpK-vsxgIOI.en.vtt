00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.530 
hello ah the weather's coming in really
bad<00:00:09.780> so<00:00:10.230> they<00:00:10.380> reckon<00:00:10.740> so<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.389> thought<00:00:12.389> that

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
bad so they reckon so I thought that

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.279 
bad so they reckon so I thought that
there<00:00:12.719> are<00:00:12.840> few<00:00:13.019> videos<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.799> how<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.670> actually

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
there are few videos on how to actually

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:22.880 
there are few videos on how to actually
use<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:17.490> dais<00:00:17.730> how<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.390> use<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.080> dais<00:00:21.529> I'm<00:00:22.529> not

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
use the dais how I use the dais I'm not

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.200 
use the dais how I use the dais I'm not
politically<00:00:23.400> correct

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
politically correct

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.500 
politically correct
I<00:00:24.240> found<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.199> machine<00:00:25.350> which<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.240> light<00:00:27.240> light

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
I found a machine which is light light

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.529 
I found a machine which is light light
lightweight<00:00:28.460> really<00:00:29.460> rugged<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:30.390> a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
lightweight really rugged it's a

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.659 
lightweight really rugged it's a
thoroughbred<00:00:30.900> when<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.890> little<00:00:32.070> Carl<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
thoroughbred when that little Carl and

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.290 
thoroughbred when that little Carl and
you<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.940> go<00:00:33.090> all<00:00:33.270> day<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.980> I<00:00:34.980> abused<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
you can go all day and I abused it and I

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.750 
you can go all day and I abused it and I
get<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.690> filthy<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.500> never<00:00:37.829> clean<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.550> and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
get it filthy and I never clean it and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.410 
get it filthy and I never clean it and
it<00:00:39.270> works<00:00:39.660> every<00:00:40.050> single<00:00:40.530> time<00:00:41.059> but<00:00:42.059> I've<00:00:42.210> got

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
it works every single time but I've got

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.729 
it works every single time but I've got
two<00:00:43.370> detectors<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.809> because<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.379> takes

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
two detectors in one because it takes

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.459 
two detectors in one because it takes
seconds<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.820> change<00:00:48.120> from<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.750> large<00:00:48.960> car<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
seconds to change from the large car to

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.970 
seconds to change from the large car to
the<00:00:49.590> small<00:00:49.829> coal<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.399> vice<00:00:50.940> versa<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.289> really

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the small coal a vice versa it is really

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.639 
the small coal a vice versa it is really
really<00:00:53.370> easy<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:54.989> don't<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.530> have

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
really easy so you don't have to have

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.790 
really easy so you don't have to have
two<00:00:55.860> detectors<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:57.059> light<00:00:57.449> work<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.649> one

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
two detectors one for light work and one

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.610 
two detectors one for light work and one
for<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> heavy<00:00:59.219> work<00:00:59.489> I<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.930> carry<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
for the heavy work I just carry the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
for the heavy work I just carry the
large<00:01:01.829> Carl<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.699> my<00:01:03.030> rucksack<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.640> they'll

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
large Carl in in my rucksack and they'll

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.160 
large Carl in in my rucksack and they'll
give<00:01:05.790> me<00:01:05.820> half<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.240> minute<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.810> I'm<00:01:07.020> not

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
give me half a minute and I'm not

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.429 
give me half a minute and I'm not
changed<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> completely<00:01:08.670> new<00:01:08.820> detector<00:01:09.510> so

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
changed to a completely new detector so

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.969 
changed to a completely new detector so
anyway<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.240> have<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> look<00:01:12.510> at<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.260> if

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
anyway just have a look at this and if

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:22.310 
anyway just have a look at this and if
you<00:01:14.250> disagree<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:16.250> disagree<00:01:20.840> see<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.049> on

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
you disagree then disagree see you on

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.590 
you disagree then disagree see you on
the<00:01:22.950> instruction<00:01:23.790> bit<00:01:25.520> changing<00:01:26.520> coils<00:01:27.119> on

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the instruction bit changing coils on

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.219 
the instruction bit changing coils on
your<00:01:28.049> dais<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:29.280> really<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.759> easy<00:01:30.229> two

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
your dais it's really that easy two

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.590 
your dais it's really that easy two
coils<00:01:31.530> since<00:01:32.430> what<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.579> call<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> thoroughbred

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
coils since what I call the thoroughbred

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.440 
coils since what I call the thoroughbred
a<00:01:34.409> little<00:01:35.100> small<00:01:35.520> coil<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
a little small coil and this is the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.039 
a little small coil and this is the
workhorse<00:01:37.700> this<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.880> what<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.180> used<00:01:39.509> when<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.810> go

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
workhorse this is what I used when I go

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.590 
workhorse this is what I used when I go
zooming<00:01:40.560> round<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.670> very<00:01:41.909> very<00:01:42.270> lightweight

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
zooming round it's very very lightweight

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.649 
zooming round it's very very lightweight
you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.259> swing<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.799> all<00:01:43.920> day<00:01:44.210> this<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.270> when<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
you can swing it all day this is when I

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.870 
you can swing it all day this is when I
found<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.170> hot<00:01:46.320> spot<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.280> want<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.579> cover<00:01:47.759> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you'll see the only clean part is here

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.240 
you'll see the only clean part is here
where<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.310> charger<00:02:05.729> clips<00:02:06.030> are<00:02:07.190> there<00:02:08.190> are

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
where the charger clips are there are

where the charger clips are there are
things<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.970> clean<00:02:09.209> them<00:02:09.420> I'm<00:02:09.899> out

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
things to do and clean them I'm out

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.130 
things to do and clean them I'm out
detecting<00:02:10.770> everything

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
detecting everything

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.750 
detecting everything
right<00:02:13.140> now<00:02:14.209> if<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.360> look<00:02:15.540> at<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:15.750> top<00:02:16.019> here

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
right now if you look at the top here

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.640 
right now if you look at the top here
you'll<00:02:17.760> see<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.150> it's<00:02:18.329> a<00:02:18.540> different<00:02:18.870> shape

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
you'll see that it's a different shape

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.380 
you'll see that it's a different shape
it<00:02:20.129> narrows<00:02:20.909> off<00:02:22.430> here<00:02:23.430> which<00:02:23.730> means<00:02:23.939> you<00:02:24.209> can

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
it narrows off here which means you can

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.330 
it narrows off here which means you can
only<00:02:24.510> put<00:02:24.810> your<00:02:24.989> head<00:02:25.170> on<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.859> right<00:02:26.099> way

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
only put your head on the right way

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.970 
only put your head on the right way
around<00:02:26.780> some<00:02:27.780> real<00:02:27.989> thought<00:02:28.349> gone<00:02:28.650> into<00:02:28.890> this

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
around some real thought gone into this
