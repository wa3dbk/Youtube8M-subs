00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.099
 lately these anticipated excesses 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.280
 they are of extreme fashion and are also a 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.650
 Effective method for developers of 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.529
 give compensation to their structures 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.230
 possibly even earlier in the game either 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.189
 completed, eventually missing i 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.880
 funds 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.580
 is the video players can give a 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.859
 compensation for their work 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.350
 here we are inside the blade 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.510
 symphony with a matrix corridor 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.670
 exactly to the matrix you could 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.800
 identify how they like this 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.010
 identification but clear evidence 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:50.579
 overwhelming and the phone carries us 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:53.550
 in this room very very nikon de 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.519
 there are lots and lots of players 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.250
 those who had the benevolence of 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.879
 exploit these features 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.659
 then my players alternate between 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.770
 month structures break the panels of 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.979
 bamboo and have fun with each other 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.970
 massacring and generating energy 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:22.679
 then this is software 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.970
 obviously very very technical a lot 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.179
 from of life 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.580
 then if you hear in the background there are 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.940
 even the Americans get stuck 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.619
 obviously they are primarily i 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.140
 creators of everything 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.619
 and my players enter inside e 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.039
 great masters sounds the great masters there 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.479
 are they giving election lessons a 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.610
 those sweetheart 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.600
 learning the art of the swordsman 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.509
 being a very technical duo, yes 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.019
 however, avoid that swordsman 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.539
 let's play so much spa moso be that 

00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:02.970
 place where the feature is this 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.030
 but actually in the congo they are 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.119
 derisive and simply needs to 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.420
 spread on the button to give 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.290
 fanned with the sword possibly as 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.290
 the kicking lesson forms and what 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.129
 remains is a spa ming instead four 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.040
 we have too many or a high technicality 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:28.830
 because he declines himself because 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.440
 too much technicality for me means that 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.580
 I have to work out the situation and I should 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.069
 stay in these places for a hair 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.550
 an amount of time and try to understand 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:46.069
 more serious indeed than later of course 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.069
 turning the arbitra these structures 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.950
 train yourself to hit how they work 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.160
 things but I may not be suitable 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.330
 made up this kind of speech 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.850
 will 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.800
 see how they bite you see that 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.350
 have their skills parano individuate 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.260
 the positions we can customize the 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:15.200
 our character obviously with i 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.900
 various types of swords start only one 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.720
 to change the point a little i 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.930
 colors of the software of the above 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:28.660
 shield of the immense is of the intrinsic e 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.459
 from inside as you wish complete 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.230
 feel again how kings impart 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.720
 orders give lessons 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.000
 I can act I can see others 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.450
 they fan or can reach one 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.450
 direct challenge 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.780
 and not only are they really like it 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:54.440
 be able to promote a similar game or the 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.299
 otherwise how to do it does not promote e 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.060
 already because it is already something I repeat 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:02.500
 always from multiple years of what it is 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:07.220
 difficult and indeed highly 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.620
 impossible to promote a stuff or e 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.690
 because sir because you have in 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.670
 eyes because you have tastes because 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.289
 you will have feelings you have read 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.889
 back based on audiovisual reception 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:24.380
 and therefore a person cannot stimulate 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.110
 if you see this stuff but take it off 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.620
 remove these sounds from this 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.590
 voice wax years and religious volume al 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.720
 maximum and just look at what 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.620
 appears on screen 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.889
 then this fire can arouse the 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.020
 your interest and this that the 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.750
 very important message I want 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:52.130
 I feel I arouse interest 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.620
 only by seeing it then not if you are 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.120
 less interesting will be the case of 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.740
 go and have a look at his style 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.850
 so here I am trying to combine 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.590
 something because why 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:12.330
 try to understand how it works too 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:17.760
 if the structure is not obvious, it seems so 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:20.520
 complex an air attack then more 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.340
 fast more balanced a heavy attack 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.210
 depending on your wishes and needs 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.600
 need 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.370
 ok this is and it sure is 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.350
 materialized in a well- structured structure 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.660
 defined but there is a whole series bellini 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.240
 where various elements are mixed and where 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.640
 it can be a general combo etc. 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.550
 I have several play types too 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.180
 cut 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.820
 with different angles and ways to the 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.720
 new new from the street 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:56.320
 and then the situation becomes more 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:00.280
 complicated and I try I will try and 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.430
 I insist and drink tea though that is 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:06.760
 a great master and can be seen from 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:10.720
 conformation of his armor already has 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.910
 unlocked some stuff so I got myself 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.030
 jet in the middle of this scrum of 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:18.790
 swordsmen needy and principals 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:22.240
 violence but also technique not for 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.710
 unleash your own most valuable value 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.910
 violence to their vandalism 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:32.200
 the con with training weighting e 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:34.540
 necessary so I recommend if you have 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.170
 that kind of impulse was 66 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.190
 implemented 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:42.430
 then it's time to get the man 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:45.460
 otherwise he would have already had to close 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:48.390
 a little bit now in total black 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.390
 regards
