00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.620 
leveled out we're gonna switch to 150
remember<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.730> mentioned<00:00:24.119> like<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.390> spot<00:00:24.600> that

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
remember I mentioned like this spot that

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.920 
remember I mentioned like this spot that
the<00:00:24.840> left<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.230> there<00:00:26.090> if<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.210> let<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.420> dry<00:00:27.510> see

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
the left on there if we let it dry see

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.540 
the left on there if we let it dry see
how<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.140> barely<00:00:28.320> pushing<00:00:28.619> comes<00:00:29.039> off<00:00:29.279> that

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
how this barely pushing comes off that

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.350 
how this barely pushing comes off that
and<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.970> again<00:00:30.330> kind<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:31.880> is<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.940> good<00:00:33.149> reason

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
and this again kind of is a good reason

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.970 
and this again kind of is a good reason
why<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.660> want<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.960> sand<00:00:34.230> something<00:00:34.530> has<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.920> be

in those edges out and that's what's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.190 
in those edges out and that's what's
going<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.819> help<00:03:02.940> feather<00:03:03.299> into<00:03:03.659> the<00:03:03.900> painted

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
going to help feather into the painted

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:24.140 
going to help feather into the painted
surface<00:03:21.920> you<00:03:22.920> can<00:03:23.069> see<00:03:23.250> right<00:03:23.430> here<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.970> that

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
surface you can see right here that that

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.449

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
of a low area there I think it's going

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.199 
of a low area there I think it's going
to<00:03:28.140> stand<00:03:28.410> out<00:03:28.620> but<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.400> am<00:03:29.430> starting<00:03:29.879> to<00:03:30.000> hit

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
to stand out but I am starting to hit

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.780

metal<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.319> body<00:03:31.620> throw<00:03:31.829> a<00:03:31.890> little<00:03:32.069> bit<00:03:32.280> so

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
metal and the body throw a little bit so

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.309 
metal and the body throw a little bit so
I<00:03:32.819> don't<00:03:33.000> want<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.180> sound<00:03:33.329> too<00:03:33.420> much<00:03:33.780> more<00:03:34.049> if
