up a new partition wizard so click Next

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.020 
up a new partition wizard so click Next
and<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.409> need<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> create<00:01:11.490> at<00:01:11.580> least<00:01:11.610> one

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and you need to create at least one

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.130 
and you need to create at least one
primary<00:01:12.540> Perdition

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
primary Perdition

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.890 
primary Perdition
so<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> first<00:01:13.979> partition<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.820> create<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
so the first partition you create in the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.960 
so the first partition you create in the
space<00:01:16.200> will<00:01:16.500> need<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.740> primary<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.820> hit

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
space will need to be primary and hit

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.330 
space will need to be primary and hit
next<00:01:18.409> type<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> amount<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.890> space<00:01:20.100> you

and what this will do is you'll have to
format<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.299> hard<00:01:48.450> drive<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.729> it'll<00:01:50.729> take<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
format the hard drive and it'll take a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.270 
format the hard drive and it'll take a
little<00:01:51.000> bit<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.240> time<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.570> format<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.280> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
little bit of time to format it and the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.710 
little bit of time to format it and the
remaining<00:01:53.700> space<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.210> want<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.390> create<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
remaining space you want to create the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.410 
remaining space you want to create the
partition<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.290> hard<00:01:55.500> drive<00:01:55.619> l2<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:57.149> just

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
partition this hard drive l2 you just

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.560 
partition this hard drive l2 you just
create<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.930> new<00:01:58.110> partition<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.189> next<00:01:59.640> you<00:02:00.299> undo

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
create a new partition and next you undo

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.770 
create a new partition and next you undo
it<00:02:00.600> an<00:02:00.810> extended<00:02:01.290> partition<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.009> case

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
it an extended partition in this case

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.550 
it an extended partition in this case
hit<00:02:03.780> next<00:02:05.450> uses<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> faultline<00:02:07.049> lot<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.290> space

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
hit next uses the faultline lot of space

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.630 
hit next uses the faultline lot of space
which<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:07.979> remaining<00:02:08.429> amount<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.670> space

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
which is the remaining amount of space

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.640 
which is the remaining amount of space
and<00:02:11.640> finally<00:02:11.879> finish<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:13.260> what<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.500> will

and finally finish it and what this will
do

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
do

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.050

this<00:02:14.370> will<00:02:14.549> partition<00:02:14.849> both<00:02:15.150> hard<00:02:15.390> drives<00:02:15.659> and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
this will partition both hard drives and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.209 
this will partition both hard drives and
you'd<00:02:18.060> be<00:02:18.150> all<00:02:18.269> set<00:02:18.299> if<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:19.469> want<00:02:19.499> to<00:02:19.709> delete<00:02:20.040> a
