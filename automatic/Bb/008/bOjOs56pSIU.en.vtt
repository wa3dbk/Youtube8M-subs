00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.540 
know jump over the fence it's pretty
useful<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> lot<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.140> purposes<00:00:55.649> one<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.219> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
useful for a lot of purposes one if you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.310 
useful for a lot of purposes one if you
don't<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.879> using<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.690> fence<00:00:57.870> gate<00:00:58.140> like

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
fence gate during the live string and

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.609 
fence gate during the live string and
then<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.820> course<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.360> know<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.869> easier<00:01:07.560> to

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.810 
for some reason it just doesn't work I
think<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.799> has<00:01:35.070> something<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.460> do<00:01:35.579> with<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
think it has something to do with the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.880 
think it has something to do with the
pressing<00:01:36.090> mechanics<00:01:37.020> as<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.350> see<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:37.799> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
pressing mechanics as you see here it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.230 
pressing mechanics as you see here it
goes<00:01:38.040> down<00:01:38.240> but<00:01:39.290> it<00:01:40.290> looks<00:01:40.770> almost<00:01:41.240> levelled

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
goes down but it looks almost levelled

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.700 
goes down but it looks almost levelled
if<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.960> looks<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.439> thing's

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
if not it looks like this thing's

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.499 
if not it looks like this thing's
actually<00:01:43.890> higher<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.909> for<00:01:45.060> some<00:01:45.180> reason<00:01:45.420> I

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
actually higher but for some reason I

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.789 
actually higher but for some reason I
think<00:01:45.570> pressure<00:01:45.899> place<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.350> doesn't<00:01:46.530> work

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
think pressure place just doesn't work

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.249 
think pressure place just doesn't work
and<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.520> course<00:01:47.549> um<00:01:48.000> anything<00:01:48.689> with<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> block

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
and of course um anything with a block

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.010 
and of course um anything with a block
or<00:01:49.470> let's<00:01:50.220> say<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.030> block<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.570> can't

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
or let's say I just have a block I can't

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.620 
or let's say I just have a block I can't
well<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.409> can't<00:01:52.649> walk<00:01:52.799> over<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.180> this

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
well I can't walk over it so in this

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.950 
well I can't walk over it so in this
case<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.320> extra<00:01:56.100> layer<00:01:56.369> snow<00:01:56.759> will<00:01:57.420> act<00:01:57.719> as

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
case the extra layer snow will act as

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.660 
case the extra layer snow will act as
the<00:01:58.020> carpet<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.100> could<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.340> jump<00:01:59.460> over

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the carpet so I could just jump over

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.580 
the carpet so I could just jump over
that<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:00.600> over<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> fence<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.380> that's

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
that and then over the fence so a that's

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.010 
that and then over the fence so a that's
pretty<00:02:01.740> much<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.920> yeah<00:02:02.549> yeah<00:02:03.090> see<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.750> told<00:02:03.810> you

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
pretty much it yeah yeah see I told you

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.260 
pretty much it yeah yeah see I told you
it<00:02:04.049> was<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> very<00:02:04.320> short<00:02:04.590> tips<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.920> tricks<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
it was a very short tips and tricks and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.779 
it was a very short tips and tricks and
you<00:02:06.270> know<00:02:06.420> slabs<00:02:07.259> won't<00:02:07.530> work<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.129> let's<00:02:08.550> go<00:02:08.729> to

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
you know slabs won't work so let's go to

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.160 
you know slabs won't work so let's go to
the<00:02:09.000> other<00:02:09.090> tips<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.509> tricks<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.750> decided<00:02:10.080> to

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the other tips and tricks I decided to

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.930 
the other tips and tricks I decided to
combine<00:02:10.319> for<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.739> video<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.700> is

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
combine for this video and that is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.520 
combine for this video and that is
horses<00:02:12.599> with<00:02:12.780> fences

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
horses with fences

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.050 
horses with fences
now<00:02:13.709> this<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.069> very<00:02:14.130> simple<00:02:14.400> one<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:14.880> not

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
now this is a very simple one it's not

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.150 
now this is a very simple one it's not
really<00:02:15.209> tips<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.569> tricks<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.650> guess<00:02:17.010> you

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
really tips and tricks but I I guess you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.290 
really tips and tricks but I I guess you
could<00:02:17.310> call<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.520> tip<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:17.940> tricks<00:02:19.100> but<00:02:20.100> um<00:02:20.670> for

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
could call it tip and tricks but um for

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.780 
could call it tip and tricks but um for
example<00:02:21.720> if<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.709> wanted<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.190> have<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.490> horse

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
example if you wanted to have a horse

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.620 
example if you wanted to have a horse
out<00:02:24.590> inside<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> containment<00:02:26.069> area<00:02:26.550> first<00:02:27.540> of

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
out inside a containment area first of

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.510 
out inside a containment area first of
all<00:02:27.690> see<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.110> little<00:02:28.380> carpets<00:02:28.830> here<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.220> works

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
all see the little carpets here it works

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.940 
all see the little carpets here it works
the<00:02:29.610> same<00:02:29.670> way<00:02:29.850> but<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.300> horses<00:02:30.569> would<00:02:30.959> not<00:02:31.230> go

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
the same way but the horses would not go

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.250 
the same way but the horses would not go
over<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.340> fence<00:02:33.090> while<00:02:33.540> they're<00:02:33.720> inside<00:02:33.870> so

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
over the fence while they're inside so

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.250 
over the fence while they're inside so
he's<00:02:34.680> here<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.400> horse<00:02:35.700> will<00:02:35.940> say<00:02:36.120> put<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.660> think

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
he's here the horse will say put I think

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.400 
he's here the horse will say put I think
if<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.440> if<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:37.890> try<00:02:38.190> shoving<00:02:38.520> him<00:02:38.760> he<00:02:38.940> may<00:02:39.390> he<00:02:39.930> may

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
if I if I try shoving him he may he may

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.770 
if I if I try shoving him he may he may
go<00:02:40.650> over<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.100> but<00:02:41.819> he's<00:02:41.970> kind<00:02:42.270> of<00:02:42.330> stubborn<00:02:42.540> he

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
go over it but he's kind of stubborn he

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.449 
go over it but he's kind of stubborn he
doesn't<00:02:43.110> want<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.350> go<00:02:43.440> over<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.100> that's<00:02:44.250> good

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
doesn't want to go over so that's good

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.030 
doesn't want to go over so that's good
so<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.150> shows<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.930> could<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.560> can

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
so this shows that you could and you can

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.890 
so this shows that you could and you can
contain<00:02:47.400> horses<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.030> pretty<00:02:48.600> much<00:02:48.630> other

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
contain horses and pretty much other

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.350 
contain horses and pretty much other
livestock<00:02:49.170> while<00:02:49.709> having<00:02:50.120> carpets<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.209> room

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
livestock while having carpets of room

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.020 
livestock while having carpets of room
so<00:02:51.840> if<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.019> just<00:02:52.200> wanted<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:53.100> horse<00:02:53.310> let's<00:02:53.820> go

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
so if you just wanted the horse let's go

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.180 
so if you just wanted the horse let's go
let's<00:02:54.360> go<00:02:54.510> my<00:02:54.630> tries<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.930> Steve<00:02:55.140> that's<00:02:55.920> an

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
let's go my tries to Steve that's an

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.740 
let's go my tries to Steve that's an
easy<00:02:56.430> way<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:56.670> just<00:02:56.940> getting<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.300> horse<00:02:57.540> out

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
easy way of just getting the horse out

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.680 
easy way of just getting the horse out
rather<00:02:58.500> than<00:02:58.650> doing<00:02:59.010> this<00:02:59.190> out<00:02:59.430> this<00:03:00.390> very

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
rather than doing this out this very

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.380 
rather than doing this out this very
hard<00:03:01.050> tactic<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.680> opening<00:03:02.100> fences<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.760> then

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
hard tactic of opening fences and then

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.199 
hard tactic of opening fences and then
let's<00:03:03.660> go<00:03:03.870> inside<00:03:04.250> let's<00:03:05.250> do<00:03:05.489> this<00:03:05.670> horsey

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
let's go inside let's do this horsey

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.350 
let's go inside let's do this horsey
let's<00:03:06.870> go<00:03:07.110> inside<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.709> then<00:03:07.860> listen<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:08.910> the

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
let's go inside and then listen this the

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.840 
let's go inside and then listen this the
horse<00:03:09.600> doesn't<00:03:09.840> go<00:03:09.989> through<00:03:10.260> one<00:03:10.560> gate<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:11.160> yet

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
horse doesn't go through one gate so yet

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.309 
horse doesn't go through one gate so yet
so<00:03:12.120> that's<00:03:12.239> how<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.480> put<00:03:12.690> pretty<00:03:13.050> much<00:03:13.170> do<00:03:13.290> the

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
so that's how you put pretty much do the

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.509 
so that's how you put pretty much do the
symptoms<00:03:13.709> tricks<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:14.010> pretty<00:03:14.310> much<00:03:14.430> just

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519
