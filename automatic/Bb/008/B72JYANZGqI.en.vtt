00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.590
 root canal complications underneath 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.479
 you understand things at a 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.150
 root canal treatment can occur 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:12.280
 undesirably, only the 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.559
 dealt with special complications 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.780
 general treatment complications 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.300
 such as nausea or dizziness 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.840
 after local anesthesia will not 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.330
 mentioned 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.250
 the most common complication is that 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.560
 not all root canals are bottled 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.500
 will look like in this animation 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.140
 the tooth has four channels and only three 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.329
 are bottled further are the channels 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.030
 often not quite to the root point 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.100
 Bottled as seen in this picture 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.800
 the reasons for that not to the root 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.589
 tip filling are diverse strong 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.809
 curved the channels root canal 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.329
 instruments break unmotivated 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.329
 Unhandled doctor and therapist 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.640
 or inexperienced therapist more 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.039
 Complications of root treatment are 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.679
 perforation of the channel of the dental crown 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.339
 An extraction is then usually the 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.530
 episode 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.720
 the already mentioned instrument break 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.799
 is also not too rare 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.630
 complication 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.909
 this can be prevented if the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.820
 instruments are changed regularly 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.250
 overfilling the channel is also 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.860
 a complication unpleasant especially 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.170
 if the teeth touch the jaw or 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.149
 bordering on the nerve canal because 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.990
 The pain and inflammation can be 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.360
 be follow 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.369
 the transferred material does not always have to 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.409
 be removed a distance of the 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.359
 Materials should be done if they are 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.000
 have pain and or the bone 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.509
 inflammatory reacts controlled 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.590
 this with half-yearly radiographs 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.570
 Furthermore, the overcrowded should 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.340
 material to be removed when in the 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.590
 near the lower jaw or the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.350
 lying down in the jaw cavity is self-evident 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.000
 see freedom from pain in the animation 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.979
 you like the root canal treatment 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.750
 unwanted material in the 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.000
 mandibular canal is pressed 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.340
 dark discolorations of the tooth 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.170
 a root canal leave on blood 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.549
 and to work at the clean 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.850
 close the root canal 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.469
 The channel should normally be clean 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.539
 bloodless and bacteria free 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.849
 if this is not the case then decompose it 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.730
 Bacteria blood and iron 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.300
 which in hemoglobin hemoglobin 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.550
 is available 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.530
 the tooth turns dark at 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.690
 use of a trunk of a 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.060
 optical magnification and clean well 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.670
 you can save yourself the time you have waited for instruments 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.890
 all these complications put you at risk 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.420
 badly filled scenes is that it 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.550
 even after years to a bone 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.220
 infection can come and or cysts 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.200
 Patients often speak of a tooth 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.630
 and do not really know 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.600
 exactly where this comes from, they see one 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.770
 cyst due to the bad 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.960
 Root treatments formed after years 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.240
 the cyst is blue 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.700
 You can clearly see how the cyst is 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.830
 nerve the mandible runs the red 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.620
 the border has pushed to the side 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.090
 The patient was complaining about this 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.890
 tingling in the lower lip 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.200
 the cause of these failures 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.580
 root canal treatment was among others 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.220
 an instrument fracture 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.020
 this is another already mentioned 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.300
 Complication of root canal treatment 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.380
 you see the white line in the 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.630
 front root 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.120
 this is part of an instrument 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.260
 that's why the channel is not further 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.450
 bottled 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.709
 a x-ray thief simple 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.540
 quality control 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.120
 They see a tooth X-ray of one 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.790
 badly filled tooth right and 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.250
 left a well- filled tooth left 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.440
 the channels are homogeneous and you funny 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.840
 filled to the top in the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.820
 X-ray like white line the 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.040
 rooting is in itself for one 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.470
 a simple and experienced practitioner 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.220
 Useful therapy for permanent teeth 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.780
 receive 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.550
 in good execution of the 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.890
 root canal treatment can pay 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.370
 good service for decades to lifelong 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.370
 Afford
