00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:16.520
 with the invention of the pneumatic 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.189
 sowing technology sets heinrich in 1966 the 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.079
 milestone of agricultural technology with it 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.949
 The company succeeds in breaking through 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:27.500
 and revolutionizes this technology 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.410
 Now the seed is dosed centrally and 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.390
 distributed with air that provides for a 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:39.680
 targeted sowing and saves seeds with 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.480
 the series dl 1977 becomes the next 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.110
 generation of accord very technology 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.870
 presented 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.300
 through the pneumatic seÃ¤technik is her 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.219
 the modular construction of seed drills 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.750
 become possible 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.850
 In addition to important benefits for the 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.399
 Machine production is at least 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.629
 as many for the farmer on the 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:02.210
 hand this technique is being further developed 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.920
 has 1980 become the electronic 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.390
 driving lanes circuit for edward 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.759
 Seeders offered 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.500
 before this was mechanical 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.590
 operated flaps controllable 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.929
 Now electronics is a fine one 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.929
 and comfortable control selectable 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.940
 1982 comes the second generation of the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.399
 accord lathes on the market 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.800
 the daa series is one 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.899
 on collected seeders circles lettings 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.810
 combination until today in the 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.759
 product program is offered, it counts 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.289
 to the best-selling machines on the 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.140
 location soest mid- 80s 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.630
 extends its offer to the individual 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.450
 grain seeding technology is now available 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.200
 mechanical and novel 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.200
 single machines of chord 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.030
 Jacobs responds to the claims 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.440
 higher surface performance with the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.990
 Presentation of the tv series 1992 creates 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.920
 the company the 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.800
 possibility of combining with passive 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.860
 tillage the development of a 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.730
 more powerful sashas succeed chord 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.370
 1994 the patent on the slick schicks 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.490
 attracted great attention in the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.200
 developed in the 90s 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.860
 chord becomes the market leader for 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.930
 seeding technology in europe the goal is also the 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.130
 to conquer world market is moving into tangible 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.850
 neighborhood 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.640
 when in 1996 the Norwegian 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.950
 kverneland group joins the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.380
 location in sauce remains 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.630
 the production of the very machines saved 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.700
 the whole group is centered there 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.890
 with the development of the first isobus 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.770
 capable drill machine proves that 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.810
 2004 continue this here 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.200
 Milestones of agricultural technology developed 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.520
 become 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.060
 this is the opportunity created 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.810
 manufacturer-independent machines 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.790
 to control combinations centrally 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.420
 in addition to the presentation of the drill pro 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.580
 represents warmth country 2006 the integrated 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.700
 solution for a flexible lake procedure 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.769
 kverneland now pursues a completely 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.769
 new concept of saddle drill 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.989
 Technique of the set tank is located 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.600
 directly on the tower of the circular saw 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.180
 for a first-class user comfort 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.600
 the dispenser is easily accessible 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.510
 positioned on the side of the machine 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.600
 with the pulled dg series 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.450
 kverneland 2007 a driller for 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.490
 large farms in front of working widths of nine 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.570
 up to twelve meters are possible 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:04.330
 the contact is almost 6000 liters with it 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.580
 the impact force of the dg series not too 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.650
 excel 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.850
 presented at the sima in paris 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.010
 kverneland 2013 with the new cx2 schaar 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.709
 the second generation of the divorce 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.870
 schaars with the invention of the 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.240
 pneumatic sowing technology and the 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.420
 patented cx discs charttechnik 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.700
 chord has made a name for itself and 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.760
 the agricultural engineering sector sustainable 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.860
 shaped the future of the dramatic 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.810
 However, turning technology is in the expansion of 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.810
