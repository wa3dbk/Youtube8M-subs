00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.270

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.240
 fast noodles once on the Turkish 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.220
 doctor taste and taste 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.830
 afterwards a bit like you 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.270
 that is now admonished for lazy and it 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.300
 is now going right on with the 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.830
 it did not matter if it needed ingredients 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.090
 decisive I have such here 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.860
 smash ex shaped then need in 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.059
 the onion I have already fine 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:46.120
 Chopped green sprits peppers I've got 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.670
 I already cut strip 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.239
 spices we need salt pepper and 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.640
 noble sweet paprika powder here I have 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.910
 tomato paste and some paprika marc 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.110
 olive oil to sear and here comes 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.980
 after a bit of pasta water 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.840
 purely 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.910
 because we need the noodle water for 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.470
 you need the sauce and minced meat 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.600
 Of course, I also have here in the 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.690
 We took meat 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.520
 plus a yoghurt sauce and that 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.600
 we do not need much ingredients I have 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.220
 yogurt here you can do as much as you want 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.250
 and also what you want me to have 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.710
 now a bit sour with 3.5 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.720
 percent fat taken that is one 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.180
 Turkish and here I have two 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.159
 I pressed the cloves of garlic 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.930
 right now in the youth 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:39.220
 Add in and I'll enter there 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.890
 little salt into it not too much then 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.259
 the sauce, he also includes the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.409
 So the meaty sauce includes yes 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:50.799
 even salt then it just stirred 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.350
 um and have your yoko already done 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:58.570
 I give myself for the minced meat sauce 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:02.310
 Now about two tablespoons of olive oil in 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:06.220
 one in a pot or in a pan 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.900
 my mincemeat in and leave that 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.900
 Minced meat for a few minutes now 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:16.100
 fry in it and then give the vegetables 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.350
 In the meantime, the meetings are 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.150
 according to the package instructions dry and 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.950
 then write a look in afterwards 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.760
 the sky 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.370
 water off so my heart is so 45 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:42.950
 minutes were advised and give now 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:45.140
 my love and power pure and everything 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.739
 a few more funny 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.150
 so fly the onions and peppers 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.180
 get a little soft 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.190
 I have everything now 15 more 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.970
 minutes competed with each other 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.010
 and now we can do the tomatenmark and 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.750
 paper from merck known as pure 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.910
 even with tomatoes or paprika 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:13.910
 We need both remain like the 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:17.500
 people always like and the spices 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.500
 Now everyone comes in too 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.970
 we turn on the stove now too 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.079
 down a bit or up 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.450
 lowest level 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.519
 because the tomatenmark and so on that 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.130
 can be fast 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.720
 so now you can get something from 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.120
 enter noodle water 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.560
 I give now such a trowel 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.769
 just two sources of noodle water become pure 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.630
 made in and it is now optimal 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.069
 and the sauce is already finished 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.500
 when the noodles are cooked 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.109
 we can do it already so I show 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.920
 not the whole thing yet 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.440
 I have always served 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.530
 noodles on a plate 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.620
 and here we have our yoghurt sauce 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.049
 the shares appreciate 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.959
 Over the noodles you could noodle and 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.269
 by the way, yoghurt sauce already before 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.980
 mix well with each other and so on 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.419
 However, the teller give you never know 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.810
 how much you want to eat 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.430
 and if something is left then you can 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.900
 that does not feel any warm anymore 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.930
 That's why I give the noodle 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.430
 rather the yoghurt sauce rather first 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:34.620
 on it like that and somehow yoghurt sauce 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.620
 I then distribute the minced meat sauce 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.130
 this is a totally delicious recipe must 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.680
 necessarily imitate if you do that 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.660
 I have never done it then 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.400
 Have fun copying 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.350
 I hope you have fun watching 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.090
 made a fast but delicious 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.350
 recipe and then we'll see it 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.350
 next time bye
