00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:12.180
 and víctor in the mechanical aldo is a magician 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.620
 which is used in the central area is a 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.389
 champion who has a lot of 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.430
 bugs can kill their rival in a 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.740
 blink of an eye 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.570
 it's good sunning thank you wv and from my 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.290
 point of view is one of the best 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.329
 beats of the moment well we begin to stop 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.790
 about 3000 defenses of power of ability 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.619
 9 marks of power skill 9 stamps 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.570
 of life by level and 9 teams of 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.370
 magic resistance or we can opt 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.489
 also for 9 reduction glyphs 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.170
 cooling for masters 2109 in 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.570
 focus on the magical damage and the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.129
 regeneration of marc spells of 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.289
 invoker we can always play with 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.559
 flash but we can choose between ghost 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.289
 healing barrier or even learn but 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.989
 the last one I do not recommend it so much 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.329
 well now your skills your passive 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.679
 glory that evolution 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.809
 Victor starts with an object called 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.699
 nucleus which we can improve to 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.460
 get better statistics and power 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.920
 improve your skills the cv will give you 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.340
 more mobility of w 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.530
 will bring the enemy to the center will leave her a 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.930
 second damage which will do more damage 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.570
 magical 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.330
 the erre will move faster but this 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.010
 is updated to the maximum evolution is not 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.290
 good to buy all the improvements of a 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.140
 flip it is better to simply update the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.270
 laser beam and start to assemble another object 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.190
 and then after buying the others or even 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.110
 you can buy two improvements but the 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.670
 third is not advisable and you 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.180
 you will be far behind 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.880
 sukkur power transfer 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.650
 Victor attacks an enemy unit in addition 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.200
 of causing magical damage and getting a 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.390
 shield increases the power of enough 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.130
 self-attack stability used to make 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.290
 an exchange and so not lose much 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.450
 life also followed by equal attack 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.960
 works with the brightness that makes the 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.960
 milk ammunition a very good object its 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.760
 w Gravitational field Vctor is a field 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.979
 of vittorio which at the beginning was 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.410
 letizia when spending time and the enemy 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.690
 stay inside is studied or 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.450
 paralyzed this life is good for 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.600
 sanitize one against one or even in 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.310
 be fights for equipment but remember this 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.800
 it really works with uses of the jungle 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.540
 except dragon and baron although this 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.040
 unit are stud do not be afraid of 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.600
 throw it since at the beginning it 's a very 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.090
 good slowdown and so you can 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.330
 pursue the tribal 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.670
 his ray of death Victor has a 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.170
 ray straight line from your arm this is 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.690
 the primary ability of víctor with the 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.430
 which we will reach you and we will do 30 when 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.379
 this ability touch the opponent will make 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.360
 all the damage and if it costs you to work 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.849
 final stability to see how it is pulled 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.150
 the trajectory and aims and if you know how to play 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:49.150
 course will be much simpler and the same 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.849
 do not be afraid to prepare the beam 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.670
 while you keep your finger on the button and 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.200
 finally his ere storm of chaos whistled 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.760
 the case the singularity in the field of 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.400
 battle that involves the magic year and 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.170
 interrupts enemy channelings 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.269
 next inflicts the magic year to 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.459
 all nearby enemies 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.860
 Victor can redirect the singularity 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.540
 this life can throw you to several 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.760
 enemies and use it while the rival 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.650
 have a percentage of life down like this already 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.400
 You can finish killing with the most damage 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.709
 that per second 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.450
 we will start doran ring in almost 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.610
 all the cases still we can start 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.189
 with crystal jars and we see the line 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.079
 very difficult of boots we can choose 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:29.030
 those of sorcerer or larsson already in what 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.760
 I only recommend the lines if 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.989
 we do not go to the sea morello not me with 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.370
 the essential objects is going to be the 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.769
 first update of the sex with 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.750
 rabadán hat and vacuum staff 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.629
 in the record update what 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.609
 we will put in the skill in objects 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.069
 varied we can opt for monero no me 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.040
 with if we want this from r and we do not 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.989
 we will assemble jon ya the code ludden for more 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.420
 I got hurt are aunts to be able 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.329
 survive and have this second air 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.299
 setravi salt and obvious updates 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:02.889
 of the export in order would be first in 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:05.000
 then the q and at the end the w 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.889
 recommendations try to practice the 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.989
 laser beam to be able to harass and know 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.549
 how to use it you can use all blue 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.459
 also to heal and not just to 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.859
 start fights the next total that you 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.269
 cv is too powerful it is also in 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.789
 reality with a give 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.069
 quite low so you dare to have it 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.930
 next to your ex do not take positions 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:26.659
 risky that it could be eliminated 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.550
 very quickly remember you're a great 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.139
 champion with a poor high's so 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.090
 try to throw all your skills in 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.030
 a correct order to be able to exploit 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.220
 your good rival has been everything in this guide 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.080
 of Victor, I hope you have served them and 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.400
 if it served him I would like him and the 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.169
 they shared with those people who 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.479
 They would like to reach that glorious 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.520
 good evolution before finishing the 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.440

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.659

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.280
 lately and it's pretty good and it gives 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:04.009
 good results the echo tank in the 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.319
 together but I would also like to make a

 champions but I need you to give me 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.150
 opinions of what champion they would like 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.319
