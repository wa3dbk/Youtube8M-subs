00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.260
 from the very first time children 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.900
 go to bed 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.980
 This is it that there are monsters in their closet 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.980
 are hidden 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.390
 but what they don't know is that 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.390
 monsters not always so and where 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.850
 can in her class and have no clothes on 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.710
 they first had to go to the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.630
 university of imagine you are 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.550
 a very small monster 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.379
 in would make one of the biggest bang 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.300
 factories to world want to work ok ah 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.860
 fat funny we will now look good 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.390
 but sometimes you gillnet if you have one 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.340
 joke with someone what makes up think 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.559
 at least something that is fun is that 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.930
 course in advance of course 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.600
 new and where can you study 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.090
 indeed at monsters university and 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.130
 match in 2001 our sync came from we 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.000
 should actually see this movie as one 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.460
 i am brewing 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.530
 that means what happened before with 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.759
 the story for mike and james together 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.259
 have met 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.300
 anyway now i am incredibly nice to know 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.300
 and in this film came in certainly behind 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.990
 you don't always get what you want too 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.610
 Not if your sample is our June first 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.850

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.040
 bushes in a wonderful movie pretty 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.659
 high qualities in which the fillets of 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.030
 sorry about your screen are the splashes 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.810
 within a lot of humor for young and old 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.670
 old 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.340
