over there going absolutely nuts will
just<00:00:13.799> cover<00:00:14.639> exactly<00:00:15.179> what<00:00:15.299> we're<00:00:15.450> trying<00:00:15.630> to

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
just cover exactly what we're trying to

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.240 
just cover exactly what we're trying to
do<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.800> first<00:00:17.039> thing<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.520> get<00:00:18.029> your<00:00:19.020> arm<00:00:19.320> 5

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
do the first thing is to get your arm 5

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.730 
do the first thing is to get your arm 5
stack<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.760> your<00:00:21.180> dark<00:00:21.660> transformation<00:00:22.439> for

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
stack of your dark transformation for

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.300 
stack of your dark transformation for
your<00:00:22.859> pet<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.180> because<00:00:24.769> most<00:00:25.769> unholy

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
your pet and that is because most unholy

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.210 
your pet and that is because most unholy
decays<00:00:26.760> will<00:00:27.029> be<00:00:27.210> rocking<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:28.189> 4-piece<00:00:29.189> set

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
decays will be rocking the 4-piece set

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.759 
decays will be rocking the 4-piece set
bonus<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.570> set<00:00:30.869> motors<00:00:31.140> there<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.529> when

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
bonus so the set motors there is when

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.180 
bonus so the set motors there is when
you<00:00:31.800> say<00:00:32.669> dark<00:00:33.000> transformation<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.530> shadow

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
you say dark transformation the shadow

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.389 
you say dark transformation the shadow
damage<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.910> increased<00:00:36.270> by<00:00:36.480> twenty<00:00:37.079> percent<00:00:37.469> so

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
damage is increased by twenty percent so

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.360 
damage is increased by twenty percent so
shadow<00:00:38.730> damage<00:00:39.210> comes<00:00:39.629> from<00:00:40.100> your<00:00:41.100> scourge

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
shadow damage comes from your scourge

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.880 
shadow damage comes from your scourge
strike<00:00:41.690> your<00:00:42.690> death<00:00:42.989> cause<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.530> much<00:00:43.649> like
