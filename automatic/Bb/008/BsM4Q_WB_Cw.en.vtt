00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.930
 welcome in this new tutorial we 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.200
 will teach how to make specifications with 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.200
 Coca Cola 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.700
 to do these explanations what 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.770
 we need is a container with some 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.290
 800 milliliters of water another with 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.110
 coca cola that are 200 milliliters a 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.570
 little cold water to stop the reaction 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.810
 then we're going to need a big one gram 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.370
 of sodium alginate 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.140
 5 grams of calcium lactate and good 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.090
 tools that we are going to use both 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.400
 a spoon to be able to take out a spoon 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.970
 to put it normal spoon and cover 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.000
 material 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.920
 very well let's start the first thing that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.130
 we have to do is put the grain of 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.840
 someone high in sodium in our mix 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.840
 of coca-cola here we have already drawn 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.079
 we add a little 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.739
 we remove a little and now with the help 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.739
 of the minipimer 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.320
 we will remove everything very well 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.869
 Obviously, being a cocacola will be formed 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.540
 First foam and specification 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:20.160
 will be without gas 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.160
 it has to be very well mixed 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.020
 we have everything well removed what 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.470
 let's do is wait for all the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.380
 mixture is without bubbles and looks good 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.720
 well liquid while our mixture is 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.940
 it ends up sitting we're going to do is put 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.740
 in the 800 milliliters of water 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.210
 let's put to put the lactate of 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.210
 calcium 5 grams 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.390
 and with some rods a spoon we are going to 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.060
 stir carefully until everything is 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.460
 well well dissolved 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.570
 once we have dissolved we could 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.460
 do it directly in this 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.659
 but I think it's better to do 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.710
 a flat container since we can 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.230
 more separate the 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.120
 specifications let's start carefully 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.390
 we put it in this container has to 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.390
 stay 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.550
 a little bit high so that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.350
 specifications to learn everything 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.080
 once we have it all ready 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.520
 with a normal spoonful or with a 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.830
 spoon that is quite round and in 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.480
 this case I do not have a spoon I have this 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.050
 here what we do is 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.050
 woman 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.880
 and then carefully 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.600
 let's do the test also with a 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.600
 spoon 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.380
 and this we have to have more or less 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.380
 in this mixture 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.940
 about two minutes 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.950
 agree not much more because yes no 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.950
 it will give you too big a cover 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.750
 very carefully what we are going to do 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.120
 is to take them out and put them in the cold water 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.650
 that we had this to give the reaction 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.790
 here we have to be very careful 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.790
 so they do not burst 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.010
 if you have a spoon like this 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.530
 to which the water can enter 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.000
 to come out that we are better 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.000
 we want how we have a 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.970
 we have here how is it going 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.639
 As we can see, it looks like a bit of 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:49.939
 gelatin and if we burst it we see that 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.939
 inside 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.990
 for these last two I will use 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.990
 white plate so that it can be 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.790
 Y 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.949
 and the other we see how these two have 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.130
 perfect, let's do some 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.130
 plus 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.229
 good since we have the result we see 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.029
 how they really look is that they are left 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.110
 very well quite round this is the 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.850
 only 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.120
 since the spoon will stay a little 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.100
 Better or worse 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.830
 and it was full we hope that I have 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.950
 liked you see that yes 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.990
 we break them inside is liquid 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.550
 we have been able to verify and that we hope 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.910
 that you liked it if you liked it 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.250
 please give to lay 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.470
 we see subscribe to our channel and if 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.970
 you want more similar videos we're going to 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.760
 Upload others in our kitchen channel 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.230
 of food still as there are also many of 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.350
 many interesting and funny dishes 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.990
 so you did not like anything please 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.830
 say something so thank you and 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.830
 until the next video
