00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.980
 good morning we present you the new sony 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.370
 here we bring it in the briefcase 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.800
 padded and well sheltered 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.520
 newly arrived 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:21.060
 the last 13 inch bathroom 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.590
 here we have it right has a start 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.920
 spectacular in less than 10 seconds we 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.920
 will start 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.040
 12 today what happens 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.550
 that screen 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.850
 he does strange things 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.850
 well let's put in the feeder 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.160
 is not that 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.060
 those stripes how weird 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.320
 it turns out that in three weeks we already 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.550
 the monitor appears completely with 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.450
 stripes 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.450
 we'll see 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.240
 what will happen 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.340
 result 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.920
 that if we open anything it makes us 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.979
 this effect 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.979
 well let's check what it says are 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.950
 are and on their website in this model 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.670
 we can read vertical lines and 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.360
 horizontals on the screen we turn it off 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.940
 we reviewed bios and discovered that we 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.190
 happens again and at the end we read that the 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.619
 cause is that it is possibly not 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.260
 covered by the bay warranty and they are 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.260
 good monitor problems 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.140
 we go back to our three laptop 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:03.240
 weeks and doing this what horror 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.789
 now we will have to take it to us 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.649
 fix it or to see or turn off a monitor 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.519
 because they say that we have given him a 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:14.099
 hit but with the button on the right 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:18.709
 we go to graphical properties and there 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.709
 we find advanced mode accept 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.420
 Y 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.549
 in color improvement let's contrast what 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.030
 we set to 0 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.250
 tachÃ¡n arranged 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.370
 what did I do that is different 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.680
 has broken the screen it turns out that it must be 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.300
 something graphic because only by changing the 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.730
 contrast attention that everything is arranged 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.550
 awesome good 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.810
 now let's go to chapter 2 we 're going to 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.020
 wear 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.580
 to review to see if in the end they change us 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.580
 the screen and make us pay
