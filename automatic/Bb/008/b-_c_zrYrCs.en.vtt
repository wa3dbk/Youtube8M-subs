iOS 7 lock screen just click on that and

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.890 
iOS 7 lock screen just click on that and
I've<00:01:31.500> said<00:01:31.799> hot<00:01:32.040> corners<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.540> can

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
I've said hot corners here so you can

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.289 
I've said hot corners here so you can
see<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.320> running<00:01:34.680> right<00:01:34.979> instantly<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
see it running right instantly and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.149 
see it running right instantly and
that's<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.080> looks<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> mac<00:01:37.920> guy

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that's what it looks like on the mac guy

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.929 
that's what it looks like on the mac guy
since<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.850> actually<00:01:39.270> customize<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.939> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
since you can actually customize the the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.560 
since you can actually customize the the
font<00:01:42.240> color<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.930> black<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.619> white<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.610> I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
font color to be black or white and I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.910 
font color to be black or white and I
think<00:01:46.049> that's<00:01:46.259> about<00:01:46.439> all<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
think that's about all the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.980 
think that's about all the
customizations<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.970> have<00:01:48.180> there<00:01:48.600> might<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
customizations you have there might be a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.719 
customizations you have there might be a
few<00:01:49.259> more<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.070> I've<00:01:50.189> overlooked

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
few more in there that I've overlooked

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.819 
few more in there that I've overlooked
but<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.659> most<00:01:51.869> part<00:01:52.020> that's<00:01:52.500> what<00:01:52.710> it

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
but for the most part that's what it

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.440 
but for the most part that's what it
looks<00:01:53.009> like<00:01:53.189> guys<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.240> think
