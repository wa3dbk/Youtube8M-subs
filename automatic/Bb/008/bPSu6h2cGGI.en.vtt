00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.000
 first thing to tell you that comes with 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.700

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.230
 let's open here 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.870
 You see how little comes 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.120
 we are not going to take out what is being the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.120
 package that goes independent of the box 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.900
 for do 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.900
 if it is clear because there it is 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.829
 and the box remains part I'll pass 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.109
 here on the greater side are not any 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.309
 and here is the box inside this 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.309
 box comes playstation 4 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.530
 let's open 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.760
 we think 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.130
 we open good I'll take the camera to 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.079
 what do you see 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.079
 so you can see the interior layout 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.790
 good 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.460
 here is the guide of everything and now we go 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.200
 to take everything out, little by little, this 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.200
 is what the playstation 4 comes like 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.619
 now let's get everything out here let's go 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.560
 taking it out to put it that way 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.090
 so it takes up less space 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.090
 Well first worldwide 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.060
 when I thought four I do not know why it 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.060
 has put on like a sheep 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.060
 between your plastic 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.660
 I'm going to take it out 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.710
 I kept plastic storage here on top 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.710
 here it is 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.470
 small couplets 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.979
 the little ones here with nothing and you see what 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.440
 what reflects what we're going to leave here 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.940
 to leave a little bit this 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.300
 if you can see you can go see the guide 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.300
 Of start 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:30.330
 and then later I would be here we have the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.330
 very basic helmets 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.550
 are the helmets with a helmet microphones 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.550
 basic lagarde 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.150
 the next command charge cable 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.150
 here 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.290
 and go 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.270
 small tops loading table that you see 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.270
 all right 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.709
 the playstation 4 power cable 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:03.799
 that is very simple, not as a source 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.790
 external power supply and the 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:10.459
 hdmi cable that does not seem very long but 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.670
 well here is a little bit less 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.890
 that the one the logical box because not 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.970
 have 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.650
 he has nothing is the play 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.810
 then the other things that come in the 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.810
 box that are here to remove it 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:33.010
 is going to pass this box through here to the side 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.010
 or here behind to give an example 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.409
 let's hope it does not fall has all the 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.409
 pint and now 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.519

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.830
