want to approach unseen so let's look
around<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.510> little<00:02:22.540> bit<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.770> town<00:02:24.010> of

around a little bit this is the town of
acre<00:02:24.430> we<00:02:25.150> modeled<00:02:25.600> this<00:02:25.810> based<00:02:26.290> on<00:02:26.530> historical

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
acre we modeled this based on historical

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.700 
acre we modeled this based on historical
documents<00:02:27.820> from<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.330> period<00:02:29.080> of<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.500> Third

Crusade<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.550> again<00:02:31.270> everything<00:02:32.020> is

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
Crusade and again everything is

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.410 
Crusade and again everything is
interactive<00:02:32.860> there<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.400> no<00:02:33.670> level<00:02:33.940> design

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
interactive there is no level design

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.160 
interactive there is no level design
path<00:02:35.430> actually<00:02:36.430> if<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:36.580> can<00:02:36.850> back<00:02:37.390> up<00:02:37.660> we<00:02:37.990> can

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
path actually if you can back up we can

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.360 
path actually if you can back up we can
maybe<00:02:38.320> show<00:02:38.650> them<00:02:38.860> another<00:02:39.130> path<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:42.250> we

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
maybe show them another path so we

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.830 
maybe show them another path so we
really<00:02:42.640> want<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:42.910> give<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.180> player<00:02:43.420> an

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840

really want to give the player an
ability<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.650> express<00:02:45.280> themselves<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.210> you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
ability to express themselves and you

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.630 
ability to express themselves and you

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
can see that his stuff there decided to

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.400 
can see that his stuff there decided to
swing<00:02:48.940> under<00:02:49.120> he<00:02:49.510> could<00:02:49.690> have<00:02:49.810> stepped<00:02:50.020> above

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
swing under he could have stepped above

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.050 
swing under he could have stepped above
and<00:02:50.710> that's<00:02:51.010> exactly<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.730> kind<00:02:51.910> of<00:02:52.000> thing

the<00:02:59.620> character<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.070> little<00:03:00.130> bit<00:03:00.490> let's<00:03:01.090> get

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
the character a little bit let's get

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.780 
the character a little bit let's get
down<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.840> our<00:03:02.080> main<00:03:02.680> business<00:03:02.980> which<00:03:03.640> is

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
down to our main business which is

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
finding William right now we're using

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.300 
finding William right now we're using
our<00:03:08.380> intuition<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.670> scan<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.300> crowd<00:03:10.450> below<00:03:11.310> we

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
our intuition to scan the crowd below we

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.490 
our intuition to scan the crowd below we
can<00:03:12.340> understand<00:03:12.970> who<00:03:13.570> in<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.750> crowd<00:03:13.960> is<00:03:14.170> for

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
can understand who in the crowd is for

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.770 
can understand who in the crowd is for
or<00:03:14.680> against<00:03:15.010> us<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.460> most<00:03:16.000> importantly<00:03:16.480> right

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
or against us and most importantly right

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.750 
or against us and most importantly right
now<00:03:16.990> it'll<00:03:17.230> help<00:03:17.440> us<00:03:17.650> pinpoint<00:03:17.890> our<00:03:18.250> target

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
now it'll help us pinpoint our target

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.570 
now it'll help us pinpoint our target
now<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.630> think<00:03:19.959> it's<00:03:20.320> that<00:03:20.410> guy<00:03:20.770> over<00:03:20.980> there<00:03:21.780> um

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
now I think it's that guy over there um

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.130 
now I think it's that guy over there um
ok<00:03:24.580> there<00:03:24.910> are<00:03:25.030> multiple<00:03:25.420> ways<00:03:25.540> we<00:03:25.870> could<00:03:25.990> do

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
ok there are multiple ways we could do

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.710 
ok there are multiple ways we could do
this<00:03:26.290> we<00:03:26.440> could<00:03:26.590> blast<00:03:26.830> down<00:03:27.130> full<00:03:27.550> speed<00:03:27.910> high

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
this we could blast down full speed high

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.900 
this we could blast down full speed high
profile<00:03:29.230> but<00:03:29.500> what<00:03:29.650> I'd<00:03:29.770> like<00:03:29.800> you<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.430> do<00:03:30.610> this

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
profile but what I'd like you to do this

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.420 
profile but what I'd like you to do this
time<00:03:31.240> is<00:03:31.540> go<00:03:32.170> slowly<00:03:32.590> we're<00:03:33.040> going<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.220> show

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
time is go slowly we're going to show

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.340 
time is go slowly we're going to show
off<00:03:33.610> something<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.360> we<00:03:34.480> call<00:03:34.720> social

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
off something that we call social

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.680 
off something that we call social
stealth<00:03:35.709> so<00:03:36.550> this<00:03:36.760> is<00:03:36.910> an<00:03:37.000> idea<00:03:37.300> that<00:03:37.420> you're

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
stealth so this is an idea that you're

like your hidden when you're doing

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.229 
like your hidden when you're doing
things<00:03:41.709> that<00:03:41.800> are<00:03:41.890> socially<00:03:42.489> acceptable<00:03:42.970> and

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
we're going to use these monks we've

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.990 
we're going to use these monks we've
done<00:03:47.650> some<00:03:47.830> helping<00:03:48.220> missions<00:03:48.550> to<00:03:48.670> help<00:03:48.850> them

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.970 
out so they're going to let us blend in
and<00:03:51.670> this<00:03:52.209> way<00:03:52.420> we<00:03:52.450> can<00:03:52.690> approach<00:03:53.140> our<00:03:53.440> target

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
and this way we can approach our target

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.490 
and this way we can approach our target
without<00:03:54.670> attracting<00:03:55.570> too<00:03:55.750> much<00:03:55.900> attention<00:03:55.959> I

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
without attracting too much attention I

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.880 
without attracting too much attention I
think<00:03:56.530> now<00:03:56.920> is<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.160> good<00:03:57.280> time<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.670> branch<00:03:58.120> off

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
think now is a good time to branch off

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.160 
think now is a good time to branch off
let's<00:03:59.890> walk<00:04:00.100> up<00:04:00.340> slowly<00:04:00.700> before<00:04:01.480> they<00:04:01.810> realize

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
let's walk up slowly before they realize

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.290 
let's walk up slowly before they realize
what's<00:04:02.410> going<00:04:02.620> on

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
what's going on

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.360 
what's going on
and<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.660> key<00:04:04.900> moment<00:04:05.320> of<00:04:06.030> assassination

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
and the key moment of assassination

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.780 
and the key moment of assassination
after<00:04:09.370> this<00:04:09.550> full<00:04:10.420> chaos<00:04:10.840> breaks<00:04:11.320> out<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:12.010> now

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
after this full chaos breaks out and now

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.220 
after this full chaos breaks out and now
you<00:04:12.850> want<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.240> escape<00:04:13.540> as<00:04:13.750> quickly<00:04:14.020> as

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
you want to escape as quickly as

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.500 
you want to escape as quickly as
possible<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:15.250> crowd<00:04:15.520> becomes<00:04:15.940> dynamic

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
possible the crowd becomes dynamic

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.420 
possible the crowd becomes dynamic
obstacles<00:04:17.170> and<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.650> feeling<00:04:17.980> is<00:04:18.100> very<00:04:18.130> much

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
obstacles and the feeling is very much

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.640 
obstacles and the feeling is very much
like<00:04:18.670> American<00:04:19.150> football<00:04:19.570> you<00:04:20.049> really<00:04:20.380> could

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
like American football you really could

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.350 
like American football you really could
get<00:04:20.799> knocked<00:04:21.100> over<00:04:21.310> if<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.670> run<00:04:21.850> full<00:04:22.090> force

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
get knocked over if you run full force

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.610 
get knocked over if you run full force
into<00:04:22.570> someone's<00:04:22.990> then<00:04:23.140> we're<00:04:23.260> going<00:04:23.350> to<00:04:23.410> stay

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
into someone's then we're going to stay

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.560 
into someone's then we're going to stay
to<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.830> right<00:04:23.860> here<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.640> let's<00:04:25.000> head<00:04:25.210> towards

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
to the right here and let's head towards

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.540 
to the right here and let's head towards
the<00:04:25.690> exit<00:04:27.570> are<00:04:28.570> we<00:04:28.750> being<00:04:28.960> followed<00:04:29.550> okay

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
the exit are we being followed okay

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.190 
the exit are we being followed okay
we're<00:04:31.210> going<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.390> show<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:31.630> something<00:04:32.080> else

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
we're going to show you something else

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.110 
we're going to show you something else
we<00:04:32.530> can<00:04:32.770> break<00:04:33.040> things<00:04:33.370> dynamically<00:04:33.880> we<00:04:34.000> have

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
we can break things dynamically we have

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.610 
we can break things dynamically we have
physics<00:04:34.570> we're<00:04:35.170> going<00:04:35.260> to<00:04:35.320> create<00:04:35.530> a

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
physics we're going to create a

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.950 
physics we're going to create a
barricade<00:04:36.190> I<00:04:36.480> thought<00:04:37.480> that<00:04:37.600> was<00:04:37.690> coming

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
barricade I thought that was coming

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.890 
barricade I thought that was coming
towards<00:04:38.230> me<00:04:38.290> and<00:04:39.280> quick<00:04:40.210> let's<00:04:40.510> get<00:04:40.690> to<00:04:40.810> the

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
towards me and quick let's get to the

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.620 
towards me and quick let's get to the
exit<00:04:43.500> okay<00:04:44.500> well<00:04:44.890> we've<00:04:45.040> been<00:04:45.210> cornered<00:04:46.210> here

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
exit okay well we've been cornered here

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.840 
exit okay well we've been cornered here
and<00:04:46.810> I<00:04:47.500> can<00:04:47.710> show<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.190> fight<00:04:48.490> now

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
and I can show you the fight now

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.330 
and I can show you the fight now
basically<00:04:49.750> this<00:04:50.080> is<00:04:50.140> a<00:04:50.290> very<00:04:50.470> realistic<00:04:50.890> fight

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
basically this is a very realistic fight

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.580 
basically this is a very realistic fight
system<00:04:51.820> you<00:04:52.060> can't<00:04:52.330> take<00:04:52.600> 100<00:04:53.230> blows<00:04:53.410> to<00:04:53.560> the

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
system you can't take 100 blows to the

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.580 
system you can't take 100 blows to the
head<00:04:53.710> in<00:04:54.070> fact<00:04:54.370> you<00:04:54.880> can't<00:04:55.120> even<00:04:55.210> take<00:04:55.510> one<00:04:55.810> so

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
head in fact you can't even take one so

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.750 
head in fact you can't even take one so
what<00:04:56.770> you<00:04:56.860> want<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.130> do<00:04:57.220> is<00:04:57.310> take<00:04:57.460> a<00:04:57.520> defensive

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
what you want to do is take a defensive

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.030 
what you want to do is take a defensive
pose<00:04:58.450> and<00:04:58.840> wait<00:04:59.020> for<00:04:59.290> an<00:04:59.350> opening<00:04:59.530> in<00:05:00.010> the

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
pose and wait for an opening in the

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.890 
pose and wait for an opening in the
enemy<00:05:00.400> just<00:05:00.640> like<00:05:00.790> his<00:05:01.000> stuff<00:05:01.210> is<00:05:01.390> doing<00:05:01.720> and

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
enemy just like his stuff is doing and

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.470 
enemy just like his stuff is doing and
use<00:05:02.410> that<00:05:02.440> timing<00:05:03.220> tool<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.030> your<00:05:04.240> perfect

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480
