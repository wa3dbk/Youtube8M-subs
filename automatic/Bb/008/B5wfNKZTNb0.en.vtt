little tool to have in your camera bag

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.470 
little tool to have in your camera bag
when<00:00:09.929> you're<00:00:10.050> doing<00:00:10.290> landscape<00:00:10.860> work<00:00:11.480> often

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
when you're doing landscape work often

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.120 
when you're doing landscape work often
times<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.870> can<00:00:12.960> be<00:00:13.110> presented<00:00:13.620> with<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.769> scene

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
times you can be presented with a scene

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.950 
times you can be presented with a scene
to<00:00:14.400> where<00:00:14.549> there's<00:00:14.759> going<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.030> be<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.210> very<00:00:15.570> wide

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
to where there's going to be a very wide

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.380 
to where there's going to be a very wide
dynamic<00:00:16.320> range<00:00:16.710> where<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.670> sky<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.000> going<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
dynamic range where the sky is going to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.870 
dynamic range where the sky is going to
be<00:00:18.510> very<00:00:18.960> bright<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.670> knock

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
be very bright and you have to knock

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.150 
be very bright and you have to knock
that<00:00:20.910> down<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.230> becomes<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.830> proper

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
that down so it becomes in proper

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.120 
that down so it becomes in proper
proportion<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.880> foreground<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.890> tool

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
proportion with the foreground the tool

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.550 
proportion with the foreground the tool
to<00:00:26.250> use<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.029> neutral<00:00:27.449> density<00:00:27.630> graduated

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
to use is a neutral density graduated

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.659 
to use is a neutral density graduated
filter<00:00:29.119> so<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:31.500> old<00:00:31.619> process<00:00:32.130> starts<00:00:32.489> with

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
filter so the old process starts with

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.880 
filter so the old process starts with
the<00:00:33.390> holder<00:00:33.660> itself<00:00:33.989> okay<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.590> called<00:00:34.770> a

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the holder itself okay it's called a

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.040 
the holder itself okay it's called a
Koken<00:00:35.280> p<00:00:35.460> holder<00:00:35.820> what<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.690> would<00:00:36.780> do<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.020> you

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
Koken p holder what you would do is you

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.790 
Koken p holder what you would do is you
would<00:00:37.170> attach<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.040> your<00:00:38.219> lens<00:00:39.770> make<00:00:40.770> sure

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
would attach this to your lens make sure

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
would attach this to your lens make sure
it's<00:00:41.129> nice<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.309> secure<00:00:42.649> okay<00:00:43.649> once<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.520> time

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
it's nice and secure okay once that time

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.150 
it's nice and secure okay once that time
what<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.420> want<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.079> look<00:00:46.860> at<00:00:47.010> your

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
what you want to do is look at your

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.790 
what you want to do is look at your
scene<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:48.300> want<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.570> compose<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.350> you

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
scene you want to compose it and you

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.040 
scene you want to compose it and you
want<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.039> expose<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> foreground<00:00:51.180> okay

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
want to expose on the foreground okay

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.340 
want to expose on the foreground okay
once<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.190> exposed<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.120> foreground<00:00:54.539> that's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
once it's exposed the foreground that's

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.110 
once it's exposed the foreground that's
your<00:00:55.649> proper<00:00:56.010> exposure<00:00:56.340> now<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.940> want

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
your proper exposure now what you want

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.260 
your proper exposure now what you want
to<00:00:57.180> do<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.539> want<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.870> knock<00:00:58.079> down<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.590> sky

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
to do is you want to knock down that sky

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.240 
to do is you want to knock down that sky
to<00:01:00.270> get<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.539> into<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.840> closer<00:01:01.140> dynamic<00:01:01.739> range<00:01:02.010> as

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
to get it into a closer dynamic range as

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.759 
to get it into a closer dynamic range as
the<00:01:02.699> foreground<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.690> what<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.320> would<00:01:04.409> do<00:01:04.559> is

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the foreground so what you would do is

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.380 
the foreground so what you would do is
you<00:01:05.010> would<00:01:05.309> take<00:01:05.640> your<00:01:05.820> neutral<00:01:06.270> density

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
you would take your neutral density

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.429 
you would take your neutral density
graduated<00:01:07.200> filter<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.450> take<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.570> out<00:01:09.689> here<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
graduated filter and take it out here it

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.280 
graduated filter and take it out here it
is<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.010> you'll<00:01:11.729> notice<00:01:11.939> what<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.659> on

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
is and you'll notice what it is is on

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.609 
is and you'll notice what it is is on
the<00:01:13.409> top<00:01:13.850> nice<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.880> tinted<00:01:15.509> okay<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.259> as<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the top nice and tinted okay and as it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.740 
the top nice and tinted okay and as it
moves<00:01:16.860> down<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.400> tinting<00:01:18.119> becomes<00:01:18.450> less<00:01:18.720> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
moves down the tinting becomes less and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.219 
moves down the tinting becomes less and
less<00:01:18.990> until<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.740> clear<00:01:20.100> down<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> bottom

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
less until it's clear down on the bottom

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.810 
less until it's clear down on the bottom
this<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.350> called<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.590> graduated<00:01:23.310> filter<00:01:23.640> now

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
this it's called a graduated filter now

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.310 
this it's called a graduated filter now
they<00:01:23.939> come<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.210> two<00:01:24.360> different<00:01:24.509> types<00:01:24.930> they

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
they come in two different types they

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.460 
they come in two different types they
come<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.710> hard<00:01:25.950> line<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:27.060> soft<00:01:27.330> line<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
come in a hard line and a soft line the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.219 
come in a hard line and a soft line the
hard<00:01:28.740> line<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.250> where<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> filter<00:01:30.659> portion

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
hard line is where the filter portion

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.530 
hard line is where the filter portion
the<00:01:31.350> tinted<00:01:31.710> portion<00:01:32.100> goes<00:01:32.369> halfway<00:01:33.150> down

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
the tinted portion goes halfway down

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.530 
the tinted portion goes halfway down
with<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> same<00:01:34.829> density<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.549> then<00:01:36.299> all<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
with the same density to it then all of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.109 
with the same density to it then all of
a<00:01:36.630> sudden<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.380> going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.890> clear<00:01:38.310> those

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
a sudden it's going to be clear those

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.910 
a sudden it's going to be clear those
are<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.329> kind<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.840> want<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.140> use<00:01:40.380> if<00:01:40.770> you're

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
are the kind you want to use if you're

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.749 
are the kind you want to use if you're
doing<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:42.590> landscape<00:01:43.590> shot<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.159> has<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> very

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
or a desert escape a lot of times you're

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.830 
or a desert escape a lot of times you're
not<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.790> presented<00:01:51.479> with<00:01:51.509> that

you're<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.409> little<00:01:52.649> Hills<00:01:53.009> maybe

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
you're going to have little Hills maybe

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.580 
you're going to have little Hills maybe
a<00:01:53.970> couple<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.329> trees<00:01:54.630> something<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.380> in

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
a couple of trees something like that in

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.469 
a couple of trees something like that in
that<00:01:55.710> case<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.009> want<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> use<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.939> soft<00:01:57.240> line

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
that case you want to use the soft line

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.719 
that case you want to use the soft line
the<00:01:57.780> graduated<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.590> which<00:01:59.189> means<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the graduated one which means that the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.429 
the graduated one which means that the
top<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.149> going<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.689> most<00:02:00.840> filtered<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
top is going to be the most filtered and

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.289 
top is going to be the most filtered and
as<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.740> goes<00:02:01.890> down<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.490> filtering<00:02:02.939> becomes

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
as it goes down the filtering becomes

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.660 
as it goes down the filtering becomes
more<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.899> more<00:02:03.990> graduated<00:02:04.890> lighter<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
more and more graduated lighter and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.700 
more and more graduated lighter and
lighter<00:02:05.880> until<00:02:06.659> it's<00:02:06.810> clear<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> bottom

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
lighter until it's clear on the bottom

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.790 
lighter until it's clear on the bottom
okay<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.819> you've<00:02:09.750> metered<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.410> foreground

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
okay so you've metered on the foreground

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.070 
okay so you've metered on the foreground
now<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.250> want<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.580> knock<00:02:11.730> down<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.150> sky<00:02:12.390> so

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
now you want to knock down the sky so

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.970 
now you want to knock down the sky so
what<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.319> would<00:02:13.440> do

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
what you would do

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.070 
what you would do
is<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.310> would<00:02:14.430> take<00:02:14.610> your<00:02:14.760> filter<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.330> you

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
is you would take your filter and you

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.210 
is you would take your filter and you
would<00:02:16.200> slide<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.769> into<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.720> slots<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.220> the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
would slide it into the slots and the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.059 
would slide it into the slots and the
holder<00:02:20.549> as<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.900> bring<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.230> camera<00:02:22.620> up<00:02:22.650> and

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
holder as you bring the camera up and

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.970 
holder as you bring the camera up and
you're<00:02:23.190> composing<00:02:23.549> it<00:02:24.379> continue<00:02:25.379> to<00:02:25.530> slide

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
you're composing it continue to slide

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.190 
you're composing it continue to slide
the<00:02:26.250> filter<00:02:26.580> down<00:02:26.959> what's<00:02:27.959> going<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.140> happen

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
the filter down what's going to happen

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.199 
the filter down what's going to happen
is<00:02:28.530> you're<00:02:28.650> going<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:28.830> see<00:02:29.069> that<00:02:29.340> tinted<00:02:29.790> area

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
is you're going to see that tinted area

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.150 
is you're going to see that tinted area
coming<00:02:30.900> lower<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.349> lower<00:02:31.560> towards<00:02:32.010> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
coming lower and lower towards the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.369 
coming lower and lower towards the
horizon<00:02:32.280> when<00:02:33.239> it's<00:02:33.360> at<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.720> proper<00:02:34.110> place

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
horizon when it's at the proper place

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.660 
horizon when it's at the proper place
you're<00:02:34.950> all<00:02:35.129> set<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.360> then<00:02:36.540> compose

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
you're all set you can then compose

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.509 
you're all set you can then compose
focus<00:02:38.670> take<00:02:39.390> your<00:02:39.540> shot<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.370> you'll<00:02:41.370> have

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
focus take your shot and you'll have

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.670 
focus take your shot and you'll have
knocked<00:02:41.819> down<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.329> sky<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.989> it's<00:02:43.319> we<00:02:43.470> come

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
knocked down that sky and it's we come

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.680 
knocked down that sky and it's we come
down<00:02:44.069> into<00:02:44.370> closer<00:02:44.790> proportion<00:02:45.450> with<00:02:45.659> the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
down into closer proportion with the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.330 
down into closer proportion with the
foreground<00:02:46.230> now<00:02:46.890> let's<00:02:47.069> say<00:02:47.190> you're

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
foreground now let's say you're

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.039 
foreground now let's say you're
presented<00:02:47.879> with<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:48.150> scene<00:02:48.390> where<00:02:48.629> the<00:02:48.750> sky

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
presented with the scene where the sky

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.509 
presented with the scene where the sky
is<00:02:49.290> really<00:02:50.390> really<00:02:51.390> blown<00:02:51.720> out<00:02:51.930> okay<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:53.250> has

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
is really really blown out okay it has

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.369 
is really really blown out okay it has
such<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.790> high<00:02:54.090> range<00:02:54.420> as<00:02:54.660> compared<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
such a high range as compared to the

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.949 
such a high range as compared to the
foreground<00:02:56.040> one<00:02:57.000> filter<00:02:57.239> isn't<00:02:57.510> going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.840> do

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
foreground one filter isn't going to do

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.599 
foreground one filter isn't going to do
it<00:02:57.989> these<00:02:58.470> filters<00:02:58.769> come<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.370> different

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
it these filters come in different

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.720 
it these filters come in different
strengths<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:01.170> right<00:03:01.620> now<00:03:01.650> i<00:03:01.829> have<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.250> two<00:03:02.549> on

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
strengths so right now i have a two on

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.199 
strengths so right now i have a two on
here<00:03:02.970> okay<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:03.959> let's<00:03:04.140> say<00:03:04.319> I<00:03:04.349> have<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.970> six<00:03:05.970> stop

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
here okay so let's say I have a six stop

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.030 
here okay so let's say I have a six stop
difference<00:03:06.750> between<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.440> sky<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.739> the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
difference between the sky and the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.460 
difference between the sky and the
foreground<00:03:08.819> what<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.569> want<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.900> do<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.290> can

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
foreground what I want to do is I can

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.170 
foreground what I want to do is I can
take<00:03:10.620> another<00:03:10.650> filter<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.819> different

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
take another filter of a different

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.080 
take another filter of a different
strengths<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.720> stack<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.920> can<00:03:14.760> come<00:03:14.970> in

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
strengths and stack it I can come in

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.330 
strengths and stack it I can come in
here<00:03:15.299> and<00:03:15.359> I<00:03:15.629> can<00:03:15.840> take<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.319> different<00:03:17.129> filter

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
here and I can take a different filter

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.589 
here and I can take a different filter
which<00:03:18.150> is<00:03:18.329> at<00:03:18.569> a<00:03:18.750> four<00:03:19.440> stop<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:20.269> can<00:03:21.269> then<00:03:21.419> slide

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
which is at a four stop I can then slide

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.430 
which is at a four stop I can then slide
this<00:03:21.930> also<00:03:22.230> in<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.859> holder<00:03:24.109> bringing<00:03:25.109> it<00:03:25.230> down

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
this also in the holder bringing it down

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.170 
this also in the holder bringing it down
to<00:03:25.579> where<00:03:26.579> it<00:03:26.609> matches<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:28.849> height<00:03:29.849> with<00:03:30.060> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
to where it matches the height with the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.379 
to where it matches the height with the
other<00:03:30.359> filter<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:31.620> now<00:03:32.010> stacked<00:03:32.519> what<00:03:33.150> we<00:03:33.239> do

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
other filter is now stacked what we do

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.990 
other filter is now stacked what we do
is<00:03:33.540> we<00:03:33.660> have<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.810> two<00:03:34.079> we<00:03:34.680> have<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:34.829> four<00:03:35.250> we<00:03:35.849> now

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
is we have a two we have a four we now

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.990 
is we have a two we have a four we now
have<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.269> six<00:03:36.660> stop<00:03:36.959> filter<00:03:37.470> on<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.609> camera

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
have a six stop filter on the camera

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.009 
have a six stop filter on the camera
okay<00:03:40.069> compose<00:03:41.069> focuses<00:03:41.880> before<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.510> take

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
okay compose focuses before and take

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.199 
okay compose focuses before and take
your<00:03:43.200> shot<00:03:43.440> there's<00:03:44.370> one<00:03:44.489> thing<00:03:44.669> to<00:03:44.880> really

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
your shot there's one thing to really

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.270 
your shot there's one thing to really
keep<00:03:45.540> in<00:03:45.690> mind<00:03:45.989> when<00:03:46.349> it<00:03:46.380> comes<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.859> filters
