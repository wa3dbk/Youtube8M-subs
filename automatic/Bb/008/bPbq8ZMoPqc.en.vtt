anything<00:00:40.079> seemed<00:00:40.440> different<00:00:40.649> from<00:00:41.129> flash

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
anything seemed different from flash

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.330 
anything seemed different from flash
sure<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.059> way<00:00:42.180> things<00:00:42.239> were<00:00:42.690> run<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.200> face<00:00:43.410> by

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
sure the way things were run the face by

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.240 
sure the way things were run the face by
calling<00:00:44.730> anything<00:00:45.000> differently<00:00:46.010> not<00:00:47.010> right

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
calling anything differently not right

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.700 
calling anything differently not right
now<00:00:47.280> no<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.879> thought<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.539> over<00:00:49.110> wife<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
now no I thought that over wife the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.430 
now no I thought that over wife the
overall<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.700> pace<00:00:50.879> was<00:00:51.059> pretty<00:00:52.020> similar<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
overall the pace was pretty similar and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.040 
overall the pace was pretty similar and
I<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.309> know<00:00:53.399> offensively<00:00:54.050> aside

I think that you know offensively aside

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.260 
I think that you know offensively aside
from<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.379> few<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.980> know<00:00:56.010> miscues<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.969> thought<00:00:57.149> we

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
