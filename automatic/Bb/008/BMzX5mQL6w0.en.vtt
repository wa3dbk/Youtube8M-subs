00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.050 
smashed the device so what I found this
one<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.380> very<00:01:52.560> similar<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.850> one<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
one is very similar to the one that

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.810 
one is very similar to the one that
Kevin<00:01:54.450> recommends<00:01:54.990> his<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.590> plastic<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.219> fake

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
Kevin recommends his is plastic and fake

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.780 
Kevin recommends his is plastic and fake
suede<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.079> fake<00:01:58.409> leather<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.579> what

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
suede this is like fake leather but what

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.249 
suede this is like fake leather but what
they<00:01:59.909> both<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.390> common<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.960> these

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
they both have in common is these

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.980 
they both have in common is these
hardened<00:02:02.189> pronounced<00:02:02.850> corners<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.479> there's

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
hardened pronounced corners and there's

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.080 
hardened pronounced corners and there's
almost<00:02:04.229> nothing<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.829> sides<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
almost nothing on the sides but the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.270 
almost nothing on the sides but the
corners

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
corners

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.340 
corners
because<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.330> corners<00:02:08.690> are<00:02:08.780> pronounced<00:02:09.110> not

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
because the corners are pronounced not

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.140 
because the corners are pronounced not
only<00:02:09.619> do<00:02:09.770> they<00:02:09.890> provide<00:02:10.459> protection<00:02:10.940> if<00:02:11.060> it

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
only do they provide protection if it

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.699 
only do they provide protection if it
lands<00:02:11.300> on<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.540> corner<00:02:11.840> but<00:02:12.260> if<00:02:12.319> it<00:02:12.410> lands<00:02:12.590> on

lands on the corner but if it lands on

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.740 
lands on the corner but if it lands on
its<00:02:12.770> side<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:14.000> corners<00:02:14.270> are<00:02:14.360> pronounced

its side the corners are pronounced

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.180 
its side the corners are pronounced
enough<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.110> they<00:02:15.200> hit<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.500> corners<00:02:15.980> first

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
enough that they hit the corners first

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.309 
enough that they hit the corners first
before<00:02:16.610> they<00:02:16.700> actually<00:02:16.910> hit<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.480> bevel<00:02:18.200> of

to provide ample protection without

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.640 
to provide ample protection without
being<00:02:23.120> bulky<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.840> adding<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.200> lot<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.440> weight
