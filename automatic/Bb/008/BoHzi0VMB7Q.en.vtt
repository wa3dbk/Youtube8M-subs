00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
potatoes in the oven so at a higher heat

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.429 
potatoes in the oven so at a higher heat
so<00:01:43.649> they<00:01:43.770> get<00:01:43.920> nice<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.220> crisp<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:45.229> you<00:01:46.229> have

so they get nice and crisp but you have

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.499
