00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
timing out every once in a while for

timing out every once in a while for
them<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:38.929> only<00:01:39.109> happened<00:01:39.469> to<00:01:39.530> me<00:01:39.619> once<00:01:39.920> and

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
them that only happened to me once and

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.739 
them that only happened to me once and
it<00:01:40.310> was<00:01:40.490> annoying<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.450> I<00:01:41.479> could<00:01:41.630> definitely

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
it was annoying so I could definitely

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.200 
it was annoying so I could definitely
see<00:01:42.109> why<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.530> would<00:01:42.679> upset<00:01:42.799> someone<00:01:43.249> it<00:01:43.640> is

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
see why that would upset someone it is

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.609 
see why that would upset someone it is
technology<00:01:44.600> though<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.229> think<00:01:45.289> it's<00:01:45.560> a

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
technology though and I think it's a

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.620 
technology though and I think it's a
given<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:46.100> there<00:01:46.729> will<00:01:46.850> always<00:01:47.060> be<00:01:47.270> some
