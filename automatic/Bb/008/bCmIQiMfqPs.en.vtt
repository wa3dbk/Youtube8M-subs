tx2 touch smart notebook but what makes

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.280 
tx2 touch smart notebook but what makes
these<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:41.969> interesting<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.570> they<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.170> use

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
these really interesting is they can use

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.590 
these really interesting is they can use
the<00:00:43.469> traditional<00:00:43.620> input<00:00:44.370> methods<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.510> know

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the traditional input methods you know

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.450 
the traditional input methods you know
kind<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.170> middlemen<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.739> input<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
kind of the the middlemen of input the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.580 
kind of the the middlemen of input the
keyboards<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.000> mouse<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.260> can

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
keyboards in the mouse but now you can

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.740 
keyboards in the mouse but now you can
also<00:00:49.739> use<00:00:50.100> your<00:00:50.399> finger<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.480> everything

kind of a fun thing I can drag these
these<00:01:31.439> photos<00:01:31.920> around<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.700> rotate<00:01:33.000> them<00:01:33.509> I

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
these photos around I can rotate them I

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.170 
these photos around I can rotate them I
can<00:01:34.200> enlarge<00:01:34.619> them<00:01:34.950> by<00:01:35.100> pinching<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.909> pulling

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
can enlarge them by pinching and pulling

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.109 
can enlarge them by pinching and pulling
on<00:01:36.659> them<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.500> again<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.579> taking<00:01:38.970> that

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
on them so it's again just taking that

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.880 
on them so it's again just taking that
whole<00:01:39.390> kind<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.720> interface<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.380> computing<00:01:40.770> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
whole kind of interface and computing to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.679 
whole kind of interface and computing to
another<00:01:41.100> level<00:01:41.310> being<00:01:42.000> able<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.270> use<00:01:42.420> things

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
another level being able to use things

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.300 
another level being able to use things
as<00:01:42.930> simple<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:43.439> our<00:01:43.799> fingers<00:01:46.070> what<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.100> like

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
as simple as our fingers what I like

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.920 
as simple as our fingers what I like
about<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> great

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
I can simply insert that on the side and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.770 
I can simply insert that on the side and
watch<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.280> movie<00:01:59.310> if<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.119> want<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.360> leave<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> note

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
for one of the family members I can

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.060 
for one of the family members I can
actually<00:02:03.390> go<00:02:03.479> down<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> note<00:02:04.380> function<00:02:04.860> so

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
actually go down to the note function so

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.100 
actually go down to the note function so
typically<00:02:05.850> when<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.180> leave<00:02:06.600> notes<00:02:06.780> we've<00:02:06.990> got

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
typically when we leave notes we've got

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.990 
typically when we leave notes we've got
the<00:02:07.229> little<00:02:07.429> sticky<00:02:08.429> pads<00:02:08.670> out<00:02:08.849> we're

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the little sticky pads out we're

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.219 
the little sticky pads out we're
probably<00:02:09.179> leaving<00:02:09.539> them<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.810> fridge

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
probably leaving them on the fridge

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.710 
probably leaving them on the fridge
or<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.470> corkboard<00:02:11.250> well<00:02:11.700> now<00:02:11.909> I<00:02:11.940> can<00:02:12.330> use<00:02:12.540> my

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
or the corkboard well now I can use my

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.390 
or the corkboard well now I can use my
fingers<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.560> can<00:02:13.650> have<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.010> note<00:02:14.190> board

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
fingers and you can have the note board

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.949 
fingers and you can have the note board
right<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.879> computer<00:02:15.299> itself<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.810> makes

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
right on the computer itself so it makes

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.350 
right on the computer itself so it makes
a<00:02:16.019> little<00:02:16.200> more<00:02:16.290> fun<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.860> actually<00:02:17.340> do<00:02:17.819> if<00:02:18.269> I

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
a little more fun to actually do if I

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.640 
a little more fun to actually do if I
want<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.599> create<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.810> new<00:02:18.989> one<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.170> can<00:02:19.379> see<00:02:19.500> down

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
want to create a new one I can see down

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.380 
want to create a new one I can see down
in<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:19.860> bottom<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.340> simply<00:02:20.519> just<00:02:20.670> click

and using my finger as the pen I can say

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:33.229 
and using my finger as the pen I can say
for<00:02:25.980> example<00:02:26.400> back<00:02:26.730> at<00:02:28.160> 3<00:02:30.170> Mike<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:33.120> can
