00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the rocks over there there's some black

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.630 
the rocks over there there's some black
rock<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.289> some<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.650> these<00:00:28.740> rocks<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.189> use<00:00:29.369> for

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
rock and some of these rocks you use for

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.310 
rock and some of these rocks you use for
the<00:00:29.730> prop<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> project<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.900> I'm<00:00:30.990> about<00:00:31.199> to

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the prop for a project that I'm about to

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.630 
the prop for a project that I'm about to
talk<00:00:31.500> about<00:00:31.820> a<00:00:32.820> dollar<00:00:33.480> for<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.130> bag<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.370> rocks

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
talk about a dollar for a bag of rocks

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
talk about a dollar for a bag of rocks
so<00:00:36.149> about<00:00:36.329> two<00:00:36.570> dollars<00:00:36.750> from<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> dollar

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
so about two dollars from the dollar

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.080 
so about two dollars from the dollar
store<00:00:37.829> then<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.399> want<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> scratch<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
store then you want to scratch the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.450 
store then you want to scratch the
surface<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.570> make<00:00:39.750> sure<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.920> there<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.280> no

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
surface and make sure that there is no

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.029 
surface and make sure that there is no
wax<00:00:41.820> coating<00:00:45.079> the<00:00:46.079> pot<00:00:46.320> itself<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.860> from<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
wax coating the pot itself is from a

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.920 
wax coating the pot itself is from a
hardware<00:00:47.340> store<00:00:47.670> for<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.940> dollar<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.600> think

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
hardware store for a dollar and I think

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.250 
hardware store for a dollar and I think
I<00:00:49.170> got<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> thermometer<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.760> about<00:00:51.260> dollar

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
I got the thermometer for about dollar

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.930 
I got the thermometer for about dollar
50<00:00:52.860> or<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.480> so<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.890> gravel<00:00:56.309> was<00:00:56.489> probably<00:00:56.850> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
50 or so so the gravel was probably a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.970 
50 or so so the gravel was probably a
little<00:00:57.030> more<00:00:57.270> expensive<00:00:57.629> about<00:00:58.050> three<00:00:58.469> three

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
little more expensive about three three

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.650 
little more expensive about three three
dollar<00:00:59.219> something<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.960> then<00:01:01.940> if<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.149> total<00:01:03.539> up

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
dollar something and then if we total up

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.130 
dollar something and then if we total up
all<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.470> decorations<00:01:05.299> at<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> PVC<00:01:06.900> pipe

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
all the decorations at the PVC pipe

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.070 
all the decorations at the PVC pipe
already<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.460> use<00:01:08.610> some<00:01:08.790> g<00:01:09.000> silicon<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
already and I use some g silicon one to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.969 
already and I use some g silicon one to
do<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.130> project<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.030> see<00:01:12.330> here<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.979> a

weight with these rocks these larger

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.030 
weight with these rocks these larger
rocks<00:01:40.590> again<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.280> dollar<00:01:41.490> store<00:01:42.079> I<00:01:43.079> did

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
rocks again for the dollar store I did

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.550 
rocks again for the dollar store I did
the<00:01:44.130> same<00:01:44.310> thing<00:01:44.369> with<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.880> baby<00:01:45.240> bottle<00:01:45.560> cut

the same thing with this baby bottle cut

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.249 
the same thing with this baby bottle cut
the<00:01:46.680> top<00:01:46.860> off<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.430> had<00:01:48.390> an<00:01:48.509> instant<00:01:48.869> cape<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
the top off I had an instant cape I

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.069 
the top off I had an instant cape I
wanted<00:01:49.590> something<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.920> could<00:01:50.310> be<00:01:52.729> could<00:01:53.729> be

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
wanted something that could be could be

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.209 
wanted something that could be could be
covered<00:01:55.079> up<00:01:55.229> but<00:01:55.439> at<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> same<00:01:55.860> time<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
covered up but at the same time the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.410 
covered up but at the same time the
bottom<00:01:56.579> bottom<00:01:57.090> would<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.270> transparent<00:01:58.340> and

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
bottom bottom would be transparent and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.749 
bottom bottom would be transparent and
so<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.869> covered<00:02:01.380> up<00:02:01.469> most<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.189> surface<00:02:02.430> area

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
so I covered up most of the surface area

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.899 
so I covered up most of the surface area
with<00:02:03.600> these<00:02:03.960> rocks<00:02:04.290> again<00:02:04.829> with<00:02:05.189> G<00:02:05.399> silicone

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
with these rocks again with G silicone

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.930 
with these rocks again with G silicone
one<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.590> created<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.890> pillar<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.429> have<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.819> make

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
one I created that pillar I have to make

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.160 
one I created that pillar I have to make
sure<00:02:08.970> rocks<00:02:09.300> laying<00:02:09.479> around<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.989> thought

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
sure rocks laying around and I thought

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.199 
sure rocks laying around and I thought
hey<00:02:10.349> why<00:02:10.500> not<00:02:10.530> create<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.920> structure<00:02:11.340> creates<00:02:12.120> a

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
hey why not create a structure creates a

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.670 
hey why not create a structure creates a
pillar<00:02:12.450> as<00:02:12.690> well<00:02:12.900> destruct

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
pillar as well destruct

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.539 
pillar as well destruct
part<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.069> structure<00:02:14.280> was<00:02:14.430> created

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
part of the structure was created

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.220 
part of the structure was created
separately<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.420> then<00:02:16.230> attached<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.219> the<00:02:17.340> cave

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
separately and then attached to the cave

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.410 
separately and then attached to the cave
once<00:02:19.230> they<00:02:19.469> both<00:02:19.680> cured<00:02:20.159> separately<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:20.939> even

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
once they both cured separately and even

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.940 
once they both cured separately and even
though<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.659> curing<00:02:21.930> time<00:02:22.079> is<00:02:22.200> set<00:02:22.349> for<00:02:22.530> 24

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
though the curing time is set for 24

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.830 
though the curing time is set for 24
hours<00:02:23.250> by<00:02:23.519> that's<00:02:23.969> a<00:02:24.090> recommended<00:02:24.540> curing

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
hours by that's a recommended curing

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.319 
hours by that's a recommended curing
time<00:02:25.079> I<00:02:25.319> decided<00:02:26.159> wait<00:02:26.459> almost<00:02:26.670> three<00:02:27.060> times

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
time I decided wait almost three times

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.220 
time I decided wait almost three times
or<00:02:27.659> more<00:02:28.459> especially<00:02:29.459> since<00:02:29.939> this<00:02:30.629> guy<00:02:30.930> might

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
or more especially since this guy might

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.770 
or more especially since this guy might
be<00:02:31.849> sucking<00:02:32.849> on<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.150> surface<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.659> these

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
be sucking on the surface of these

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.119 
be sucking on the surface of these
things<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.260> don't<00:02:34.469> want<00:02:34.650> any<00:02:34.859> of<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
things and I don't want any of the

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.550 
things and I don't want any of the
chemicals<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:36.269> ingested<00:02:37.079> especially

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
chemicals to be ingested especially

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.890 
chemicals to be ingested especially
since<00:02:37.769> he's<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.099> most<00:02:38.280> expensive<00:02:38.670> fish<00:02:39.629> in

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
since he's the most expensive fish in

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.640 
since he's the most expensive fish in
this<00:02:40.079> tank<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:44.659> this<00:02:45.659> this<00:02:46.049> works<00:02:46.349> great

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
this tank and this this works great

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.229 
this tank and this this works great
because<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.220> increase<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:48.000> amount<00:02:48.180> of

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
because you increase the amount of

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.080 
because you increase the amount of
surface<00:02:48.480> area<00:02:48.989> in<00:02:49.109> your<00:02:49.230> tank<00:02:49.790> plenty<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.879> room

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
surface area in your tank plenty of room

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.780 
surface area in your tank plenty of room
for<00:02:51.120> algae<00:02:51.689> to<00:02:51.840> grow<00:02:52.310> plenty<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.400> hiding

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
for algae to grow plenty of hiding

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.399 
for algae to grow plenty of hiding
spaces<00:02:54.269> incredible<00:02:54.989> hiding<00:02:55.200> spaces

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.839 
spaces incredible hiding spaces
sometimes<00:02:55.859> I<00:02:55.980> have<00:02:56.069> a<00:02:56.129> hard<00:02:56.400> time<00:02:56.579> finding

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
sometimes I have a hard time finding

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.459 
sometimes I have a hard time finding
these<00:02:57.150> guys<00:02:57.209> there's<00:02:57.659> some<00:02:57.840> ghost<00:02:58.049> shrimp<00:02:58.319> in

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.469 
these guys there's some ghost shrimp in

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.209 
these guys there's some ghost shrimp in
here<00:02:58.650> as<00:02:58.799> well<00:02:59.540> so<00:03:00.540> again<00:03:00.840> it's<00:03:01.560> centrally

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:02.219 
here as well so again it's centrally

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.170 
here as well so again it's centrally
