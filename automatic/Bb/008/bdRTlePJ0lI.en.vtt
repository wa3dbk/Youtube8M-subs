cover<00:00:48.489> of<00:00:48.639> the<00:00:48.729> song<00:00:48.909> in<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.929> mix<00:00:50.139> jazz<00:00:50.710> vocal

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
cover of the song in the mix jazz vocal

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.119 
cover of the song in the mix jazz vocal
is<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.850> mixed<00:00:52.539> a<00:00:52.749> bit<00:00:53.109> higher<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.679> bit<00:00:53.709> louder

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
is the mixed a bit higher a bit louder

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.139 
is the mixed a bit higher a bit louder
than<00:00:54.429> the<00:00:54.670> other

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
than the other

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.539 
than the other
vocals<00:00:55.539> so<00:00:55.870> this<00:00:56.559> suggests<00:00:56.799> that<00:00:57.249> they

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:57.549 
vocals so this suggests that they

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:00.180 
vocals so this suggests that they
probably<00:00:57.879> recorded<00:00:58.629> this<00:00:58.839> one<00:00:59.079> if<00:00:59.739> they<00:01:00.039> use

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
probably recorded this one if they use

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.579 
probably recorded this one if they use
the<00:01:00.369> microphone<00:01:00.999> single<00:01:01.420> microphone<00:01:01.839> George

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
the microphone single microphone George

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.250 
the microphone single microphone George
was<00:01:02.769> in<00:01:02.799> the<00:01:03.039> middle<00:01:03.639> and<00:01:03.940> John<00:01:04.720> and<00:01:04.870> Paul<00:01:05.050> was

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
was in the middle and John and Paul was

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.310 
was in the middle and John and Paul was
a<00:01:05.290> side<00:01:05.620> or<00:01:06.340> maybe<00:01:06.760> John<00:01:07.060> was<00:01:07.720> on<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:07.960> single

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
a side or maybe John was on a single

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.680 
a side or maybe John was on a single
microphone<00:01:08.950> and<00:01:09.220> John<00:01:09.970> in<00:01:10.090> Poland<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.540> our

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
microphone and John in Poland and our

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.020 
microphone and John in Poland and our
single<00:01:11.080> microphone<00:01:11.560> so<00:01:12.100> we<00:01:12.220> literally<00:01:12.670> mixed

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
single microphone so we literally mixed

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.090 
single microphone so we literally mixed
them<00:01:13.360> differently<00:01:13.900> what<00:01:14.200> else<00:01:14.410> the<00:01:14.650> parts<00:01:14.980> are

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
them differently what else the parts are

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.190 
them differently what else the parts are
pretty<00:01:15.340> easy<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:16.120> learn<00:01:16.270> if<00:01:16.600> you<00:01:16.720> take<00:01:17.020> them

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
pretty easy to learn if you take them

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.710 
pretty easy to learn if you take them
one<00:01:17.530> at<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:17.740> time<00:01:17.770> you<00:01:18.190> know<00:01:18.340> singularly<00:01:19.300> even

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
one at a time you know singularly even

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.200 
one at a time you know singularly even
if<00:01:19.810> they<00:01:20.110> create<00:01:20.620> some<00:01:20.920> very<00:01:21.190> strange<00:01:21.580> chords

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210
