00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
saying that there are HD alternatives to

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.810 
saying that there are HD alternatives to
like<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.170> Nintendo<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.369> thing<00:00:32.790> about

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
like the Nintendo but the thing about

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.610 
like the Nintendo but the thing about
getting<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.300> retron<00:00:33.600> 5<00:00:33.660> isn't<00:00:34.140> about<00:00:34.380> just

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
getting a retron 5 isn't about just

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.470

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
plot 5 to play multiple systems it's a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.319

want to preserve the original source of
one<00:03:37.550> plane<00:03:37.910> it<00:03:38.090> was<00:03:38.239> like<00:03:38.420> so<00:03:38.660> I<00:03:38.690> record<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.380> in

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
one plane it was like so I record it in

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.140 
one plane it was like so I record it in
the<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.550> way<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.880> was<00:03:41.380> but<00:03:42.380> retron<00:03:43.370> 5<00:03:43.400> i<00:03:43.880> think

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
the the way it was but retron 5 i think

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.990 
the the way it was but retron 5 i think
is<00:03:44.330> great<00:03:44.600> for<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:44.959> reasons<00:03:45.320> you<00:03:45.470> said

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
is great for the reasons you said

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.590 
is great for the reasons you said
accessibility<00:03:47.000> all<00:03:47.450> those<00:03:47.989> systems<00:03:48.380> in<00:03:48.590> one

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
accessibility all those systems in one

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.510 
accessibility all those systems in one
for<00:03:50.600> some<00:03:50.810> people<00:03:51.140> it's<00:03:51.350> hard<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.890> get<00:03:52.160> all<00:03:52.370> the

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
for some people it's hard to get all the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.850 
for some people it's hard to get all the
original<00:03:52.640> systems<00:03:53.390> yeah<00:03:54.020> so<00:03:54.440> getting<00:03:54.770> that

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
original systems yeah so getting that

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.340 
original systems yeah so getting that
all<00:03:55.040> in<00:03:55.190> one<00:03:55.220> system<00:03:55.640> is<00:03:56.000> great<00:03:56.270> and<00:03:56.810> it's<00:03:57.140> also

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
all in one system is great and it's also

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.940 
all in one system is great and it's also
