00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:14.697
 Welcome to the League of Legends champion Singed, the Mad Chemist 

00:00:15.564 --> 00:00:17.651
 Singed is a well moving tank fighter, ... 

00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:21.621
 ... which stands out for the constant "harassment" of enemies and the award of permanent damage during combat. 

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:28.933
 One of Singed's qualities is his ability to kite enemy champions, so he actually wins fights just by running around. 

00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:31.794
 Singed's passive skill is 'Empowered Bulwark'. 

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:35.810
 A certain percentage of Singed's maximum mana is added to his maximum health. 

00:00:35.947 --> 00:00:39.669
 So when you buy items that add mana, you become more resistant. 

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:44.604
 'Poison Trail' is a power-on skill. When switched on, you leave poisonous vapors behind you. 

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:49.754
 Enemies who go through poisonous vapors are poisoned and injured for a short time. 

00:00:50.013 --> 00:00:55.423
 'Mega Adhesive' creates an area on the ground that reduces the speed of movement of all enemies inside. 

00:00:55.702 --> 00:01:00.467
 'Fling' hurts an opponent and throws him away for you. 

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:06.348
 'Insanity Potion' strengthens Singed for a few seconds, giving him more health, mana regeneration ... 

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:12.391
 ... speed of movement, armor, magic resist and also reduce the duration of all crowd control effects used on Singed. 

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:19.299
 From level 6, Singed is extremely strong in rope. I play aggressively against Riven and try to push her towards the tower. 

00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:25.329
 Master Yi is trying to run over me. I'll stay in the bushes for a while, which will give me time to attack me. 

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:28.194
 I turn on the Poison Trail and try to reach our tower. 

00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:33.192
 When they attack, I use Mega Adhesive right in front of me, which will stop most champions. 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.249
 I have one more ace up my sleeve after Alpha Strike. As he approaches, I flip him directly to our tower. 

00:01:39.407 --> 00:01:42.722
 When I know he'll run, I'll hit him with one or two attacks and get him. 

00:01:42.897 --> 00:01:46.485
 Then I run, because Riven is chasing me, but I have created enough distance between us ... 

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:51.579
 ... that he succumbs to the tower and the Poison Trail, which just gives me a double kill just by running. 

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:56.265
 Once you have the advantage, you should keep it and control the lane. 

00:01:56.374 --> 00:02:03.226
 Note that I play in such a way that I get the most time for the Poison Trail. I turn on the Poison Trail and then Insanity Potion. 

00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:06.953
 I place the Mega Adhesive in a single possible Rivenin escape point. 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.211
 When Flashne is gone, I use Fling to get her back to Mega Adhesive. 

00:02:11.394 --> 00:02:14.769
 In the end, the Poison Trail gradually turns her to health enough to kill her. 

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:18.611
 While I run away from Swain and Riven, Master Yi jumps on me. 

00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:21.675
 I turn on the Poison Trail and try to use Fling to run away. 

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:24.987
 I lured him into the bushes, then I turned and enjoyed Fling and threw him behind the wall. 

00:02:25.114 --> 00:02:28.820
 Xin Zhao is on my way and Swain has little health from the Poison Trail. 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.333
 After his first kilometer, I will help him a bit with Mega Adhesiv, bringing Master Yi as he tries to pull out to the tower. 

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:42.382
 In the middle of the game, everything is a matter of accumulating large amounts of gold and getting a higher level while distracting the enemy team. 

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:47.960
 Once you get the Rod of Ages, constantly reflect the minion waves using the poison Trail, then look for a fight. 

00:02:48.112 --> 00:02:50.550
 Finally, the hostile champions will try to gank you, ... 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.383
 ... but with Insanity Potion, Ghost and Mega Adhesive, the smaller fights can be escaped. 

00:02:55.706 --> 00:03:01.176
 One small comment on Singed - you should map '/ laugh' to a slightly accessible key. 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.694
 Whenever you get bored in a rope, you should laugh at your opponent. Prevents them from doing a lot of damage :-) 

00:03:07.883 --> 00:03:10.333
 Now let's look at a game that hasn't started too well. 

00:03:10.503 --> 00:03:15.665
 At low levels, basic attacks and other skills may have more damage than the Poison Trail, so play defensively. 

00:03:15.798 --> 00:03:20.726
 Jarvan plays aggressively here, threw me out in a wave of minions and picked up more than half my health. 

00:03:20.863 --> 00:03:25.177
 Fortunately, I hardly survived, but of course it's not a good start. 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:33.462
 This is how it continues for some time and I start playing with 1/5/2. But after getting Rod of Ages, I have more confidence and lots of mana. 

00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:39.274
 I will fly through Jarvan's wave of minions with the Poison Trail and use Fling to hurt him. I'm still fighting until Riven shows up. 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.520
 I'm going to run and try to shake them off with Mega Adhesive. 

00:03:42.676 --> 00:03:46.988
 Poison Trail hurts them all the time, so I come back and hurt Riven even more with Fling. 

00:03:47.175 --> 00:03:50.678
 As long as I have Insanity Potion, the fight is going well. 

00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:54.769
 However, I cannot approach the enemy tower, so I hang around the center of the rope. 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.787
 Eventually, they decided to go after me, Riven throwing away Fling from Jarvan and splitting them with Mega Adhesiv. 

00:03:59.927 --> 00:04:03.785
 As you can see, Riven soon dies and Jarvan can do nothing to help her. 

00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:07.660
 The Mega Adhesive and Poison Trail will take care of Riven, and I'll focus on Jarvan. 

00:04:07.772 --> 00:04:11.447
 I'll let my minions refuel the tower and run towards it in the hope of killing him. 

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:17.366
 But the tower will cause me a little more damage and reduce my health to 50, but at that moment Jarvan succumbs to the Poison Trail. 

00:04:19.074 --> 00:04:23.287
 When you get into the game, use your tanking skills and support to win your team. 

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:29.911
 I have a total score of 22 to 19 and here we are trying a big deal. Mega Adhesive separates Annie from the rest of her team. 

00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:35.020
 When Xin Zhao is chasing me, I throw him between allies and kill him before he even touches us. 

00:04:35.113 --> 00:04:41.993
 We meet adversaries, go to Annie and Caitlyn. Even though I have Exhaust, I try to hold on to Caitlyn and eventually kill her with Fling. 

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:45.903
 Now, with just 500 health, I'm trying to escape with Insanity Potion and Ghost. 

00:04:46.024 --> 00:04:49.363
 I got enough time for Annie to succumb to Poison Trail with a little help from Talon, ... 

00:04:49.524 --> 00:04:52.305
 ... which eventually caused the last two surviving enemies to escape. 

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:56.536
 The basic rule when fighting Singed: Don't follow Singed. 

00:04:56.901 --> 00:05:01.527
 Also, note that Fling can help or hurt a team if they use surface skills. 

00:05:01.652 --> 00:05:05.569
 Here we went after Jarvan and Fling caused Brand's Pillar of Flame to miss. 

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:11.477
 But in another duel Fling managed to throw Caitlyn into Nunu's Absolute Zero, which guaranteed an easy kill. 

00:05:11.664 --> 00:05:15.120
 Always keep in mind that Fling can have a completely different effect. 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.899
 Runes I chose magic penetration mark, dodge sealy, flat magic resist glyph, and movement speed quintessences. 

00:05:22.046 --> 00:05:30.212
 This lineup gives me a little more resilience at the beginning of the game and focuses on effective kiting towards the end of the game with dodge sealy strengthening Nimbleness. 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:37.666
 My masteries are 0/14/16 with a clear choice - Nimbleness and three points in Strength of Spirit in Defense. 

00:05:37.803 --> 00:05:42.663
 In Utility, definitely choose to increase your experience gain, maximum mana and speed. 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.054
 I also chose Teleport and Ghost to make the most of it. 

00:05:46.305 --> 00:05:48.930
 At level 1, put a point in Fling and leave it that way. 

00:05:49.116 --> 00:05:53.234
 Then get your Poison Trail and then Mega Adhesive as soon as possible. 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.850
 This skill set is aimed at awarding the most damage to the Poison Trail ... 

00:05:57.007 --> 00:06:00.616
 ... and increase your benefit for the team with a slowdown from Mega Adhesive. 

00:06:00.763 --> 00:06:06.154
 You can max out Fling instead of Mega Adhesive if you want even more damage, but I prefer a slowdown. 

00:06:06.295 --> 00:06:12.838
 I'm starting with Sapphire Crystal and two Health Potions. Then I choose two extremely important: ... 

00:06:12.961 --> 00:06:18.107
 ... as soon as possible Catalyst and upgraded shoes, either Mercury Treads or Ninja Tabi depending on the enemy team's line-up. 

00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:22.591
 When I get a lot of gold, my first big buy is Rod of Ages and Rylai's Crystal Scepter. 

00:06:22.744 --> 00:06:29.241
 If I often have to deal with a lot of physical damage, I'll add a Sunfire Cape, Randuin's Omen, Guardian Angel, Thornmail, or Frozen Heart. 

00:06:29.401 --> 00:06:36.681
 If, on the other hand, I am afraid of magic damage, I will convert my Catalyst to Banshee's Veil and add Force of Nature, Spirit Visage or Abyssal Scepter. 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.557
 Thanks for seeing Singed.
