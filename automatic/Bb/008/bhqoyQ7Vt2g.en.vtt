hello<00:00:01.589> and<00:00:01.800> welcome<00:00:02.129> this<00:00:03.060> video<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:03.899> show<00:00:04.259> you

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
hello and welcome this video I show you

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.299 
hello and welcome this video I show you
a<00:00:04.770> new<00:00:05.759> script<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.270> wrote<00:00:06.480> for<00:00:07.440> quickly

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
a new script I wrote for quickly

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.310 
a new script I wrote for quickly
creating<00:00:08.340> chains<00:00:11.389> so<00:00:12.389> let's<00:00:12.570> get<00:00:12.750> right

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
creating chains so let's get right

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.840 
creating chains so let's get right
started<00:00:13.549> in<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.849> button<00:00:15.150> over<00:00:15.240> here<00:00:15.540> and

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
started in this button over here and

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.490 
started in this button over here and
well<00:00:17.850> if<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.090> want<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.330> create<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.170> dynamic

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
well if I want to create like a dynamic

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.370 
well if I want to create like a dynamic
chain<00:00:20.390> workflow<00:00:21.390> would<00:00:21.570> be<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.080> first

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
chain workflow would be like this first

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.400 
chain workflow would be like this first
I<00:00:22.590> would<00:00:22.710> create<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.689> dynamic<00:00:24.689> curve<00:00:25.170> so

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
I would create the dynamic curve so

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.430 
I would create the dynamic curve so
let's<00:00:25.619> quickly<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.519> one<00:00:28.519> run<00:00:29.519> any<00:00:29.699> rebuilds

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.700 

okay<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.710> looks<00:00:34.829> good<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.360> I<00:00:36.559> make<00:00:37.559> this

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
okay that looks good now I make this

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.040 
okay that looks good now I make this
dynamic<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:42.739> apply<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.800> script<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.640> this

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
dynamic and apply this script to this

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.410 
dynamic and apply this script to this
dynamic<00:00:46.050> output<00:00:46.559> curve<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.850> let's<00:00:48.149> set<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
dynamic output curve so let's set the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.299 
dynamic output curve so let's set the
button<00:00:48.719> lets<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.440> see<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:49.739> very<00:00:49.920> simple

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
button lets you can see it's very simple

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.970 
button lets you can see it's very simple
builds<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:51.180> gets<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> choose<00:00:52.440> menu<00:00:52.770> for

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
selected load it up down here now you

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.370 
selected load it up down here now you
can<00:01:06.950> with<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.420> simple<00:01:09.420> rake<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.140> do

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
can with this simple rake you can now do

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.820 
can with this simple rake you can now do
some<00:01:11.119> shape<00:01:12.119> adjustments<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.200> chain<00:01:13.530> link

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
some shape adjustments to the chain link

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.880 
some shape adjustments to the chain link
and<00:01:17.509> you<00:01:18.509> know<00:01:18.600> once<00:01:18.780> you're<00:01:20.540> satisfactory

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
and you know once you're satisfactory

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.840 
and you know once you're satisfactory
let<00:01:22.890> me<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.479> put<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.570> some<00:01:24.600> values<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:27.350> this

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
let me just put in some values like this

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.999 
let me just put in some values like this
you<00:01:29.850> select<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> kerf<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.659> click<00:01:31.009> create

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
you select the kerf and click create

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.289 
you select the kerf and click create
from<00:01:32.220> selected<00:01:32.729> curve<00:01:34.909> information<00:01:35.909> window

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
from selected curve information window

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.210 
from selected curve information window
pops<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:36.960> well<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.500> tells<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
pops up here well it tells you the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.920 
pops up here well it tells you the
length<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.119> probe<00:01:39.329> that's<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.810> be

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
length of the probe that's going to be

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.130 
length of the probe that's going to be
used<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.590> length<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.700> each<00:01:41.790> linked<00:01:42.210> by<00:01:42.930> so

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
used the length of each linked by so

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.929 
used the length of each linked by so
that<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.439> calculates<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> number<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.460> links

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
that it calculates the number of links

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.389 
that it calculates the number of links
and<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.049> calculates<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.860> estimated

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
and on that it calculates the estimated

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.460 
and on that it calculates the estimated
time<00:01:48.170> this<00:01:49.280> will<00:01:50.280> rise<00:01:50.610> exponentially<00:01:51.470> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
time this will rise exponentially the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.300 
time this will rise exponentially the
more<00:01:52.500> links<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:55.159> do<00:01:56.159> not

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
more links you have so I do not

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.520 
more links you have so I do not
recommend<00:01:56.840> creating<00:01:57.840> change<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.409> are

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
recommend creating change that are

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.770 
recommend creating change that are
larger<00:01:58.950> than<00:01:58.979> 300<00:01:59.939> links<00:02:00.180> or<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.479> because

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
larger than 300 links or so because

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.499 
larger than 300 links or so because
after<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.250> your<00:02:02.250> calculation<00:02:02.850> terms<00:02:03.060> really

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
after that your calculation terms really

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.859 
after that your calculation terms really
aren't<00:02:03.719> going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.079> bump<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:04.969> but<00:02:05.969> however<00:02:06.149> 40

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
aren't going to bump up but however 40

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.580 
aren't going to bump up but however 40
links<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.459> very<00:02:08.459> good<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:08.970> mean<00:02:09.270> this

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
links is very good so that mean this

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.589 
links is very good so that mean this
click<00:02:10.590> proceed<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.280> here's<00:02:11.550> our<00:02:11.760> 40<00:02:12.300> links

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
click proceed and here's our 40 links

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.559 
click proceed and here's our 40 links
chain

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
chain

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.839 
chain
fine<00:02:13.750> let<00:02:14.409> me<00:02:14.500> undo<00:02:14.709> this<00:02:14.739> I'm<00:02:15.579> going<00:02:15.760> to

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
fine let me undo this I'm going to

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:28.170 
fine let me undo this I'm going to
create<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.329> one<00:02:16.719> finer<00:02:17.939> smaller<00:02:18.939> links<00:02:20.069> so<00:02:27.180> like

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
create a one finer smaller links so like

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.789 
create a one finer smaller links so like
this<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:29.079> may<00:02:29.319> better

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
this on this may better

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.599 
this on this may better
so<00:02:30.040> laws<00:02:30.250> thirty<00:02:31.150> two<00:02:31.390> links<00:02:32.099> create<00:02:33.099> that

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.280 

plus<00:02:36.609> chain<00:02:37.030> looks<00:02:37.269> a<00:02:37.359> little<00:02:37.450> bit<00:02:37.659> larger<00:02:38.079> so

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
plus chain looks a little bit larger so

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.770 
plus chain looks a little bit larger so
the<00:02:39.040> way<00:02:39.159> this<00:02:39.280> effect<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.939> it<00:02:40.329> creates<00:02:40.629> a

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
the way this effect is it creates a

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.929 
the way this effect is it creates a
locator<00:02:42.389> connects<00:02:43.389> them<00:02:43.569> to<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.870> curve<00:02:44.139> and

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
locator connects them to the curve and

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.960 
locator connects them to the curve and
creates<00:02:45.939> an<00:02:46.060> upload<00:02:46.420> an<00:02:46.810> up<00:02:46.989> Vector<00:02:47.019> locator

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
creates an upload an up Vector locator

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.649 
creates an upload an up Vector locator
that<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.930> link<00:02:50.109> will<00:02:50.379> follow<00:02:50.970> as<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.540> up

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
that the link will follow as the up

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.800 
that the link will follow as the up
Vector<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.859> for<00:02:54.549> chain<00:02:54.819> like<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.629> the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
Vector so for chain like this and the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.119 
Vector so for chain like this and the
way<00:02:55.959> they<00:02:56.139> up<00:02:56.409> and<00:02:56.620> two<00:02:56.739> locators<00:02:57.189> are<00:02:57.459> placed

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
way they up and two locators are placed

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.610 
way they up and two locators are placed
it<00:03:00.129> will<00:03:00.340> very<00:03:00.760> quickly<00:03:00.970> get<00:03:01.359> into<00:03:03.299> flipping

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
it will very quickly get into flipping

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.909 
it will very quickly get into flipping
so<00:03:05.620> what<00:03:05.799> we<00:03:05.950> would<00:03:06.159> do<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:07.500> select<00:03:08.500> all<00:03:08.709> of<00:03:08.799> the

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:08.919 
so what we would do is select all of the

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:14.490 
so what we would do is select all of the
up<00:03:09.040> Vector<00:03:09.189> locators<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:12.959> just<00:03:13.959> move<00:03:14.139> them<00:03:14.349> to

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
up Vector locators and just move them to

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.289 
up Vector locators and just move them to
the<00:03:14.620> side<00:03:14.889> and<00:03:15.159> we're<00:03:15.549> like<00:03:16.120> this<00:03:17.940> now<00:03:18.940> we<00:03:19.000> can

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
the side and we're like this now we can

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.250 
the side and we're like this now we can
create<00:03:19.569> we<00:03:20.139> can<00:03:20.319> play<00:03:21.129> a<00:03:21.159> ram<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.639> chain<00:03:22.260> let

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
create we can play a ram of a chain let

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.349 
create we can play a ram of a chain let
me<00:03:23.379> introduce<00:03:24.010> myself<00:03:24.489> so<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:24.970> little<00:03:25.180> bit<00:03:25.299> more

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
me introduce myself so a little bit more

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:32.009 
me introduce myself so a little bit more
time<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:28.120> see<00:03:28.329> now<00:03:29.489> chain<00:03:30.489> creates<00:03:31.019> you

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
time and you see now chain creates you

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.280 
time and you see now chain creates you
need<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.530> do<00:03:33.459> some<00:03:33.699> tweaks<00:03:34.030> near<00:03:34.299> on<00:03:34.629> the<00:03:34.930> hair

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
need to do some tweaks near on the hair

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.740 
need to do some tweaks near on the hair
system<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:35.859> nucleus<00:03:36.280> because<00:03:36.699> this<00:03:37.030> obviously

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
system a nucleus because this obviously

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.710 
system a nucleus because this obviously
doesn't<00:03:38.109> look<00:03:38.379> like<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:38.620> chain<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:40.299> let's<00:03:40.629> do

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
doesn't look like a chain so let's do

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.099 
doesn't look like a chain so let's do
this<00:03:40.840> non<00:03:41.370> first<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.579> nucleus<00:03:42.970> i'm<00:03:43.750> increase

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
this non first the nucleus i'm increase

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.129 
this non first the nucleus i'm increase
the<00:03:44.260> substeps<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.919> eight<00:03:45.659> reduce<00:03:46.659> the<00:03:46.840> scale

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
the substeps to eight reduce the scale

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.159 
the substeps to eight reduce the scale
to<00:03:47.349> 0.01<00:03:48.310> this<00:03:48.519> is<00:03:48.699> because<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.449> maya<00:03:49.810> unit

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
system is based on centimeters and the

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.729 
system is based on centimeters and the
nucleus<00:03:53.319> system<00:03:53.949> here<00:03:54.190> is<00:03:55.139> based<00:03:56.139> on<00:03:56.379> meters

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
nucleus system here is based on meters

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.979 
nucleus system here is based on meters
that<00:03:57.669> means<00:03:57.909> that's<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:58.449> order<00:03:58.659> to<00:03:58.780> match

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
that means that's in order to match

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.949 
that means that's in order to match
those<00:03:59.290> two<00:03:59.799> unit<00:04:00.159> systems<00:04:00.549> we<00:04:00.729> need<00:04:00.879> to<00:04:01.030> divide

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
those two unit systems we need to divide

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.319 
those two unit systems we need to divide
the<00:04:02.199> nucleus<00:04:02.680> square<00:04:03.519> space<00:04:03.909> scale<00:04:04.209> by<00:04:04.479> 100<00:04:05.109> to

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
the nucleus square space scale by 100 to

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.539 
the nucleus square space scale by 100 to
calculate<00:04:07.329> from<00:04:07.510> meters<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:08.079> centimeters

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
calculate from meters to centimeters

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.159 
calculate from meters to centimeters
that's<00:04:09.549> because<00:04:09.970> that's<00:04:10.329> why<00:04:10.599> this<00:04:10.659> value<00:04:11.079> is

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
that's because that's why this value is

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.529 
that's because that's why this value is
in<00:04:11.319> here<00:04:11.530> let's<00:04:12.250> scatter<00:04:12.609> on<00:04:12.759> some<00:04:13.030> grow<00:04:13.389> plane

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:15.539 
in here let's scatter on some grow plane

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:21.629 
in here let's scatter on some grow plane
bomb<00:04:16.539> of<00:04:16.659> this<00:04:16.810> friction<00:04:17.729> let's<00:04:18.729> say<00:04:18.959> 2.7<00:04:20.639> now

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
bomb of this friction let's say 2.7 now

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.140 
bomb of this friction let's say 2.7 now
in<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.849> hair<00:04:22.000> system<00:04:23.279> we<00:04:24.279> introduce<00:04:24.940> some

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
in the hair system we introduce some

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.260 
in the hair system we introduce some
self<00:04:25.450> collation

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.100 

make<00:04:29.770> introduce<00:04:30.770> some<00:04:31.010> collision<00:04:31.460> with<00:04:31.610> upset

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
make introduce some collision with upset

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.440 
make introduce some collision with upset
now<00:04:33.110> change<00:04:33.740> obviously<00:04:34.160> don't<00:04:34.580> stretch<00:04:35.090> at

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
now change obviously don't stretch at

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.320 
now change obviously don't stretch at
least<00:04:35.690> not<00:04:36.290> further<00:04:36.560> than<00:04:36.830> this<00:04:36.980> so<00:04:37.970> we<00:04:38.000> can

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
least not further than this so we can

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.460 
least not further than this so we can
bug<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.780> stretch<00:04:39.050> resistance<00:04:39.590> up<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.340> 200

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
bug the stretch resistance up to 200

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.920 
bug the stretch resistance up to 200
where<00:04:42.470> change<00:04:42.740> can<00:04:42.980> compress<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:44.060> let's<00:04:44.510> leave

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
where change can compress so let's leave

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.340 
where change can compress so let's leave
this<00:04:45.220> compression<00:04:46.220> resistance<00:04:46.340> fairly<00:04:47.030> low

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
this compression resistance fairly low

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.320 
this compression resistance fairly low
band<00:04:48.350> resistance<00:04:48.620> they<00:04:49.220> can<00:04:49.460> bend<00:04:49.700> in<00:04:50.030> a<00:04:50.120> very

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
band resistance they can bend in a very

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.260 
band resistance they can bend in a very
close<00:04:51.170> angle<00:04:52.040> because<00:04:52.400> of<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.610> way<00:04:53.090> they're

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
close angle because of the way they're

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.470 
close angle because of the way they're
built<00:04:53.480> so<00:04:53.810> let's<00:04:54.160> reduce<00:04:55.160> this<00:04:55.610> to<00:04:55.880> a<00:04:55.910> very<00:04:56.300> low

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
built so let's reduce this to a very low

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.170 
built so let's reduce this to a very low
value<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:59.440> yeah<00:05:00.440> that's<00:05:00.680> it<00:05:00.830> let's<00:05:01.040> see<00:05:02.000> how

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
value and yeah that's it let's see how

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.720 
value and yeah that's it let's see how
this<00:05:02.630> looks<00:05:02.840> from<00:05:02.930> now<00:05:03.290> I<00:05:03.530> want<00:05:04.160> one<00:05:04.520> last

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
this looks from now I want one last

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.690 
this looks from now I want one last
thing<00:05:05.030> let<00:05:05.570> me<00:05:05.600> just<00:05:05.830> remove<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:07.100> point<00:05:07.460> lock

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
thing let me just remove the point lock

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.600 
thing let me just remove the point lock
from<00:05:08.240> both<00:05:08.450> ends<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:08.930> base<00:05:09.170> in<00:05:10.130> order<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.460> have

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
from both ends to base in order to have

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.710 
from both ends to base in order to have
a<00:05:10.640> loose<00:05:10.880> chain<00:05:11.240> up<00:05:12.910> run<00:05:13.910> one<00:05:14.120> in<00:05:15.910> this<00:05:16.910> case<00:05:17.450> I

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
a loose chain up run one in this case I

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.130 
a loose chain up run one in this case I
would<00:05:17.780> need<00:05:18.050> to<00:05:18.200> do<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.470> tip<00:05:18.710> oh<00:05:21.340> now<00:05:22.340> I<00:05:23.140> can

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
would need to do the tip oh now I can

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.250 
would need to do the tip oh now I can
play<00:05:24.320> a<00:05:24.350> little<00:05:24.650> bit<00:05:24.830> around<00:05:25.040> for<00:05:25.370> chain<00:05:25.670> and

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
play a little bit around for chain and

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:33.070 
play a little bit around for chain and
see<00:05:27.260> how<00:05:27.440> this<00:05:27.650> behaves<00:05:31.570> and<00:05:32.570> as<00:05:32.750> you<00:05:32.870> can<00:05:33.020> see

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
see how this behaves and as you can see

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.990 
see how this behaves and as you can see
from<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:33.710> simulation<00:05:34.220> it<00:05:34.520> already<00:05:34.790> looks

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
from the simulation it already looks

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.660 
from the simulation it already looks
pretty<00:05:35.630> good<00:05:36.010> we<00:05:37.010> get<00:05:37.220> some<00:05:37.490> nice<00:05:37.640> collisions

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
pretty good we get some nice collisions

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:49.210 
pretty good we get some nice collisions

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:29.480 
link and the chain link so now the chain

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.840 
link and the chain link so now the chain
is<00:06:29.690> a<00:06:31.180> closed<00:06:32.180> system<00:06:32.450> with<00:06:33.440> no<00:06:33.850> influence

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
is a closed system with no influence

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.380 
is a closed system with no influence
from<00:06:35.300> this

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390
