00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
hey youtube how's it going PC custom

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.959 
hey youtube how's it going PC custom
cool<00:00:08.780> just<00:00:09.469> thought<00:00:09.650> we<00:00:09.770> do<00:00:10.400> another<00:00:10.610> unboxing

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
cool just thought we do another unboxing

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.670 
cool just thought we do another unboxing
together<00:00:11.510> and<00:00:11.690> I<00:00:11.750> wanted<00:00:11.990> to<00:00:12.049> share<00:00:12.290> this<00:00:12.469> with

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
together and I wanted to share this with

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:20.290 
together and I wanted to share this with
you<00:00:13.150> I<00:00:14.200> 720<00:00:15.200> 600<00:00:15.650> cake<00:00:16.390> processor<00:00:17.650> let's<00:00:19.300> let's

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
you I 720 600 cake processor let's let's

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.090 
you I 720 600 cake processor let's let's
go<00:00:20.450> ahead<00:00:20.570> and<00:00:20.990> take<00:00:21.590> some<00:00:21.619> of<00:00:21.890> this<00:00:21.949> stuff

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
go ahead and take some of this stuff

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.509 
go ahead and take some of this stuff
apart<00:00:22.520> because<00:00:23.020> it<00:00:24.020> is<00:00:24.230> now<00:00:24.470> time<00:00:25.160> to<00:00:27.519> start

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
apart because it is now time to start

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.910 
apart because it is now time to start
putting<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:31.419> motherboard<00:00:32.419> in<00:00:32.710> we're<00:00:33.710> going

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
putting the motherboard in we're going

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:47.880 
putting the motherboard in we're going
to<00:00:34.070> be<00:00:39.550> starting<00:00:40.550> to<00:00:40.579> assemble

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:57.870 

everything

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.890 

here<00:00:58.450> we<00:00:58.570> go<00:00:58.900> a<00:00:58.930> little<00:00:59.470> fan

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.870 

I<00:01:03.960> guess<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.860> hasn't<00:01:05.040> changed<00:01:05.520> since<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
I guess that hasn't changed since the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.429 
I guess that hasn't changed since the
last<00:01:05.910> time

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
last time

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.080 
last time
so<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.130> good

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.270 

well<00:01:15.409> so<00:01:16.670> there's<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:19.590> here<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:19.829> go<00:01:19.979> there's

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
well so there's the here we go there's

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.620 
well so there's the here we go there's
the<00:01:20.659> heatsink<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.020> which<00:01:23.569> of<00:01:24.569> course

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the heatsink for that which of course

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:34.490 
the heatsink for that which of course
will<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.439> no<00:01:26.189> use<00:01:26.219> for<00:01:30.170> here<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.259> go<00:01:33.500> there's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
will have no use for here we go there's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.969 
will have no use for here we go there's
the<00:01:34.590> processor<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.899> okay<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.829> would

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the processor there okay and I would

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.300 
the processor there okay and I would
bring<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.310> even<00:01:38.399> closer<00:01:38.780> but<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.929> does<00:01:40.109> say<00:01:40.409> i7

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
bring it even closer but it does say i7

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:52.870 
bring it even closer but it does say i7
2600

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.459 

use<00:01:53.880> our<00:01:54.060> processor<00:01:54.629> we'll<00:01:55.020> leave<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.319> alone

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
use our processor we'll leave that alone

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.190 
use our processor we'll leave that alone
for<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.129> a<00:01:56.189> second<00:01:56.569> because<00:01:57.569> I<00:01:57.810> do<00:01:57.869> want

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
for just for a second because I do want

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.190 
for just for a second because I do want
to<00:01:58.289> open<00:02:01.579> this<00:02:02.579> motherboard<00:02:03.119> as<00:02:03.239> well<00:02:03.420> let's

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200

these<00:03:36.799> are<00:03:36.980> interesting<00:03:39.100> yeah<00:03:40.100> I<00:03:40.730> believe

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
these are interesting yeah I believe

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.900 
these are interesting yeah I believe
these<00:03:41.989> are<00:03:42.049> more<00:03:42.410> connections<00:03:42.739> for<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.280> cue

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
these are more connections for the cue

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.819 
these are more connections for the cue
connector<00:03:44.390> but<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:44.959> will<00:03:45.109> have<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.380> read<00:03:45.560> up<00:03:45.680> and

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
connector but I will have to read up and

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.050 
connector but I will have to read up and
find<00:03:46.040> out<00:03:46.190> with<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.720> what<00:03:47.720> those<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.709> do<00:03:49.060> the

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
find out with that what those to do the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.410 
find out with that what those to do the
IOT<00:03:50.359> very<00:03:51.049> nice<00:03:53.440> crossfire

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.000 

our<00:03:58.420> crossfire<00:03:58.990> I<00:03:59.380> believe<00:03:59.650> when<00:03:59.770> you<00:03:59.800> have

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
our crossfire I believe when you have

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.410 
our crossfire I believe when you have
the<00:04:00.100> courage<00:04:00.280> further<00:04:00.580> apart<00:04:00.910> but<00:04:01.060> what<00:04:01.390> I

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
the courage further apart but what I

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.650 
the courage further apart but what I
need<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.750> find<00:04:01.990> out<00:04:02.490> for<00:04:03.490> that<00:04:03.790> if<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.300> were<00:04:04.480> ever

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
need to find out for that if I were ever

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.809 
need to find out for that if I were ever

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
Maximus for stream I know 16 times does

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.180 
Maximus for stream I know 16 times does
it<00:04:15.520> become<00:04:16.079> after<00:04:17.079> that<00:04:17.230> eight<00:04:17.500> times<00:04:17.859> and

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
it become after that eight times and

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.819 
it become after that eight times and
eight<00:04:18.370> times<00:04:18.639> or<00:04:18.790> is<00:04:18.910> it<00:04:19.060> sixteen<00:04:19.450> and<00:04:19.570> sixteen

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
eight times or is it sixteen and sixteen

eight times or is it sixteen and sixteen
put<00:04:20.829> in<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.160> connector<00:04:21.519> right<00:04:21.700> below<00:04:22.030> it

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
put in the connector right below it

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.629 
put in the connector right below it
again<00:04:23.440> that's<00:04:23.860> something<00:04:24.280> that<00:04:24.400> I<00:04:24.430> have<00:04:24.610> to

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
again that's something that I have to

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.700 
again that's something that I have to
read<00:04:24.910> up<00:04:25.060> on<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:25.570> find<00:04:25.900> out<00:04:26.050> it's<00:04:26.260> never<00:04:26.410> really

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
read up on to find out it's never really

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.950 
read up on to find out it's never really
mattered<00:04:27.669> to<00:04:27.910> me<00:04:28.030> before<00:04:28.419> I've<00:04:28.540> always<00:04:28.840> gone

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.250 

these<00:04:38.440> are<00:04:38.590> interesting<00:04:38.830> Oh<00:04:39.330> ROG<00:04:40.330> oh<00:04:40.510> okay<00:04:41.020> I

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
these are interesting Oh ROG oh okay I

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.100 
these are interesting Oh ROG oh okay I
think<00:04:42.040> I<00:04:42.130> know<00:04:42.190> what<00:04:42.400> these<00:04:42.520> are<00:04:42.580> here<00:04:43.060> but<00:04:43.990> it

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
think I know what these are here but it

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.570 
think I know what these are here but it
won't<00:04:44.260> matter<00:04:44.440> because<00:04:44.710> they<00:04:44.980> do<00:04:45.040> come<00:04:45.220> with

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
won't matter because they do come with

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.600 
won't matter because they do come with
instructions<00:04:46.540> so<00:04:46.810> I<00:04:47.280> won't<00:04:48.280> bore<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:48.490> with

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
that right now

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.670 
that right now
and<00:04:51.970> what<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:52.360> was<00:04:52.660> really<00:04:52.870> looking<00:04:52.990> forward<00:04:53.530> to

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
and what I was really looking forward to

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.629 
and what I was really looking forward to
actually<00:04:54.100> were<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:55.830> SATA<00:04:56.830> three<00:04:57.160> connectors

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
actually were the SATA three connectors

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.530 
actually were the SATA three connectors
there's<00:04:58.360> six<00:04:58.990> of<00:04:59.080> them<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.880> I<00:05:01.120> like<00:05:01.300> that<00:05:01.510> a

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
there's six of them and I like that a

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.390 
there's six of them and I like that a
lot<00:05:01.630> because<00:05:01.990> everything<00:05:02.410> is<00:05:02.740> black<00:05:03.040> and

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
lot because everything is black and

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.920 
lot because everything is black and
these<00:05:03.640> have<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:03.940> white<00:05:04.120> heads<00:05:04.360> on<00:05:04.570> them<00:05:04.750> but

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
these have the white heads on them but

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.719 
these have the white heads on them but
it<00:05:05.020> doesn't<00:05:05.200> matter<00:05:05.470> all<00:05:05.950> you<00:05:06.130> be<00:05:06.250> able<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.550> see

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
it doesn't matter all you be able to see

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.909 
it doesn't matter all you be able to see
is<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:06.970> cables<00:05:07.390> everywhere<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:07.900> we're<00:05:08.830> gonna
