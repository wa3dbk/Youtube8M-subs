00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 and hello is disney's successor 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.360
 or a short video where we had 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.920
 again accurate revelations about 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.910
 live movies this time are movies 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.609
 of animation so there will be ralph 2 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.460
 so if you liked the first 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.230
 so that princess did not see no 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.990
 and you want me to lend to go to me 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.609
 but it's not a thing and castles 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.529
 but they are cold that the vf we do not 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.750
 good good pub short if I tell you 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.369
 ready you will forget me but maybe it's 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.780
 I realized that after months 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.090
 after seeing critics like what 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.410
 the French dubbing was prof and I 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.780
 am when I journals I got 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.340
 Cedric ce1 and lack of panache you see 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.989
 it may have been bad leaders it's 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.789
 nothing but bio here is a movie 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.010
 awesome the following very well be done 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.200
 because that's what happens in a 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.610
 universe of video games that's it 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.969
 in an arcade actually at 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.640
 departure 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.100
 arcane h bridge because of video games 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.170
 with the boom darkness finally here is there 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.350
 arcade stations or dark and no 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.390
 arcade and arcade I'm not crazy and 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.760
 so that's where he can very well have 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.900
 the arrival of recent video games where they 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.000
 are going to close the thing a little to the toy 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.530
 story 3 so you can do without a lot of 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.830
 stuff on it we do not really 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.150
 of idea even though I'm pretty 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.360
 in a hurry because people saw more 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.130
 this film as a big as like a 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.540
 big open door to cameo games 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.970
 video because in raining sony 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.320
 hackman components finally it's 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.030
 really nice on it is a beautiful 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.460
 wink to video games a lot more 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.189
 the pixel I specify and so here 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.710
 why do not I wait for it with 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.710
 impatience but I would be curious enough 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.990
 our new so 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.850
 they announced the exit the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.289
 indestructible 2 he knew since 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.630
 long as the first one came out yeah 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.630
 it's been a while since it's been good since 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.770
 2005 to 2008 it is watching 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.469
 our collection disney the looks 8 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.360
 watch all the movies that came out 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.219
 oil and bamboula between jack you 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.679
 see and well 2008 or 2009 I believe that 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.799
 never a movie ever a back emerged 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.380
 as far from the first I think we think 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.000
 and therefore so much I seldom try 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.610
 I wonder how he can 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.920
 finally, if it's going to be the continuation again with 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.000
 adventures with the same family or 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.680
 yeah obviously 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.060
 huawei and ce1 now enough there 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.620
 has other superheroes me but that's 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.239
 the family that's called believe they 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.349
 had them I do not know if dancing she 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.269
 who as paluds excuse me 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.610
 but this is basically sir 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.290
 moussaoui in the name it always makes me 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.540
 after that is going to be wearing more 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.489
 views and kind it's kids it's 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.530
 possible or to disney very rarely he 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.690
 puts to make age a weight yes but 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.690
 kind the baby he had maya the bee 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.090
 diet is really see transform no 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.170
 more but we go a little bit in everything and 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.810
 what will be bigger or is it 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.639
 will be the direct following as you say with 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.930
 other bad guys 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.850
 I have not been burned I have 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.829
 loved the indestructible one seriously 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.500
 but it's really a I liked 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.299
 but he did not mark me as much as he 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.980
 could have I think besides that you 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.480
 you have not noticed and you will tell us 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.470
 you too but me when I saw 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.010
 I'm told it's not this plagiarism 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.599
 because we compare to the fantastic 4 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.870
 Bahrain the father is very strong the 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.220
 sea ​​she can be elastic girl 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.880
 it can be invisible and make 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.900
 force fields 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.189
 yes but 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.379
 somewhere there is that the crowd had 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.269
 still the thread the baby he got 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.159
 turned into a human torch no I am 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.620
 tell if it's weird as it's very 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:29.049
 sure these drawings are a family 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.310
 super heroes so you can not honey 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.209
 and find them something for everyone 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.319
 yes but I mean it's weird 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.370
 it's like the fantastic 4 I want 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.170
 to say it's a bit like thirty years ago 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.730
 I mean the girl who can the girl 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.890
 which may sound good there was also 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.319
 do force fields also like 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.579
 the cei and in the fantastic four of 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.010
 this was the silver surfer 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:49.750
 yes yes you have they have a friend there who 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.180
 make ice you know ah yes yeah 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.349
 that's right why the Indians the target 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.209
 like autism 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.730
 it's true that it's like a movie 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.139
 marvel super hero 20 years old ah yes but 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.849
 that's for sure but it's just that it's 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.170
 a lot of it is enormously 4 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.060
 fantastic I do not know what you're doing 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.230
 do you think after that maybe in the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.400
 thought maybe the creators were 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.780
 fantastic four fans because 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.389
 I mean he could have given them 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.739
 any power it falls on wii 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.000
 on the four members of the family there 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.680
 has three who have the pears of the 4 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.389
 fantastic what not counting the 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.660
 fifth so the baby who turns 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.680
 in human torch so no and small 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.970
 off topic at the same time but you're 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.520
 remember the movie the wild 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.289
 yes compared to kids because that's it 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.120
 the wild is out before madagascar 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.800
 Madagascar who has a bigger 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.550
 cardboard way and the people they have 10 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.990
 may 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.940
 you realize that in spindles and 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.980
 it is true that often he is very much 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.210
 more realistic then madagascar he plays 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.670
 a lot for example on their music 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.830
 farraj act bad too fast in memory 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.830
 see it dancing all the time on it and 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.270
 suddenly I remember too need 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.650
 I actually saw this one I know it 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.020
 would like a link and leo angie 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.370
 raffin what on the platform I remember 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.110
 the more I saw them twice while 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.980
 madagascar is a hippopotamus gerra 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.570
 the zebras 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.670
 but it's really great this movie to 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.500
 six agents but also for whiskey or 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.080
 dodge in the collection because he 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.460
 is she has to so he was 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.530
 aside joe let sweat the wild 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.680
 he came out just before cars and after 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.880
 bambi 2 but what's weird is 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.770
 he did not make a lot of noise 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.150
 it's nothing it's a shame because 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.980
 here it is but it lied to them at the same time 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.710
 practically in question franck loas and 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:27.550
 So it's a bit like shrek and 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:30.070
 shrek and atlantis that 's dethroned that 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.870
 made over more cartons than that 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:36.760
 so of me and suddenly he spent a little 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.890
 to oblivion so that we do not come 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.310
 I do not know too much but thank god I 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.780
 evolved compared to the fact that copy 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.890
 finally copied that is of resemblance 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.360
 between two things that do not come out 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.410
 long time at the same time even though the 4 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.200
 fantastic are felt very long 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.550
 yeah so that's so Princess did not 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.680
 saw ralph so she can not give too much 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.830
 his opinion on me here I told you 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.140
 I am curious I wait for him 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.640
 yeah and so for the indestructible 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:05.950
 or touba me I have frankly 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.970
 the linen had liked a lot but the 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.950
 two feints you see I would not have 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.620
 thought kurun turin joy not absolutely 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:15.320
 which seems to me that at the end of 1 1 there is 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.030
 there is an end of the law freeze at all 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.870
 is broken and where do we go back to 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.310
 ventured the 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.199
 oh yes it's good that they do it 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.580
 finish with a new villain like 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:24.050
 in the new heroes beating 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.199
 new heroes the dogs in fact there 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.610
 must have fun in the city at the end 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.780
 but yes it ends on a new 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.990
 nasty finally how they resume 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.340
 of the service what's it all and you me 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.930
 I thought it would be well finished 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.280
 as sacred without necessarily doing a 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.340
 kill you by and large you 're not very curious 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.530
 special page we'll see here that's it 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.510
 so I'm afraid it will be painted 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.760
 like both of them finally most of 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.260
 voice I do not want it to be that 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.270
 because it's true that it breaks a little 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.860
 so here you are who you expect to 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.000
 what you have but one of the two 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.440
 other what do you imagine as 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.789
 scenario for both would have also 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.320
 because seriously for the 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:58.639
 indestructible 2 it's going to be like 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.199
 wonder like all the stuff of 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.300
 superhero wearing a new hat 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:04.430
 villain and the same family who fights there

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.280
