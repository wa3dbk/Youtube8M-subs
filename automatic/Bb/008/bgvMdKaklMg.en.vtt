idea<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.000> black<00:00:48.210> ops<00:00:48.390> 2<00:00:48.510> thought<00:00:48.899> it'd<00:00:48.989> be

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
idea on black ops 2 thought it'd be

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.810 
idea on black ops 2 thought it'd be
really<00:00:49.079> awesome<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.430> could<00:00:50.579> either<00:00:50.700> be

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
really awesome so this could either be

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.459 
really awesome so this could either be
for<00:00:51.030> map<00:00:51.210> pack<00:00:51.420> three<00:00:51.629> or<00:00:51.809> four<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> think<00:00:52.289> map

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
for map pack three or four I think map

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.049 
for map pack three or four I think map
pack<00:00:52.680> 3<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.160> format<00:00:53.399> part<00:00:53.610> 4<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:53.940> could

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
pack 3 because format part 4 we could

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.939 
pack 3 because format part 4 we could
have<00:00:54.149> an<00:00:54.239> awesome<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.260> haven't<00:00:55.680> really

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
have an awesome and in I haven't really

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.680 
have an awesome and in I haven't really
thought<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.489> yet<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.360> could<00:00:57.570> be

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
thought of that yet but this could be

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.900 
thought of that yet but this could be
format<00:00:58.050> pack<00:00:58.230> 3<00:00:58.500> know<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> map<00:00:58.949> name<00:00:59.190> could<00:00:59.789> be

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
format pack 3 know the map name could be

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.760 
format pack 3 know the map name could be
the<00:01:00.059> doctor's<00:01:00.449> lab<00:01:00.660> or<00:01:00.870> Richtofen<00:01:01.410> slab<00:01:01.620> or

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the doctor's lab or Richtofen slab or

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.290 
the doctor's lab or Richtofen slab or
something<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.670> basically<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
something like that so basically the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.390 
something like that so basically the
whole<00:01:03.420> map<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.809> based<00:01:03.989> around<00:01:04.170> ripped<00:01:05.040> off<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
whole map is based around ripped off and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.190 
whole map is based around ripped off and
slab<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> experiments<00:01:06.420> he<00:01:06.570> was<00:01:06.780> doing<00:01:07.020> while

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
slab the experiments he was doing while

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.780 
slab the experiments he was doing while
he<00:01:07.350> was<00:01:07.470> showing<00:01:07.740> off<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> zombies<00:01:08.549> team

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
he was showing off with the zombies team

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.520 
he was showing off with the zombies team
while<00:01:09.270> he<00:01:09.390> wasn't<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> zombies<00:01:10.170> teaming

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
while he wasn't but the zombies teaming

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.109 
while he wasn't but the zombies teaming
they<00:01:10.590> would<00:01:10.740> go<00:01:10.860> back<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.280> his<00:01:11.400> lab<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.820> do

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
they would go back to his lab and do

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.700 
they would go back to his lab and do
experiments<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.960> these<00:01:13.170> zombies<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
experiments on these zombies and

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.560 
experiments on these zombies and
basically<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.490> gonna<00:01:14.640> be<00:01:14.909> how<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> starts

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
basically this is gonna be how it starts

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.840 
basically this is gonna be how it starts
so<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> map<00:01:15.900> part<00:01:16.110> 3<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.770> year-old<00:01:17.310> characters

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
so a map part 3 the year-old characters

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.510 
so a map part 3 the year-old characters
get<00:01:18.299> teleported<00:01:18.689> back<00:01:19.229> from<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> moon<00:01:19.920> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
get teleported back from the moon to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.789 
get teleported back from the moon to
somewhere<00:01:21.150> else<00:01:21.360> by<00:01:21.570> dr.<00:01:22.080> max<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.650> he

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
somewhere else by dr. max as you know he

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.740 
somewhere else by dr. max as you know he
somehow<00:01:23.040> sets<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> secret<00:01:24.090> teleporter

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
somehow sets up the secret teleporter

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.539 
somehow sets up the secret teleporter
these<00:01:25.229> old<00:01:25.439> characters<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.040> back<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.460> they

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
these old characters get back on it they

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.070 
these old characters get back on it they
think<00:01:26.729> they're<00:01:26.909> going<00:01:27.060> back<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.390> earth<00:01:27.540> but

think they're going back to earth but

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.270 
think they're going back to earth but
they<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.290> go<00:01:28.470> back<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.860> but<00:01:29.040> they<00:01:29.159> get

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
they do go back to it but they get

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.890 
they do go back to it but they get
teleported<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.210> wrong<00:01:30.360> place<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.840> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
teleported to the wrong place and it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.350 
teleported to the wrong place and it
gets<00:01:31.049> teleported<00:01:31.259> into<00:01:32.000> richtofen's<00:01:33.000> lab<00:01:33.180> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
gets teleported into richtofen's lab and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.749 
gets teleported into richtofen's lab and
that's<00:01:33.540> where<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.869> whole<00:01:33.930> map<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.560> start<00:01:34.890> so

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
that's where this whole map can start so

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.240 
that's where this whole map can start so
you're<00:01:35.939> immediately<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.869> dark<00:01:37.350> horrible

how rekt off and dead become to take

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.429 
how rekt off and dead become to take
over<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.180> zombies<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.479> know<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.780> know<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
over the zombies you know we know the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.170 
over the zombies you know we know the
basics<00:02:01.920> from<00:02:02.040> moon<00:02:02.310> when<00:02:02.579> he<00:02:02.700> got<00:02:02.850> into<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
basics from moon when he got into the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.330 
basics from moon when he got into the
MPD<00:02:03.420> pyramid<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.560> we<00:02:04.619> could<00:02:04.770> find<00:02:05.009> out<00:02:05.219> you

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
MPD pyramid but we could find out you

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.889 
MPD pyramid but we could find out you
know<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.640> behind<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.149> scenes<00:02:06.420> things<00:02:06.689> you

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
know the behind the scenes things you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.479 
know the behind the scenes things you
know<00:02:07.020> what<00:02:07.320> he<00:02:07.560> was<00:02:07.649> kind<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> doing<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:08.399> could

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
know what he was kind of doing we could

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.580 
know what he was kind of doing we could
also<00:02:08.670> see<00:02:09.060> for<00:02:09.209> some<00:02:09.360> zombie<00:02:09.660> Mossy's<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
also see for some zombie Mossy's the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.260 
also see for some zombie Mossy's the
failed<00:02:11.039> experiments<00:02:11.819> he<00:02:11.940> could<00:02:12.090> have<00:02:12.180> been

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
failed experiments he could have been

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.830 
failed experiments he could have been
putting<00:02:12.660> people<00:02:12.989> into<00:02:13.140> these

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
putting people into these

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.420 
putting people into these
machines<00:02:14.260> thinking<00:02:14.739> they<00:02:14.860> would<00:02:14.980> turn<00:02:15.220> into

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
machines thinking they would turn into

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.460 
machines thinking they would turn into
zombies<00:02:15.550> but<00:02:16.300> some<00:02:16.569> of<00:02:16.660> them<00:02:16.780> failed<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.349> they

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
zombies but some of them failed and they

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.680 
zombies but some of them failed and they
actually<00:02:17.769> turned<00:02:18.040> into<00:02:18.220> these<00:02:18.489> you<00:02:18.879> know<00:02:19.000> even

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
actually turned into these you know even

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.170 
actually turned into these you know even
more<00:02:20.040> mutated<00:02:21.040> monsters<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.670> guess<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.030> could

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
more mutated monsters I guess you could

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.910 
more mutated monsters I guess you could
say<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.360> they<00:02:22.989> could<00:02:23.170> be<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.410> new<00:02:23.560> zombie

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
say so they could be the new zombie

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.140 
say so they could be the new zombie
bosses<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.400> we<00:02:24.489> could<00:02:24.640> be<00:02:24.700> seen<00:02:24.910> some

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
bosses that we could be seen some

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.210 
bosses that we could be seen some
mutated<00:02:25.690> experiments<00:02:26.349> from<00:02:26.440> dr.<00:02:26.860> Richtofen

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
mutated experiments from dr. Richtofen

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.400 
mutated experiments from dr. Richtofen
and<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:28.060> was<00:02:28.209> thinking<00:02:28.569> of<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.750> wonder<00:02:29.080> weapon

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
and I was thinking of a wonder weapon

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.570 
and I was thinking of a wonder weapon
the<00:02:29.470> only<00:02:29.530> wonder<00:02:29.890> weapon<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.220> could<00:02:30.280> really

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
the only wonder weapon I could really

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.220 
the only wonder weapon I could really
think<00:02:30.849> of<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.180> know<00:02:31.299> that<00:02:31.480> rekt<00:02:31.720> off<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.049> likes

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
think of I know that rekt off and likes

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.410 
think of I know that rekt off and likes
the<00:02:32.349> wound<00:02:32.650> off<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.220> maybe<00:02:33.730> we<00:02:33.879> could<00:02:34.030> have<00:02:34.150> the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
the wound off so maybe we could have the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.789 
the wound off so maybe we could have the
Wunderwaffe<00:02:34.840> back<00:02:35.080> that's<00:02:35.319> an<00:02:35.470> awesome

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
Wunderwaffe back that's an awesome

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.470 
Wunderwaffe back that's an awesome
weapon<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.160> everyone<00:02:36.430> loves<00:02:36.670> or<00:02:36.879> they<00:02:37.330> could

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
weapon that everyone loves or they could

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.030 
weapon that everyone loves or they could
come<00:02:37.690> up<00:02:37.810> with<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.959> new<00:02:38.260> wonder<00:02:38.590> weapon<00:02:38.890> maybe

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
come up with a new wonder weapon maybe

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.400 
come up with a new wonder weapon maybe
one<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.400> fires<00:02:39.700> fire<00:02:40.569> or<00:02:40.900> something<00:02:41.319> about

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
that would just burn them straight away

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.589 
that would just burn them straight away

that Richthofen intended to kill the
humans<00:02:48.790> with<00:02:48.970> instead<00:02:49.599> of<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.810> zombies<00:02:50.110> but

because we don't have one like that yeah
we<00:03:33.160> only<00:03:33.280> have<00:03:33.459> one<00:03:33.609> that<00:03:33.760> can<00:03:33.910> make<00:03:33.940> us<00:03:34.239> reload

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
we only have one that can make us reload

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.110 
we only have one that can make us reload
quick<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.739> also<00:03:36.010> one<00:03:36.160> that<00:03:36.280> can<00:03:36.459> make<00:03:36.639> us<00:03:36.819> jump

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
quick and also one that can make us jump

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.030

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
think they could be too or some

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.629 
think they could be too or some
different<00:03:40.989> perks<00:03:41.200> as<00:03:41.410> well<00:03:41.590> in<00:03:41.950> terms<00:03:42.400> of

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
different perks as well in terms of
