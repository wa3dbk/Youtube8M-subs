switcher for vjing purposes and the cool

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.709 
switcher for vjing purposes and the cool
thing<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.219> it's<00:00:14.429> controlled<00:00:15.120> by<00:00:15.420> an

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
thing is that it's controlled by an

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.250 
thing is that it's controlled by an
Arduino<00:00:16.320> Ethernet<00:00:16.640> module<00:00:17.720> with<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.750> ATM

Arduino Ethernet module with the ATM
library<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.279> developed<00:00:20.760> for<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:20.970> module

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
library that I developed for this module

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.679 
library that I developed for this module
and<00:00:22.109> what<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.220> get<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.760> customized

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
and what you get is a customized

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.189 
and what you get is a customized
solution<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.500> tries<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.220> give<00:00:27.210> VJs<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.990> feel

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
solution that tries to give VJs the feel

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.050 
solution that tries to give VJs the feel
they<00:00:28.470> would<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.980> have<00:00:29.160> namely<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.880> they

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
they would like to have namely that they

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.540 
they would like to have namely that they
have<00:00:30.240> buttons<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:30.900> selecting<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:32.130> one<00:00:32.309> and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
have buttons for selecting the one and

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.340 
have buttons for selecting the one and
the<00:00:32.640> other<00:00:32.790> input<00:00:33.000> source<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.840> slider<00:00:34.170> in

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the other input source and a slider in

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.110 
the other input source and a slider in
between<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.890> see<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.340> mock-up<00:00:35.670> right

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
between so you see this mock-up right

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.510 
between so you see this mock-up right
here<00:00:36.450> with<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:37.260> pair<00:00:37.469> circuit<00:00:37.890> boards<00:00:38.219> now

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
here with just pair circuit boards now

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.430 
here with just pair circuit boards now
imagine<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.600> would<00:00:39.780> be<00:00:39.930> implemented

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
imagine that this would be implemented

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.299 
imagine that this would be implemented
in<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.520> one<00:00:42.000> unit<00:00:42.239> size<00:00:43.020> rack<00:00:43.440> thingy<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.100> this

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
in a one unit size rack thingy and this

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.790 
in a one unit size rack thingy and this
whole<00:00:44.520> thing<00:00:45.210> could<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.510> built<00:00:45.840> properly<00:00:46.440> into

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
whole thing could be built properly into

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.040 
whole thing could be built properly into
a<00:00:46.829> case<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:48.239> right<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:48.809> just

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
a case and so on but right here we just

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.510 
a case and so on but right here we just
show<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.710> an<00:00:49.800> idea<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.399> what

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
show that this is an idea this is what

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.090 
show that this is an idea this is what
you<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:51.059> do<00:00:51.270> with<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.930> Arduino<00:00:52.469> module<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
you can do with the Arduino module and

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.310 
you can do with the Arduino module and
one<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> reasons<00:00:54.390> why<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.750> such<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> cool

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
one of the reasons why it's such a cool

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.189 
one of the reasons why it's such a cool
way<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:56.180> interact<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.239> your<00:00:57.449> ATM<00:00:57.780> switcher

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
way to interact with your ATM switcher

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.740 
way to interact with your ATM switcher
getting<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.120> extremely<00:01:00.120> customized

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
getting this extremely customized

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.389 
getting this extremely customized
solution<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.590> now<00:01:01.710> I'm<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.100> show<00:01:02.340> you

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
solution so now I'm going to show you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.600 
solution so now I'm going to show you
exactly<00:01:03.000> what<00:01:03.500> this<00:01:04.500> could<00:01:04.710> do<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.339> as<00:01:05.460> an

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
exactly what this could do just as an

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.820 
exactly what this could do just as an
example<00:01:05.840> over<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.229> an<00:01:07.350> input<00:01:07.500> source

example over here I have an input source
from<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.189> Mac<00:01:08.430> over<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.810> another

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
from this Mac over here I have another

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.020 
from this Mac over here I have another
input<00:01:10.380> source<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.799> tablet<00:01:11.280> PC<00:01:11.520> they're<00:01:11.760> just

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
input source a tablet PC they're just

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.880 
input source a tablet PC they're just
running<00:01:12.240> screen<00:01:12.600> savers<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> purpose<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
running screen savers for the purpose of

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.440 
running screen savers for the purpose of
this<00:01:14.040> demonstration<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.820> right<00:01:15.060> here<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> have

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
this demonstration and right here I have

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.240 
this demonstration and right here I have
a<00:01:15.479> camera<00:01:15.840> which<00:01:16.049> could<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.409> pointed<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
a camera which could be pointed to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.530 
a camera which could be pointed to
anything<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.790> want<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.119> include<00:01:18.330> in

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
anything that you want to include in

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.020 
anything that you want to include in
your<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.930> your<00:01:18.960> mix<00:01:19.259> okay<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.220> over<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> now

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
your in your mix okay so over here I now

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.560 
your in your mix okay so over here I now
select<00:01:21.450> my<00:01:21.659> Meg<00:01:22.200> input<00:01:22.590> directly<00:01:23.580> Obama<00:01:24.299> I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
select my Meg input directly Obama I

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.120 
select my Meg input directly Obama I
shouldn't<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.259> done<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.500> because<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
shouldn't have done that because the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.060 
shouldn't have done that because the
slider<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.450> side<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:27.990> over<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:28.770> any

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
slider is on this side so over here any

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.550 
slider is on this side so over here any
selection<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.150> will<00:01:30.540> go<00:01:30.689> directly<00:01:31.020> on

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
selection I do will go directly on

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.730 
selection I do will go directly on
program<00:01:32.040> out<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.780> also<00:01:33.960> lights<00:01:34.500> up<00:01:34.680> red

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
program out so and it also lights up red

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.730 
program out so and it also lights up red
so<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> indicates<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.740> program

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
so it indicates that this is program

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.010 
so it indicates that this is program
it's<00:01:37.920> no-go<00:01:38.340> area<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.090> want<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.479> select<00:01:39.659> an

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it's no-go area if I want to select an

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.590 
it's no-go area if I want to select an
input<00:01:40.409> source<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.100> mix<00:01:41.579> too<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.270> over

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
input source that I can mix too so over

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.590 
input source that I can mix too so over
here<00:01:42.840> instead<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.590> select<00:01:44.250> let<00:01:44.970> me<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
here instead I select let me see the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.920 
here instead I select let me see the
input<00:01:46.229> source<00:01:46.439> from<00:01:46.770> my<00:01:46.979> my<00:01:47.970> tablet<00:01:48.420> PC<00:01:48.720> right

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
input source from my my tablet PC right

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.319 
input source from my my tablet PC right
here<00:01:49.259> which<00:01:49.770> ran<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.579> screensaver<00:01:51.119> and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
here which ran the screensaver and

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.480 
here which ran the screensaver and
doesn't<00:01:51.720> do<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.930> anymore<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.470> now<00:01:52.680> do<00:01:53.250> it

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
doesn't do it anymore but now do it

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.780 
doesn't do it anymore but now do it
again

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
again

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.359 
again
okay<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:55.079> confirm<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
okay so I I confirm that I have the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.870 
okay so I I confirm that I have the
right<00:01:57.350> input<00:01:58.350> source<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.799> preview<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.280> move

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
right input source and preview I move

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.870 
right input source and preview I move
the<00:02:00.090> slider<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.770> do<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.040> mix<00:02:02.310> as<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.700> see

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
the slider I do the mix as you can see

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.480 
the slider I do the mix as you can see
now<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.600> lights<00:02:03.960> up<00:02:04.170> red<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.979> know<00:02:05.130> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
now this lights up red so I know that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.910 
now this lights up red so I know that
this<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.969> again<00:02:06.299> no-go<00:02:06.750> area<00:02:07.079> don't<00:02:07.560> charge

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
this is again no-go area don't charge

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.190 
this is again no-go area don't charge
these<00:02:08.129> buttons<00:02:08.520> over<00:02:08.700> here<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.539> have<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> green

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
these buttons over here I have a green

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.110 
these buttons over here I have a green
light<00:02:10.229> indicating<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.160> any<00:02:11.459> selection<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.060> do

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
light indicating that any selection I do

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.390 
light indicating that any selection I do
in<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.569> part

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
in this part

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.300 
in this part
be<00:02:14.700> okay<00:02:15.060> like<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:16.080> could<00:02:16.319> go<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.500> my<00:02:16.769> camera

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
be okay like I could go to my camera

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.300 
be okay like I could go to my camera
again<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:18.450> lights<00:02:18.690> up<00:02:18.900> green<00:02:18.930> right<00:02:19.379> now<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.799> I

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
again it lights up green right now and I

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.670 
again it lights up green right now and I
could<00:02:20.370> mix<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.879> that<00:02:21.030> again<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:22.080> here<00:02:22.530> we're

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
could mix to that again so here we're

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.580 
could mix to that again so here we're
trying<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.040> build<00:02:23.370> some<00:02:23.640> customized<00:02:24.590> Arduino

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
trying to build some customized Arduino

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.460 
trying to build some customized Arduino
based<00:02:25.799> controller<00:02:26.459> for<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.760> ATM<00:02:27.090> switch

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
directly targeted to VJs and of course

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.449 
directly targeted to VJs and of course
we<00:02:31.500> could<00:02:31.650> imagine<00:02:31.890> many<00:02:32.250> other

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
we could imagine many other

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.190 
we could imagine many other
functionalities<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.239> we<00:02:33.659> would<00:02:33.989> like<00:02:34.170> to

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
functionalities that we would like to

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.699 
functionalities that we would like to
implement<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:35.129> is<00:02:35.280> just<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.610> mug<00:02:35.819> up<00:02:36.000> on<00:02:36.709> some

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
implement this is just a mug up on some

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.640 
implement this is just a mug up on some
plywood<00:02:38.220> plate
