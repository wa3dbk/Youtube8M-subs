gave him a come card and I kind of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120 
gave him a come card and I kind of
caught<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.360> plane<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.020> at<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.170> same<00:00:34.469> time<00:00:34.739> I

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
caught on plane but at the same time I

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.770 
caught on plane but at the same time I
was<00:00:35.520> kind<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> hoping<00:00:35.880> for<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> right<00:00:36.600> mood

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
was kind of hoping for a right mood

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.360 
was kind of hoping for a right mood
because<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.230> his<00:00:37.410> heart<00:00:37.710> because<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.250> his

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
because of his heart because of his

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.760 
because of his heart because of his
strength<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.930> think<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.260> card<00:00:40.559> would

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
strength I just think this card would

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.950 
strength I just think this card would
have<00:00:40.890> been<00:00:41.040> sued<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.850> being<00:00:41.969> out<00:00:42.329> wide<00:00:42.629> because

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
have been sued to being out wide because

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.869 
have been sued to being out wide because
we<00:00:43.320> could<00:00:43.530> plays<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> better<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.280> why<00:00:44.489> just

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
we could plays a better out why just

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.569 
we could plays a better out why just
because<00:00:45.000> they're<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.160> pack<00:00:47.399> as

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
because they're not as in the pack as

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.430 
because they're not as in the pack as
much<00:00:47.760> as<00:00:47.969> such<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:48.510> that's<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:49.050> would<00:00:49.230> say

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
much as such if that's right would say

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.680 
much as such if that's right would say
that<00:00:49.620> he<00:00:49.680> didn't<00:00:49.860> got<00:00:49.980> 49<00:00:50.219> strength<00:00:50.690> obviously

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
that he didn't got 49 strength obviously

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.290 
that he didn't got 49 strength obviously
balance<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> pretty<00:00:52.410> good<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.670> dribble

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
balance is pretty good so we can dribble

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.209 
balance is pretty good so we can dribble
inside<00:00:54.780> out<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.050> what<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> rode<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> challenge

that's one of the worst things about in

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.149 
that's one of the worst things about in
straight<00:01:11.729> away<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.270> how<00:01:12.600> weak<00:01:12.960> years<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.650> so

straight away just how weak years is so
annoying<00:01:14.430> how<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.760> kids<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.110> he<00:01:16.259> had<00:01:16.409> been

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
annoying how we kids so if he had been

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.140 
annoying how we kids so if he had been
the<00:01:16.740> right<00:01:16.920> mid<00:01:17.130> day<00:01:17.250> you're<00:01:17.460> supposed<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.970> be

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the right mid day you're supposed to be

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.480 
the right mid day you're supposed to be
I<00:01:18.360> think<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.990> would<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.200> better<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:20.009> when

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
I think it would be better because when

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609 
I think it would be better because when
you<00:01:20.580> out<00:01:20.700> wide<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.600> got<00:01:21.780> more<00:01:21.990> time<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you out wide you got more time on the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.429 
you out wide you got more time on the
board<00:01:22.920> you've<00:01:23.549> got<00:01:23.790> more<00:01:24.210> space<00:01:24.600> yawn<00:01:25.200> as

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
board you've got more space yawn as

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.560 
board you've got more space yawn as
intense<00:01:26.009> with<00:01:26.280> defenders<00:01:26.759> nayer<00:01:27.210> because

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
intense with defenders nayer because

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.670 
intense with defenders nayer because
you've<00:01:27.659> only<00:01:27.780> got<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.020> ones<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.409> side<00:01:28.650> of

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
you've only got the ones to the side of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.710 
you've only got the ones to the side of
you<00:01:28.920> you're<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.640> totally<00:01:29.909> surrounded<00:01:30.390> by

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
you you're not totally surrounded by

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.480 
you you're not totally surrounded by
them<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.170> there's<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> couple<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.040> players<00:01:32.310> I

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
them and there's a couple of players I

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.069 
them and there's a couple of players I
think<00:01:32.520> would've<00:01:32.939> been<00:01:33.030> better<00:01:33.210> out<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.630> still

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
team the week so i think is about that

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.550 
team the week so i think is about that
price<00:02:11.700> maybe<00:02:11.910> 510<00:02:12.569> k

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
price maybe 510 k

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.710 
price maybe 510 k
exactly<00:02:14.069> but<00:02:14.940> don't<00:02:15.180> get<00:02:15.239> me<00:02:15.300> wrong<00:02:15.480> if<00:02:15.599> you've

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
exactly but don't get me wrong if you've

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.150 
exactly but don't get me wrong if you've
got<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.020> causing<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.440> willing<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.830> splash

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
got the causing you willing to splash

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.490 
got the causing you willing to splash
then<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.819> suppose<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.569> want<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.810> get<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.319> best

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
then I suppose you want to get the best

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.860 
then I suppose you want to get the best
that<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.770> can<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.250> do<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.030> mainly<00:02:21.330> just

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
that you can so you do it mainly just

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.280 
that you can so you do it mainly just
for<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.640> well<00:02:23.640> for<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.000> info<00:02:24.690> card<00:02:24.989> I<00:02:25.080> guess

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
for the well for the info card I guess

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.990 
for the well for the info card I guess
because<00:02:25.500> he<00:02:26.190> probably<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.640> still<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.970> best

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
because he probably is still the best

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.990 
because he probably is still the best
legal<00:02:27.390> max<00:02:27.690> cam<00:02:28.590> if<00:02:28.709> I'd<00:02:28.860> be<00:02:28.950> nice<00:02:29.160> like<00:02:29.670> I

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
legal max cam if I'd be nice like I

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.880 
legal max cam if I'd be nice like I
would<00:02:30.420> choose<00:02:30.630> him<00:02:30.840> when<00:02:31.170> making<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.560> legal<00:02:31.769> max

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
would choose him when making a legal max

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.820 
would choose him when making a legal max
team<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:32.360> still<00:02:33.360> putting<00:02:33.569> it<00:02:33.660> cam<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.230> you

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830

team and still putting it cam and you
can<00:02:35.040> see<00:02:35.220> he's<00:02:35.370> going<00:02:35.640> some<00:02:35.760> decent<00:02:36.090> gold<00:02:36.180> he's

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
can see he's going some decent gold he's

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.880 
can see he's going some decent gold he's
been<00:02:36.599> unlucky<00:02:36.900> with<00:02:37.170> some<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.500> his<00:02:37.590> shots

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
been unlucky with some of his shots

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.350 
been unlucky with some of his shots
right<00:02:38.160> as<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.550> can<00:02:38.700> see<00:02:38.819> I've<00:02:38.940> thrown<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.269> some

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
right as you can see I've thrown in some

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.610 
right as you can see I've thrown in some
of<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.540> shots<00:02:39.690> there<00:02:39.959> where<00:02:40.140> they<00:02:40.260> were<00:02:40.319> nice

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
of the shots there where they were nice

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.009 
of the shots there where they were nice
particular<00:02:41.280> runs<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:42.390> then<00:02:42.510> sometimes<00:02:42.930> they

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
particular runs and then sometimes they

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.620 
particular runs and then sometimes they
just<00:02:43.110> didn't<00:02:43.530> turn<00:02:43.980> out<00:02:44.040> how<00:02:44.250> wanted<00:02:44.910> his<00:02:45.330> free

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
just didn't turn out how wanted his free

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.850 
just didn't turn out how wanted his free
boards<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.049> passing<00:02:46.350> was<00:02:46.470> pretty<00:02:46.709> nice

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
boards and passing was pretty nice

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.710 
boards and passing was pretty nice
obviously<00:02:47.190> can't<00:02:47.640> play<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:47.850> come<00:02:48.209> card<00:02:48.450> work

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
obviously can't play that come card work

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.199 
obviously can't play that come card work
that<00:02:48.989> comes<00:02:49.230> lot<00:02:49.530> well<00:02:49.739> in<00:02:50.459> terms<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:51.090> the

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
that comes lot well in terms of the

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.180 
that comes lot well in terms of the
passing<00:02:51.630> ability<00:02:51.810> it's<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.950> fact<00:02:53.130> that

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
passing ability it's just the fact that

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.000 
passing ability it's just the fact that
we<00:02:53.489> kids<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.819> wouldn't<00:02:54.030> put<00:02:54.630> him<00:02:54.750> up<00:02:54.870> front<00:02:55.140> just

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
we kids I wouldn't put him up front just

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.650 
we kids I wouldn't put him up front just
because<00:02:56.310> he<00:02:56.430> would<00:02:56.610> be<00:02:56.790> way<00:02:56.970> too<00:02:57.030> weak<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.630> a

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
because he would be way too weak it a

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.140 
because he would be way too weak it a
striker<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.459> get<00:02:59.610> bullied<00:02:59.849> out<00:03:00.030> the

striker you just get bullied out the
game<00:03:00.299> completely<00:03:00.510> they<00:03:00.959> survive<00:03:01.709> macam<00:03:02.280> his

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
game completely they survive macam his

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.220 
game completely they survive macam his
position<00:03:03.030> because<00:03:03.480> he's<00:03:03.599> normal<00:03:03.930> card<00:03:04.110> is<00:03:04.200> a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
position because he's normal card is a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.660 
position because he's normal card is a
centre-forward<00:03:04.709> that's<00:03:05.130> another<00:03:05.370> one<00:03:05.519> way

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
centre-forward that's another one way

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.640 
centre-forward that's another one way
it's<00:03:05.819> just<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.120> unlucky<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.660> bounce<00:03:06.900> he's

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.229 
went B I yet here was again that was so
unfortunate<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.400> just<00:03:32.430> wish<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.970> few<00:03:33.150> of

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
unfortunate and I just wish a few of

unfortunate and I just wish a few of
these<00:03:33.390> got<00:03:33.750> him<00:03:33.900> because<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.709> was<00:03:34.769> so<00:03:35.069> good<00:03:35.370> but

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.729 
I do feel it was just that he wasn't as
good<00:03:39.239> as<00:03:39.390> like<00:03:39.780> he<00:03:39.959> was<00:03:40.109> better<00:03:40.290> than<00:03:40.440> his<00:03:40.530> non

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.619 
just I don't feel he's caught that much
better<00:04:32.039> than<00:04:32.189> his<00:04:32.340> non<00:04:32.520> inform<00:04:32.939> so

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 
better than his non inform so

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.809 
better than his non inform so
technically<00:04:34.319> it's<00:04:34.470> a<00:04:34.500> native<00:04:34.919> reading<00:04:35.280> but

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
technically it's a native reading but

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.790 
technically it's a native reading but
it's<00:04:35.969> not<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.210> negative<00:04:36.449> rating<00:04:37.050> because<00:04:37.169> he's

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
it's not a negative rating because he's

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.649 
it's not a negative rating because he's
still<00:04:37.979> a<00:04:38.039> nice<00:04:38.280> card<00:04:38.639> it's<00:04:39.090> just<00:04:39.389> not<00:04:39.629> that

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
still a nice card it's just not that

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.469 
still a nice card it's just not that
much<00:04:39.990> better<00:04:40.199> than<00:04:40.439> his<00:04:40.849> uninformed<00:04:41.849> so<00:04:42.180> i'd

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479
