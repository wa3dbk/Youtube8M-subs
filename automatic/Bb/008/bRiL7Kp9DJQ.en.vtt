copper toxicity and remember the u.s.
meat<00:01:58.159> shipment<00:01:58.579> to<00:01:58.669> Mexico<00:01:59.179> that<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.840> Mexico

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
meat shipment to Mexico that that Mexico

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.139 
meat shipment to Mexico that that Mexico
refused<00:02:00.829> to<00:02:00.950> lead<00:02:01.130> in<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.340> was<00:02:01.579> because<00:02:01.939> of

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
refused to lead in that was because of

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.529 
refused to lead in that was because of
copper<00:02:02.840> contamination<00:02:03.999> this<00:02:04.999> researcher

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
copper contamination this researcher

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.659 
copper contamination this researcher
blames<00:02:05.810> three<00:02:06.469> things<00:02:06.739> that<00:02:07.099> developed

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:07.669 
blames three things that developed

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:08.740 
blames three things that developed
countries<00:02:07.729> have<00:02:08.149> done<00:02:08.300> over<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.630> last

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
countries have done over the last

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.840 
countries have done over the last
half-century<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:09.740> started<00:02:10.130> using<00:02:10.310> copper

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
half-century so started using copper

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.730 
half-century so started using copper
plumbing<00:02:11.090> for<00:02:11.420> our<00:02:11.510> water<00:02:11.720> we<00:02:12.260> started<00:02:12.560> taking

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
plumbing for our water we started taking

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.390 
plumbing for our water we started taking
a<00:02:12.770> lot<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:12.890> supplements

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
a lot of supplements

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.550 
a lot of supplements
like<00:02:13.579> multivitamins<00:02:14.269> with<00:02:14.420> copper<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:14.959> it

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
like multivitamins with copper and it

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.619 
like multivitamins with copper and it
started<00:02:15.950> eating<00:02:16.250> too<00:02:16.430> much<00:02:16.549> meat<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:17.239> he

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
started eating too much meat so he

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.170 
started eating too much meat so he
suggested<00:02:18.260> we<00:02:19.220> should<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.579> know<00:02:19.670> test<00:02:20.030> our

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
suggested we should you know test our

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.580 
suggested we should you know test our
water<00:02:20.329> for<00:02:20.510> copper<00:02:20.840> throw<00:02:21.170> out<00:02:21.349> any

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
water for copper throw out any

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.289 
water for copper throw out any
supplements<00:02:22.099> with<00:02:22.220> copper<00:02:22.579> and<00:02:22.730> then<00:02:23.120> in

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
supplements with copper and then in

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.089 
supplements with copper and then in
terms<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.569> diet<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.170> prevent<00:02:24.200> Alzheimer's

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
terms of diet to prevent Alzheimer's

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.780 
terms of diet to prevent Alzheimer's
number<00:02:25.430> three<00:02:25.700> reduce<00:02:26.689> meat<00:02:27.290> intake<00:02:27.790> since

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
number three reduce meat intake since

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.520 
number three reduce meat intake since
the<00:02:29.180> copper<00:02:29.569> in<00:02:29.689> meat<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:30.140> much<00:02:30.349> better

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
the copper in meat is much better

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.179 
the copper in meat is much better
absorbed<00:02:31.159> so<00:02:31.400> yeah<00:02:32.299> blaming<00:02:33.260> meat<00:02:33.620> may

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
absorbed so yeah blaming meat may

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.149 
absorbed so yeah blaming meat may
actually<00:02:34.340> be<00:02:34.609> right<00:02:34.640> but<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:36.560> new<00:02:36.829> theory

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
actually be right but this new theory

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.670 
actually be right but this new theory
goes<00:02:37.459> it's<00:02:37.700> not<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:37.970> prions<00:02:38.359> the<00:02:39.079> damaging

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
goes it's not the prions the damaging

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.959 
goes it's not the prions the damaging
agent<00:02:40.069> in<00:02:40.189> meat<00:02:40.430> maybe<00:02:40.959> copper
