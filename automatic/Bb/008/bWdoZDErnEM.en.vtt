00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.779
 when this account tweet appeared 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.700
 official of the women's soccer world cup 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:07.390
 you could already guess where they were going 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.370
 shots 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.410
 fifa 16 has been presented with the 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.090
 usual marketing strategy but 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.740
 this time instead of promising goalkeepers 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.020
 100 for the sixth consecutive year 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.850
 have shown that at least at the 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.770
 advertising will obviously be the 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.470
 great novelty of this edition football 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.480
 female that we will see from 25 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.640
 September in the form of 12 selections 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.800
 nationals among them by the way Spain 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.600
 and nothing else this has been all the 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.700
 presentation this time has not gotten us 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.320
 by the eyes new animations the 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.600
 faces of the fans of the third 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.880
 amphitheater or a new stadium or no 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.680
 type of game mode different and by 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.510
 true the referee mode where is it because 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.219
 I would really love it once and for all 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.780
 all be a referee in fifa or pro 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.430
 evolution would see me quite the same 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.290
 I make this video to comment on the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.239
 inclusion of women's soccer because 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.800
 total it's impossible to say anything you can 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.110
 like more you may like less and 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.450
 is there to talk a little bit about 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.250
 sports and marketing and is that the 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.850
 continuously repeats itself 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.010
 fifa x 8 or 9 months later it is announced 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.330
 fifa x plus 1 with the typical trailer and 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.430
 soon after we started to see 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.530
 comparisons with the previous fifa where 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.420
 magically everything worked fatally in 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.550
 comparison with the new one and if that's 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.200
 normal at this point the only way to 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.390
 show playable differences in a 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.250
 football title is comparing it 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.290
 directly with what already exists is of 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.260
 the same or another saga the question is 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.180
 instead of talking about new things between 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.190
 quotes because of a damn time for 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.110
 all do not do the same as always but 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.660
 well if of course everyone is 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.060
 occurs in hundreds well equal hundreds no 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.070
 but dozens of additions that would make the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.470
 game something better exclusively 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.420
 most enjoyable playable more complete 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.280
 realistic funny whatever it is but the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.979
 continuous negative of not wanting or not 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.990
 know how to fix what is wrong is what 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.140
 to me unless drags over 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.610
 five years this saga things like I do not know 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.830
 for example the engine theme of 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.600
 impacts introduced a few 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.310
 years for me works pretty well is 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.680
 Improvable but it really was an advance 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.910
 tremendous more little things like the shots that 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.160
 in general I think they have suffered a 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.830
 huge improvement at least in manual the subject 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.660
 of the handling of the ball in very 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.340
 very small shorts I do not know already I tell you that 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.450
 for me they are things that work well are 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.430
 things 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.530
 completely new so I think the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.540
 result more or less because it is quite 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.849
 fine but because once and for all at 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.830
 less and at this point not 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.900
 takes root a serious failure and defoliates 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.730
 completely and you start from scratch yes 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.400
 which is very easy to say and not to do 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.260
 but at least that 's my opinion so 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.030
 I see for myself I do not know what you see 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.560
 on the pitch the worst thing with 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.940
 difference is the lack of response from 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.920
 player in question to certain actions 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.780
 what do you do with the command especially with the 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.790
 typical loose ball when there is some 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.950
 kind of rejection of bad pass there 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.170
 Normally, the player does not know much 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.160
 less reacts as it should be something that 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.690
 the few videos that I've made 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.190
 lately of fifa then I mention it 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.140
 a lot and that is that if I press a button on the 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.870
 command that is the minimum required is 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.970
 that the player on the screen tried to do 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.489
 the action that asked for it I repeat try 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.349
 at least try then you can leave 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.060
 better it can go worse that will depend on 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.530
 a thousand things if you have done well what 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.230
 you have done wrong in order to a lot of 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.480
 factors but if the player does not do anything 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.030
 or it takes I do not know several tenths of a second 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.370
 in doing it is that that is wrong and for me 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.170
 that's really where the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.880
 problems in the subject of including thousand 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.350
 new things a year that can 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.820
 work very well 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.830
 always but good in general because yes 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.720
 that can go well and forgetting what 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.040
 that already works badly since before that 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.710
 end then makes them add up 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.450
 these faults are not the same each year , two 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.220
 year after year can include one thousand 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.070
 new things but if in the end it adds up 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.020
 mistakes things end up really bad and 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.970
 they end up with very very situations 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.830
 frustrating and I had is really like 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.620
 base a good game because for me fifa 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.110
 at its base it's a very good game but there 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.220
 certain details that for me 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.050
 completely destroy the experience 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.370
 of game mostly online and ya ni os 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.560
 I want to talk about the subject of the manual but 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.540
 well that 's another topic 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.040
 unfortunately the issue of fixing 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.720
 those things because it sells far less than 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.090
 announce I do not know special letters of 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.610
 color magenta phosphorite for the ultimate 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.830
 team and it is more surely up to sell 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.510
 less than including women's teams 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.040
 I know what you will think of all this 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.140
 about the strategy of them post 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.210
 respect to fifa especially before the 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.280
 pitches when presented in the e3 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.140
 in the first gameplays and in passing 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.239
 you can also put me if you want what 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.040
 is what you expect from this fifa 16 a 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.690
 level especially since it is playable that is 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.400
 the most important 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.350
 I guess to see those little things 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.250
 we will have to wait at least e3 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.410
 which is celebrated 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.230
 of three weeks on June 15 and 16 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.730
 approximately and good really 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.070
 I would like to read that your opinions 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.890
 about the marketing part of how 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.260
 she tries more or less to get us 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.810
 the eyes every year the fifa of turn 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.910
 surely this announcement of fifa 16 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.400
 focused exclusively on football 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.710
 feminine is a great starting point what 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.550
 You see, you will see many 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.550
 thanks bye
