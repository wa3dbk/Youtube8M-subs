00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.680
 hi if you can exercise you will be very often 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.660
 see with this hairstyle 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.360
 so one in demand back and then 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.950
 existence of knot i do that because i like it 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.660
 I like that my hair is not in my 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.310
 eyes come and now I'm sure it 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.380
 all stuck 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.720
 I get her questions about how do you do that 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.599
 show something to your child how to be with yourself 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.839
 and so I thought this might be fun 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.429
 to show you how I do that 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.800
 for the men sorry it's a small one 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.230
 bit of a woman subject that you admit 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.910
 going to look at the neighbor is still 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.100
 alternating plus there is occasionally will 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.230
 hammering born something like that in between 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.690
 but well we have to do that 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.670
 I have just noticed it really really 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.070
 lots of practice so if you get the nicely done 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.480
 go try and try again and try 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.370
 Then eventually you will notice it 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.320
 succeeds 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.170
 babies wonder how I do this then stay 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.570
 looking away just okay what you are doing 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.989
 you scare a side part 4 you 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.989
 tuft and divide that into three 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.390
 only the upper tufts 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.880
 do you do it over the normal braid and 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.939
 Other the smoke or please start with 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.400
 braid you grab this tuft over it 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:22.509
 you grab a tuft and you do it 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.280
 in a braid, rather over it 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.790
 a tuft 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.500
 and then do the job with the other side 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.130
 so suppose you have a spot over the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:37.899
 other than that I pick 1 and the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.549
 other side over it and what am I 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.890
 remember that in the beginning I am easy 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.820
 found my back hair here man away 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.799
 to do 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.539
 So here really say is making in 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.270
 so here I really only had one job 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.390
 to braid with 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.299
 now I do it just as sweetly 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.969
 and so you can order one if you are just starting one 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:02.950
 other hair grabs back Alice 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:05.520
 prickje bij over and bij not the big one 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.520
 picking at 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:13.560
 over it also a tuft 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.560
 and so you work all the way back 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.360
 about 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.720
 and one with 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.700
 is now a bit late I glasses on 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.510
 regular weigh about 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.510
 and pack in sway 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.319
 make sure you only pick tufts 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.390
 who really at the beginning of your house me 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.950
 think you're a strict here but make 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.080
 write a tuft of expensive way 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.080
 keep your chapter very at the front 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.020
 that's how I want you all the way back 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.920
 if you've arrived behind 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.410
 make your regular braid far the tokens 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.040
 just about it 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.040
 normal flight 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.140
 do it because you have it further 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:42.910
 less chance of those loose gifts you know 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:45.040
 sure it will be all right and then 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.170
 grab an elastic 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.040
 you can now with a small rubber band and 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.600
 fix it 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:58.060
 I find it perfect to direct my hair 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:59.590
 there address, you can choose 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.810
 so to worry about my tail 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:08.550
 so fix it or you can put a bun 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.550
 having fun with you simply exists 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.780
 and if my size makes you grab it 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.510
 another rubber band 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:22.660
 Grab your hair fun and engaging them 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.850
 because dear you know where I find myself 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.949
 nice gift reset button my kiss that nice 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.520
 finds 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:33.060
 pull my little bit apart and 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.060
 good looking 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.180
 I hope you could see nice song 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.639
 so very often during exercise because 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.330
 you just relax next to it for years in between 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.840
 could not see and gladly until the 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.840
 next time
