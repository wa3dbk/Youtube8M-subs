much I don't want to give up on it as
yet<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:24.200> just<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.560> too<00:01:25.799> hard<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.720> as<00:01:27.720> I

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
yet I just think it's too hard and as I

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.480 
yet I just think it's too hard and as I
was<00:01:28.080> hearing<00:01:28.470> what<00:01:28.740> they<00:01:28.890> were<00:01:28.950> talking<00:01:29.250> about

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
was hearing what they were talking about

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.090 
was hearing what they were talking about
I<00:01:29.880> was<00:01:30.150> literally<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.780> smiling<00:01:31.530> at<00:01:31.680> myself

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
I was literally just smiling at myself

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.580 
I was literally just smiling at myself
thinking<00:01:32.520> girls<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.150> used<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:34.049> think<00:01:34.259> exactly

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
thinking girls I used to think exactly

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.340 
thinking girls I used to think exactly
the<00:01:35.310> same<00:01:35.640> thing

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the same thing

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.350 
the same thing
and<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> only<00:01:37.650> difference<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.880> did<00:01:39.180> it

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
and the only difference is that I did it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.050 
and the only difference is that I did it
even<00:01:39.750> though<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.229> had<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.770> fear<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.400> didn't

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
even though I had this fear I didn't

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.370 
even though I had this fear I didn't
allow<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:43.320> fear<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.490> limit<00:01:45.150> me<00:01:45.360> because<00:01:46.170> I

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
allow this fear to limit me because I

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.310 
allow this fear to limit me because I
educated<00:01:47.310> myself<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:48.090> knew<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
educated myself I knew that this is the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.620 
educated myself I knew that this is the
part<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.650> I<00:01:49.890> want<00:01:50.190> to<00:01:50.310> commit<00:01:50.640> myself<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
part that I want to commit myself to and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.130 
part that I want to commit myself to and
so<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.530> went<00:01:52.710> along<00:01:52.950> with<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.690> now<00:01:54.690> once

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
so I just went along with it now once

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.990

the<00:04:12.989> back<00:04:13.169> in<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:13.859> past<00:04:14.130> there<00:04:14.790> are

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
the back in the past there are

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.120 
the back in the past there are
challenges<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.630> face<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:16.079> deal<00:04:16.260> with<00:04:16.500> yet<00:04:16.979> it

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
challenges to face and deal with yet it

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.500 
challenges to face and deal with yet it
is<00:04:17.280> only<00:04:17.519> through<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:18.510> but<00:04:19.079> we<00:04:19.289> can<00:04:19.320> grow<00:04:19.739> and
