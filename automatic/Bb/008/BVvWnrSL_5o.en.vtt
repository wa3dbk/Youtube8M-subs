water pump thought so what you would do
is<00:01:20.549> available<00:01:20.970> water<00:01:21.180> pipes<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.290> I'm

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
is available water pipes is that so I'm

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.179 
is available water pipes is that so I'm
losing<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:23.030> but<00:01:24.030> before<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.110> also<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.950> need

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
losing on but before you also just need

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.620 
losing on but before you also just need
that<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:28.040> now<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.340> want<00:01:29.520> city<00:01:29.820> run<00:01:30.150> maybe

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
them so right now if you've got a city

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.010 
them so right now if you've got a city
of<00:02:13.580> probably<00:02:14.450> use<00:02:14.630> less<00:02:15.500> than<00:02:15.740> 10,000<00:02:16.489> people

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
of probably use less than 10,000 people

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.250 
of probably use less than 10,000 people
water<00:02:18.020> should<00:02:18.500> be<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:19.160> much<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.640> problem<00:02:20.260> but

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
water should be so much of a problem but

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.380 
water should be so much of a problem but
here<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.940> because<00:02:22.940> C<00:02:23.569> is<00:02:23.840> growing<00:02:24.500> I<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:25.819> barely

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
here it because C is growing I I barely

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.960 
here it because C is growing I I barely
same<00:02:26.780> space<00:02:27.080> of<00:02:27.290> our<00:02:27.410> luck<00:02:27.760> 75,000<00:02:28.760> people

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
same space of our luck 75,000 people

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.860 
same space of our luck 75,000 people
here<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:31.239> yeah<00:02:33.580> maybe<00:02:34.580> there<00:02:35.180> are<00:02:35.420> some<00:02:35.450> other

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
here so yeah maybe there are some other

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.320 
here so yeah maybe there are some other
ways<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.290> grow<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:37.310> make<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.640> same<00:02:37.880> role

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
ways to grow to make the same role

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.360 
ways to grow to make the same role
that's<00:02:38.750> not<00:02:39.050> adding<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.650> more<00:02:39.680> residential

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
that's not adding in more residential

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.750 
that's not adding in more residential
place<00:02:41.180> craft<00:02:41.860> building<00:02:42.860> up<00:02:42.950> density<00:02:43.580> in<00:02:43.670> the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
place craft building up density in the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.060 
place craft building up density in the
residential<00:02:44.209> but<00:02:44.690> wait<00:02:44.900> I've<00:02:45.560> already<00:02:45.830> got

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
residential but wait I've already got

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.640 
residential but wait I've already got
some<00:02:46.280> very<00:02:46.489> high<00:02:46.850> density<00:02:47.360> buildings<00:02:47.840> how

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
some very high density buildings how

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.740 
some very high density buildings how
much<00:02:48.860> more<00:02:49.040> deaths<00:02:49.250> can<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:49.580> get<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:50.120> lot<00:02:50.720> more

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
much more deaths can you get a lot more
