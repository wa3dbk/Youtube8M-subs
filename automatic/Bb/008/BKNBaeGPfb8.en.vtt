00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
next update or at least most of them

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.740 
next update or at least most of them
will<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.640> when<00:00:30.029> will<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.269> be<00:00:30.330> coming<00:00:30.510> out

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
will be so when will it be coming out

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.060 
will be so when will it be coming out
then<00:00:30.960> because<00:00:31.320> uh<00:00:31.349> there's<00:00:31.769> been<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> big

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
then because uh there's been a big

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.500 
then because uh there's been a big
science<00:00:32.430> from<00:00:32.550> 4chan<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.030> issue<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
science from 4chan the issue and the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.790 
science from 4chan the issue and the
reason<00:00:33.660> for<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.469> Raschi<00:00:34.649> on

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
reason for that is that the Raschi on

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.470 
reason for that is that the Raschi on
christmas<00:00:35.190> break<00:00:35.399> like<00:00:35.670> other<00:00:35.850> studios<00:00:36.270> they
