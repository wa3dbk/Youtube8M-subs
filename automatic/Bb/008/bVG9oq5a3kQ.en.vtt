00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.630
 if the title 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.870
 to think of the delights of my palate 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.550
 sorry to disappoint you because it is 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.180
 much more 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.280
 our Czech offers us a new one 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.710
 recipe with all the ingredients 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.430
 according to his whimsical style and 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.430
 original 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.110
 to get the photo effect 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.110
 it will be necessary to build this gb 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.670
 essential is that the tip of the cutter e 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:48.960
 center of the dragging tip 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.960
 exactly match 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.750
 this tool will rotate 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.900
 the expense that in our case presents to 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.600
 90-degree sides between them and creates a 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.460
 furrow one centimeter and a half deep 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.060
 this data is obviously only 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.060
 indicative 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.120
 and supported by a sturdy arm 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.130
 adjustable to the bed of the 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.979
 lathe 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.860
 the holes on the arm allow you to 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:26.310
 get the best job position 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.940
 on the arm is connected the castle on 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.760
 the tool runs with the cutter lo 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.140
 square stop at the top left 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:40.440
 prevents the trolley from coming out 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:45.690
 on the castle built with pieces of 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:50.120
 scrap a people acts as a stop for 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.120
 prevent the trolley from coming out 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.620
 and with the last milling door element 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.220
 the description of the whole ends 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.220
 league 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.700
 now on a piece of iron from which 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.810
 we will make a bowl trace the 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.900
 diagonals and we find the center of the piece 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.240
 mounted on the lathe by the tail of 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.180
 pig after making a pre-hole 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.960
 of the invitation will go to joke about 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.800
 chuck jaws 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:42.670
 since the wood appears crosswise 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.319
 the dig is observed a hangover 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.569
 on the outside of the already defined bowl 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.159
 in his profile he is ready to take 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.159
 misunderstanding spindle 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.290
 we put the gip in place for 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.660
 carry out the quarries we choose the degrees of 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.090
 interval to our pleasure between one and 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.760
 the other quarry we help each other with 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.720
 the indexed king of the lathe and proceed 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.430
 to the rip-offs 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.980
 we prepare square stalls of 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.980
 one and a half centimeter maple to the side 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.210
 on two adjacent sides of ours 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.440
 strips we glue before the floor 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.800
 become and then of maple leaning on 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:37.530
 woods protected by transparent film 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.530
 then we press our sandwich 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.070
 refer to the sides of the connection 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.820
 after bonding, they are cut 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:01.150
 measure the various tiles one piece will come 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.250
 also cut at 45 degrees to avoid 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.240
 interference when gluing i 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.240
 small squares on the bowl 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:17.299
 here are all the paintings and pasted now 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:21.360
 it will be necessary to wait at least a couple of hours 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.110
 now on the wheel to remove the parts 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.260
 protruding 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.260
 as seen in this photo 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:37.400
 you can 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.400
 ferno finishing it to your liking 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.050
 we can pass 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.390
 inside after fixing the bowl 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.780
 to the spindle through the socket in 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.780
 compression 

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:02.040
 Finally, let us take as 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.410
 then on the bottom we left 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.530
 last to give stability to the 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.530
 bowl 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:15.020
 a ya cup is ready on the baby 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.020
 appropriate for resuming at the bottom 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:22.809
 a sheet of paper interposed racco pairs 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:25.370
 and bowl will prevent slippage or 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:28.550
 damage 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.150
 we place a small mark against the tip 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:35.290
 left on the bottom in anticipation of this 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.290
 will favor the exact centering 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:44.510
 we eliminate the spindle grip with a 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:51.050
 truncated leaving an estate of 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:54.910
 about a centimeter in diameter that as 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.910
 we will bring with a hacksaw 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:02.220
 we remove the stump with a chisel 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.850
 well sharpened or with a hangover a 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.850
 profile 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:14.620
 finished we fuck and give a hand of 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.620
 shellac
