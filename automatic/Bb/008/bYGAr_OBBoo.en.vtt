different things but there are some

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.660 
different things but there are some
things<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.949> might<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.310> little<00:00:29.460> bit

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
things that might be a little bit

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.229 
things that might be a little bit
difficult<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.390> when<00:00:30.810> you're<00:00:30.960> using<00:00:31.080> a

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
difficult to do when you're using a

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.280 
difficult to do when you're using a
operating<00:00:33.239> system<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.630> basically<00:00:33.719> relies

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
operating system that basically relies

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.410 
operating system that basically relies
on<00:00:34.320> cloud<00:00:34.829> apps<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.790> for<00:00:35.940> instance<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.329> can

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
on cloud apps so for instance you can

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.010 
on cloud apps so for instance you can
edit<00:00:36.630> do<00:00:37.590> some<00:00:37.710> basic<00:00:37.890> edits<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.579> photos<00:00:39.020> using

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
edit do some basic edits to photos using

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.569 
edit do some basic edits to photos using
some<00:00:40.290> built-in<00:00:40.620> tools<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> file

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
some built-in tools like the file

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.750 
some built-in tools like the file
browser<00:00:42.440> which<00:00:43.440> lets<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:44.040> go<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.610> your

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
browser which lets you go to your

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.920 
browser which lets you go to your
downloads<00:00:45.469> open<00:00:46.879> something<00:00:47.879> click<00:00:48.390> edit<00:00:48.750> and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
downloads open something click edit and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.840 
downloads open something click edit and
so<00:00:49.050> forth<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.100> really<00:00:50.399> pretty<00:00:50.670> basic

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
so forth but it's really pretty basic

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.330 
so forth but it's really pretty basic
and<00:00:51.390> then<00:00:51.899> things<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.289> editing<00:00:52.860> video<00:00:53.160> is

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
and then things like editing video is

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.369 
and then things like editing video is
why<00:00:53.460> would<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> want<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> upload<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> huge<00:00:55.020> video

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
why would I want to upload a huge video

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.439 
why would I want to upload a huge video
to<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> Internet<00:00:55.980> edit<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.489> download<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.270> and

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
to the Internet edit it download it and

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.760 
to the Internet edit it download it and
then<00:00:57.510> re-upload<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.199> different<00:00:58.649> website

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
then re-upload it to a different website

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.189 
then re-upload it to a different website
so<00:00:59.160> there's<00:00:59.309> some<00:00:59.460> times<00:00:59.899> when<00:01:00.899> you're<00:01:01.020> using

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
so there's some times when you're using

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.439 
so there's some times when you're using
a<00:01:01.350> Chromebook<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:02.160> you're<00:01:02.460> using<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.879> as<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
a Chromebook if you're using it as a

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.810 
a Chromebook if you're using it as a
replacement<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.559> full-blown<00:01:05.189> desktop

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
replacement for a full-blown desktop

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.870 
replacement for a full-blown desktop
when<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.030> might<00:01:06.240> want<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.479> use<00:01:07.460> more<00:01:08.460> desktop

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
when you might want to use more desktop

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.990 
when you might want to use more desktop
style<00:01:09.270> applications<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.369> possible<00:01:11.970> to

you use the touchscreen so you can say

think<00:04:59.570> it's<00:04:59.810> because<00:04:59.960> he<00:05:00.050> asserted<00:05:00.290> a<00:05:00.500> double

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950
