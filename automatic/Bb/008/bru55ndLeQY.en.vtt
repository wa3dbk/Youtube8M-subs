four hours to do this bodice which is

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.140 
four hours to do this bodice which is
all<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.640> done<00:00:20.990> because<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:23.460> main<00:00:23.699> bodice

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
all I have done because the main bodice

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.920 
all I have done because the main bodice
is<00:00:24.500> constructed<00:00:25.500> from<00:00:25.890> satin<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.599> satin

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
is constructed from satin but the satin

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.530 
is constructed from satin but the satin
had<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:30.590> it<00:00:31.590> has<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> covering<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.790> lace<00:00:33.180> on

had to be it has a covering of lace on

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.600 
had to be it has a covering of lace on
top<00:00:33.920> so<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:36.230> was<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> little<00:00:37.559> time-consuming<00:00:37.920> as

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
top so it was a little time-consuming as

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.799 
top so it was a little time-consuming as
you<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.790> make<00:00:38.910> sure<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.120> everything<00:00:39.510> was
