00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.490 

okay<00:00:02.010> so<00:00:02.070> now<00:00:02.520> that<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.909> tree<00:00:03.149> is<00:00:03.179> out<00:00:03.480> it's<00:00:04.410> a

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
okay so now that the tree is out it's a

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.839 
okay so now that the tree is out it's a
perfect<00:00:05.009> opportunity<00:00:05.839> to<00:00:07.280> observe<00:00:08.280> how<00:00:08.639> this

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
perfect opportunity to observe how this

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.430 
perfect opportunity to observe how this
piano<00:00:09.210> works<00:00:10.010> because<00:00:11.269> there<00:00:12.269> are<00:00:12.450> two<00:00:12.719> main

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
piano works because there are two main

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.029 
piano works because there are two main
systems<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.280> know<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.969> pianos<00:00:15.570> use

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
systems that I know of that pianos use

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.120 
systems that I know of that pianos use
the<00:00:17.039> Vienna<00:00:17.970> system<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.840> British<00:00:19.650> system

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
the Vienna system and the British system

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.590 
the Vienna system and the British system
and<00:00:20.660> actually<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.230> neither<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.740> them

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
and actually this is neither of them

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.420 
and actually this is neither of them
despite<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.660> fact<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.590> piano<00:00:25.890> was

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
despite the fact that this piano was

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.740 
despite the fact that this piano was
actually<00:00:27.150> made<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.689> Vienna<00:00:28.220> so<00:00:29.390> but<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.570> was

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
actually made in Vienna so but it was

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.180 
actually made in Vienna so but it was
made<00:00:30.960> around<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:34.520> 1890s<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.739> wasn't<00:00:38.070> made

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
made around the 1890s so it wasn't made

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.740 
made around the 1890s so it wasn't made
yesterday<00:00:40.730> downside<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> thing<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.510> that

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
yesterday downside of the thing is that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.799 
yesterday downside of the thing is that
this<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.559> D<00:00:43.800> key<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.700> hammer<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> D<00:00:45.510> key

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
this the D key the hammer of the D key

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.380 
this the D key the hammer of the D key
broke<00:00:46.350> as<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:47.610> was<00:00:48.030> pulling<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.450> tray<00:00:48.660> out<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.920> I

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
broke as I was pulling the tray out so I

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.770 
broke as I was pulling the tray out so I
had<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.629> glue<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.680> back<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.570> wrap<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.719> around

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
had to glue it back and wrap it around

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.069 
had to glue it back and wrap it around
with<00:00:55.110> cellotape<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.219> case<00:00:56.600> so<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.660> can

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
with cellotape just in case so you can

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:10.030 
with cellotape just in case so you can
see<00:01:01.879> you<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.090> see<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:09.030> neck<00:01:09.270> was<00:01:09.450> broken

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
see you can see that the neck was broken

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.600 
see you can see that the neck was broken
but<00:01:11.040> luckily<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:12.000> was<00:01:12.180> broken<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.780> way<00:01:12.810> that

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
but luckily it was broken in a way that

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.300 
but luckily it was broken in a way that
when<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.760> hits<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.210> strings<00:01:15.799> this<00:01:16.799> won't<00:01:17.100> make

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
when it hits the strings this won't make

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.670 
when it hits the strings this won't make
it<00:01:17.460> fall<00:01:17.700> off<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.720> overlapping<00:01:19.320> part

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
it fall off so if the overlapping part

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.289 
it fall off so if the overlapping part
is<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.189> giving<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.119> strength<00:01:22.790> this<00:01:23.790> has

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
is just giving a strength this has

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.440 
is just giving a strength this has
happened<00:01:24.540> many<00:01:25.409> occasions<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.610> all<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.210> them

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
happened many occasions but all of them

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.690 
happened many occasions but all of them
were<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> previous<00:01:28.590> owner<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.340> for

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
were with the previous owner so for

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.539 
were with the previous owner so for
example<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.360> hammer<00:01:30.689> has<00:01:33.229> some<00:01:34.549> massive

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
example this hammer has some massive

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.980 
example this hammer has some massive
stitching<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> other<00:01:36.570> at<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> neck<00:01:37.320> and

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
stitching to the other at the neck and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.940 
stitching to the other at the neck and
the<00:01:39.990> same<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:41.250> hammer<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.950> this

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
the same with this hammer and this

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.840 
the same with this hammer and this
hammers<00:01:44.909> head<00:01:45.270> was<00:01:45.750> glued<00:01:46.170> back<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.950> yeah<00:01:47.430> this

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
hammers head was glued back so yeah this

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.139 
hammers head was glued back so yeah this
is<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.090> common<00:01:48.899> thing<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.200> happen<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:49.740> still<00:01:50.149> as

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
is a common thing to happen but still as

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:11.860 
is a common thing to happen but still as
long<00:01:51.689> as<00:01:51.930> I've<00:01:52.079> had<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.439> piano

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.570 

proper<00:02:12.870> introduction<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.740> piano<00:02:14.130> but<00:02:14.280> I

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
proper introduction to the piano but I

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.690 
proper introduction to the piano but I
just<00:02:15.180> wanted<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.990> know<00:02:16.110> show<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.700> how

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
just wanted to you know show you how

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.060 
just wanted to you know show you how
this<00:02:17.910> thing<00:02:17.970> really<00:02:18.390> works<00:02:18.720> because<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.530> think

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
this thing really works because I think

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.300 
this thing really works because I think
many<00:02:20.340> people<00:02:21.180> have<00:02:21.390> pianos<00:02:22.110> actually<00:02:22.830> never

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
many people have pianos actually never

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.600 
many people have pianos actually never
get<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.850> point<00:02:24.060> when<00:02:24.390> they<00:02:24.630> just<00:02:25.460> pull<00:02:26.460> it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
get to the point when they just pull it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.040 
get to the point when they just pull it
apart<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:27.480> see<00:02:27.510> how<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.810> works<00:02:28.170> it's<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.430> a

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
apart to see how it works it's just a

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.540 
apart to see how it works it's just a
mystical<00:02:31.050> machine<00:02:31.410> for<00:02:31.650> them<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:31.980> that's<00:02:32.100> all

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.100 

yeah<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:35.880> basic<00:02:36.600> idea<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:38.300> every<00:02:39.300> key<00:02:39.540> you

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
yeah so basic idea is that every key you

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.140 
yeah so basic idea is that every key you
know<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.460> really<00:02:41.640> really<00:02:41.970> long

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
know it's a really really really long

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.440 
know it's a really really really long
stick<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:43.250> this<00:02:44.250> stick<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:47.150> fixed<00:02:48.150> up<00:02:48.300> on

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
stick and this stick is fixed up on

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.590 
stick and this stick is fixed up on
these<00:02:48.660> pins<00:02:49.140> or<00:02:49.620> whatever<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:51.240> realize

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
these pins or whatever and you realize

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.950 
these pins or whatever and you realize
how<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.930> white<00:02:52.350> keys<00:02:52.920> have<00:02:53.460> pins<00:02:53.880> lower<00:02:54.510> down

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
how the white keys have pins lower down

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.560 
how the white keys have pins lower down
and<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.470> Black<00:02:55.680> Keys<00:02:55.950> have<00:02:56.670> pins<00:02:57.000> higher<00:02:57.300> up

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
and the Black Keys have pins higher up

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.020 
and the Black Keys have pins higher up
you<00:02:57.810> know<00:02:58.260> that's<00:02:58.530> because<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.400> Black<00:02:59.850> Keys

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
you know that's because the Black Keys

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.750 
you know that's because the Black Keys
are<00:03:00.300> relatively<00:03:00.840> shorter<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:01.740> they<00:03:02.070> in<00:03:02.550> order

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
are relatively shorter so they in order

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.580 
are relatively shorter so they in order
to<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:04.410> same<00:03:06.140> arm<00:03:07.140> length<00:03:07.580> they<00:03:08.580> have<00:03:08.910> to

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
to have the same arm length they have to

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.840 
to have the same arm length they have to
you<00:03:10.590> know<00:03:10.740> even<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.030> distance<00:03:12.420> out<00:03:13.010> so<00:03:14.010> the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
you know even the distance out so the

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.510 
you know even the distance out so the
basic<00:03:15.209> idea<00:03:15.330> is<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.750> when<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.320> hit<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.220> key

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
basic idea is that when you hit a key

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.229 
basic idea is that when you hit a key
down<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.720> other<00:03:18.900> end<00:03:19.020> lifts<00:03:19.890> up<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.400> while

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
down the other end lifts up and while

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:28.270 
down the other end lifts up and while
doing<00:03:21.630> so<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:23.180> lifts<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:26.180> nyhammer<00:03:27.180> as<00:03:27.420> well

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
doing so it lifts the nyhammer as well

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.830 
doing so it lifts the nyhammer as well
which<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.310> attached<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.750> key<00:03:31.670> itself<00:03:32.840> but

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
which is attached to the key itself but

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.960 
which is attached to the key itself but
the<00:03:34.410> hammer<00:03:34.940> goes<00:03:35.940> up<00:03:36.230> because<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.340> held

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
the hammer goes up because it is held

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.130 
the hammer goes up because it is held
down<00:03:39.239> by<00:03:39.510> this<00:03:39.570> thing<00:03:40.050> as<00:03:40.170> well<00:03:40.700> but<00:03:42.050> when<00:03:43.050> it

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
down by this thing as well but when it

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.430 
down by this thing as well but when it
hits<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.560> string<00:03:44.750> then<00:03:45.750> as<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:46.590> can<00:03:46.770> see<00:03:47.070> it

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
hits the string then as you can see it

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.260 
hits the string then as you can see it
it<00:03:50.690> swipes<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:52.050> thing<00:03:52.400> aside<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.820> falls

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
it swipes that thing aside and falls

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.360 
it swipes that thing aside and falls
back<00:03:54.390> because<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.440> gravity<00:03:55.890> is<00:03:56.100> more

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
back because the gravity is more

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.920 
back because the gravity is more
powerful<00:03:56.700> than<00:03:56.959> this<00:03:57.959> small<00:04:01.640> stick<00:04:02.930> holding

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
powerful than this small stick holding

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.280 
powerful than this small stick holding
that<00:04:04.080> thing

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
that thing

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.850 
that thing
so<00:04:06.629> that's<00:04:07.629> the<00:04:07.840> idea<00:04:07.959> behind<00:04:08.349> this<00:04:08.650> whole

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
so that's the idea behind this whole

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.119 
so that's the idea behind this whole
thing

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
thing

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.220 
thing
yeah<00:04:09.939> of<00:04:10.030> course<00:04:10.299> this<00:04:10.510> shouldn't<00:04:11.049> happen

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
yeah of course this shouldn't happen

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.220 
yeah of course this shouldn't happen
once<00:04:11.560> there<00:04:11.709> are<00:04:11.860> strings<00:04:12.099> here<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:13.230> these

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
once there are strings here and these

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.020 
once there are strings here and these
things<00:04:14.560> are<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:16.150> lift<00:04:17.400> lift<00:04:18.400> those<00:04:18.699> little

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
things are to lift lift those little

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.950 
things are to lift lift those little
cushions<00:04:19.510> which<00:04:20.280> silenced<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.669> strings<00:04:22.030> when

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
cushions which silenced the strings when

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.820 
cushions which silenced the strings when
you<00:04:23.229> let<00:04:24.039> the<00:04:24.220> key<00:04:24.400> back<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:29.169> know<00:04:29.199> there's

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
you let the key back so you know there's

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.920 
you let the key back so you know there's
there's<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.310> metal<00:04:30.850> thing<00:04:31.090> here<00:04:31.449> and<00:04:31.660> when<00:04:31.810> you

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
there's a metal thing here and when you

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.010 
there's a metal thing here and when you
press<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.380> key<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.889> metal<00:04:33.280> thing<00:04:33.580> lift<00:04:34.330> the

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
press the key the metal thing lift the

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.250 
press the key the metal thing lift the
small<00:04:35.440> cushion<00:04:36.039> that<00:04:36.820> keeps<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:38.020> string

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
small cushion that keeps the string

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.180 
small cushion that keeps the string
silent<00:04:38.789> when<00:04:39.789> it's<00:04:39.940> not<00:04:40.090> in<00:04:40.270> use<00:04:41.039> and<00:04:42.039> it's

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
silent when it's not in use and it's

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.400 
silent when it's not in use and it's
also<00:04:42.580> an<00:04:42.850> interesting<00:04:42.970> observation<00:04:43.419> that<00:04:44.139> was

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
also an interesting observation that was

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.820 
also an interesting observation that was
the<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.940> highest<00:04:46.210> tone<00:04:47.639> has<00:04:48.639> a<00:04:48.669> small<00:04:49.330> end<00:04:49.830> the

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
the the highest tone has a small end the

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.140 
the the highest tone has a small end the
deepest<00:04:51.760> term<00:04:52.000> has<00:04:52.360> a<00:04:52.389> big<00:04:53.080> fat<00:04:53.350> head<00:04:53.910> so<00:04:54.910> it

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
deepest term has a big fat head so it

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.680 
deepest term has a big fat head so it
just<00:04:55.330> falls<00:04:55.870> back<00:04:56.050> I<00:04:56.229> can't<00:04:56.680> even<00:04:56.800> keep<00:04:57.100> it<00:04:57.250> up

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.900 

yeah<00:05:01.690> so<00:05:01.960> there<00:05:02.199> are<00:05:02.380> there<00:05:02.710> are<00:05:02.740> some<00:05:03.100> issues

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
yeah so there are there are some issues

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.900 
yeah so there are there are some issues
with<00:05:04.300> this<00:05:04.449> piano<00:05:05.350> I<00:05:05.590> mean<00:05:06.010> just<00:05:06.370> really<00:05:06.669> just

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
with this piano I mean just really just

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.339 
with this piano I mean just really just
a<00:05:07.090> few<00:05:07.330> because<00:05:07.889> it's<00:05:08.889> in<00:05:09.070> perfect<00:05:09.550> shape<00:05:09.580> and

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
a few because it's in perfect shape and

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.839 
a few because it's in perfect shape and
you<00:05:11.349> know<00:05:11.470> these<00:05:11.740> two<00:05:11.979> keys<00:05:12.250> are<00:05:14.849> intercepting

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
you know these two keys are intercepting

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.330 
you know these two keys are intercepting
the<00:05:16.270> way<00:05:16.449> they<00:05:16.599> shouldn't<00:05:16.930> be<00:05:17.050> so<00:05:17.380> maybe<00:05:18.130> I'll

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
the way they shouldn't be so maybe I'll

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.520 
the way they shouldn't be so maybe I'll
take<00:05:18.520> a<00:05:18.580> look<00:05:18.760> at<00:05:18.940> this<00:05:21.900> well<00:05:22.900> I<00:05:22.930> think<00:05:23.050> it's<00:05:23.410> a

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
take a look at this well I think it's a

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:32.460 
take a look at this well I think it's a
it's<00:05:23.740> a<00:05:23.860> magnificent<00:05:24.520> instrument<00:05:29.070> my<00:05:30.070> pride
