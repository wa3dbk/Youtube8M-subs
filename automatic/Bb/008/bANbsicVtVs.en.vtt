00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.570
 the improvement in this video of today back 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.570
 this year you how to make the pane effect 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.900
 the effect can be nothing more than you 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.700
 pick up a moving object 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.770
 freeze this object leave the plane of 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.020
 background 'is blurred in the 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.329
 true then will give the impression that 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.829
 the objects moving very fast as 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.930
 You can see in the picture that you are going 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.910
 to need to be made from a 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.460
 camera that at least has the control 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.020
 of the shutter than the shutter 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.430
 controls movement 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.960
 so for us to leave this image 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.090
 we will need what to use 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.609
 a longer speed 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.230
 usually trade in a 60 bar 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.539
 for the camera but then it will depend on 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.910
 according to its object the speed that 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.379
 Moving objects are placed here 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.239
 my house in the sixty neighborhood 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.620
 just remembering to vote using tv mode 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.480
 because that way I do not have to 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.679
 worry about image exposure only 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.730
 to worry is to focus on the object and 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.320
 freeze it and leave there in the background 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.790
 blurred if you give that person 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.310
 manual mode you can use the 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.580
 manual is in fashion tv 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.760
 I put it shutter 1/60 right, I know 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.720
 if I pass camera and moselle is the image 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.440
 gets blurred 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.030
 You can see I left the ISO 100 and the 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.980
 Camera diaphragm will control for me 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.510
 It's just like the exhibition is also a 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.400
 thing that I'm going to change on the camera to 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.180
 make it easy to set the shooting mode 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.430
 continuously to take multiple pictures 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:35.360
 and I will also change the autofocus mode 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.630
 I'll change a shock to be 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.870
 if you have a nikon it's called a 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.000
 fcc or continue the servo you place 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.970
 this because the focus he will always be 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.340
 following if the object it will not lock 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.590
 an object for you to photograph are 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.870
 conforming the object was moving the focus 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.740
 will continue following him keeping 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.930
 it matters 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.120
 theoretically and now what we have 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.640
 what to do is follow the object with the camera 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.010
 and photograph what you can do to 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.350
 start training is you power up front 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.989
 from the camera you focus on his show going 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.349
 following the other thing put your 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.480
 focus point on the center do not use all 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.310
 the 11 door for you is to focus 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.800
 precisely in its object, evidence and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.620
 to practice you focus on the finger will follow 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.200
 shoot first attempt 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.790
 he got out of focus and try again 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.159
 here you go putting you see that the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.769
 Second it was already evident with the focus 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.180
 background has already been a little honored grandchild 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.840
 moving very slowly now I'll try 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.519
 do with cars only remembering that it is the 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.840
 object that comes at the moment it has 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.970
 parallel with the camera is never 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.569
 running forward pulling me away will not go 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.930
 succeed 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.810
 how are you using the other focus on 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.480
 that keeps your eyes focused on the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.239
 object keeps the button pressed 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.760
 only the button goes bare to a point where 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.560
 it is in the center of your chicken where 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.319
 you want to photograph is the following in 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.299
 I play to the photo where I want to make a 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:12.290
 Test here for you to see try. 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:14.629
 put a car here I'll focus and 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.659
 returning to photos as shot 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.970
 keep your finger tight 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:23.390
 He buys and goes to photograph. 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.109
 You can see if there's more left 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.599
 so bad 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.700
 I put a shutter or here 1/50 that 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:33.620
 I think it's not so blurry plan 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.300
 background or clay 50 and I will try another 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.840
 time here 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:43.100
 the object you have photographed 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.440
 see is the object stayed michigan and the plan 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.960
 bottom as tail 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.640
 so it's just you practice a lot of yours 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.520
 getting better is pretty easy 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.070
 if your camera does not have this 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.970
 continuous focus or shooting mode 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.290
 continuous 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.300
 then you will have to follow the same 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.280
 once you are coming close to 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.080
 Where do you want to photograph you photograph? 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.660
 one the only way you have to 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.400
 but it is very simple to maintain the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.020
 hubble released shutter down just take care 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.730
 when put very low on sunny day 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.020
 to trigger form gets too bursty 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.980
 You always have to pay. 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.510
 attention to it 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.950
 how I'm using the camera view mode 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.570
 is controlling for my wife then 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.620
 I do not have to worry about it is 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.269
 pretty easy 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.130
 Good, I hope you enjoyed it. 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.290
