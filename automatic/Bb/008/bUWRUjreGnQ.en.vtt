00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
buy that it um they they do make a

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.050 
buy that it um they they do make a
version<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.129> speaker<00:02:52.459> makes<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.790> version

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
version of this speaker makes a version

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.089 
version of this speaker makes a version
of<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.299> i<00:02:53.569> think<00:02:54.140> they<00:02:54.230> call<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.530> new<00:02:54.680> hybrid

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
of this i think they call the new hybrid

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.800 
of this i think they call the new hybrid
one<00:02:55.609> of<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.760> main<00:02:55.970> differences<00:02:56.390> between<00:02:56.450> the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
one of the main differences between the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.470 
one of the main differences between the
Neo<00:02:56.989> Hybrid<00:02:57.079> and<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:57.680> one<00:02:57.859> is<00:02:58.489> that<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:59.329> new

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
Neo Hybrid and this one is that the new

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.180 
Neo Hybrid and this one is that the new
hybrid<00:03:00.019> I<00:03:00.200> believe<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:02.269> plastic<00:03:02.989> frame<00:03:03.440> and

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
hybrid I believe is a plastic frame and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.910 
hybrid I believe is a plastic frame and
so<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.549> is<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.760> aluminum<00:03:05.329> it's<00:03:05.599> metal<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:06.799> has

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
so this is a aluminum it's metal so has

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.670 
so this is a aluminum it's metal so has
its<00:03:07.069> kind<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.310> shine<00:03:07.549> to<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:07.819> and<00:03:08.150> yeah<00:03:09.109> over

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
its kind of shine to it and yeah over

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.800 
its kind of shine to it and yeah over
time<00:03:09.890> I'm<00:03:10.040> sure<00:03:10.280> aware<00:03:11.030> probably<00:03:11.599> but<00:03:13.450> it's<00:03:14.450> me

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
time I'm sure aware probably but it's me

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.680 
time I'm sure aware probably but it's me
the<00:03:15.500> metal<00:03:16.040> aluminum<00:03:16.250> kind<00:03:16.639> of<00:03:16.760> really<00:03:17.450> was

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
the metal aluminum kind of really was

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.319 
the metal aluminum kind of really was
reminiscent<00:03:18.230> of<00:03:18.260> what<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.680> note<00:03:18.889> 4<00:03:19.250> kind<00:03:20.239> of

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
reminiscent of what the note 4 kind of

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.370 
reminiscent of what the note 4 kind of
the<00:03:20.810> original<00:03:21.200> design<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:22.569> this<00:03:23.569> is<00:03:23.599> my<00:03:23.750> note

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
the original design so this is my note

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.890 
the original design so this is my note

a little bit different than AT&amp;T and
t-mobile<00:04:03.319> and<00:04:03.739> Sprint<00:04:04.180> because<00:04:05.180> they

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
t-mobile and Sprint because they

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:09.699 
t-mobile and Sprint because they
actually<00:04:05.690> changed<00:04:06.379> their<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:09.049> layout<00:04:09.410> of

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
actually changed their the layout of

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.550 
actually changed their the layout of
their<00:04:10.340> microphone<00:04:11.209> port<00:04:11.510> so<00:04:12.049> a<00:04:12.079> lot<00:04:12.379> of<00:04:12.410> the

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
their microphone port so a lot of the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.210 
their microphone port so a lot of the
cases<00:04:14.019> one<00:04:15.019> of<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.139> microphone<00:04:15.530> ports<00:04:15.889> lineup

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
cases one of the microphone ports lineup

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.099 
cases one of the microphone ports lineup
and<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.609> other<00:04:16.760> one<00:04:16.970> does<00:04:17.150> not<00:04:17.389> and<00:04:17.630> that<00:04:18.079> is

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
and the other one does not and that is

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.449 
and the other one does not and that is
also<00:04:18.349> the<00:04:18.470> case<00:04:18.680> with<00:04:18.739> this<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.370> I'll

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
also the case with this and I'll

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.310 
also the case with this and I'll
probably<00:04:19.729> end<00:04:19.969> up<00:04:20.060> modifying<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:20.930> already

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
probably end up modifying it I already

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.170 
probably end up modifying it I already

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
and one of the main reasons i got the

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.559 
and one of the main reasons i got the
case<00:04:41.500> was<00:04:41.979> because<00:04:42.370> this<00:04:42.550> kind<00:04:42.699> of<00:04:42.819> textured

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
case was because this kind of textured

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.529 
case was because this kind of textured
back<00:04:43.780> it<00:04:44.500> reminds<00:04:44.979> me<00:04:45.069> a<00:04:45.160> lot<00:04:45.430> of<00:04:45.539> Samsung's

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
back it reminds me a lot of Samsung's

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.680 
back it reminds me a lot of Samsung's
design<00:04:47.520> but<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.580> nice<00:04:48.699> thing<00:04:48.729> is<00:04:48.940> it<00:04:49.120> it's<00:04:49.449> not

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
design but the nice thing is it it's not

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.629 
design but the nice thing is it it's not
plasticky<00:04:50.380> it's<00:04:50.530> actually<00:04:50.919> like<00:04:51.220> a<00:04:51.280> soft

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
plasticky it's actually like a soft

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.529 
plasticky it's actually like a soft
rubber<00:04:53.310> if<00:04:54.310> we<00:04:54.520> make<00:04:54.699> that<00:04:54.880> out<00:04:55.030> an<00:04:55.150> app<00:04:55.270> but

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
rubber if we make that out an app but

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.320 
rubber if we make that out an app but
there's<00:04:56.080> a<00:04:56.139> really<00:04:56.289> nice<00:04:56.500> feel<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.740> it<00:04:56.949> I<00:04:57.099> think

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
there's a really nice feel to it I think

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.890 
there's a really nice feel to it I think
it's<00:04:58.330> a<00:04:58.449> really<00:04:58.599> nice<00:04:58.810> kind<00:04:59.349> of<00:04:59.470> grip<00:04:59.740> and<00:05:00.900> one

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
it's a really nice kind of grip and one

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.230 
it's a really nice kind of grip and one
of<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.020> things<00:05:02.050> about<00:05:02.229> the<00:05:02.560> original<00:05:02.919> note

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
of the things about the original note

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.230 
of the things about the original note
i'm<00:05:04.240> in<00:05:04.389> the<00:05:04.479> note<00:05:04.599> for<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.349> case<00:05:06.120> here<00:05:07.120> has

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
i'm in the note for the case here has

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.969 
i'm in the note for the case here has
that<00:05:07.360> texture<00:05:07.690> to<00:05:07.810> it<00:05:07.840> but<00:05:08.680> it's<00:05:08.830> still

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
that texture to it but it's still

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.420 
that texture to it but it's still
plastic<00:05:09.430> and<00:05:09.930> it<00:05:10.930> is<00:05:11.289> in<00:05:11.590> my<00:05:11.710> opinion<00:05:11.830> a<00:05:12.159> little

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
plastic and it is in my opinion a little

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.719 
plastic and it is in my opinion a little
slippery<00:05:12.789> so<00:05:13.680> really<00:05:14.680> like<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.370> kind<00:05:15.699> of

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
slippery so really like the kind of

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.120 
slippery so really like the kind of
texture<00:05:16.120> this<00:05:16.330> case<00:05:16.599> adds<00:05:16.870> to<00:05:17.169> it<00:05:17.319> really

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
texture this case adds to it really

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.100 
texture this case adds to it really
helps<00:05:18.430> with<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.699> grip<00:05:18.909> one<00:05:19.690> other<00:05:19.780> thing<00:05:19.870> I'll

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
helps with the grip one other thing I'll

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.100 
helps with the grip one other thing I'll
point<00:05:20.139> out<00:05:20.440> is<00:05:20.650> the<00:05:21.490> aluminum<00:05:22.090> frame<00:05:22.449> that<00:05:22.930> you

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
point out is the aluminum frame that you

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.860 
point out is the aluminum frame that you
know<00:05:23.319> you<00:05:23.409> attach<00:05:23.680> on<00:05:23.919> I<00:05:24.509> it's<00:05:25.509> probably<00:05:25.750> not

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
know you attach on I it's probably not

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.080 
know you attach on I it's probably not
as<00:05:26.020> noticeable<00:05:26.199> on<00:05:26.650> this<00:05:26.860> blue<00:05:27.099> but<00:05:27.430> on<00:05:27.610> the

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
as noticeable on this blue but on the

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.070 
as noticeable on this blue but on the
silver<00:05:28.570> level<00:05:29.409> that<00:05:29.650> I've<00:05:29.770> ordered<00:05:30.039> I<00:05:30.400> I<00:05:31.210> think

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
silver level that I've ordered I I think

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.060 
silver level that I've ordered I I think
it'll<00:05:32.229> be<00:05:32.259> a<00:05:32.320> little<00:05:32.409> bit<00:05:32.560> more<00:05:32.680> noticeable

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
it'll be a little bit more noticeable

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.709 
it'll be a little bit more noticeable
but<00:05:33.250> it<00:05:33.310> does<00:05:33.460> have<00:05:33.639> that<00:05:33.759> kind<00:05:34.030> of<00:05:34.090> bevel<00:05:34.479> that

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:34.719 
but it does have that kind of bevel that

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.020 
but it does have that kind of bevel that
chamfered<00:05:35.320> edge<00:05:35.530> they<00:05:35.770> call<00:05:35.979> I<00:05:36.009> guess<00:05:36.219> that

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
chamfered edge they call I guess that

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.279 
chamfered edge they call I guess that
the<00:05:37.180> original<00:05:37.389> note<00:05:37.810> does<00:05:38.740> and<00:05:39.009> so<00:05:39.880> I<00:05:40.449> really

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
the original note does and so I really

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.610 
the original note does and so I really
like<00:05:41.440> to<00:05:41.620> look<00:05:41.740> at<00:05:41.889> that<00:05:42.180> but<00:05:43.180> let<00:05:43.330> me<00:05:43.590> use<00:05:44.590> it

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
like to look at that but let me use it

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.129 
like to look at that but let me use it
for<00:05:44.889> a<00:05:44.919> couple<00:05:45.039> hours<00:05:45.250> day<00:05:45.940> or<00:05:45.969> two<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.479> I<00:05:46.990> will

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
for a couple hours day or two and I will

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.800 
for a couple hours day or two and I will
actually<00:05:47.409> post<00:05:47.590> a<00:05:47.710> review<00:05:48.270> with<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:49.509> various

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
actually post a review with the various

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.010 
actually post a review with the various
case<00:05:50.080> the<00:05:50.500> rinky<00:05:50.949> fusion<00:05:51.340> case<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:52.020> my

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
case the rinky fusion case and my

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.620 
case the rinky fusion case and my
speaking<00:05:53.800> Thai<00:05:54.009> farmer<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:55.180> what<00:05:55.389> I<00:05:55.419> think

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
speaking Thai farmer and what I think

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.820 
speaking Thai farmer and what I think
I'll<00:05:55.719> put<00:05:55.900> a<00:05:55.930> couple<00:05:56.169> of<00:05:56.349> things<00:05:56.380> just<00:05:56.710> I

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
I'll put a couple of things just I

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.620 
I'll put a couple of things just I
noticed<00:05:57.190> off<00:05:57.400> of<00:05:57.819> the<00:05:58.690> bat<00:05:58.840> is<00:05:59.050> the<00:05:59.500> bumper

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
noticed off of the bat is the bumper

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.999 
noticed off of the bat is the bumper
kind<00:06:01.630> of<00:06:01.690> that<00:06:01.780> raised<00:06:01.960> edge<00:06:02.259> unit<00:06:02.560> to<00:06:02.680> protect

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:03.009 
kind of that raised edge unit to protect

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.149 
kind of that raised edge unit to protect
the<00:06:03.099> screen<00:06:03.280> is<00:06:03.610> very<00:06:04.300> pronounced<00:06:05.110> on<00:06:05.620> this

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
the screen is very pronounced on this

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:10.290 
the screen is very pronounced on this
case<00:06:06.430> and<00:06:06.750> this<00:06:07.750> almost<00:06:08.729> maybe<00:06:09.729> even<00:06:09.969> slightly

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
case and this almost maybe even slightly

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.089 
case and this almost maybe even slightly
more<00:06:10.630> so<00:06:10.780> than<00:06:10.960> the<00:06:11.020> tough<00:06:11.259> armor<00:06:11.590> but<00:06:11.770> i'll

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
more so than the tough armor but i'll

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.520 
more so than the tough armor but i'll
compare<00:06:12.370> that<00:06:12.490> when<00:06:12.639> i<00:06:12.669> do<00:06:12.789> the<00:06:12.909> video<00:06:13.090> and<00:06:13.530> it

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
compare that when i do the video and it

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.990 
compare that when i do the video and it
does<00:06:14.830> cover<00:06:16.469> just<00:06:17.469> slightly<00:06:17.740> that<00:06:18.250> gap<00:06:18.520> that

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
does cover just slightly that gap that

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.200 
does cover just slightly that gap that
people<00:06:19.210> are<00:06:19.300> concerned<00:06:19.539> about<00:06:19.740> so<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:21.210> case

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
people are concerned about so the case

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:29.100 
people are concerned about so the case
does<00:06:22.630> come<00:06:22.900> over<00:06:23.169> that<00:06:23.259> top<00:06:23.500> of<00:06:23.680> that<00:06:27.840> yeah<00:06:28.840> has

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
does come over that top of that yeah has
