man<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.500> guess<00:00:40.860> what<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.910> it

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
man I guess what is it

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.569 
man I guess what is it
I<00:00:42.739> guess<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.550> basically<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:46.579> rubber

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
I guess the it's basically like a rubber

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.280 
I guess the it's basically like a rubber
cement<00:00:47.909> that<00:00:48.269> they<00:00:48.390> put<00:00:48.629> down<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.019> kind<00:00:49.230> of

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
cement that they put down to kind of

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.979 
cement that they put down to kind of
dampen<00:00:49.589> the<00:00:50.010> noise<00:00:50.040> like<00:00:50.970> street<00:00:51.329> noise<00:00:51.540> and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
dampen the noise like street noise and

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.990 
dampen the noise like street noise and
tire<00:00:52.829> noise<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.370> all<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.579> kind<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.790> stuff

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
