00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.039 
the best it can
as<00:03:32.639> far<00:03:32.849> as<00:03:32.879> capturing<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.680> detail<00:03:36.049> focus

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
as far as capturing the detail focus

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:43.550 
as far as capturing the detail focus
maybe<00:03:38.040> not<00:03:39.620> according<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.799> light<00:03:42.560> it's

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
maybe not according to the light it's

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.339 
maybe not according to the light it's
not<00:03:43.709> going<00:03:43.919> to<00:03:43.979> focus<00:03:44.220> all<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.430> way

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.800 

so<00:03:47.980> but<00:03:48.609> anyway<00:03:48.879> you<00:03:48.939> get<00:03:49.239> you<00:03:49.359> guys<00:03:49.510> can<00:03:49.659> see

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
so but anyway you get you guys can see

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.619 
so but anyway you get you guys can see
that<00:03:49.959> right<00:03:50.849> let's<00:03:51.849> see<00:03:51.999> if<00:03:52.120> this<00:03:52.239> will<00:03:52.389> do<00:03:52.540> the

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
that right let's see if this will do the

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.229 
that right let's see if this will do the
trick

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
trick

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:01.170 
trick
nope<00:03:55.239> not<00:03:55.540> focusing<00:03:56.790> unfortunately<00:04:00.030> there<00:04:01.030> we

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
nope not focusing unfortunately there we

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.699 
nope not focusing unfortunately there we
go<00:04:01.299> like<00:04:01.389> it's<00:04:01.719> kind<00:04:01.989> of<00:04:02.109> focusing<00:04:02.499> you<00:04:02.590> can

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
go like it's kind of focusing you can

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:03.959 
go like it's kind of focusing you can
kind<00:04:02.889> of<00:04:02.920> see<00:04:03.069> it<00:04:03.189> so<00:04:03.639> there's<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:03.939> other

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
I get if halfway there if I try to put

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.529 
I get if halfway there if I try to put
it<00:04:25.960> here<00:04:26.169> my<00:04:26.320> ring<00:04:26.560> finger<00:04:26.830> ring<00:04:27.340> finger<00:04:27.539> can

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
it here my ring finger ring finger can

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.689 
it here my ring finger ring finger can
kind<00:04:28.750> of<00:04:28.840> get<00:04:29.289> almost<00:04:29.710> there<00:04:29.949> I'm<00:04:30.370> sure<00:04:30.550> if<00:04:30.639> I

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
kind of get almost there I'm sure if I

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.089 
kind of get almost there I'm sure if I
put<00:04:30.880> on<00:04:30.970> my<00:04:31.030> pinky<00:04:31.360> it'll<00:04:31.630> fit<00:04:31.780> all<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.020> way<00:04:32.099> so

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
put on my pinky it'll fit all the way so

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:34.439 
put on my pinky it'll fit all the way so
there's<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.400> One<00:04:33.520> Ring<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:34.060> I<00:04:34.180> should<00:04:34.360> be

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
there's the One Ring and I should be

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.060 
there's the One Ring and I should be
invisible<00:04:34.630> right<00:04:34.990> now<00:04:35.139> but<00:04:35.440> it's<00:04:35.560> not<00:04:35.710> working

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
invisible right now but it's not working

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.210 
invisible right now but it's not working
so<00:04:36.759> I<00:04:36.789> guess<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.449> ten<00:04:37.870> dollar<00:04:38.080> deposit<00:04:38.710> is<00:04:38.979> not

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
so I guess the ten dollar deposit is not

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.839 
so I guess the ten dollar deposit is not
enough<00:04:39.599> anyway<00:04:40.599> there's<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.259> One<00:04:41.380> Ring<00:04:41.849> kind

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
enough anyway there's the One Ring kind

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.339 
enough anyway there's the One Ring kind
of<00:04:42.940> put<00:04:43.120> it<00:04:43.240> there<00:04:43.419> you<00:04:43.660> can<00:04:43.750> put<00:04:44.199> it<00:04:44.289> anywhere

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
of put it there you can put it anywhere

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.129 
of put it there you can put it anywhere
pretty<00:04:44.800> much<00:04:45.009> now<00:04:45.940> now<00:04:46.360> that<00:04:46.509> I<00:04:46.539> think<00:04:46.599> of<00:04:46.810> it<00:04:46.930> I

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
pretty much now now that I think of it I

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.770 
pretty much now now that I think of it I
can't<00:04:47.470> remember<00:04:47.620> where<00:04:48.610> Frodo<00:04:49.150> usually<00:04:49.599> put

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
can't remember where Frodo usually put

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.450 
can't remember where Frodo usually put
the<00:04:49.990> ring<00:04:50.139> on<00:04:50.259> which<00:04:50.470> finger<00:04:50.860> I<00:04:50.979> believe<00:04:51.370> it

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
the ring on which finger I believe it

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.570 
the ring on which finger I believe it
was<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.880> pointer<00:04:52.330> finger<00:04:52.599> but<00:04:53.259> who<00:04:53.620> knows<00:04:53.830> but

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
was the pointer finger but who knows but

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.089 
was the pointer finger but who knows but
anyway<00:04:54.909> this<00:04:55.030> is<00:04:55.090> this<00:04:55.509> is<00:04:55.630> a<00:04:55.659> nice<00:04:56.099> prop
