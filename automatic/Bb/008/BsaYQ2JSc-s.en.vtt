00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
in the wild they're getting even bigger

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.250

there<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> misconception<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.809> goldfish

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
there is a misconception that goldfish

there is a misconception that goldfish
grow<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.620> fit<00:00:46.950> their<00:00:47.100> environment<00:00:47.219> but<00:00:47.760> their

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
grow to fit their environment but their

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.639 
grow to fit their environment but their
size<00:00:48.030> actually<00:00:48.329> comes<00:00:48.629> down<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.050> nitrate<00:00:49.469> in

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
size actually comes down to nitrate in

there's<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:53.850> much<00:00:54.000> nitrate<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.750> they

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
there's not as much nitrate and they

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.779 
there's not as much nitrate and they
don't<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> delicious<00:00:55.980> feast<00:00:56.489> of
