00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.780 
now you see a couple different things I
did<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.330> put<00:03:04.599> my<00:03:04.630> foot<00:03:04.959> up<00:03:05.080> higher<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:06.519> make<00:03:06.670> it

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
did I put my foot up higher and make it

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.280 
did I put my foot up higher and make it
tilt<00:03:07.030> in<00:03:09.000> now<00:03:10.000> again<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:10.599> I'd<00:03:10.810> go<00:03:10.870> lighter

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
tilt in now again this I'd go lighter

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.050 
tilt in now again this I'd go lighter
with<00:03:11.560> relative<00:03:12.099> to<00:03:12.220> powerlifting<00:03:12.700> squats

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
with relative to powerlifting squats

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.850 
with relative to powerlifting squats
because<00:03:13.599> really<00:03:14.079> what<00:03:14.349> you're<00:03:14.500> doing<00:03:14.530> here

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
because really what you're doing here

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.650 
because really what you're doing here
for<00:03:14.890> me<00:03:15.190> this<00:03:15.549> is<00:03:15.670> what<00:03:15.790> I've<00:03:15.910> done<00:03:16.090> this<00:03:16.420> again

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
for me this is what I've done this again

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.160 
for me this is what I've done this again
for<00:03:16.840> me

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
for me

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.229 
for me
I'm<00:03:17.860> strengthen<00:03:18.430> my<00:03:18.549> ligaments<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.180> joints

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
I'm strengthen my ligaments and joints

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.780 
I'm strengthen my ligaments and joints
and<00:03:19.690> tendons<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.530> building<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.370> quads<00:03:21.610> at

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
and tendons and building the quads at

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.460 
and tendons and building the quads at
the<00:03:21.849> same<00:03:22.060> time<00:03:22.329> but<00:03:22.840> it's<00:03:22.989> something<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.410> do

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
the same time but it's something I do

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.130 
the same time but it's something I do
for<00:03:23.829> longevity<00:03:24.329> what<00:03:25.329> you<00:03:25.450> do<00:03:25.630> is<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:25.959> see<00:03:26.110> a

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
for longevity what you do is you see a

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.569 
for longevity what you do is you see a
lot<00:03:26.319> of<00:03:26.349> bodybuilders<00:03:26.860> come<00:03:27.069> in<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.370> squat

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
lot of bodybuilders come in and squat

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.120 
lot of bodybuilders come in and squat
like<00:03:27.700> this<00:03:27.760> solely<00:03:28.500> solely<00:03:29.500> for<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.860> quad

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
like this solely solely for the quad

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.160 
like this solely solely for the quad
development<00:03:30.640> which<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.090> fine<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:31.510> they<00:03:31.989> don't

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
development which is fine and they don't

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.629 
development which is fine and they don't
go<00:03:32.290> as<00:03:32.440> deep<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.980> again<00:03:33.250> that's<00:03:33.370> fine

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
go as deep and again that's fine

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.699 
go as deep and again that's fine
understand<00:03:34.120> why<00:03:34.299> they're<00:03:34.540> doing<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.810> they're

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
understand why they're doing it they're

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:36.809 
understand why they're doing it they're
not<00:03:35.799> doing<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.190> compete<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.579> power

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
not doing it to compete and power

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.789 
not doing it to compete and power
appearances<00:03:37.480> they're<00:03:38.230> doing<00:03:38.440> it<00:03:38.530> just<00:03:38.560> for

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
appearances they're doing it just for

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.539 
appearances they're doing it just for
the<00:03:38.889> quad<00:03:39.100> development<00:03:40.560> but<00:03:41.560> again<00:03:41.799> this<00:03:42.370> is

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
the quad development but again this is

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.009 
the quad development but again this is
something<00:03:42.730> I<00:03:42.880> do<00:03:43.060> lighter<00:03:43.329> than<00:03:43.540> powerfu

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
something I do lighter than powerfu

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.960 
something I do lighter than powerfu
squats<00:03:44.319> all<00:03:45.190> right<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.549> this<00:03:45.609> is<00:03:45.670> going<00:03:45.910> to

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
squats all right and this is going to

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.220 
squats all right and this is going to
strengthen<00:03:46.150> everything<00:03:46.450> else<00:03:46.690> because<00:03:47.109> it's

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
strengthen everything else because it's

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.170 
strengthen everything else because it's
not<00:03:47.380> about<00:03:47.560> just<00:03:47.739> building<00:03:47.920> muscle<00:03:48.400> get<00:03:48.940> build

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
not about just building muscle get build

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.030 
not about just building muscle get build
everything<00:03:49.510> all<00:03:50.440> right<00:03:50.530> that's<00:03:50.769> why<00:03:50.859> we're

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
everything all right that's why we're

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.319 
everything all right that's why we're
still<00:03:51.280> around<00:03:51.370> it's<00:03:51.730> why<00:03:51.850> we're<00:03:52.030> doing<00:03:52.150> it

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
still around it's why we're doing it

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.889 
still around it's why we're doing it
we're<00:03:52.450> having<00:03:52.840> fun<00:03:53.079> do<00:03:53.410> you<00:03:53.500> hear<00:03:53.739> me
