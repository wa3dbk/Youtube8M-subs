APM is concerned sure we have the the HK
pilot<00:00:48.750> 42<00:00:49.200> out<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:49.560> which<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.220> you<00:00:51.060> know

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
pilot 42 out there which is a you know

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.150 
pilot 42 out there which is a you know
in<00:00:51.630> regards<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:52.200> better<00:00:52.530> flight<00:00:52.800> controller

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
in regards a better flight controller

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.730 
in regards a better flight controller
but<00:00:53.510> thus<00:00:54.510> comes<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> price<00:00:55.110> tag<00:00:55.380> with<00:00:55.590> that

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
but thus comes the price tag with that

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
also got the new updated radio set now

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.999 
also got the new updated radio set now
it's<00:01:15.659> different<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.170> these<00:01:16.350> radio<00:01:16.710> sets

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it's different with these radio sets

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.859 
it's different with these radio sets
it's<00:01:17.310> Universal<00:01:17.909> between<00:01:18.240> ground<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.689> air

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
it's Universal between ground and air

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.569 
it's Universal between ground and air
modules<00:01:19.289> modules<00:01:19.890> meaning<00:01:20.219> that<00:01:20.340> both

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
modules modules meaning that both

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.779 
modules modules meaning that both
support<00:01:21.319> USB<00:01:22.319> as<00:01:22.710> well<00:01:23.039> as<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.609> are

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
support USB as well as you are

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:25.880 
support USB as well as you are
connections<00:01:24.359> so<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.929> can<00:01:25.109> use<00:01:25.259> them<00:01:25.499> whether

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
connections so you can use them whether

aircraft or switch and vice versa that
makes<00:01:29.399> it<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:29.759> easy<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.389> updating<00:01:30.869> as

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
makes it really easy for updating as

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.989 
makes it really easy for updating as
well<00:01:31.200> before<00:01:31.649> you<00:01:31.950> had<00:01:32.069> to<00:01:32.159> use<00:01:32.280> an<00:01:32.399> FTDI<00:01:32.850> to

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
well before you had to use an FTDI to

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:35.480 
well before you had to use an FTDI to
connect<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.960> air<00:01:34.139> module<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.889> computer

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
connect the air module to the computer

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.889 
connect the air module to the computer
and<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.700> them<00:01:35.789> updated<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.450> synced<00:01:36.780> and

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
and get them updated and synced and

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.289 
and get them updated and synced and
change<00:01:37.109> these<00:01:37.369> now<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:38.880> swap<00:01:39.060> them

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
change these now you can just swap them
