00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.759 
caught my attention it exposes a lot in
the<00:00:24.150> front<00:00:24.420> with<00:00:24.570> all<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.900> strap<00:00:25.170> detailing

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the front with all the strap detailing

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.370 
the front with all the strap detailing
along<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.250> chest<00:00:26.519> area<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.779> also<00:00:27.810> has<00:00:28.349> a

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
along the chest area and it also has a

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.640 
along the chest area and it also has a
ton<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.920> straps<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.820> back<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.349> really

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
ton of straps in the back so it really

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.709 
ton of straps in the back so it really
exposes<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.309> lot<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.759> skin<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:33.540> someone

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
exposes a lot of skin but for someone

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.440 
exposes a lot of skin but for someone
like<00:00:33.840> me<00:00:34.170> who's<00:00:34.410> smaller<00:00:34.710> on<00:00:34.950> top<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:36.059> top

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
like me who's smaller on top this top

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.020 
like me who's smaller on top this top
actually<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.050> don't<00:00:37.200> feel<00:00:37.440> any<00:00:38.040> less<00:00:38.399> naked<00:00:38.910> in

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
actually I don't feel any less naked in

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.540 
actually I don't feel any less naked in
it<00:00:39.149> than<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.450> would<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:40.110> any<00:00:40.559> other<00:00:40.680> crop<00:00:41.129> top<00:00:41.399> I

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
it than I would in any other crop top I

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.430 
it than I would in any other crop top I
own<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.790> actually<00:00:42.239> covers<00:00:42.570> more<00:00:42.809> skin<00:00:43.170> but

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
own that actually covers more skin but

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.979 
own that actually covers more skin but
it's<00:00:43.559> still<00:00:43.739> crop<00:00:44.070> if<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.850> makes<00:00:45.090> sense<00:00:45.210> you

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it's still crop if that makes sense you

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:46.910 
it's still crop if that makes sense you
don't<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.379> really<00:00:46.530> worry<00:00:46.620> about

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
don't have to really worry about

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.310 
don't have to really worry about
anything<00:00:47.309> popping<00:00:47.670> out<00:00:48.030> unless<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.690> have

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
anything popping out unless you have

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.590 
anything popping out unless you have
more<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.280> top<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.789> that's<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
more going on on top so that's the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.150 
more going on on top so that's the
benefit<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.050> guess<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.500> being<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:53.010> bit

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
benefit I guess of being a little bit

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.590 
benefit I guess of being a little bit
smaller<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.610> top<00:00:53.789> that's<00:00:54.000> one<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> pluses

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
smaller on top that's one of the pluses

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.450 
smaller on top that's one of the pluses
I<00:00:54.870> could<00:00:55.050> see<00:00:55.230> about<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.280> wear

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
I could see about it you can wear

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.060 
I could see about it you can wear
something<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.629> feel<00:00:57.960> still<00:00:58.680> sort

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
something like this and feel still sort

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.639 
something like this and feel still sort
of<00:00:59.129> boyish<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.789> tomboyish<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.050> dressed
