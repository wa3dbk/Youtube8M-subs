00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
right now it's going to drop us off and

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.530 
right now it's going to drop us off and
he's<00:02:57.890> going<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.130> be<00:02:58.280> warping<00:02:58.640> in<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.820> whole<00:02:59.180> lot

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
he's going to be warping in a whole lot

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.210 
he's going to be warping in a whole lot
of<00:02:59.630> +1<00:03:00.050> zealots<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.440> we<00:03:00.560> can<00:03:00.710> speed<00:03:00.890> this<00:03:01.010> one

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
of +1 zealots and we can speed this one

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.950 
of +1 zealots and we can speed this one
up<00:03:01.340> for<00:03:01.970> just<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.270> little<00:03:02.360> bit<00:03:02.600> and<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:02.840> will

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
up for just a little bit and you will

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.330 
up for just a little bit and you will
notice<00:03:03.290> probably<00:03:03.620> how<00:03:03.830> it's<00:03:04.010> gonna<00:03:04.100> go

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
notice probably how it's gonna go

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.040 
notice probably how it's gonna go
because<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.970> third<00:03:05.180> player<00:03:05.390> is<00:03:05.510> not<00:03:05.720> prepared

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
because the third player is not prepared

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.510 
because the third player is not prepared
for<00:03:06.110> it<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:06.530> was<00:03:06.650> pretty<00:03:06.860> much<00:03:07.010> unable<00:03:07.340> to

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
for it it was pretty much unable to

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.030 
for it it was pretty much unable to
scout<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.090> then<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:08.690> will<00:03:08.810> just<00:03:09.020> will<00:03:09.830> just

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
scout it and then it will just will just

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.680 
scout it and then it will just will just
simply<00:03:10.310> overrun<00:03:10.700> as<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.060> can<00:03:11.180> see<00:03:11.330> all<00:03:11.540> the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
simply overrun as you can see all the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.470 
simply overrun as you can see all the
workers<00:03:11.960> are<00:03:12.230> pretty<00:03:12.500> much<00:03:12.620> going<00:03:12.950> down<00:03:13.480> now

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
workers are pretty much going down now

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.729 
workers are pretty much going down now
since<00:03:14.750> we<00:03:14.900> are<00:03:14.989> pushing<00:03:15.230> with<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.470> lot<00:03:15.709> of

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
since we are pushing with a lot of

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.860 
since we are pushing with a lot of
zealots<00:03:16.040> are<00:03:16.250> only<00:03:16.400> two<00:03:16.730> immortals<00:03:17.300> we<00:03:17.510> are

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
zealots are only two immortals we are

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.080 
zealots are only two immortals we are
basically<00:03:18.470> not<00:03:18.890> needing<00:03:19.250> that<00:03:19.370> much<00:03:19.610> gas<00:03:19.880> at

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
basically not needing that much gas at

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.880 
basically not needing that much gas at
all<00:03:20.209> in<00:03:20.390> fact<00:03:20.630> we<00:03:20.750> are<00:03:20.840> only<00:03:20.989> going<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.410> get<00:03:21.590> one

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
all in fact we are only going to get one

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.729 
all in fact we are only going to get one
gas<00:03:22.160> for<00:03:22.489> this<00:03:22.610> entire<00:03:22.940> push<00:03:23.300> also<00:03:24.080> like<00:03:24.709> I

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
gas for this entire push also like I

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:25.990 
gas for this entire push also like I
mentioned<00:03:24.830> we<00:03:25.250> are<00:03:25.280> going<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.670> be<00:03:25.790> playing

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
mentioned we are going to be playing

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.850 
mentioned we are going to be playing
extremely<00:03:26.600> safe<00:03:26.900> so<00:03:27.110> we<00:03:27.230> don't<00:03:27.470> want<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.739> be

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
extremely safe so we don't want to be

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.190 
extremely safe so we don't want to be
dying<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.190> pretty<00:03:28.520> much<00:03:28.670> anything<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.870> know

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
dying to pretty much anything you know

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.990 
dying to pretty much anything you know
that<00:03:30.230> is<00:03:30.470> common<00:03:31.100> in<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.310> current<00:03:31.580> meta<00:03:31.730> game

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
that is common in the current meta game

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.720 
that is common in the current meta game
of<00:03:32.209> zerk<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:33.380> also<00:03:33.709> this<00:03:34.010> build<00:03:34.310> order<00:03:34.610> is

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
of zerk and also this build order is

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.160 
of zerk and also this build order is
relatively<00:03:35.180> easy<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.510> execute<00:03:35.870> because

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
relatively easy to execute because

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.290 
relatively easy to execute because
Nanoha<00:03:36.709> basically<00:03:37.250> sits<00:03:37.520> back<00:03:37.790> in<00:03:37.850> his<00:03:38.090> base

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
Nanoha basically sits back in his base

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.540 
Nanoha basically sits back in his base
and<00:03:38.540> he<00:03:39.140> plays<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.410> safely<00:03:39.920> but<00:03:40.040> he<00:03:40.190> does<00:03:40.370> not

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
and he plays it safely but he does not

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.820 
and he plays it safely but he does not
scout<00:03:40.790> he<00:03:40.970> does<00:03:41.180> not<00:03:41.360> do<00:03:41.510> much<00:03:41.780> at<00:03:41.989> all<00:03:42.110> and<00:03:42.290> so

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
scout he does not do much at all and so

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.250 
scout he does not do much at all and so
yeah<00:03:43.100> so<00:03:43.940> here<00:03:44.120> we<00:03:44.270> are<00:03:44.300> in<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.600> actual<00:03:44.959> build

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
yeah so here we are in the actual build

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.110 
yeah so here we are in the actual build
or<00:03:45.440> an<00:03:45.680> animal<00:03:45.980> opens<00:03:46.280> up<00:03:46.430> this<00:03:46.640> build<00:03:46.880> within

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
or an animal opens up this build within

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.479 
or an animal opens up this build within
nine<00:03:47.450> final<00:03:47.959> once<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.530> pile<00:03:48.739> of<00:03:48.890> finishes<00:03:49.310> he

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
nine final once the pile of finishes he

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.400 
nine final once the pile of finishes he
credibly<00:03:49.910> still<00:03:50.180> Nexus<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:50.660> he<00:03:50.750> obviously<00:03:50.930> is

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
credibly still Nexus and he obviously is

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.290 
credibly still Nexus and he obviously is
going<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.739> be<00:03:51.950> making<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.340> gateway<00:03:52.580> at<00:03:52.880> 13

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
going to be making a gateway at 13

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.600 
going to be making a gateway at 13
supply<00:03:53.630> 114<00:03:54.410> supply<00:03:54.680> he<00:03:54.950> will<00:03:55.100> be<00:03:55.220> taking<00:03:55.520> the

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
supply 114 supply he will be taking the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.060 
supply 114 supply he will be taking the
gas<00:03:55.760> geyser<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.750> a<00:03:57.380> little<00:03:57.680> bit<00:03:57.800> later<00:03:57.980> on

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
gas geyser and a little bit later on

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.770 
gas geyser and a little bit later on
sixteen<00:03:58.550> supply<00:03:58.850> he<00:03:59.060> will<00:03:59.150> actually<00:03:59.420> rally<00:03:59.660> a

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
sixteen supply he will actually rally a

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.330 
sixteen supply he will actually rally a
drone<00:04:00.020> from<00:04:00.200> an<00:04:00.380> axis<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:00.709> build<00:04:01.070> a<00:04:01.130> pile

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
drone from an axis and build a pile

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.640 
drone from an axis and build a pile
whatever<00:04:01.760> when<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.510> gas<00:04:02.690> guys<00:04:02.930> finishes<00:04:03.500> he

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
whatever when the gas guys finishes he

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.650 
whatever when the gas guys finishes he
instantly<00:04:03.950> puts<00:04:04.310> three<00:04:04.700> probes<00:04:05.060> right<00:04:05.540> in

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
instantly puts three probes right in

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.449 
instantly puts three probes right in
there<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.230> once<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.560> Gateway<00:04:06.769> finishes<00:04:07.340> he

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
there and once the Gateway finishes he

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.830 
there and once the Gateway finishes he
instantly<00:04:07.910> follows<00:04:08.390> it<00:04:08.510> up<00:04:08.600> with<00:04:08.660> a

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840

let this gateway finish up the zealot

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.060

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.890
