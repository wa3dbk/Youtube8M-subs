00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello here friendships bio cook 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.520
 mostly want to cool 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.670
 But before we have to grill you have to first 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.670
 come 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.830
 yes, to cook what absorbs 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.130
 then that 's the big difference 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.580
 To many things as salt comes to you 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.580
 prevent 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.430
 He gets much better and will 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.230
 So I think better sources of salt 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.170
 that would prevent the aid 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.199
 fruits for example believes the brush 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.199
 he breaks form from the field 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.520
 please do not just go wild from the field 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.550
 it is not allowed to pick it down 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.340
 mostly fodder corn and can do this 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.110
 naturally treated differently and then 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.800
 the end does not look like this one 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.800
 sugar corn 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.500
 Often you get your business 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.380
 pre-cooked nowadays already fed 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.520
 just as you would get it already plans for 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.100
 normal 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.020
 and then into the water the need in 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.210
 this size between 1 and one and a half 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.460
 The cook does not have to go around wildly for hours 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.880
 cook but slowly to himself 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.880
 simmer 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.440
 most of it is still whole now 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.000
 hoarse what you realize that you can 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.860
 a bit cleaned or tender as you will 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.640
 can also speak something out and it 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.170
 just try it 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.000
 It's easy for total grams 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.100
 picks up 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.400
 central is pure so a little time 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.400
 can 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.899
 and beautiful now first roasting of 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.899
 all sides 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.090
 now there is a nice roast from every side 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.030
 now comes the sentences with 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:22.750
 herbal butter dream as there is then yes 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.750
 really tasty apply again 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.730
 the flag for a bit down 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.700
 not taken that to irritate us now 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:39.060
 The butter does not taste good either 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:42.750
 probably no one has much garlic in it 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.290
 the robot 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.180
 our device offers from the tax office yes 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.470
 Unbelievable the herb butter to the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.120
 Of course you can also margareta 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.040
 do for those you like at wigan 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.600
