00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:25.830
 or howard I insight 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:27.320
 we go to jorge that has been reinforced very 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.000
 all right 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.000
 the measure of the interest was capped 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.510
 let's move on 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.039
 because this doing runs 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.070
 that is 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.550
 all the young man but is that not 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.550
 I get it 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.520
 my mother god 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:04.670
 defensive fit to bounce and orient 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.239
 perfect so that they do not arrive well 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.239
 salaries 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.800
 Now that you are entering with the bag 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.270
 I hate when they make porrones 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.870
 fuck how is it for 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.990
 the correct time is like that of the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.990
 athletic champions 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.799
 6 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.799
 that play is normal 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.240
 formally raise that active play but worse 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.240
 I find it very nervous 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.470
 thank goodness to mark two fingers and already turned off 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.470
 the console of victory to you 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:02.520
 I throw you fucking 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.520
 Man comes as we go down for 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.990
 this has been what the repetition leaves for 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.800
 golazo favor 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.800
 gross 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.080
 really what a disaster 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.740
 Play Maria Spears Count as Tyrant 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.180
 also his fucking time 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.180
 go to some for god they will go 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.700
 but when you do damage to 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.120
 here you have there all the time or not 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.560
 I understand a rejection for some no no 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.170
 other 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.670
 oh please if it's that in a drawer in the 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.439
 final is going to be the goal is that it's going to 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.170
 to drop the goal is that I'm looking at it already 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:51.170
 do not look at me another reject 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.380
 mine 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.110
 is that this time in part very clear that 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.060
 it has to be goal in the end uncle 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.060
 mother, how incredible 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.790
 I knew I did not take it with me 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.829

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.370

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:28.610

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.140

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:36.920

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.920

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.090

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.870
 Advocacy activity gratifies odious 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.300
 of the defense look that the defense that the 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.600
