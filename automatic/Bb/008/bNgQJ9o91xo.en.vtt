remember<00:00:25.560> when<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.740> was<00:00:25.920> looking<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.310> buy<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
remember when I was looking to buy a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.700 
remember when I was looking to buy a
ninja<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.330> heard<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> lot<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.080> things<00:00:28.230> oh<00:00:28.410> they

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
ninja I heard a lot of things oh they

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.269 
ninja I heard a lot of things oh they
can't<00:00:29.460> handle<00:00:29.609> highway<00:00:30.090> speeds<00:00:31.070> yada<00:00:32.070> yada

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
can't handle highway speeds yada yada

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.870 
can't handle highway speeds yada yada
yada<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.219> very<00:00:35.579> untrue

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.510 

I'm<00:00:41.390> not<00:00:41.540> too<00:00:41.720> far<00:00:41.930> from<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:42.200> highway<00:00:42.490> so<00:00:43.490> I

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
I'm not too far from the highway so I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.400 
I'm not too far from the highway so I
figured<00:00:43.880> I<00:00:43.970> could<00:00:44.000> start<00:00:44.630> the<00:00:44.750> video<00:00:44.840> here<00:00:45.260> at

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
figured I could start the video here at

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:54.310 
figured I could start the video here at
my<00:00:45.620> friend<00:00:45.890> Eric's<00:00:46.100> house<00:00:52.600> anyway<00:00:53.600> I<00:00:53.840> was

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
my friend Eric's house anyway I was

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.140 
my friend Eric's house anyway I was
always<00:00:54.440> looking<00:00:54.770> for<00:00:55.040> highway<00:00:55.490> videos<00:00:55.850> on

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
always looking for highway videos on

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.450 
always looking for highway videos on
ninja<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.720> 50s<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:57.410> it<00:00:57.920> wasn't<00:00:58.070> a<00:00:58.190> whole<00:00:58.280> lot

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
ninja to 50s and it wasn't a whole lot

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.030 
ninja to 50s and it wasn't a whole lot
of<00:00:58.489> them<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:58.970> I<00:00:59.320> guess<00:01:00.320> I'll<00:01:00.470> just<00:01:00.620> add<00:01:00.770> to<00:01:00.800> the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
of them so I guess I'll just add to the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.110 
of them so I guess I'll just add to the
handful<00:01:01.489> of<00:01:01.670> them<00:01:01.820> but<00:01:02.030> there<00:01:02.180> are<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:04.120> maybe

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
handful of them but there are and maybe

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.240 
handful of them but there are and maybe
this<00:01:05.390> will<00:01:05.540> help<00:01:05.570> some<00:01:06.050> of<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:06.290> guys<00:01:06.590> decide

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
this will help some of you guys decide

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.080 
this will help some of you guys decide
that<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.580> ninja<00:01:07.940> 250<00:01:08.330> is<00:01:08.479> a<00:01:08.780> good<00:01:09.290> choice<00:01:09.500> for<00:01:09.650> a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
that a ninja 250 is a good choice for a

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.580 
that a ninja 250 is a good choice for a
first<00:01:11.090> bike<00:01:12.880> because<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.150> can<00:01:14.390> in<00:01:14.570> fact<00:01:14.600> handle

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
first bike because it can in fact handle

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:24.230 
first bike because it can in fact handle
highway<00:01:15.830> speeds<00:01:16.130> more<00:01:16.520> than<00:01:16.670> handled

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
