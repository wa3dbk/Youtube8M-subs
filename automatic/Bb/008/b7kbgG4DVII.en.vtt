00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.569
 welcome back to damon knight let's start 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:14.219
 immediately we have to go to the world 4 island 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:15.780
 great concert we are 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.789
 at the beginning by concert one of the most ways 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.720
 short that between now you will find three 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.670
 usual levels 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.210
 ok first level is called city express 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.210
 let's start right away 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:39.320
 ok so many 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.380
 anyway even if a short video will do 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:04.690
 only this world has the vision a little 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.690
 strange for this that makes it beautiful 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.610
 I went through the palace 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.480
 this is the interesting thing 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.010
 however it should not be too much 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.280
 difficult as you have just seen why 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.720
 it's pretty easy 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.720
 yes I said it strangely though 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:44.280
 ok like this that this ex play does not 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.470
 it's very interesting and fairies you see 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.479
 also from the answer from revisits 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.590
 access the comments I like 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.939
 etc. etc. 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.929
 but as I told you, we were saying one 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.929
 substitute thing 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:13.680
 ok but somebody does not 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.640
 however recently it is good timid and i 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.640
 favorite 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.000
 go to bed nana nana st 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:56.499
 never finished 188 I would say that I put a 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.609
 some time because I braked the first one 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:03.939
 time, however, it was not too difficult 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:09.579
 this is the nice thing now is the 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:11.379
 flower well known weird strange that here 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.079
 there is nothing history about these 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.900
 levels will be less just for addition to 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.769
 here one of my sees you prefer them to 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.239
 more knight 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:25.540
 let's start right away on the tower 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:32.639
 watch out here is why 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.639
 attention the rhythm changes 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:48.010
 attention that I should jump to here 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.110
 just ghosts 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.730
 these are the most disgusting i 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:04:02.520
 enemies of everything here is the power 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:02.520
 will change you see for a while not really 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:16.030
 a cannes na na na na na though however i 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.489
 ghosts can be seen thanks 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.489
 in the shadow of this 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.930
 and the first time I can do 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.310
 something like this of the 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.310
 telemarket in the role of the red show 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:05:01.669
 nice 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:03.960
 ok you finished late good navan 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.449
 great as I have already said this world 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.749
 quite well though it's not too much 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.930
 difficult and inside there is one of mine 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:12.689
 levels 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.189
 indeed one of my favorite music pieces 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.930
 that of the clock tower because 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.520
 we should review later if not 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.430
 erro 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.830
 anyway we are done now we do 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.270
 the last level rooftop racing here not 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.889
 there are obviously in this world 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.599
 I mean hidden things like the river 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:34.259
 numerous as they are called so there is not 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:40.289
 worry about finding the pink river in 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:42.860
 this sense maybe objects from rastan e 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.860
 since the enemies 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:06:09.289
 here 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:06:11.469
 spiders and blue cue from nothing wow 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.469
 who is it 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.510
 you have to skip line 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.790
 to 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.210
 who is it 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.819
 Yes No 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:09.550
 yesterday though tan tan tan as a thing 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.099
 that I like about all levels 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:15.430
 armed and that usually most 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:18.280
 the less it always has the main jingle 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:20.590
 of the game that now is me 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:24.090
 it played the reason of course when 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:26.800
 I have to say something I feel a nanny 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:29.800
 there is always in all levels the 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:38.590
 most at least three in note bosses 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:40.300
 real fine world passed if it is a 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.310
 in fact, this is a fairly brief world 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.500
 video is quite short but it doesn't matter 

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:49.020
 I finished this so I'll see you there 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.020
