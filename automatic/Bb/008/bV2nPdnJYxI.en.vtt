00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 but really what was a drama for 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.960
 moments was the low level of ramirez and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.280
 crossed not to me it surprised me a lot says 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.620
 actually it was a topic that 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.849
 they were bad 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.580
 but have a theme that they were going with 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.990
 the heavy what were not fine I 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.240
 that are not happening to you there I think that 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.279
 indeed if he has weighed them he was 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.990
 thinking and did not come acting consider yourself 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.210
 Ramirez Room If you were Ponte Preta, you 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.220
 are you pondering in the paulista right now what 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.320
 that is different is another type of 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.439
 regional police radars in regional 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.260
 and this and has caused sanctions two 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.329
 5 unusual parties and there just is not 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.309
 surrendering but the same is not in does not have 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.200
 the streak of matches that should 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.450
 have a selected player can not 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.420
 That aside I think so because there 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.750
 in that line in that first line 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.100
 core that in another party has been 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.840
 probably the one that had the most 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.079
 incidence even though it has no renown 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.610
 as farfán pizarro in this case and not 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.430
 was hooked in the first stage and 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.649
 that's why chile dominated because it did not have 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.220
 almost the entire position of the party with 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.409
 Chile plays a good game, says player 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.420
 what 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.710
 what hands we are is a good match 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.450
 shas chile knew san pablo is a 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.450
 scholar understood how how are we going to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.680
 play us there is not bird not those three that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.470
 so well it was not for example against 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.080
 Argentina but I calculate that that's already happening 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.729
 and put a team that attacked the time 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.659
 ability so that in those three more are 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.090
 counting and taking into account that 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.590
 we had crossed, he comes playing us a lot 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.869
 that the one who removes most actually this one 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.130
 the half court Chile wins and from 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.740
 there it becomes obviously 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.479
 dominator then the change is coming 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.490
 we are going to analyze it in a moment of 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.320
 Mariño where is the most feels the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.270
 peru flyer and from there changed 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.950
 crossed attitude he not used to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.970
 have a good rhythm almost all 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.130
 parties there are not these people were 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.020
 Obviously, a fall or a fall in 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.319
 level or a football downturn in this 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.090
 moment there obviously involved 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.280
 much element in taking it as a 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.619
 appearance low on the spot the same with 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.600
 ramírez not so much with lobatón because 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.619
 it was initially said that but I was going to 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.140
 you walk in possession which moved more 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.420
 not in recovery nevertheless lobatón 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.679
 he was wrong too much in the plus factor 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:18.769
 what I had to 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:18.769
 take steps in such a delicate position 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.390
 carmona carlos carmona who played for me 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.819
 well in chile but he had it as crazy in 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.629
 that sector and good not to mention Sanchez 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.700
 that although it did not stand out at all 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.609
 it exploded but but they their little things and 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.200
 he also did not handle it not you but covering 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.569
 in some way lobatón is not why that 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.920
 an achievement of his passes is coming 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.950
 that they had to have another destiny that 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.359
 they end up being wrong and out there I 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.099
 I think it goes beyond what it was 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.919
 conditioned with the marias staying 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.629
 early on what would you dial 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:55.430
 not to change it p certainly was 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.430
 fulfilling an evil a bad job
