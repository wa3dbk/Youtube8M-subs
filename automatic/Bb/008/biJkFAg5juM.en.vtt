00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.000
 Before coming here, I was hoping to call the Jornal Nacional and see Willian Bonner talking: 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 "Good Night, dies of overdose so-and-so ..." 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.700
 And I was very sad to hope for such a bad thing, to cheer over an overdose .. 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.900
 But then I remembered that I already twisted for worse ... 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.700
 I'm Basque. 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.600
 And by the way, there's a lot of Basque at the Plateia, is there? 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.700
 Oh, you have not. 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.700
 Po, too bad, I was going to talk about drugs. 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.700
 And there are several types of drug addicts: There are those who spend a day in a row to buy drugs 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.700
 Months collecting money to buy this shit that ends the life that are: 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.700
 Fans of Justin Bieber. 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.700
 And speaking of gays. 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700
 It seems that Justin Bieber used cocaine. 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.700
 I was very sad to know that. Very sad, really disappointed. I hope from the bottom of my heart that 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.700
 Cocaine comes out of it. Because... 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.700
 Cocaine has been much better. 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
 Kurt Cobain, Charlie Sheen, Amy Winehouse, Cherokee ... 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.700
 Cry. 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.700
 And for those who do not know cocaine is that white drug that the guy makes a career and then ... 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.700
 SHUUUUU! 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 Even the Chorão, died in the middle of his career. 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700
 This really takes time. 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.700
 Now Amy Winehouse was fucking because in addition to using cocaine, she still respected the bible. 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.700
 Because "I came from the dust and to the dust I will return." 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 Her make-up artists did not like it very much because before she got into the show she was going through a lot of dust. 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 But I'm going to talk about all kinds of drugs, right? There is one that .. 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.100
 The guy when he's stoned talks a lot of shit, yell! 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.400
 They think they own the truth, steal families 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
 That they are the Shepherds. 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.400
 And there are the potmen too. 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400
 And everyone knows a guy who smokes marijuana 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.900
 And when I met them it was a very good time of my life. 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.600
 For example, it was at this time that I lost my virginity ... 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.900
 Anal. 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.900
 And I received many positive results 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.900
 Yes, I contracted AIDS. 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.900
 And I asked them a lot of advice ... 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.900
 Dude, do you think I should enroll in Calculus II? 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.900
 And he would look at me: "HAND ... 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.900
 REGISTRATION!" 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.900
 Then I went there and enrolled in the calculus chair, thanks to him. I went there... 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.500
 I enrolled. 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.500
 Then I said, "Dude, thanks to you I enrolled in the calculus chair." 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.500
 What chair? 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.900
 Of calculation! 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.900
 REGISTRATION! 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.900
 And it's a shame that one of my friends who smoked marijuana ended up going to crack. 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.900
 And when he started consuming stone, he lost a lot of weight 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.900
 He was 2 feet tall, 120 pounds. 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.900
 On the other day he had 110 .. 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.900
 After 100 ... 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.900
 After 90 ... 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.900
 After 80 ... 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.900
 And I looked at him and said "Dude, stop it. Does the crack make you happy?" 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.700
 "Yes, man, crack makes me happy ... 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.900
 And being happy consumes me. " 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.900
 At the height of his addiction it was so heavy that ... 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.900
 At the height of the addiction if I took out paper or scissors, put stone, he smoked my hand. 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.500
 Too bad one of my friends ended up going to a worse drug. 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.900
 And no, it's not Calypso. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.900
 He ended up consuming heroin. 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.900
 And for those who do not know heroin is the most dangerous and violent drug in the world! 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.900
 After that he started to consume heroin. 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.300
 He sold everything to buy drugs. 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.500
 He sold house, car, television, bed ... 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.300
 He sold it to his mother. 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.300
 And he was very close to his mother. 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.300
 I remember one day from his mother's birthday. 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.300
 That he bought a picture frame from him with his mother. 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.300
 And he put a caption, embraced: 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.300
 "MY MOM, 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.300
 MY HERO." 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.300
 Ow, I'm asking you guys not to use drugs today. 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.300
 It's something that's good, but it goes fast. And it does not make you happy. 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.300
 It's like, premature ejaculation. 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.800
 And this kind of "junkie" thinking, that kind of playful thinking. 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.200
 It turns Brazil into what it is today. 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.200
 Not that Brazil has much drugged, nothing sees. 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.200
 But Brazil has a lot of bad things, like: Dilma. 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.200
 And ends up generating a lot of prejudice. 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.200
 For example, everything will cross a street. 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.200
 Here comes a guy with Flemish shirt. 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.200
 There you go across the street. 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.200
 Nothing to see. But there is this prejudice! 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.200
 He's coming at night and he's wearing a hat. 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.200
 And one has nothing to see. 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.200
 Just because he has a cap, just because he's wearing a Flemish shirt, 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.800
 Just because he's carrying a gun. You have nothing to do! 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.800
 Sorry, flamenguistas. 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.800
 Are there any flamenguists here? 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.800
 Eta, damn it. Or so many people! 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.800
 My God... 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.800
 Conditional! 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.800
 Yes, people. Thank you! 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.800
