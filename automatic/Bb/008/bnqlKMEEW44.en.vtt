00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello hello but bitch then 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.509
 I hope you are well 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.790
 today so a video hall on a 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.059
 site that so I was asked to 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.389
 test which is the site pink wales and 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.460
 so I was told to choose so 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.439
 several products on the site and from 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.779
 test and talk about it then I'm going to you 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.199
 so talk about it today so this site 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.000
 the propose in so what is different 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.140
 other sites so let's say between 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.060
 Chinese quotation marks because they are 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.009
 almost all Chinese is that they 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.230
 offer vintage clothes and that 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.630
 frankly I really like you and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.420
 vintage skirts and vintage dresses 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.149
 what other people do not propose 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.579
 other sites such as upright 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.440
 than others so I'm going to you 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.239
 therefore already present the accessories 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.930
 bought on the site and you talk about it 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.820
 so already this package that I carry you 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.350
 ask a little closer the veil has 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.020
 sent he is really very very very 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.049
 pretty colors in pastel that 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.460
 I actually like it so I like the only 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.340
 problem with the accessories is that they 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.320
 are very beautiful but the quality is not 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.900
 really not at the rendezvous me this one 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.180
 I received them from facts here at the level 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.430
 of the wire I received so after a little one a 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.189
 p'tit hughie pernici who had 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.780
 so take off there by wanting to do it 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.540
 but for example the closure is part 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.060
 in the hands form brief that's it 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.050
 this sister are pretty but here after 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.800
 certainly not going a quality 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.840
 really top 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.000
 I showed you in a row life 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.050
 strong so to another note also appeared 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.400
 I bought on the site 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.680
 it's that part so there you have 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.240
 found really pretty so so like 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.540
 you see it is missing of course a small 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.750
 end here so that was so high up 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.180
 level request of the receipt of the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.500
 parcel so here I am really 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.780
 beautiful the colors are really 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.410
 very beautiful so when it sat me 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.570
 reminds a little 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.370
 rio de janeiro month its colors there is 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.440
 what I found to see more beautiful and 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.320
 more beautiful is the ring and you 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.520
 have talked a lot about housing 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.710
 there when I wanted to show the video 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.540
 I had talked a lot about it and I found 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.670
 just too beautiful she is really 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.200
 loaded so there is no need to wear another 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.850
 thing on the fingers when you put 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.680
 she is really very pretty 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.530
 always result in accessories 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.260
 I also wanted to test this pretty ring 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.140
 there so I was not born mini 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.070
 gbagbo is this one if it is she is 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.980
 crown-shaped 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.900
 so here I show it to you she is 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.700
 really very very fine very small and I 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.769
 find it really pretty so see 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.810
 is full it's a little crown 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.190
 like that after bomb after you 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.630
 choose the finger or wanted to 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.790
 where is the hand on just on the phalanx 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.390
 like that you can also insert 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.390
 in the finger 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.090
 so in the little finger like this and 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.189
 I find them very very beautiful 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.030
 steel a little aged you know and 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:59.400
 then I also wanted to test because 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.950
 that I have almost no fossils 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.349
 including cider pebbles of course all 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.790
 the Chinese sites proposed fossils then 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.440
 what I like of course these fossils there 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.019
 they do not have thick edges 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.060
 the ridge is really very very thin and 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.129
 so they come to ask themselves very 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.780
 naturally on the eyes I you 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.170
 anyway put the link may 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.200
 did you went to see the price there 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.579
 two four six eight ten pairs and that 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.540
 must really really cost really 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.459
 I go back in two years 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.650
 around 2 or 3 dollars when I pass 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.659
 then to the clothes so I did not take 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.700
 only one outfit we will say one 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.889
 piece but I really find it 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.769

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:47.790

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.720

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.730

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.800

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.870
 fall of the shirt and that's the not so 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.700

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.130
 worn with a skirt really very very 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.570

 Rossdale girls site so I have not 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.230
 bought a lot of I did not choose 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.090
 a lot of articles on it that's what 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.070
 I say it is that it depends 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.050
 also it's like in drastic dr 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.960

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.540

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.260
 et cetera but I tell you the most 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.090
 of this site it's really the side 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.640
 vintage so this vintage part they 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.680
 so have to change all the 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.600
 outfits that we can see so that's fine 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.150
 sometimes to mix a vintage piece 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.160
 more modern dps and so it's me 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.100
