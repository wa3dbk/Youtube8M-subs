00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.629
 we spent the last year creating 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.639
 second version of the kit for 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.320
 developers he will bring us closer to that 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.240
 what kind of consumer do we want 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.400
 version and which will allow developers 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.320
 create games with the best feeling from 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.180
 virtual reality 2 dev kit 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.320
 has a lot of improvement aimed at 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.510
 mainly comfort and feel 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.789
 presence sense of presence 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.590
 virtual reality is something completely 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.210
 perhaps the first new virtual 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.039
 surrounded by your brain will feel 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.840
 yourself comfortable you know it's not 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.579
 reality but very much like her 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.219
 thanks to this version we have become much 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.380
 closer to the goal dev kit 2 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.300
 has a smaller delay more frequency 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.070
 higher resolution frames and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.410
 less inertia along with 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.020
 full head tracking 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.140
 all this gives a greater effect of immersion in 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.210
 gameplay dev kit 2 allows 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.190
 track head position with accuracy 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.260
 up to a millimeter which means that your 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.100
 look will always be sent wherever 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.329
 you want them 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.149
 now you have the opportunity 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.800
 lean back and forth and look out 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.500
 because of the angle it greatly expands 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.619
 gaming capabilities and radically changes 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.720
 content development approach is another 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.640
 a significant improvement is the use 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.380
 low inertia screen this 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.509
 the display only shows the picture 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.280
 short time then screen 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.200
 darkens until the next frame 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.790
 it happens very often and in 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.799
 As a result, your brain does not notice 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.380
 blur and shake pictures 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.990
 two years ago I thought that all of us 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.210
 need this fast pixels and get 120 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.890
 Herz oled screen we have achieved this 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.600
 it was very interesting to see 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.340
 research shaft which clearly 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.280
 showed the benefits of using 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.170
 low inertia display also we 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.060
 significantly reduced our latency 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.340
 systems thanks to code optimization 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.710
 video signal and screen enhancement 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.420
 the original byfleet gave out 60 fps not 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.549
 because it was enough for 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.500
 comfortable immersion in the game but because 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.479
 that it was the best display at the time 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.340
 now we use the oled screen with 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.710
 high frame rate and difference 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.270
 really huge detective 2 became 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.850
 better not thanks to any particular 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.740
 Aspect is a combination of all the new features. 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.570
 which allows you to raise the feeling of 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.759
 games on a completely different level 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.439
 we spent the last years figuring out 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.209
 what should be virtual reality 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.799
 for the user and now we know 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.959
 everyone in the apple company is committed 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.390
 create better in the world of technology 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.189
 virtual reality one of the main 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.439
 directions in the act of luz this association 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.299
 the smartest people in the world we work on 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.159
 software and hardware we have 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.989
 have their own infrastructure designers 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.760
 the only way by which 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.890
 we can bring you virtual 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.239
 reality is the desire to lure the most 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.430
 the best people in the industry 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.230
 I think the main reason is that 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.209
 virtual reality did not develop 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.069
 recent years is that 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.870
 never before the right people 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.760
 got together to solve this 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.069
 problem i think is achilles 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.989
 we managed to do this from different genres 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.150
 the world's best developers of outstanding 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.079
 talents to create something about what you even 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.909
 could not think 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.010
 virtual reality communities 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.230
 stronger than ever and we have not achieved 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.150
 would all of this be created without you 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.889
 hundreds of virtual realities behind 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.299
 last year added more content 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:08.069
 than in the last 20 years everything is always 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.409
 starts with small teams which 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.569
 going and doing something inconceivably 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:15.419
 cool and that later becomes the standard 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:19.910
 for all we can not wait to learn 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.910
 impression of people from these new features
