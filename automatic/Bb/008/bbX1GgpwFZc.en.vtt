00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.900
I was a bit nervous, not too much.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:37.880
I don't think I thought of anything other than the routine.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.600
This is a short program, so I will do three jumps,
three spins and two steps.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.400
I am about to do the most important jump now.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.769
I feel like I am doing live broadcasting.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:19.400
My team was discussing the theme
and my choreographer David Wilson

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:32.100
suggested James Bond,so we thought 
it would be unique and nice to give it a try.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.990
I am doing steps. At this stage I am relieved and more relaxed,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.200
than before because I had already
succeeded in all the important moves.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.800
But just in case, I am focusing on not making any mistakes.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.900
I slightly stumbled here.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.050
This is the last spin that I am focusing on now.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.960
This spin can affect the result.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.900
Sometimes the smallest difference
 in the score decides winning or losing.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.000
So I have to stay focused to the last minute.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.200
The last scene is very important because 
it always remains a strong image,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:12.150
so every figure skater in all programs decide on the last move carefully.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:20.000
Originally it wasn't the move I was going to do, 
until this move was confirmed

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:28.100
there were so many changes. 
I realized after the competition it had become famous.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.110
A fan threw a stuffed animal for me.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.200
I am not sure where it is, but I know I have it.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:48.100
Because I knew Asada Mao already had a good score,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:56.800
I felt nervous in case of anything although I knew had done well.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.100
I had done all I could, so I thought I had won,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.100
but I wasn't sure I won, until it was confirmed.
