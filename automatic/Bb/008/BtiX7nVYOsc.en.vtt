00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.860
 here 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.459
 very good to all be all 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.550
 welcome to a new video tutorial on 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.740
 the one that I'm going to show you how to create 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.020
 automatic plots in our 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.970
 book servers and then what are we going to 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.579
 need would be three plugins the wardi 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.779
 woorward and the simple market region and 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.010
 Well, the plans will be in the 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.010
 description of the video only the 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.690
 download and put them in the folder that 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.830
 it is called plugins of our server 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.750
 bukit and now we go to once posts 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.300
 the projects in the room or to take out the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.360
 ax a wooden ax and we will create 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.920
 a region we are going to put here like this 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.300
 concludes left on one on one side and 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.300
 with a right click on the other 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.790
 already 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.060
 now let's use the expand command 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.060
 vert 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.600
 and to expand see if we are going to expand 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:09.580
 Now let's give it a name and let's 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.520
 put region defines for example test 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.159
 test 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.159
 now we are going to the religion priority 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:26.189
 priority of priority region 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.189
 1 priority 0 test 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.259
 to see region priority test this 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.580
 region priority test and launch 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.920
 zero priority now and as you will see and 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.780
 putting region priority test and you 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.680
 we put the priority that would be 0 which is 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.720
 what will remain here and good now once 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.479
 defined what this would be already this 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.220
 city and here everything would be protected 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.280
 but now how do you want to do 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.979
 win permissions only in this part to a 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.319
 user and that is fully automatic 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.330
 now let's go marking what would be 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.750
 our little plot we will see again 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.560
 expand bert expand bert and we're going to 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.120
 put region defines the name that 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.120
 we want for example plot 1 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:26.090
 when I can not get that 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.850
 house 1 and it would be home or not but before 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.600
 that everything would have to put region 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.080
 priority 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.790
 region priority house 1 and the and we're going to 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.590
 give priority 1 for users 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.900
 when the purchase in can destroy or if 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.650
 no they can not we will put house 1 and you 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.660
 we give priority 1 then once done 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.630
 these two for these steps we are going to 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.730
 grab a sign and we will use these 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.730
 things we put the sign where we give the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.120
 gift won 'and we come here for 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.580
 good example to put them the one that means 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.310
 sell in square brackets and let's put 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.710
 the name house one that I named the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.750
 region like this and we're going to put a price per 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.690
 thousand example 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.430
 and this is going to come out then now 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.680
 when a user wants to come can 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.410
 grab I have to be in surval for 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.940
 do that comes right clicks and 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.890
 buy the house 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.170
 and because the user will not be able to damage what 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.790
 which is outside but only inside but if 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.490
 We would not give priority to give us a 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.160
 bug and it can not hurt it will not let 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.530
 to damage 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.730
 and well let's do how and so can 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.990
 keep doing with others for 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.460
 example we will be able to make another 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.460
 not just an expand vert 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:48.300
 expand and let's put region defines 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.220
 house a house 2 we can not put any 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.230
 region defines married and they have already 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.780
 named married to this one now we're going to 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.510
 put priority region married and we're going 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.580
 to give priority 1 now yes once done 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.680
 this we can come here and calm or 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.780
 anywhere for example in the 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.040
 entrance to the city there is dinner already 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.480
 example here that is the city to the 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.860
 the city responds and we put 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.860
 here cel 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.680
 is house 1 and house not married and you 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.269
 let's sell in thousand for example 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.430
 we can put what we give the 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.550
 win until like this and I will sell to 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.550
 that price 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.930
 and well now we would say right click 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.000
 I have no money, I 'm going to set my goal 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.710
 shit I have no money at any time 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.710
 fastest diamond 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.010
 let's get him 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.470
 and I'm going to sell already once this is done 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.470
 we can buy 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.090
 I will have put so expensive 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.470
 ready now we are going to join here 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.360
 we can survive and someone comes by 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.080
 example and says hala 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.580
 here is plots and right click 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.830
 shit because I put so expensive 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.330
 I do not have money then I hope in a 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:24.030
 moment I do not know again be married and 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.640
 we are going to sell in 12 thousand 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.460
 and then I came to link he clicks 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.900
 right and buy the plot well of 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.340
 easy they can do shares to the most 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.800
 great I've done this just from 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.490
 proof I'm going to show you the city that 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.490
 there is in this server 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.930
 that is, once someone buys 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:45.560
 can only damage this and for example if 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.300
 they want to delete because they only put region 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.270
 remove and for example I do not think like the 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.569
 name to this test test and I already 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:59.039
 erase this is already the name house 1 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:01.080
 region removes house 1 and region removes 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.920
 married like that because although someone is no longer 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.970
 nothing happens, no problem 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.970
 I'm going to leave this 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.860
 and ready must be caught so well 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.860
 and well I will go here 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.000
 here 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.690
 and we are going to damage this portal that no longer 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.690
 I need 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:29.460
 and we'll leave law for a moment 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.460
 and let's see the city 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.380
 as you will see maybe the city that we have 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.380
 on this server 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:42.010
 the plots are made with word and all 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.410
 and nothing when someone wants to buy a 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:47.470
 plot so here on this server 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:49.510
 the plots cost 100 thousand so 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.120
 they work enough to have a plot 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:55.910
 and they are put here but for now 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.590
 they are exhausted I would have to go do more 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.660
 and this has been the whole tutorial of the day 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.490
 today I hope you liked the 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.330
 plugin still has more things for 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:08.480
 teach how for example you can rent 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.830
 make auctions with this plugin but only 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.970
 what vÃ©lez came to teach was 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.930
 basically the protein protection 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:18.500
 protect your house 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:20.830
 let's say creation of plots and so on 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.140
 it's pretty easy 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:26.110
 and well if I can in another tutorial I already 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:28.900
 I'll be bringing how to do that rent 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:31.040
 to ask this question of what they are 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.800
 Hotels 

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.830
 because when a server is something like 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.990
 I tell them something expensive the plots are 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.790
 they make hotels and then a user goes and 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.940
 just right click on a 

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:46.040
 poster and buy the as you do not buy it 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.290
 but rent for a certain time what 

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.600
 that is a quarter and there you can save your 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.910
 things and so on 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.180
 and nothing I think this is that is all the 

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.290
 today I hope you liked it 

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.580
 ip of the server in the description of 

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:02.710
 video 

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.710
 and see you bye
