really<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.700> know<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:29.909> awful<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.360> put

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
really you know it's awful that they put

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.580 
really you know it's awful that they put
this<00:01:30.600> out<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.200> think<00:01:31.290> it's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
this out there and I think it's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.830 
this out there and I think it's
horrendous<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.030> their<00:01:33.240> minds<00:01:33.479> are<00:01:33.630> like

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
horrendous but in their minds are like

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.270 
horrendous but in their minds are like
yeah<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.710> away<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.250> some

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
yeah we can get away with that with some

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.359 
yeah we can get away with that with some
PR<00:01:35.729> afterward<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.890> yeah<00:01:37.890> no<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.100> definitely

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
PR afterward I yeah no I definitely

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.710 
PR afterward I yeah no I definitely
think<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.000> they<00:01:39.180> thought<00:01:39.329> they<00:01:39.509> could<00:01:39.659> get

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
think that they thought they could get

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.870 
think that they thought they could get
away<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.409> think<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.950> 100%<00:01:41.490> to

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
away with it but I think this is 100% to

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.429 
away with it but I think this is 100% to
generate<00:01:42.210> publicity<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.899> their<00:01:43.049> company

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
generate publicity for their company

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.840 
generate publicity for their company
which<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.710> by<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.860> way<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.340> believe<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
which is by the way I believe in the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.090 
which is by the way I believe in the
last<00:01:45.000> quarter<00:01:45.329> their<00:01:45.540> sales<00:01:45.810> slipped<00:01:46.170> by<00:01:46.320> 7.3

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
last quarter their sales slipped by 7.3

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.289 
last quarter their sales slipped by 7.3
percent<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.610> they're<00:01:47.759> having<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.090> hard<00:01:48.240> time

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
percent like they're having a hard time

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.600 
percent like they're having a hard time
perhaps<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.500> they're<00:01:49.710> most<00:01:49.950> associated

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
perhaps because they're most associated

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.999 
perhaps because they're most associated
in<00:01:50.880> our<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.780> collective<00:01:52.350> consciousness<00:01:52.770> as

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
in our like collective consciousness as

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.859 
in our like collective consciousness as
the<00:01:53.460> company<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.000> tries<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.299> piss<00:01:54.689> people

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.080 
the company that tries to piss people
off<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.920> think<00:01:56.399> they<00:01:56.520> had<00:01:56.700> shirt<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.060> just

off but I think they had shirt that just

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.810 
off but I think they had shirt that just
said<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.570> depression<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.649> one<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.640> was

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
hurts the Kent State community today

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.339 
hurts the Kent State community today
there's<00:02:59.480> almost<00:02:59.569> certainly<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.049> case<00:03:00.169> you

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
there's almost certainly the case you

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.319 
there's almost certainly the case you
can't<00:03:00.560> go<00:03:00.799> to<00:03:00.859> Kent<00:03:01.310> State<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.790> not<00:03:01.969> think

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
can't go to Kent State and not think

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:03.429 
can't go to Kent State and not think
about<00:03:02.419> the<00:03:02.659> massacre<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.019> happened<00:03:03.349> there

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:03.439 
about the massacre that happened there

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.720 
about the massacre that happened there
just<00:03:03.680> like<00:03:03.799> at<00:03:03.950> ut-austin

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
just like at ut-austin

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.599 
just like at ut-austin
you<00:03:05.030> can't<00:03:05.209> go<00:03:05.359> there<00:03:05.599> and<00:03:05.629> see<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:07.040> tower<00:03:07.280> and

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
you can't go there and see the tower and

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:08.979 
you can't go there and see the tower and
not<00:03:07.669> think<00:03:08.060> about<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.359> shooting<00:03:08.659> from<00:03:08.840> there

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
not think about the shooting from there

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.270 
not think about the shooting from there
like<00:03:09.200> these<00:03:09.349> things<00:03:09.650> linger<00:03:10.069> in<00:03:10.159> our

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
like these things linger in our

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.920 
like these things linger in our
collective<00:03:10.609> consciousness<00:03:10.819> and<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.840> is

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
collective consciousness and it is

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.390 
collective consciousness and it is
ridiculous<00:03:12.439> they're<00:03:12.709> using<00:03:13.069> it<00:03:13.129> to<00:03:13.159> try<00:03:13.340> to

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
ridiculous they're using it to try to

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.099 
ridiculous they're using it to try to
sell<00:03:13.639> their<00:03:13.819> shitty<00:03:14.030> low<00:03:14.180> sweatshirts<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:14.719> my

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
sell their shitty low sweatshirts and my

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.229 
sell their shitty low sweatshirts and my
thought<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.439> like<00:03:15.469> I<00:03:15.769> don't<00:03:16.010> so<00:03:16.790> look<00:03:17.060> I<00:03:17.209> think

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
thought is like I don't so look I think

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.969 
thought is like I don't so look I think
that<00:03:17.449> urban<00:03:17.810> outfitters<00:03:18.229> is<00:03:18.349> a<00:03:18.379> company<00:03:18.739> could

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:18.979 
that urban outfitters is a company could

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:19.869 
that urban outfitters is a company could
have<00:03:19.069> taken<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.370> completely<00:03:19.760> different

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
have taken a completely different

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.189 
have taken a completely different
approach<00:03:20.209> they<00:03:20.479> could<00:03:20.599> have<00:03:20.690> said<00:03:20.840> we're

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:21.199 
approach they could have said we're

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.289 
approach they could have said we're
making<00:03:21.919> this<00:03:22.069> sweatshirt<00:03:22.609> too<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.090> somehow

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
making this sweatshirt too and somehow

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.180 
making this sweatshirt too and somehow
to<00:03:23.840> somehow<00:03:24.109> bring<00:03:24.379> awareness<00:03:24.709> there<00:03:25.099> would

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
to somehow bring awareness there would

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.610 
to somehow bring awareness there would
happen<00:03:25.459> in<00:03:25.549> 1970<00:03:26.359> at<00:03:26.479> Kent<00:03:26.690> State<00:03:26.780> but<00:03:27.290> instead

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
happen in 1970 at Kent State but instead

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.559 
happen in 1970 at Kent State but instead
they<00:03:27.799> denied<00:03:28.190> it<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:28.579> think<00:03:28.639> that's<00:03:28.879> really

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
they denied it and I think that's really

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.000 
they denied it and I think that's really
what's<00:03:29.750> troubling<00:03:29.959> for<00:03:30.319> me<00:03:30.379> like<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.739> can

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
what's troubling for me like you can

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.759 
what's troubling for me like you can
make<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.250> mistake<00:03:31.459> and<00:03:31.909> they<00:03:32.060> can<00:03:32.239> make<00:03:32.389> a

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
make a mistake and they can make a

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.500 
make a mistake and they can make a
sweatshirt<00:03:33.769> or<00:03:33.919> whatever<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:35.090> isn't

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
sweatshirt or whatever that isn't

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.210 
sweatshirt or whatever that isn't
appropriate<00:03:35.780> because<00:03:36.650> you're<00:03:36.949> trying<00:03:37.159> to

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
appropriate because you're trying to

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.589 
appropriate because you're trying to
raise<00:03:37.370> awareness<00:03:37.519> for<00:03:37.909> a<00:03:37.939> cost<00:03:38.150> but<00:03:38.359> here

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
raise awareness for a cost but here

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.750 
raise awareness for a cost but here
they're<00:03:39.229> flat-out<00:03:39.829> denying<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.489> it<00:03:40.639> had

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
they're flat-out denying that it had

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.009 
they're flat-out denying that it had
anything<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.120> do<00:03:41.329> with<00:03:41.359> it<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.689> I'm<00:03:41.780> sorry

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
anything to do with it and I'm sorry

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.409 
anything to do with it and I'm sorry
when<00:03:42.349> it<00:03:42.439> yeah<00:03:42.979> it's<00:03:43.519> too<00:03:43.970> much<00:03:44.209> of<00:03:44.239> a

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
when it yeah it's too much of a

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.479 
when it yeah it's too much of a
coincidence<00:03:44.599> that<00:03:45.079> it's<00:03:45.319> a<00:03:45.439> red<00:03:45.919> sweatshirt

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
coincidence that it's a red sweatshirt

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.610 
coincidence that it's a red sweatshirt
that<00:03:46.729> looks<00:03:47.449> like<00:03:47.629> it<00:03:47.780> has<00:03:47.900> blood<00:03:48.139> on<00:03:48.199> it<00:03:48.409> that

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
that looks like it has blood on it that

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.229 
that looks like it has blood on it that
just<00:03:48.859> so<00:03:49.009> happened<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.519> be<00:03:49.669> from<00:03:49.879> Kent<00:03:50.150> State

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
just so happened to be from Kent State

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.599 
just so happened to be from Kent State
it<00:03:50.540> has<00:03:50.659> his<00:03:50.870> yeah<00:03:51.769> yeah<00:03:52.099> look<00:03:52.340> if<00:03:52.459> they've

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
it has his yeah yeah look if they've

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.369 
it has his yeah yeah look if they've
done<00:03:52.639> the<00:03:53.030> strategy<00:03:53.389> look<00:03:53.659> I<00:03:53.930> could

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
done the strategy look I could

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:55.809 
done the strategy look I could
understand<00:03:54.769> a<00:03:54.799> company<00:03:55.099> trying<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.459> do<00:03:55.639> that

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
understand a company trying to do that

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.249 
understand a company trying to do that
using<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.209> to<00:03:56.329> raise<00:03:56.479> awareness<00:03:56.629> or<00:03:57.049> something

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:57.259 
using it to raise awareness or something

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:58.719 
using it to raise awareness or something
like<00:03:57.319> that<00:03:57.500> maybe<00:03:57.680> if<00:03:57.889> Kent<00:03:58.099> State<00:03:58.310> itself

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:58.729 
like that maybe if Kent State itself

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:00.610 
like that maybe if Kent State itself
sold<00:03:59.060> those<00:03:59.269> I<00:03:59.540> think<00:03:59.810> most<00:04:00.259> people<00:04:00.409> would

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
sold those I think most people would

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.589 
sold those I think most people would
still<00:04:00.769> have<00:04:00.919> a<00:04:00.949> massive<00:04:01.459> problem<00:04:01.699> with<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:02.180> but

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
still have a massive problem with it but

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.809 
still have a massive problem with it but
it's<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.139> denial<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.889> only<00:04:04.250> selling<00:04:04.609> one

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
it's the the denial and only selling one

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.399 
it's the the denial and only selling one
like<00:04:05.209> you<00:04:05.629> get<00:04:05.870> your<00:04:05.900> head<00:04:06.109> out<00:04:06.199> of<00:04:06.229> your<00:04:06.319> ass

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409 
like you get your head out of your ass

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:07.719 
like you get your head out of your ass
but<00:04:06.650> anyway<00:04:06.859> let's<00:04:07.250> talk<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.430> little<00:04:07.459> bit<00:04:07.609> about

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:07.729 
but anyway let's talk a little bit about

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.159 
but anyway let's talk a little bit about
Kent<00:04:08.030> State<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:08.269> what<00:04:08.389> it<00:04:08.479> should<00:04:08.900> have<00:04:09.019> was

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
Kent State and what it should have was

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:10.479 
Kent State and what it should have was
because<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:09.560> think<00:04:09.620> for<00:04:09.829> a<00:04:09.889> lot<00:04:09.979> of<00:04:10.040> people<00:04:10.370> they

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
because I think for a lot of people they

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.159 
because I think for a lot of people they
will<00:04:10.609> hear<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:10.819> reference<00:04:11.299> and<00:04:11.569> they'll<00:04:12.019> know

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
will hear the reference and they'll know

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:13.509 
will hear the reference and they'll know
that<00:04:12.349> something<00:04:12.650> bad<00:04:12.799> happened<00:04:13.069> there<00:04:13.370> but

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
that something bad happened there but

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.409 
that something bad happened there but
they<00:04:13.609> don't<00:04:13.759> really<00:04:14.000> know<00:04:14.180> what<00:04:14.329> the

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
they don't really know what the

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.330 
they don't really know what the
situation<00:04:14.569> was<00:04:15.079> and<00:04:15.290> so<00:04:15.409> basically<00:04:15.799> this<00:04:16.280> is

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
situation was and so basically this is

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.449 
situation was and so basically this is
back<00:04:16.699> during<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.539> Vietnam<00:04:18.259> War<00:04:18.289> era<00:04:18.739> during

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
back during the Vietnam War era during

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
building at Kent State is burned down we

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.520 
building at Kent State is burned down we
don't<00:05:23.540> know<00:05:23.720> for<00:05:23.930> sure<00:05:23.990> that's<00:05:24.320> the

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
don't know for sure that's the

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.260 
don't know for sure that's the
demonstrators<00:05:25.100> but<00:05:25.340> they<00:05:25.430> were<00:05:25.490> seen<00:05:25.970> sort<00:05:26.210> of

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
demonstrators but they were seen sort of

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.090 
demonstrators but they were seen sort of
cheering<00:05:26.780> it<00:05:26.930> as<00:05:27.080> it<00:05:27.350> burns<00:05:27.530> down<00:05:27.770> so<00:05:27.980> it's

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
cheering it as it burns down so it's

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.830 
cheering it as it burns down so it's
likely<00:05:28.430> that<00:05:28.460> they<00:05:28.670> did<00:05:28.820> do<00:05:28.970> that<00:05:29.150> so<00:05:29.330> look

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
likely that they did do that so look

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.590 
likely that they did do that so look
they<00:05:29.990> were<00:05:30.080> doing<00:05:30.440> bad<00:05:30.650> things<00:05:30.680> at<00:05:31.190> the<00:05:31.250> time

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
they were doing bad things at the time

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.790 
they were doing bad things at the time
eventually<00:05:32.600> the<00:05:32.720> demonstrations<00:05:33.350> get<00:05:33.590> bigger

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
eventually the demonstrations get bigger

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.280 
eventually the demonstrations get bigger
and<00:05:34.010> bigger<00:05:34.190> and<00:05:34.400> at<00:05:34.520> one<00:05:34.700> point<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.960> the

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
and bigger and at one point the the
