00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.090
 The following is another example 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.899
 72 are overwhelmed by this at this stage 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.029
 That bowl 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:12.909
 How much power to use with a racket 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:15.589
 There are many people who are hard to grasp 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:16.839
 In women 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:20.339
 If you let this in a form without power or if there is that power 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:25.300
 Palau loses its weakest one hundred and thirty six years ago 

00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:30.829
 Horibe from ms this will cause old age mistakes 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.850
 It can not but be left side by side in the member's work room 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.460
 I think it seems the ball will come 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.430
 I will let you know 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.510
 Spending 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.000
 I came in from the practice of anti-money 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.030
 buck-tick a little because I've never been in this state 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.710
 Pretty funny 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.100
 Once in the foreground 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.080
 This is a strike 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.080
 I would like to analogize to the former Putnam people 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.640
 Soft type 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.640
 material 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.540
 Soon 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.540
 On the other hand it started earlier than a little more 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.950
 End 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.720
 I understood 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.240
 I understood 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.820
 By the way 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.820
 Topic stock 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.310
 Significant continuation 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.310
 f1 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.789
 While being transmitted 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.659
 It became singing power next year 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.659
 Placed in front of the racket 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.439
 Hotel from the ruins 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.929
 It is sanchin 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:34.509
 5000 Yen 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.059
 The 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:42.349
 End 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.259
 Frankfurt show 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:47.259
 The turnover is 10 billion yen 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.999
 Coverage 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.739
 No way 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.149
 I expect 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:02.609
 baud 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.369
 There is no one 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.369
 First 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.459
 Aggressive 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:32.659
 Now the regulation student is Blaine 35 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.599
 Hands of the room 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.760
 I want you to make it one that everyone is selling 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.819
 And what does that mean? 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:45.889
 Market article is Otsuka first 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.239
 Two death glances of television's favorite 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.859
 Mr. Maeda 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.869
 But it is 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:55.899
 There are also 32 mailings. 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:57.759
 The point of dekoden 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.829
 After this on the wrist but 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.199
 Without using 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.679
 Put before your debut pet's 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:07.679
 Rich standink 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.340
 Brazil is also convenient 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.099
 To mean Ebisu 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.489
 Position to take the ball 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.180
 Because there is no useless movement of autobiography 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.580
 We can cope with meeting mode 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.029
 First over the net 

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:27.949
 Then our company is over 9 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:28.879
 lose 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.789
 Someone like you 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.409
 Kobe port came 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:33.969
 On the other hand 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:36.969
 It's been a while 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.789
 I will tighten my body 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.900
 Because 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.689
 In response to this 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:50.740
 so 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.219
 It was a little stuck now 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.229
 After the apartment 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.699
 The city that came out also went before 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.030
 The city that originally supports the city is full
