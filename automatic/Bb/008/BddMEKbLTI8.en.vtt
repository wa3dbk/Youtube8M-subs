00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.999
 it floats like a perfume 70s and 80s will be nominated 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:20.460
 this small town of central brittany hosted Saturday the third round of 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.579
 french championship of old motorcycles 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.119
 150 pilots from France and Navarre are involved in this 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.289
 competition 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.300
 out of love for nature and for the old bike 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.980
 so the sensation compared to a motorcycle during this attack for 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.480
 take back to the restorers it is necessary to understand your agreement 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.500
 these ladies a noisy hair of water between May 28 43 years 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
 then necessarily they are less flexible and less dispersed 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.960
 well they brought the jobs a lot of suspension% to 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.700
 the back not much for coal either 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.700
 in all the 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.500
 the motorola field very very differently 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.880
 an innocuous pass with a normal bike becomes yesterday I 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060
 what in the case of the big differences in the holding of 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.850
 delay 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.400
 and then the bikes are much heavier 6 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.400
 and on the other hand they are very important also this level of braking 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.320
 it's as if you want with a 4th on a circuit the cost for the state of 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.530
 California 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.070
 pilots are also not immune to a possible capricci 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.070
 mechanical 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.330
 the riders of these antiques rolls on average between 25 and 30 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.270
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.550
 on a 65 km circuit 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.940
 the luxury house 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.390
 a real obstacle course 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.480
 it's a circuit after arriving 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.280
 so we have the road of the exploitation way 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.770
 not in possession of rupture 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.280
 the owners' permissions of course 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.380
 so we can have teeth in front of voices for 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.960
 vicinal ways attentive 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.310
 this optics 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.520
 the tire sector 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.060
 the plan of m 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.670
 but Frederic and his colleagues do not take unconscious risks 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.870
 to finish in the first 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.550
 pilots driving motorcycles are also not partridges of the year 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.560
 drive again we already have because later on up and we did not 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.560
 inevitably want to be champion something even higher 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.880
 just one in five drivers was able to finish the race 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.010
 the weather conditions that made the test 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.920
 very difficult
