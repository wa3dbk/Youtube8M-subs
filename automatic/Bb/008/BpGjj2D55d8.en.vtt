paper that's going to be layered for for
a<00:02:03.789> layout<00:02:03.969> and<00:02:04.329> what<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:04.899> do<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.139> I<00:02:05.319> take<00:02:05.499> my

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
a layout and what I do is I take my

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.440 
a layout and what I do is I take my
trimmer<00:02:05.950> Alice<00:02:06.399> sadly<00:02:06.849> I<00:02:06.880> moved<00:02:07.149> it<00:02:07.240> out<00:02:07.329> of

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
trimmer Alice sadly I moved it out of

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.270 
trimmer Alice sadly I moved it out of
the<00:02:07.539> frame<00:02:07.719> I<00:02:07.929> can't<00:02:08.200> believe<00:02:08.350> that<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:09.040> you

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
the frame I can't believe that and you

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.050 
the frame I can't believe that and you
just<00:02:09.580> take<00:02:09.820> it<00:02:10.030> down<00:02:10.240> an<00:02:10.479> inch<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:11.880> when<00:02:12.880> you

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
just take it down an inch and when you

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.680 
just take it down an inch and when you
when<00:02:13.480> you

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
when you

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.390 
when you
make<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.380> come<00:02:14.530> down<00:02:14.740> towards<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.100> you<00:02:15.280> only

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
make it come down towards you you only

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.180 
make it come down towards you you only
take<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.970> 11<00:02:16.330> inches<00:02:16.450> not<00:02:16.780> 12<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:18.010> you're

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
take it to 11 inches not 12 so you're

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.640 
take it to 11 inches not 12 so you're
essentially<00:02:18.580> creating<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.270> frame<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:20.350> that

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
essentially creating a frame so that

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.350 
essentially creating a frame so that
centerpiece<00:02:21.130> will<00:02:21.490> be<00:02:21.610> cut<00:02:21.820> out<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.000> then

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
centerpiece will be cut out and then

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.510 
centerpiece will be cut out and then
you'll<00:02:22.390> be<00:02:22.600> able<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.870> use<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.560> green<00:02:24.040> again

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
you'll be able to use that green again

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.520 
you'll be able to use that green again
for<00:02:25.210> another<00:02:25.330> project<00:02:25.570> I<00:02:25.960> just<00:02:26.170> didn't<00:02:26.410> want

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
for another project I just didn't want

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.280 
for another project I just didn't want
to<00:02:26.590> use<00:02:26.740> up<00:02:26.950> all<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.640> green<00:02:27.960> okay<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.140> the

to use up all that green okay and the
paper<00:02:29.500> stays<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.340> at<00:02:30.760> 12<00:02:31.120> inches<00:02:31.270> by<00:02:31.630> 12

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
paper stays the at 12 inches by 12

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.570 
paper stays the at 12 inches by 12
inches<00:02:31.960> overall<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.980> you'll<00:02:33.100> see<00:02:33.280> how<00:02:33.310> I'm

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
inches overall and you'll see how I'm

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.630 
inches overall and you'll see how I'm
going<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.820> layer<00:02:34.030> all<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.810> back<00:02:34.960> pieces<00:02:35.640> so

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
going to layer all the back pieces so

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.130 
going to layer all the back pieces so
now<00:02:36.760> go<00:02:37.030> ahead<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.240> I<00:02:37.360> cut<00:02:37.660> my<00:02:38.140> white<00:02:38.530> at<00:02:40.140> 11

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
now go ahead and I cut my white at 11

now go ahead and I cut my white at 11
and<00:02:41.410> three<00:02:42.070> quarters<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:43.660> make<00:02:44.050> a<00:02:44.080> nice<00:02:44.380> layer

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
and as you can see and then I have also

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.280 
and as you can see and then I have also
that<00:02:53.470> piece<00:02:53.860> is<00:02:54.070> going<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.280> be<00:02:54.400> cut<00:02:54.640> at<00:02:55.140> 11<00:02:56.140> and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290

it thought to be a lot of white showing

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.100 
it thought to be a lot of white showing
it's<00:03:01.690> just<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:02.050> slight<00:03:02.320> bit<00:03:02.460> now<00:03:03.460> i<00:03:03.490> use<00:03:03.640> my<00:03:04.180> atg

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.140 
it's just a slight bit now i use my atg
gun<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.890> go<00:03:06.040> ahead<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.370> stick<00:03:06.640> these<00:03:06.820> three

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
gun to go ahead and stick these three

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.390 
gun to go ahead and stick these three
layers<00:03:07.390> together<00:03:07.750> remember<00:03:08.740> the<00:03:08.920> screen<00:03:09.220> is

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
layers together remember the screen is

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.280 
layers together remember the screen is
12<00:03:09.670> inches<00:03:09.760> by<00:03:10.090> 12<00:03:10.330> inches<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:10.990> it's<00:03:11.110> really

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
12 inches by 12 inches so it's really

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.300 
the back so I'm just using my scotch atg
gun<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.760> stick<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:16.150> down<00:03:16.980> actually<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.100> stick

gun to stick this down actually to stick
all<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.580> layers<00:03:18.910> together<00:03:19.180> I<00:03:19.390> should<00:03:19.660> say<00:03:19.870> so

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
all the layers together I should say so

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.080 
all the layers together I should say so
next<00:03:20.470> I'm<00:03:20.650> going<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:20.860> layer<00:03:21.040> up<00:03:21.310> my<00:03:21.850> white

a<00:04:47.770> little<00:04:47.889> trick<00:04:48.220> I<00:04:48.340> just<00:04:48.550> picked<00:04:48.759> up<00:04:48.910> i'm

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
a little trick I just picked up i'm

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.290 
a little trick I just picked up i'm
using<00:04:50.020> painters<00:04:50.440> tape<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:50.830> tape<00:04:51.310> my<00:04:51.520> layout<00:04:51.940> to

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
using painters tape to tape my layout to

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.629 
using painters tape to tape my layout to
this<00:04:52.570> close<00:04:53.139> to<00:04:53.169> my<00:04:53.320> heart<00:04:53.470> verse<00:04:53.830> on<00:04:54.070> Matt<00:04:54.310> I

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
this close to my heart verse on Matt I

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.760 
this close to my heart verse on Matt I
love<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.539> verse<00:04:55.750> amount<00:04:56.080> in<00:04:56.199> particular

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
love the verse amount in particular

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.350 
love the verse amount in particular
because<00:04:56.979> as<00:04:57.280> you<00:04:57.430> see<00:04:57.639> there's<00:04:57.880> numbers

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
because as you see there's numbers

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.990 
because as you see there's numbers
there's<00:04:58.840> measurements<00:04:59.800> on<00:04:59.919> all<00:05:00.610> four<00:05:00.970> sides

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
there's measurements on all four sides

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.360 
there's measurements on all four sides
and<00:05:01.599> with<00:05:02.259> these<00:05:02.349> graphic<00:05:02.800> layouts<00:05:03.160> it

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
and with these graphic layouts it

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.980 
and with these graphic layouts it
sometimes<00:05:03.789> gets<00:05:03.970> really<00:05:04.449> hard<00:05:04.630> to<00:05:04.870> lay

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
sometimes gets really hard to lay

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.270 
sometimes gets really hard to lay
something<00:05:05.259> down<00:05:05.440> in<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:05.800> middle<00:05:05.979> of<00:05:06.009> the<00:05:06.099> page

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
something down in the middle of the page

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.890 
something down in the middle of the page
and<00:05:06.340> make<00:05:06.669> sure<00:05:06.699> it's<00:05:07.000> even<00:05:07.300> on<00:05:07.389> both<00:05:07.599> sides

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
and make sure it's even on both sides

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.589 
and make sure it's even on both sides
well<00:05:08.590> with<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.949> painters<00:05:09.280> tape<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.880> gets<00:05:10.479> a

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
well with the painters tape it gets a

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.270 
well with the painters tape it gets a
whole<00:05:10.780> lot<00:05:10.840> easier<00:05:11.169> to<00:05:11.500> do<00:05:11.650> that<00:05:11.860> because<00:05:12.039> now

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
whole lot easier to do that because now

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.760 
whole lot easier to do that because now
the<00:05:12.340> layout<00:05:13.150> doesn't<00:05:13.330> shimmy<00:05:13.720> around<00:05:14.110> I<00:05:14.380> don't

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
the layout doesn't shimmy around I don't

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.700 
the layout doesn't shimmy around I don't
know<00:05:14.860> if<00:05:14.919> you<00:05:14.979> have<00:05:15.070> that<00:05:15.220> problem<00:05:15.460> but<00:05:15.639> I<00:05:15.789> have

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
know if you have that problem but I have

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.529 
know if you have that problem but I have
how<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:17.770> makes<00:05:17.919> it<00:05:18.130> so<00:05:18.340> easy<00:05:18.370> to<00:05:19.000> lay<00:05:19.180> down<00:05:19.210> this

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
how it makes it so easy to lay down this

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.480 
how it makes it so easy to lay down this
pink<00:05:19.870> section<00:05:20.320> because<00:05:20.830> I'm<00:05:21.099> just<00:05:21.280> going<00:05:21.460> to

pink section because I'm just going to
lay<00:05:21.669> that<00:05:21.699> out<00:05:21.910> at<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.539> six<00:05:22.780> inch<00:05:22.990> mark<00:05:23.320> on

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
lay that out at the six inch mark on

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.129 
lay that out at the six inch mark on
both<00:05:23.770> sides<00:05:24.039> and<00:05:24.250> I<00:05:24.430> know<00:05:24.490> it's<00:05:24.820> even<00:05:25.210> I've<00:05:25.449> got

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
both sides and I know it's even I've got

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.170
