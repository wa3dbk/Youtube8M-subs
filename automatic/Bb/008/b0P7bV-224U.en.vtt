Hey I'm Anthony Walsh, and today I'm here
to show you GoPro Tips and Tricks series on

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.230
how to prep your camera for water photography.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.539
First step, make sure you've got a battery.
Plenty of times I've jumped in the water and

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.000
I've had a flat battery and the session's
good, I've had to run in and out and miss

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.869
waves. Next thing you really want to have,
make sure you've got an SD card. That's a

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.579
huge key. Then, with a towel, you really want
to clean your lens. I've had shots and there's

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.660
been fingerprints on my shots and it just
totally ruins the shot. Then inside, you want

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.079
to clean inside, outside of the lens really
good, put it up to the light and you can see

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.079
if there are any fingerprints or anything in
there. Next, since you're in the water, well

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.559
I live in Hawai'i, so it's really humid here,
so you need to have the anti-fogs so you don't

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.699
get a foggy screen. Just put them in there
like that, it goes underneath, close it. When

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.840
you're closing it, really make sure that your
seal is done up tight, there's no sand, there's

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.740
no dirt or anything like that because otherwise
you'll get water in your housing and ruin

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.000
the camera. Any time you're in the water you
need to use a GoPro floaty back. It's an absolute

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.400
must. The camera doesn't float on its own,
so you really need to use that.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.200
Now that you're all prepped and ready to go,
let me run you through a few modes, specific

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.820
to what you want to shoot. I shoot a lot of
Instagram, so I like to use the wVGA mode,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.060
240 frames per second. It's the highest frame
rate, so when you do slomo you can really

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.270
make it look super smooth. The resolution
is low, so you can't really stretch it out,

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.780
but on your phone it looks great. For Youtube
and Vimeo, I like to use the 720p 120 frames

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.720
per second. You get a lot better quality,
it's perfect for the computer screen, 720p.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.000
It's still high frame rate, 120 frames, so
it still looks really good for slomo.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.000
I really love the video mode on the GoPro,
but my favorite is the photo mode, the burst

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.989
mode. 30 photos a second, no other camera
does that. So, when you're coming to the wave,

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.109
the wave is coming in, you want to have the
camera really steady, especially in low light.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.180
There's a short delay, press the button just
before the moment you want and it will run

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.000
for a whole second.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.500
I'm Anthony Walsh, thank you for watching
GoPro Tips and Tricks, until next time.
