00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170 
it up give it a firm press and you're

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:52.400 
it up give it a firm press and you're
all<00:05:46.260> set<00:05:49.820> it's<00:05:50.820> up<00:05:51.000> to<00:05:51.030> 40<00:05:51.570> degrees<00:05:51.900> again<00:05:52.230> that

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
all set it's up to 40 degrees again that

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.170 
all set it's up to 40 degrees again that
it<00:05:52.530> actually<00:05:52.710> dropped<00:05:53.190> the<00:05:53.400> thirty-six<00:05:54.000> of
