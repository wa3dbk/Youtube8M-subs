00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
amount but you know what is this about

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.240 
amount but you know what is this about
10<00:06:23.240> products<00:06:23.690> yeah<00:06:24.050> so<00:06:24.350> 10<00:06:24.530> products<00:06:24.890> less

than<00:06:25.700> what<00:06:26.060> I<00:06:26.090> had<00:06:26.630> before<00:06:26.660> so<00:06:27.230> that's<00:06:27.350> good

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
than what I had before so that's good

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.500 
than what I had before so that's good
because<00:06:28.190> you<00:06:28.730> know<00:06:28.850> just<00:06:28.880> kind<00:06:29.240> of<00:06:29.300> pulling

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
because you know just kind of pulling

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.110 
because you know just kind of pulling
out<00:06:29.840> just<00:06:30.260> a<00:06:30.380> few<00:06:30.710> items<00:06:30.950> that<00:06:31.310> you<00:06:31.610> realize

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
out just a few items that you realize

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.700 
out just a few items that you realize
that<00:06:32.150> you<00:06:32.420> have<00:06:32.720> stopped<00:06:33.020> using<00:06:33.230> for<00:06:33.590> whatever

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
that you have stopped using for whatever

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.190 
that you have stopped using for whatever
reason<00:06:34.160> it<00:06:34.460> just<00:06:34.880> allows<00:06:35.150> you<00:06:35.360> to<00:06:35.570> put<00:06:35.990> all

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
reason it just allows you to put all

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.170 
reason it just allows you to put all
your<00:06:36.380> focus<00:06:36.770> into<00:06:37.040> the<00:06:37.640> products<00:06:37.970> that<00:06:38.060> you

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
your focus into the products that you

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.020 
your focus into the products that you
really<00:06:38.570> do<00:06:38.690> love<00:06:38.900> wearing<00:06:39.170> often<00:06:39.770> so<00:06:40.400> I<00:06:40.760> guess

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
really do love wearing often so I guess

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.910 
really do love wearing often so I guess
that's<00:06:41.210> everything<00:06:41.420> you<00:06:41.630> guys<00:06:41.750> I<00:06:42.200> shall<00:06:42.800> let

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:42.920 
that's everything you guys I shall let

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.820 
that's everything you guys I shall let
you<00:06:42.950> go<00:06:43.130> for<00:06:43.280> this<00:06:43.400> video<00:06:43.670> and<00:06:43.730> I<00:06:44.630> think<00:06:45.080> the

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
you go for this video and I think the

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.320 
you go for this video and I think the
next<00:06:46.070> one<00:06:46.220> is<00:06:46.340> going<00:06:46.460> to<00:06:46.520> be<00:06:46.760> or<00:06:47.030> the<00:06:47.150> next

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
next one is going to be or the next

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.430 
next one is going to be or the next
declutter<00:06:47.720> I<00:06:47.810> don't<00:06:47.990> know<00:06:48.050> about<00:06:48.170> the<00:06:48.260> next

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 
declutter I don't know about the next

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.470 
declutter I don't know about the next
video<00:06:48.740> but<00:06:49.310> next<00:06:49.520> declutter<00:06:49.910> will<00:06:50.120> probably

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
video but next declutter will probably

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.710 
video but next declutter will probably
be<00:06:50.600> Mac<00:06:50.990> eyeshadows
