00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.350
 very important match for gazélec 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.480
 Ajaccio hosting the Olympic Nîmes 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.950
 ajaccio is fifth in the ranking 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.590
 promoted behaves very well 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.960
 nimes 9th also makes a good start to 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.090
 Nîmes season are on their second 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.439
 victory of the season while the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.419
 gazélec is on a series of two 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.520
 consecutive victories and occasionally 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.969
 of these two matches the Corsican do not have 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.370
 cashed any goal 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:37.469
 we are therefore expecting a game played with 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.800
 a gas elec is decided to be made 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.270
 respect at home nîmes is struggling to 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.200
 clear on this first action 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.290
 the first framed shot and the recovery 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.540
 succeeded by John Tshibumbu 13th minute 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.790
 the opening of the score for gas 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.770
 made 1-0 first goal of the season 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.530
 the ball is released by mathieu michel 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.850
 the Nîmes custodian allowed tshibumbu 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.870
 to score this first goal 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.810
 answer from the Nîmes and the beautiful parade of 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.460
 Clement maury it's a little better 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.159
 for men by josé pasqualetti 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.350
 but it's a tough match on gazelec 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.109
 dominated attention to this recovery 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.929
 exceptional florian fabre 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.229
 it's 2-0 in the 43rd minute to the best 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:21.060
 moment 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.499
 what risk taking but sometimes he 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.780
 must try this kind of gesture and it's 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.700
 here paying first goal of the season for 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.459
 florian fabre and he will remember 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.799
 an extraordinary strike that carries the 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:36.170
 score at 2 0 just before the break it's 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.170
 the blow very hard for crocos Nîmes 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.319
 gazélec ajaccio did most of the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.899
 job 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:46.109
 it's a rather deserved score nîmes did not 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.759
 not shown enough the confidence of the promoted 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.889
 Corsican is quite impressive 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.630
 it continues in the second half with 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.459
 this free kick is on the bar 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.109
 transversal 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.829
 huge new opportunity it's saved on 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.659
 line 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.969
 the double opportunity for gazélec 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.520
 ajaccio is still a possibility on 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.189
 this free kick was saved by mathieu 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.929
 michel than opportunities for a gazelec 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.840
 who could score the third goal 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.459
 on every action we are not far from 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.530
 this extra buses again a 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.560
 attempt with that hit in himself 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.560
 returning 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.260
 nîmes has more opportunities since well 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.800
 long time 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.240
 here is one 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.390
 but not too much danger anyway for 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.460
 Clement maury new free kick here 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.910
 it was harder for the keeper 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.170
 Corsican he managed to clear his camp 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.880
 the anthem insists in the end of the match 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.380
 to try to narrow the gap and 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.300
 afford a crazy end game but 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.610
 it's too late this last kick 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.730
 stopped gives nothing victory of gazélec 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.780
 ajaccio 2 0 against nîmes the Corsican team 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.780
