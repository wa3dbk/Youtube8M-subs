 He is my computer for everything that is 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.100
 That's what I mean, I'm in a park. 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.680
 I like writing when travel leads 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.589
 for the hotel has hours that the inspiration 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.960
 comes from nothing quoted Sunday comes the idea in 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.330
 head and gets the idea that Matelândia 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.579
 I have to wake up to the computer. 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.739
 The music inspires me a lot then. 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.780
 usually when I write I am 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.989
 always with some music that has to do 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.320
 with the chapter the character of that 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.009
 chapter I think the song creates a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.570
 The climate in this story is me. 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.240
 I have to always write in 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.830
 silence I can even with other people 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.000
 around but I usually have a phone 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.220
 of ear 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.590
 but I always try to stay in a more 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.800
 Calm exactly why I write 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.350
 more at night when there is less noise is 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.560
 when everything is calmer then the night and 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.050
 dawn are the moments that I like 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.039
 more writing but writing well in 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.580
 any time 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:39.149
 I do not have much with the know- how method or 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.970
 a favorite place is the same time 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.849
 néné up because I usually write 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.560
 almost all day long anywhere 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:52.470
 so I usually say that inspiration 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.840
 she exists but she needs to find 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.599
 Are you working then? 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.429
 so that's why I in one of them was very 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:02.690
 time or place and just go 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.690
 writing and creating
