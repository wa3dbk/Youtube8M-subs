00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.270
 good kids how are you doing and we have 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.400
 a video better said another relative video 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.259
 to that possible sixth lc l that he craves 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.269
 the community and of course a server 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.219
 but because it makes us is another video of 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.839
 this issue is because it makes heca 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.730
 few details have come out 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.260
 they are rather a few clues 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.760
 provided by the developers 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.039
 that could indicate us the existence of 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.539
 this dlc could be nothing but I think 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.460
 how much provocation on the part of the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.869
 developers deserves mention and good to 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.820
 these heights I suppose you already know in 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.679
 what it is but just in case we are going to 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.600
 define it quickie basically the sixth 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.430
 from lezea price as we know it now 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.230
 then it was explained because it would be a pack of 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.120
 maps of old deliveries that we were 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.230
 would give in quotes for compensation 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.670
 for everything we've had to 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.560
 endure with battlefield 4 and some 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.330
 you will say but if they have already done it with dry 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.580
 nasal and you will be right in part since 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.020
 in theory it is true but really in 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.280
 instead of paying attention to the vote that 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.170
 he did in his day they did what he gave them 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.240
 he wins with the maps they brought 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.590
 little was again made a vote as 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.060
 the one of that moment and the results 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.590
 they are still the same obviously not 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.360
 we will have underground and it already 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.520
 we have but the order of maps that more 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.769
 we would like to see would be great bazaar crossing 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.510
 del sena canales de rosarito receive 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.610
 of course four maps is milk 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.080
 that I would love to see in battlefield 4 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.430
 I say they ignored what 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.260
 we wanted and the community has been 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.880
 asking for another d lc since then but 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.310
 this time with the maps that really 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.230
 we want but let's go to the new 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.030
 these rumors were started by another link 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.560
 from the ct files that revealed a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.390
 user that will sound if you watched the video 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.130
 of the crossbow or the bf news of the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.140
 sunday terrace gamer give that in this 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.960
 case he showed us a sheet with the possible 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.400
 name of the sixth d lc a price the truth 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.870
 is that as well as subjective data is 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.250
 word is one that I like a lot since 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.870
 it is usually used to describe a 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.150
 revolution an uprising like it would be 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.650
 literally translated as a result of this 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.240
 Chava began the typical interrogation to 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.560
 the developers on twitter when 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.509
 one of our acquaintances and majors 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.340
 creators of rumors davids ireland 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.830
 oettinger on twitter gave us this phrase 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.119
 at the end of the rainbow the battle fest 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.890
 find the treasure by doing a little 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.750
 reference in addition to the magician of oz 'in case 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.250
 you do not know what the battle face is 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.140
 this event during which we are given 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.490
 battle packs experience bus and all 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.530
 those little things which I understand 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.330
 starts in a few days and will last longer or 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.590
 less a month as I think I remember that lasted 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.540
 the previous one and that has made the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.820
 premium battlelog calendar you have 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.200
 that extend a lot more and although 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.760
 It seems that there is no detail of the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.590
 calendar combined with not climbing 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.460
 at the maximum level 150 with the last 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.320
 upgrade 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.030
 meant for many another clue that the 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.950
 life of battlefield 4 would spread further 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.930
 through another one of lc and sincerely 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.280
 I understand why they think about it since 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.260
 I think they made room and to put us 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.030
 3 battle packs and we like experience or 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.740
 or maybe yes but as they say 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.020
 Hope is the last thing that is lost 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.670
 in this case the hope of filling that 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.320
 unexpected time between tan endings and 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.820
 hard line because you remember you are in 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.110
 theory we should take like a month and 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.610
 half playing hard line but in a 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.620
 gesture of the developers that I 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.970
 loved decided to delay the game 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.140
 five months to make sure that the 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.520
 launch was not like that of 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.320
 battlefield 4 but it was a 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.540
 flawless launch great attitude 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.920
 part of visceral on this occasion apart 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.450
 of this what I would highlight is the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.860
 typical play with which they carry 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.750
 some developers for 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.280
 time in quotes like I said to the 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.780
 beginning of the video provoking us 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.240
 inadvertently betting for us to think 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.830
 that there will be another new dlc or minimum something 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.660
 more than what we are waiting for 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.220
 really kids to me this story has 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.990
 to go giving us clues I like but 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.120
 as long as they carry anything 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.220
 but that they take us to something because I do not know 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.450
 to you but to me going dizzy to the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.400
 community is something that I do not like 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.990
 I too oddly enough 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.210
 trust in dais and keep hoping that 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.440
 we will have something else and my mother go 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.700
 coincidence but while I'm 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.069
 writing this on twitter 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.050
 fd and you just textually say a 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.700
 reliable source told me that there will be 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.709
 two to three expansion packs 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.019
 additional that could be maps or dlcs 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.030
 that are planned for battlefield 4 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.920
 at the moment it is what we say 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.420
 concrete that we have been told is 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.220
 when rumors come out they are usually very 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.569
 confused as the tweet before 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.730
 circular but this statement is 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.170
 categorical although we do not know the source 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.459
 but anyway taking into account 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.750
 the huge amount of likes of 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.250
 battlefield four of those that we have 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.690
 aware and the credibility that it has 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.150
 see him and I think it's reasonable 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.099
 start to believe us a little bit more 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.200
 that our illusions can be fulfilled 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.720
 in a short time only one thing please 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.819
 great bazaar and good kids that would be 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.620
 all for this extra short video on the 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.120
 which summarized the news regarding 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.890
 price that by the way I have come the 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.200
 mind that it was the name of a dlc of 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.459
 black ops 2 I think remember is good and 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.110
 from today apart I hope that I have 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.459
 liked the video and if so I would like 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.079
 How much could you leave your opinion 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.670
 but this time not only about the maps 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.560
 what you want and all that we have already 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.090
 ever discussed but if you believe 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.100
 that the quotes in quotes that 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.720
 we have are credible or if directly 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.540
 apart from these continue to believe that 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.400
 there will be a sixth tlc so nothing said 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.120
 I say goodbye 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.120
 goodbye kids
