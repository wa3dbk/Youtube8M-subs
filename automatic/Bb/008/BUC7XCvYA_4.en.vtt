00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.980
 hello friends with you khafs 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.980
 and today we will discuss another British 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.320
 tank soviet development squirrel me 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.140
 it feels like when ours got 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.460
 heavy and big third churchill and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.590
 they just left green paint 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.140
 which the command said to either 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.599
 use it but not pour it in vain 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.000
 so we asked the English 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.739
 something small so 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.309
 Meet the hero of our today's 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.160
 review called captions in blitz he 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.000
 represented by a premium tank 2 level 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.430
 so why bother about 2 levla 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.829
 naturally for pleasure either for 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.170
 bend and so our today's 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.899
 hero, we will consider it with 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.420
 these two sides of the leg farm same on it 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.370
 I understand it on a tank from May 5 to 8 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.829
 nice to do yet there coefficient 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.170
 yield big but fuel 2 blah 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.030
 bla profit ratio well of course 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.790
 good for your laurels too 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.790
 dinner making it is very long and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.189
 painful idea well so what 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.680
 regards exactly pleasure then 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.229
 captions get it for me personally 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.630
 quite a challenge 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.150
 the thing is that he has a very 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.390
 good and dangerous competitor under 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.890
 T2 light here in a few words 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.610
 literally a review came out quite recently 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.310
 there is a great speaker just 70 80 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.770
 kilometers per hour worn on the map catch 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.689
 the wind is more like his whistling in the ears and so 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.380
 further even a gun 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.960
 that viola is like 2 lite 1,200 rounds 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.259
 boeukladki rapid-gun shy and 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.570
 here I teach the collapse that we have 64 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.030
 kilometer per hour top speed but engine 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.520
 rather weak and therefore credits are not 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.360
 accelerates on a straight line to this maximum 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.220
 will drive 50 can not 55 kilometers 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.680
 per hour therefore 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.070
 somehow stand out particularly among the tanks 2 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.740
 catching especially series btbt 2 that is, we 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.600
 let's not even drive slower what 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.840
 the same applies to the gun here 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.800
 the most important bummer in terms of pleasure 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.020
 before 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.570
 guns good she comfortable she 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.330
 bends but reloading him 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.600
 is 4 seconds on the second left 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.270
 it's still a bit too much so you sit 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.910
 wait while you recharge this gameplay 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.160
 more for five sixth seventh so on 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.860
 levels but not for the deepest 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.070
 imagine yourself a sandbox 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.980
 the atmosphere here you see ms-1 t1 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.900
 bt-2 t18 lighthouse tractor 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.709
 most famous sand tanks with 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.580
 which everyone probably met and 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.150
 recharging four and a half 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.570
 there second wait for yourself and wait for 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.000
 alpha is 45 dpm units of course 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.340
 good but on opponent 2 was not in 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.010
 on average, it takes 15-20 seconds without 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.350
 adrenaline she is an opponent already 3 him 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.840
 have to spend half a minute picking 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.640
 Well, that's what I actually and 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.920
 getting at 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.769
 the pleasure of t2 light is much more 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.060
 and since it is still in comparison 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.880
 breaks that credits really behind 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.640
 and very much as for fan 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.700
 it is on the other tanks 2 Vlad she Tom 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.739
 same t18 on this abby sand his 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.590
 Again, you can get a lot more as well 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.870
 so the credits and I do not consider 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.970
 the parties are just pleasure 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.610
 further the second side of our 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.880
 Today's review is bending over credits 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.640
 he 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.549
 whether this machine can bend down 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.400
 of course can gun comfortable 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.700
 armor penetration allows you to punch t18 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.720
 the flop but this is certainly a great achievement 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.630
 really comfortable 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.880
 really nice alpha repeat 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.620
 small dpm small mobility 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.770
 little no good mobility 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.450
 Basically everything is very balanced 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.600
 nothing stands out as for 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.730
 there is absolutely no armor for her 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.120
 almost sand tanks fishing is not 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.060
 excluding again the same great t18 a 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.940
 so set us set 18 too us 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.460
 vanshot t82 vanshot and such things 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.520
 so you still have to play neatly 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.890
 and therefore credits for bend fit 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.870
 only those who have 5 thousand behind 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.510
 fights well, at least from 1000 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.550
 so that at least some experience of the game is not 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.070
 only in the sandbox but different high on 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.840
 shafts of tiles when you know who where 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.130
 although I will go though the sandbox 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.650
 unpredictable circus stuff like that and here 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.750
 when you already know the cool arrangement 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.330
 you can bend it absolutely on any tank 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.180
 colors it does not stop doing 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.100
 he is so balanced most ordinary 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.870
 Well, such a reviewer is not yet 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.600
 uninformative rather short 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.540
 do we need to buy a total 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.990
 captions and if you really really want if 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.850
 really want to buy okay but 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.890
 if you treat it like a typewriter 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.860
 for pleasure then look better in 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.390
 side t2 light for bend over ordinary 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.730
 pumped tanks 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.300
 but still not everyone keeps in the hangar 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:24.580
 In general, the total one you can buy but not 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.710
 so and so right away to run after him and 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.410
 so if you have some other 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.260
 opinion about this tank 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.660
 forget to share it in the comments 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.730
 well and you had a Fox subscribe to 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:42.000
