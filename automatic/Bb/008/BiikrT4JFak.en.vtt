color of your blood and as a result when
you<00:00:24.869> look<00:00:25.080> at<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.500> looks<00:00:26.310> live<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.910> course

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
you look at it looks live of course

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.109 
you look at it looks live of course
there's<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.720> lot<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.930> course<00:00:28.640> your<00:00:29.640> eyes<00:00:29.849> are

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
there's a lot of course your eyes are

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.410 
there's a lot of course your eyes are
the<00:00:30.470> windows<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.710> soul<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:33.180> obviously

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
the windows to the soul and so obviously

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.540 
the windows to the soul and so obviously
the<00:00:33.930> eyes<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.440> look<00:00:34.620> alive<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.250> this

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the eyes have to look alive in this

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.920 
the eyes have to look alive in this
particular<00:00:35.760> case<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.450> use<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.600> technology

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
particular case we use a technology

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.720 
particular case we use a technology
called<00:00:37.290> ray<00:00:37.500> tracing<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.040> race<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.460> eyes

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
called ray tracing the race the eyes

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.389 
called ray tracing the race the eyes
that's<00:00:39.450> why<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> crystal<00:00:40.920> looks<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.219> it

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that's why the I crystal looks like it

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.240 
that's why the I crystal looks like it
looks<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.480> alive<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.770> course<00:00:44.010> all

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
looks like it's alive and of course all

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.950 
looks like it's alive and of course all
of<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.550> shadows<00:00:44.969> are<00:00:45.120> view<00:00:45.360> rendered<00:00:45.750> so

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
of the shadows are view rendered so

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.709 
of the shadows are view rendered so
beautifully<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:47.219> see<00:00:47.550> no<00:00:47.760> triangles<00:00:48.450> no

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
beautifully you see no triangles no

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.709 
beautifully you see no triangles no
faceting<00:00:49.379> whatsoever<00:00:50.629> triangles<00:00:51.629> have

faceting whatsoever triangles have

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.950 
faceting whatsoever triangles have
disappeared<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.829> lighting<00:00:53.190> system<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:54.750> so

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
disappeared the lighting system is so

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.389 
disappeared the lighting system is so
sophisticated<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.860> pick<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> little

their engine as you mentioned the yacht

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.090 
their engine as you mentioned the yacht
quality<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:24.210> second<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> none<00:01:25.100> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
quality is is second to none the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.030 
quality is is second to none the
textures<00:01:26.549> are<00:01:26.790> amazing<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.600> also<00:01:28.290> lots<00:01:28.920> of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
textures are amazing and also lots of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.830 
textures are amazing and also lots of
little<00:01:29.220> effects<00:01:29.640> as<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.299> go<00:01:30.420> around<00:01:30.509> I'll

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
little effects as we go around I'll

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.590 
little effects as we go around I'll
point<00:01:31.020> some<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.380> them<00:01:31.500> out<00:01:32.240> look<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> water

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
point some of them out look at the water

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.780 
point some of them out look at the water
dripping<00:01:34.110> off<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.259> wall<00:01:34.560> yep

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
dripping off the wall yep

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.060 
dripping off the wall yep
the<00:01:36.790> lens<00:01:37.030> flare<00:01:37.360> you<00:01:38.230> look<00:01:38.380> at<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.590> Sun<00:01:38.800> high

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
the lens flare you look at the Sun high

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.130 
the lens flare you look at the Sun high
dynamic<00:01:39.280> range<00:01:39.570> look<00:01:40.570> how<00:01:40.690> bright<00:01:40.900> the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
dynamic range look how bright the

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.370 
dynamic range look how bright the
brights<00:01:41.410> are<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:41.770> how<00:01:41.860> dark<00:01:42.160> the<00:01:42.310> darks<00:01:42.580> are

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
brights are and how dark the darks are

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.440 
brights are and how dark the darks are
ok<00:01:44.380> imagine<00:01:44.620> a<00:01:44.890> camera<00:01:45.250> doing<00:01:45.580> this<00:01:45.700> really

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
ok imagine a camera doing this really

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.360 
ok imagine a camera doing this really
hard<00:01:46.660> time<00:01:46.870> with<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.440> camera<00:01:47.740> doing<00:01:48.070> this<00:01:48.190> now

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
hard time with a camera doing this now

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.420 
hard time with a camera doing this now
it's<00:01:48.520> computer<00:01:48.880> graphics<00:01:49.210> tunes<00:01:50.190> so<00:01:51.190> as<00:01:51.310> you

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
it's computer graphics tunes so as you

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.740 
it's computer graphics tunes so as you
mentioned<00:01:51.700> before<00:01:51.820> this<00:01:52.150> is<00:01:52.330> trying<00:01:52.630> to

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
mentioned before this is trying to

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.500 
mentioned before this is trying to
simulate<00:01:53.020> exactly<00:01:53.800> what<00:01:53.950> your<00:01:54.580> ICS<00:01:55.240> and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
simulate exactly what your ICS and

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.719 
simulate exactly what your ICS and
indeed<00:01:56.050> they<00:01:56.530> have<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.740> feature<00:01:57.040> called<00:01:57.220> the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
indeed they have a feature called the

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.450 
indeed they have a feature called the
pupil<00:01:58.300> adaptation<00:01:59.050> where<00:01:59.740> they<00:01:59.860> calculate

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
pupil adaptation where they calculate

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.000 
pupil adaptation where they calculate
the<00:02:00.640> luminance<00:02:01.060> in<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.390> scene<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.900> just<00:02:02.860> like

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
the luminance in the scene and just like

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.100 
the luminance in the scene and just like
you<00:02:03.160> would<00:02:03.400> if<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:04.210> went<00:02:04.390> from<00:02:04.510> a<00:02:04.660> bride

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
you would if you went from a bride

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.410 
you would if you went from a bride
environment<00:02:05.770> into<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.160> document<00:02:06.490> if<00:02:07.270> you're

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
environment into a document if you're

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.080 
environment into a document if you're
outside<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:08.050> ran<00:02:08.170> into<00:02:08.440> every<00:02:08.770> your<00:02:09.429> people

takes a little while to sort of adapt to

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.130 
takes a little while to sort of adapt to
that<00:02:12.400> they<00:02:12.910> build<00:02:13.209> that<00:02:13.330> into<00:02:13.630> this<00:02:13.750> engine

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
that they build that into this engine

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.990 
that they build that into this engine
gives<00:02:15.010> wonderful<00:02:15.700> effects

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
gives wonderful effects

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.119 
gives wonderful effects
they've<00:02:19.000> got<00:02:19.150> lots<00:02:19.329> of<00:02:19.480> nice<00:02:20.129> reflective

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
they've got lots of nice reflective

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.280 
they've got lots of nice reflective
surfaces<00:02:21.790> as<00:02:21.970> well<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:22.629> over<00:02:22.840> here<00:02:22.989> we<00:02:23.110> have<00:02:23.260> a

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
surfaces as well so over here we have a

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.880 
surfaces as well so over here we have a
mirror

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
mirror

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.110 
mirror
we<00:02:24.950> have<00:02:25.100> tiles<00:02:26.350> trash<00:02:27.350> can<00:02:27.680> over<00:02:27.860> here<00:02:28.190> is

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
we have tiles trash can over here is

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.030 
we have tiles trash can over here is
reflecting<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.720> rest<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.170> Rio<00:02:30.830> that

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
reflecting the rest of the Rio that

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.830 
reflecting the rest of the Rio that
trash<00:02:31.280> camp<00:02:31.550> obviously<00:02:32.180> looks<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:32.600> real

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
trash camp obviously looks so real

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.350 
trash camp obviously looks so real
because<00:02:33.170> it's<00:02:34.010> somehow<00:02:34.340> simulated<00:02:35.120> in<00:02:35.270> a

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
because it's somehow simulated in a

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.770 
because it's somehow simulated in a
physically<00:02:35.810> fit<00:02:36.800> physically<00:02:37.340> based<00:02:37.640> ways<00:02:38.030> so

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
physically fit physically based ways so

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.210 
physically fit physically based ways so
that<00:02:38.810> when<00:02:39.050> light<00:02:39.260> bounces<00:02:39.290> off<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:40.100> you

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
that when light bounces off of it you

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.680 
that when light bounces off of it you
could<00:02:40.370> almost<00:02:40.670> feel<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:42.010> steel<00:02:43.010> that's<00:02:43.690> that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
could almost feel the steel that's that

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.690 
could almost feel the steel that's that
smooth<00:02:45.130> absolutely<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.340> can<00:02:46.550> see<00:02:46.670> the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
smooth absolutely and you can see the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.949 
smooth absolutely and you can see the
water<00:02:47.060> dripping<00:02:47.150> down<00:02:47.600> in<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.410> back<00:02:48.590> there<00:02:49.959> as

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
water dripping down in the back there as

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.590 
water dripping down in the back there as
we<00:02:51.110> come<00:02:51.260> along<00:02:51.500> here<00:02:51.800> that<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.220> more<00:02:53.030> sort<00:02:53.570> of

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
we come along here that the more sort of

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.100 
we come along here that the more sort of
plastic<00:02:54.140> posters<00:02:55.540> reflections<00:02:56.540> again<00:02:56.930> off

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
plastic posters reflections again off

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.350 
plastic posters reflections again off
the<00:02:57.140> tiles<00:02:57.739> of<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.400> quality<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.910> textures

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
the tiles of the quality of the textures

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.740 
the tiles of the quality of the textures
is<00:03:00.250> unbelievable<00:03:01.360> this<00:03:02.360> is<00:03:02.510> real-time

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
is unbelievable this is real-time

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.449 
is unbelievable this is real-time
computer<00:03:03.290> graphics<00:03:03.680> Lacey<00:03:03.890> German<00:03:04.310> on<00:03:04.430> a

computer graphics Lacey German on a

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.550 
computer graphics Lacey German on a
little<00:03:04.790> mobile<00:03:05.120> chip<00:03:05.360> yeah<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:06.320> has

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.140 

and<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:11.650> mentioned<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:12.100> for<00:03:12.550> bumpy<00:03:12.850> shiny

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
and you mentioned the for bumpy shiny

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.640 
and you mentioned the for bumpy shiny
you<00:03:13.510> always<00:03:13.690> have<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:13.960> have<00:03:13.990> something<00:03:14.260> shiny

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
you always have to have something shiny

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.940 
you always have to have something shiny
so<00:03:15.040> this<00:03:15.610> is<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.760> nice<00:03:16.030> shiny<00:03:16.420> pipe<00:03:16.950> whereas

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
so this is a nice shiny pipe whereas

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.740 
so this is a nice shiny pipe whereas
everything<00:03:18.340> else<00:03:18.490> in<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.730> scene<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:19.090> quite

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
everything else in the scene is quite

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.900 
everything else in the scene is quite
rusty<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.350> somehow<00:03:21.100> this<00:03:21.340> has<00:03:21.400> managed<00:03:21.819> to

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
rusty and somehow this has managed to

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.140 
rusty and somehow this has managed to
station<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:24.280> final<00:03:24.580> feature<00:03:24.730> i'll<00:03:24.940> mention

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
station the final feature i'll mention

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.250 
station the final feature i'll mention
just<00:03:25.720> briefly<00:03:25.840> see<00:03:26.620> here<00:03:26.890> there's<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.220> light

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
just briefly see here there's a light

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.800 
just briefly see here there's a light
sparking<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.940> they<00:03:30.940> do<00:03:31.000> some<00:03:31.300> very<00:03:31.450> clever

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
sparking and they do some very clever

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.840 
sparking and they do some very clever
things<00:03:32.200> with<00:03:32.470> particle<00:03:33.040> effects<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.610> they

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
things with particle effects and they

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.340 
things with particle effects and they
actually<00:03:34.000> put<00:03:34.390> physics<00:03:34.810> on<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.050> particle

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
actually put physics on the particle

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.530 
actually put physics on the particle
effects<00:03:35.800> so<00:03:36.130> that<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.580> stocks<00:03:37.000> don't<00:03:37.330> just

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
effects so that the stocks don't just

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.060 
effects so that the stocks don't just
fly<00:03:37.780> through<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:38.200> wall<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.650> through<00:03:38.860> all<00:03:38.950> the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
fly through the wall and through all the

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.370 
fly through the wall and through all the
objects<00:03:39.430> in<00:03:39.550> the<00:03:39.670> scene<00:03:39.910> actually<00:03:40.630> bounce<00:03:41.050> off

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
objects in the scene actually bounce off

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.979 
objects in the scene actually bounce off
the<00:03:41.560> wall<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:42.010> you<00:03:42.610> can<00:03:42.730> see<00:03:42.940> them<00:03:43.180> they're

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
the wall and you can see them they're

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.479 
the wall and you can see them they're
actually<00:03:44.350> lighting<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.830> environment<00:03:45.340> and

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
actually lighting the environment and

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.070 
actually lighting the environment and
they<00:03:45.790> are<00:03:45.940> letting<00:03:46.150> yet<00:03:46.480> so<00:03:46.690> they<00:03:46.840> like

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
they are letting yet so they like

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.199 
they are letting yet so they like
kicking<00:03:47.620> out<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:48.070> also<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.519> effects<00:03:48.880> come

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
kicking out and also the effects come

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.180 
kicking out and also the effects come
down<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.720> then<00:03:49.840> bounce<00:03:50.290> around<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.830> little<00:03:50.980> bit

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
down and then bounce around a little bit

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.770 
down and then bounce around a little bit
give<00:03:51.550> a<00:03:51.580> nice<00:03:51.790> so<00:03:52.000> they<00:03:52.120> all<00:03:52.239> become<00:03:52.540> light

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
give a nice so they all become light

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.110 
give a nice so they all become light
sources<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.500> they're<00:03:53.590> cast<00:03:53.860> shadows<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.970> can

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
sources and they're cast shadows you can

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.550 
sources and they're cast shadows you can
just<00:03:55.269> see<00:03:55.420> it<00:03:55.540> as<00:03:55.570> a<00:03:55.690> fantastic<00:03:56.380> system

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
just see it as a fantastic system

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.680 
just see it as a fantastic system
absolutely<00:03:57.340> exquisite<00:03:57.730> now<00:03:58.180> these<00:03:58.360> little

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
absolutely exquisite now these little

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.080 
absolutely exquisite now these little
tiny<00:03:58.900> details<00:03:59.410> is<00:04:00.130> what<00:04:00.430> increases<00:04:00.790> the

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
tiny details is what increases the

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.630 
tiny details is what increases the
production<00:04:01.420> value<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:02.140> games<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.890> we<00:04:03.400> see

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
production value of games and we see

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.170 
production value of games and we see
this<00:04:03.670> with<00:04:04.480> movies<00:04:04.810> today<00:04:05.610> there<00:04:06.610> are<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.000> many

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
this with movies today there are so many

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.729 
this with movies today there are so many
things<00:04:07.390> that<00:04:07.510> they<00:04:07.720> do<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:08.170> attention<00:04:08.709> to

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
things that they do the attention to

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.500 
things that they do the attention to
detail<00:04:08.830> that<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.700> obvious<00:04:10.090> do<00:04:10.209> you<00:04:10.300> don't

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
detail that the obvious do you don't

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.810 
detail that the obvious do you don't
have<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:10.959> do<00:04:11.080> they<00:04:11.800> obviously<00:04:12.040> don't<00:04:12.459> have<00:04:12.580> to

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
have to do they obviously don't have to
