Solar Decathlon and Lea and Newton are
going<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.770> tell<00:00:04.920> us<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.069> little<00:00:05.160> bit<00:00:05.310> about<00:00:05.430> the

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
going to tell us a little bit about the

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.639 
going to tell us a little bit about the
project<00:00:06.150> it's<00:00:06.990> got<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.170> really<00:00:07.319> interesting

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
project it's got a really interesting

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.970 
project it's got a really interesting
roof<00:00:08.610> design<00:00:09.150> it<00:00:09.570> looks<00:00:09.840> like<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.410> have<00:00:10.440> two

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
roof design it looks like you have two

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.110 
roof design it looks like you have two
different<00:00:11.160> approaches<00:00:11.519> can<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.849> tell<00:00:12.000> us<00:00:12.030> a

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
different approaches can you tell us a

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.730 
different approaches can you tell us a
little<00:00:12.210> about<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.630> yeah<00:00:13.230> well<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
little about that yeah well this is the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.189 
little about that yeah well this is the
University<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.309> Maryland's<00:00:14.580> watershed<00:00:15.199> we

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
University of Maryland's watershed we

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.439 
University of Maryland's watershed we
use<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.529> Chesapeake<00:00:17.010> Bay<00:00:17.039> outside<00:00:17.760> of

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
use the Chesapeake Bay outside of

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.420 
use the Chesapeake Bay outside of
Baltimore<00:00:18.960> sort<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> design<00:00:19.680> inspiration

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
Baltimore sort of a design inspiration

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.269 
Baltimore sort of a design inspiration
to<00:00:20.460> look<00:00:20.910> beyond<00:00:21.480> energy<00:00:22.410> consumption<00:00:23.070> which

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
to look beyond energy consumption which

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.769 
to look beyond energy consumption which
is<00:00:23.430> sort<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.850> number<00:00:24.090> one<00:00:24.240> thing<00:00:24.480> for<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
is sort of the number one thing for the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.099 
is sort of the number one thing for the
project<00:00:25.849> into<00:00:26.849> water<00:00:27.210> consumption<00:00:27.689> which<00:00:27.960> is

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
project into water consumption which is

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.109 
project into water consumption which is
really<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.320> next<00:00:28.560> big<00:00:28.890> issue<00:00:29.160> we're<00:00:30.090> dealing

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
really the next big issue we're dealing

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.440 
really the next big issue we're dealing
with<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.109> our<00:00:31.619> house<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.520> constructed<00:00:33.090> using

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
with so our house is constructed using

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.290 
with so our house is constructed using
two<00:00:33.989> different<00:00:34.469> modules<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.640> north<00:00:35.850> module

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
two different modules the north module

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.060 
two different modules the north module
being<00:00:36.480> sort<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> public<00:00:37.230> realm<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.860> south

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
constructed wetlands which actually

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.719 
constructed wetlands which actually
filter<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.560> grey<00:01:07.710> water<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.159> allow<00:01:08.369> us<00:01:08.549> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
filter the grey water and allow us to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.359 
filter the grey water and allow us to
reuse<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.240> for<00:01:09.270> irrigation<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.710> home<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.370 
standard or is our structural system is
uses<00:01:47.329> a<00:01:47.420> tongue-and-groove<00:01:47.659> decking<00:01:48.350> which

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
uses a tongue-and-groove decking which

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.139 
uses a tongue-and-groove decking which
it<00:01:48.619> allows<00:01:48.860> us<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:49.220> span<00:01:49.490> on<00:01:49.640> four<00:01:49.939> foot

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
it allows us to span on four foot

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.870 
it allows us to span on four foot
centers<00:01:50.539> and<00:01:50.780> by<00:01:51.439> going<00:01:51.799> that<00:01:52.070> it's<00:01:52.369> a<00:01:52.549> unique

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
centers and by going that it's a unique

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.310 
centers and by going that it's a unique
structural<00:01:53.420> system<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.020> we've<00:01:54.140> actually

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
structural system so we've actually

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.620 
structural system so we've actually
highlighted<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.100> on<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.369> inside<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:55.970> the

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
highlighted that on the inside and the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.230 
highlighted that on the inside and the
structural<00:01:57.110> frame<00:01:57.409> marches<00:01:58.009> as<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:58.939> go<00:01:59.090> down

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
structural frame marches as you go down

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.850 
structural frame marches as you go down
the<00:01:59.299> house<00:01:59.569> on<00:01:59.840> four<00:02:00.110> foot<00:02:00.319> centers<00:02:00.649> which

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
the house on four foot centers which

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.740 
the house on four foot centers which
creates<00:02:01.189> a<00:02:01.250> nice<00:02:01.399> rhythm<00:02:01.670> which<00:02:02.420> will<00:02:02.569> break

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
creates a nice rhythm which will break

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.899 
creates a nice rhythm which will break
up<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:03.020> space<00:02:03.259> on<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.560> ends<00:02:03.770> here<00:02:03.920> now<00:02:04.759> will

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
up the space on the ends here now will

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.910 
up the space on the ends here now will
you<00:02:04.939> have<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.240> deconstruct<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.560> house<00:02:06.710> to

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
you have to deconstruct the house to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.650 
you have to deconstruct the house to
that<00:02:07.069> point<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.520> move<00:02:07.729> it<00:02:07.909> or<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.330> just<00:02:08.450> break

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
that point to move it or you just break

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.660 
that point to move it or you just break
it<00:02:08.810> into<00:02:08.929> two<00:02:09.080> separate<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:10.190> actually<00:02:10.519> breaks

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
it into two separate it actually breaks

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.120 
it into two separate it actually breaks
into<00:02:10.910> five<00:02:11.150> separate<00:02:11.540> parts<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.680> two<00:02:12.860> modules

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
into five separate parts the two modules

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.729 
into five separate parts the two modules
the<00:02:14.090> three<00:02:14.330> modules<00:02:14.540> break<00:02:15.019> apart<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.680> then

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
the three modules break apart and then

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.559 
the three modules break apart and then
the<00:02:15.890> roofs<00:02:16.099> actually<00:02:16.489> come<00:02:16.700> off<00:02:16.880> okay<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
the roofs actually come off okay and

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.210 
the roofs actually come off okay and
then<00:02:17.810> they'll<00:02:17.989> be<00:02:18.019> put<00:02:18.319> back<00:02:18.470> together<00:02:18.680> on<00:02:19.130> a

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
then they'll be put back together on a

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.240 
then they'll be put back together on a
national<00:02:19.549> mall<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.799> do<00:02:21.799> you<00:02:21.890> guys<00:02:21.950> have<00:02:22.099> any

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
national mall and do you guys have any

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.259
