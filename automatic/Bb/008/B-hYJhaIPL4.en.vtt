00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:13.310
 well then we'll see how it's possible now 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:16.640
 pass from a number in base 2 and a 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:21.080
 number in base 10 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.800
 suppose we have the number 10 01 in 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:29.230
 base 2 and we want to see what is his 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.739
 correspondent based 10 core we give that 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:37.069
 base 2 we mean that numbers can 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:40.370
 use only 0 and 1 but 16 want 

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:44.109
 say that numbers can be formed 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.760
 from all digits ranging from 0 to 9 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.559
 what is the general rule for passing 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.199
 for numbers in base 2 to the number in base 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.069
 10 general rule is the following 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:58.850
 given the number based on 2 what we do 

00:00:55.069 --> 00:01:01.010
 we mark the positions so let's start from 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.530
 zero this number is in one 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.030
 position 0 here we are an opposition 1 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.219
 here we are in position 2 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.229
 so we are in opposition because there 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:12.610
 need the positions of the numbers there 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.820
 need for that the algorithm of 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.640
 conversion uses these these 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.229
 positions always start from the right 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.729
 to the left it starts from the first number 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:33.590
 of the first digit from the most to the right and yes 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:37.000
 writes 1x2 raised to the position where 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.939
 the number is therefore two to zero 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.810
 in this case we have zero then zero for 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.179
 two 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.799
 let's see position 1 then 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:54.020
 raised to 1 plus we see the position 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:02:01.280
 then zero for two raised to 2 plus 1 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:02.790
 x 2 a high position 3 that happens 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.950
 here now 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.500
 we make this summation here 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.400
 we have one for 2 to 0 2 to 0 and 1 then 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.490
 one by one and one more here we have 0 0 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.970
 which multiplies a quantity is always 0 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.160
 more 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.540
 same speech for a candle that mortifies and 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.110
 two squared 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:27.180
 here at 0 here we have one that multiplies 2 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.970
 to the 32 to three equal to 8 then here 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.770
 we have an ugly that equals 8 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:40.800
 adding this quantity here we have that 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:48.170
 eight plus 19 then 1001 in base 2 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:51.510
 becomes 9 in base 10 and this algorithm 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.600
 general that you use to switch from 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.630
 base 2 numbers so they use 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.270
 only 0 1 0 and 1 then binary numbers 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.670
 the base ten numbers all use 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.670
 the figures ranging from zero to 9
