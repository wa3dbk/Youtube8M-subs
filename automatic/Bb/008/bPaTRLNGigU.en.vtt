00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
by the way and then this is like the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.530 
by the way and then this is like the
house<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.950> two<00:01:41.130> chests<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.549> furnace<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
house I have two chests of furnace and a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.600 
house I have two chests of furnace and a
crafting<00:01:42.960> table<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.350> then<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
crafting table and then you have a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.819 
crafting table and then you have a
little<00:01:44.939> see-through<00:01:45.509> floor<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.649> see

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
little see-through floor so you can see

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.530 
little see-through floor so you can see
with<00:01:46.920> failure<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.000> also<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.210> some

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
with failure and you also have some

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
with failure and you also have some
windows<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.079> see<00:01:49.290> out<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.770> both<00:01:50.009> sides

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
windows you can see out of on both sides

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.109 
windows you can see out of on both sides
so<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.890> going<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> place<00:01:53.939> we

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
so this is going to be like a place we

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.499 
so this is going to be like a place we
can<00:01:54.180> sleep<00:01:54.710> now<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.880> special<00:01:56.880> part<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.360> this

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
can sleep now the special part with this

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.719 
can sleep now the special part with this
block<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.590> teleports<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.280> down<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.579> that

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
block is it teleports you down to that

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.450 
block is it teleports you down to that
one<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.060> those<00:02:00.180> two<00:02:00.530> blue<00:02:01.530> blue<00:02:01.950> blocks<00:02:02.219> down

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
one of those two blue blue blocks down

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.880 
one of those two blue blue blocks down
at<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.030> bottom<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:04.049> when<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.229> jump<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.740> it

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
at the bottom so when you jump on it it

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.649 
at the bottom so when you jump on it it
teleports<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.520> down<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.759> there<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.090> then<00:02:06.149> so

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
teleports it down to there and then so

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.969 
teleports it down to there and then so
you<00:02:06.750> get<00:02:06.899> up<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.140> down<00:02:07.320> between<00:02:07.530> thing

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
you get up and down between thing

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.800 
you get up and down between thing
without<00:02:08.220> dying

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
without dying

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.920 
without dying
but<00:02:10.810> uh<00:02:11.220> that's<00:02:12.220> apparently<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.670> mod<00:02:12.930> it

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
but uh that's apparently the mod it

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.500 
but uh that's apparently the mod it
generates<00:02:14.590> everything<00:02:14.920> for<00:02:15.100> you<00:02:15.190> but<00:02:15.880> say

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
generates everything for you but say

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.610 
generates everything for you but say
that<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.720> want<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:16.900> remove<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.350> for

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
that you want to remove this for

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.530 
that you want to remove this for
whatever<00:02:17.830> reason<00:02:18.280> all<00:02:18.819> you<00:02:19.060> do<00:02:19.240> is<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.420> could

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
whatever reason all you do is you could

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.000 
whatever reason all you do is you could
break<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.230> block<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.650> then<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:20.860> have<00:02:20.950> this

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
break the block and then you have this

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.920 
break the block and then you have this
little<00:02:21.130> red<00:02:21.340> block<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:22.000> when<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.660> click<00:02:22.780> on

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
little red block and when you click on

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.809 
little red block and when you click on
it<00:02:23.110> or<00:02:23.560> destroy<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.130> when<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.340> remove<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.640> I'm

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
generating of this building right here

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.540 
generating of this building right here
took<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> while<00:02:46.140> because<00:02:47.140> there's<00:02:47.769> it's<00:02:48.340> just
