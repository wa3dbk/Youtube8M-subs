00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
is in the fuel door and it's worked out

00:00:59.219 --> 00:00:59.959 
is in the fuel door and it's worked out
really<00:00:59.489> well

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
really well

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.619 
really well
just<00:01:00.539> right<00:01:00.750> there<00:01:00.960> above<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.260> gas<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:03.480> we

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
just right there above the gas and we

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.479 
just right there above the gas and we
can<00:01:03.780> take<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.409> off<00:01:04.619> real<00:01:04.830> easily<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.369> have

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
can take this off real easily and have

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.490 
can take this off real easily and have
access<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.909> both<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.479> he<00:01:06.570> still<00:01:06.810> has<00:01:06.840> room<00:01:07.260> I

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
access to both so he still has room I

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.980 
access to both so he still has room I
find<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.400> probably<00:01:08.700> about<00:01:08.760> run<00:01:09.119> 50/50<00:01:09.840> on

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
find that it probably about run 50/50 on

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.469 
find that it probably about run 50/50 on
my<00:01:10.110> ability<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> put<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> fuel<00:01:12.240> door

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
my ability to put it in the fuel door

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.240 
my ability to put it in the fuel door
but<00:01:12.869> when<00:01:13.020> possible<00:01:13.260> we'd<00:01:13.710> love<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
but when possible we'd love to do it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.539 
but when possible we'd love to do it
that<00:01:14.460> way<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:15.350> little<00:01:16.350> more<00:01:16.500> labor<00:01:16.860> that's<00:01:17.280> for

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
that way a little more labor that's for

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.929 
that way a little more labor that's for
sure<00:01:17.759> here's<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.750> tank<00:01:19.220> it's<00:01:20.220> well<00:01:20.430> secured

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
sure here's the tank it's well secured

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.249 
sure here's the tank it's well secured
in<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.119> back<00:01:21.360> we've<00:01:21.570> got<00:01:21.600> plate<00:01:21.960> steel

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
in the back we've got plate steel

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.190 
in the back we've got plate steel
underneath<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:24.030> used<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.479> existing

underneath and we used the existing
carpet<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.580> secured<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.600> above<00:01:27.900> there

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
carpet and just secured it above there

you have this feed coming right here out

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.180 
you have this feed coming right here out
to<00:03:12.390> follow<00:03:12.990> that<00:03:13.290> through<00:03:13.560> we<00:03:13.800> go<00:03:13.920> through<00:03:14.160> our

fuel rail which is right here and this

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.930 
fuel rail which is right here and this
is<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.200> four<00:03:19.410> cylinder<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:20.040> obviously<00:03:20.400> one<00:03:20.640> fuel

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
is a four cylinder so obviously one fuel

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.240 
is a four cylinder so obviously one fuel
rail<00:03:21.180> here's<00:03:21.840> our<00:03:22.020> vacuum<00:03:22.230> line<00:03:22.650> which<00:03:22.950> goes

map<00:03:40.620> sensor<00:03:40.890> right<00:03:41.220> here<00:03:41.990> mounted<00:03:42.990> right

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
map sensor right here mounted right

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.270 
map sensor right here mounted right
there<00:03:43.440> okay<00:03:44.720> we've<00:03:45.720> got<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.110> main<00:03:46.650> fuse<00:03:47.010> right

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
there okay we've got the main fuse right

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:59.390 
there okay we've got the main fuse right
here<00:03:47.520> for<00:03:47.700> easy<00:03:47.880> access<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:57.980> let's<00:03:58.980> see<00:03:59.190> if<00:03:59.220> we

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
here for easy access and let's see if we

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.510 
here for easy access and let's see if we
can<00:03:59.490> get<00:03:59.580> a<00:03:59.610> good<00:03:59.850> shot<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.209> these<00:04:01.520> injector

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
can get a good shot of these injector

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.920 
can get a good shot of these injector
nozzles<00:04:03.830> there<00:04:04.830> we<00:04:05.040> go<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:05.459> this<00:04:05.720> there's<00:04:06.720> the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
nozzles there we go so this there's the

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.750 
nozzles there we go so this there's the
tubing<00:04:07.380> running<00:04:07.830> right<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.280> injector

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
tubing running right to the injector

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.710 
tubing running right to the injector
nozzle<00:04:09.240> and<00:04:09.830> it's<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:11.610> there's<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.450> dark

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
nozzle and it's and there's the the dark

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.900 
nozzle and it's and there's the the dark
block<00:04:13.020> is<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.440> actual<00:04:13.800> intake<00:04:14.070> manifold<00:04:14.670> and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
block is the actual intake manifold and

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.849 
block is the actual intake manifold and
he<00:04:15.630> just<00:04:15.810> drilled<00:04:16.080> right<00:04:16.230> into<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.650> plastic

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
he just drilled right into the plastic

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.099 
he just drilled right into the plastic
left<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.520> manifold<00:04:18.000> intact

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
left the manifold intact

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.450 
left the manifold intact
and<00:04:19.459> just<00:04:20.459> just<00:04:20.730> drilled<00:04:21.239> right<00:04:21.390> in<00:04:21.600> and

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
and just just drilled right in and

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.840 
and just just drilled right in and
pretty<00:04:23.460> simple

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
pretty simple

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.400 
pretty simple
yeah<00:04:24.210> just<00:04:24.479> put<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.660> little<00:04:24.840> bit<00:04:24.930> of<00:04:25.050> grease<00:04:25.260> on

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
yeah just put a little bit of grease on

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.160 
yeah just put a little bit of grease on
the<00:04:25.560> bit<00:04:25.770> and

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
the bit and

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.190 
the bit and
on<00:04:26.230> the<00:04:26.350> path<00:04:26.560> and<00:04:27.330> any<00:04:28.330> savings<00:04:28.840> in<00:04:28.990> there<00:04:29.170> I

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
on the path and any savings in there I

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.020 
on the path and any savings in there I
don't<00:04:29.350> think<00:04:29.560> collected<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.520> majority<00:04:30.970> of

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
don't think collected the majority of

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.510 
don't think collected the majority of
your<00:04:31.150> plastic<00:04:31.420> shavings<00:04:32.080> on<00:04:32.440> plastic<00:04:33.100> we<00:04:33.250> just

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
your plastic shavings on plastic we just

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.670 
your plastic shavings on plastic we just
drill<00:04:33.760> right<00:04:33.970> through<00:04:34.000> but<00:04:34.900> we<00:04:35.140> find<00:04:35.500> if<00:04:35.650> we

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
drill right through but we find if we

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.560 
drill right through but we find if we
put<00:04:35.890> a<00:04:35.920> little<00:04:35.950> grease<00:04:36.310> on<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.610> top<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.090> on

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
put a little grease on the top and on

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.360 
put a little grease on the top and on
the<00:04:37.690> drill<00:04:37.930> bit<00:04:38.140> will<00:04:38.410> we're<00:04:38.770> able<00:04:38.890> to<00:04:39.100> collect

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
the drill bit will we're able to collect

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.210 
the drill bit will we're able to collect
right<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.660> majority<00:04:41.140> of<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.350> shavings<00:04:41.800> as<00:04:41.980> we

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
right the majority of the shavings as we

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.950 
right the majority of the shavings as we
about<00:04:42.730> ready<00:04:42.940> to<00:04:43.000> break<00:04:43.150> through<00:04:43.510> we<00:04:43.690> dip<00:04:43.870> it

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
about ready to break through we dip it

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.440 
about ready to break through we dip it
in<00:04:44.050> Greece<00:04:44.290> they<00:04:44.890> can<00:04:45.010> continue<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.520> che<00:04:45.790> drill

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
in Greece they can continue to che drill

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.870 
in Greece they can continue to che drill
through<00:04:46.780> so<00:04:47.560> any<00:04:47.590> check<00:04:48.160> engine<00:04:48.370> lights<00:04:48.640> with

think it's about 20 hours 20 hours who
have<00:05:20.440> tanked<00:05:20.740> everything<00:05:21.490> yep

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
have tanked everything yep

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.960 
have tanked everything yep
okay<00:05:22.630> I<00:05:22.780> recorded<00:05:23.350> my<00:05:23.530> time<00:05:23.770> I<00:05:23.800> was<00:05:24.070> 20<00:05:24.400> to<00:05:24.520> 25

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
okay I recorded my time I was 20 to 25

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.660 
okay I recorded my time I was 20 to 25
hours<00:05:25.000> total<00:05:25.510> okay<00:05:25.870> well<00:05:26.770> yeah<00:05:27.010> and<00:05:27.220> the<00:05:27.310> tank

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
hours total okay well yeah and the tank

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.100 
hours total okay well yeah and the tank
you<00:05:27.790> would<00:05:27.940> think<00:05:28.120> is<00:05:28.300> how<00:05:28.420> much<00:05:28.600> of<00:05:28.630> that<00:05:28.870> time

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
you would think is how much of that time

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.980 
you would think is how much of that time
it's<00:05:29.740> one<00:05:30.490> third<00:05:30.730> good<00:05:31.390> eight<00:05:31.570> to<00:05:31.780> 10<00:05:31.960> hours

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
it's one third good eight to 10 hours

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.590 
it's one third good eight to 10 hours
yeah<00:05:32.680> yeah<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:33.340> tank<00:05:33.580> the<00:05:33.940> tank<00:05:34.120> is<00:05:34.390> where

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
yeah yeah the tank the tank is where

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.720 
yeah yeah the tank the tank is where
especially<00:05:35.080> doing<00:05:35.500> stuff<00:05:35.770> like<00:05:35.890> he<00:05:36.160> did<00:05:36.400> doing

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
especially doing stuff like he did doing
