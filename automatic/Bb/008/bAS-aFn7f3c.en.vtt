very<00:00:08.340> important<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:09.000> have<00:00:09.059> read<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.450> manual

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
very important to have read the manual

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.390 
very important to have read the manual
follow<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> steps<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.769> we've<00:00:10.980> just<00:00:11.160> talked

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
follow the steps that we've just talked

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.910 
follow the steps that we've just talked
about<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.960> otherwise<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.139> can<00:00:13.380> result<00:00:13.710> in

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
about and otherwise you can result in

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.829 
about and otherwise you can result in
locking<00:00:14.519> up<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.759> receiver<00:00:15.089> now<00:00:15.389> it's<00:00:15.630> not<00:00:15.780> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
locking up the receiver now it's not a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.330 
locking up the receiver now it's not a
fault<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.289> receiver<00:00:16.619> it's<00:00:16.949> actually<00:00:17.310> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
fault of the receiver it's actually a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.790 
fault of the receiver it's actually a
user<00:00:17.699> error<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.990> way<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.260> can<00:00:19.410> happen<00:00:19.529> is

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
user error and the way it can happen is

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.620 
user error and the way it can happen is
if<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.189> don't<00:00:20.220> hold<00:00:20.699> down<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.180> button<00:00:21.210> long

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
if you don't hold down the button long

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.450 
if you don't hold down the button long
enough<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.080> get<00:00:22.199> your<00:00:22.380> confirming<00:00:22.949> tone<00:00:23.189> so

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
enough to get your confirming tone so

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.179 
enough to get your confirming tone so
just<00:00:23.640> remember<00:00:23.789> always<00:00:24.240> wait<00:00:24.600> for<00:00:24.630> your<00:00:24.930> tones

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
just remember always wait for your tones

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.560 
just remember always wait for your tones
I've<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.250> demonstrate<00:00:26.910> how<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.150> can<00:00:27.449> go

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
I've just demonstrate how it can go

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.870 
I've just demonstrate how it can go
wrong<00:00:27.810> if<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.470> don't<00:00:28.710> hold<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.039> down<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.550> say

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
wrong if you don't hold it down so say

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.049 
wrong if you don't hold it down so say
if<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.090> want<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.330> program<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.170> tone<00:00:31.640> I've<00:00:32.640> got<00:00:32.940> my

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
if I want to program in tone I've got my

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.450 
if I want to program in tone I've got my
light<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.420> tone<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> whole<00:00:34.710> power<00:00:35.100> button

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
light on tone and the whole power button

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.040 
light on tone and the whole power button
and<00:00:35.579> rather<00:00:35.969> than<00:00:36.149> waiting<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.840> tube

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and rather than waiting for the tube

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.740 
and rather than waiting for the tube
confirmation<00:00:37.710> tones<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.430> see<00:00:38.640> now<00:00:38.850> it's

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
confirmation tones you can see now it's

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.450 
confirmation tones you can see now it's
locked<00:00:40.079> up<00:00:40.290> because<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.680> haven't<00:00:40.950> held<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
locked up because I haven't held the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.430 
locked up because I haven't held the
button<00:00:41.640> down<00:00:41.910> long<00:00:41.940> enough<00:00:42.149> now<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.290> does

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
button down long enough now if it does

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.110 
button down long enough now if it does
happen<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.129> receive<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> freezes<00:00:44.940> up

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
happen and you receive a freezes up

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.840 
happen and you receive a freezes up

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
simple case hold down whichever light is

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.360 
simple case hold down whichever light is
illuminated<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:49.230> then<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.250> take

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
illuminated and then you it will take

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.670 
illuminated and then you it will take
you<00:00:50.579> back<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.350> then<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.559> can

carry on as normal hold down your tone

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.889 
carry on as normal hold down your tone
and<00:00:54.980> suggest<00:00:55.980> select<00:00:56.550> your<00:00:56.640> head<00:00:56.850> there<00:00:57.090> by

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
wait for the confirmation tones if you

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.700 
wait for the confirmation tones if you
do<00:01:02.789> experience<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.480> loss<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.840> power<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.409> the
