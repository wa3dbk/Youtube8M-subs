00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.550
 everything starts with copper copper 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.100
 conducts heat and energy without hardly 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.010
 losses here it becomes wire 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.100
 very thin for the manufacture of cable 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.590
 the brox family business that is are 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.470
 the special wires cables that serve 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.440
 to set in motion cars and trains 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.100
 robots because they transmit energy and data 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.680
 in real time 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.620
 for it the copper wire if it has 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.899
 that braid isolate and wire how 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.989
 doing it exactly is something that decides 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.620
 sabina brox who is technical director of 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.620
 manufacturing 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.600
 well there are many tricks for 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.660
 make the cable like this especially when 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.840
 we have unconventional models but 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.110
 I think I should not talk more about these 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.660
 exact company secrets 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.200
 the secrets of this company remain in 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.200
 the family 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.010
 the youngest member has six weeks 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.210
 smith and peter 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.800
 will grow here and of course a lot will happen 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.860
 time here because I'm very 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.630
 involved in the business I think what 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.970
 I will bring with me when I come for 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.590
 company on weekends with the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.630
 clear hope that I develop 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.630
 interest in cable and drivers 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.619
 like his mother that I came brox that is 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.890
 will continue with the business direction 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:49.710
 better brox that is founded the company in 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.320
 1947 and then he passed it on to his son 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.490
 long ago no sir brox 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.780
 that will be 26 years 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.700
 now the son is the boss 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.399
 as arrived 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.450
 and many memories he grew the 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.819
 esabe abel company bills more than 90 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.160
 million euros around the world the 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.489
 company now belongs to the third 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.099
 sabine brox generation that is has the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.200
 most part but decisions are made 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.019
 jointly as on the investments 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.310
 here a new ship will be built 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.349
 production we still have some area in 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.340
 white on the world map in 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:37.549
 south america the next east in africa 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.620
 we are not especially strong though 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.590
 we are considering south africa as 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.560
 industrial site we still have 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.890
 plans advocating mission 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.870
 and certainly also problems in the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.450
 countries of southern Europe bursts 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.940
 crisis and with it according to the demand of 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.040
 cable and for such a manual job 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.310
 German is no longer a place 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.310
 cheap to produce the competition what 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.590
 manufactures cheaper and in other places 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.530
 we are twice as expensive as in Asia that 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.860
 it's clear and how they do it to have 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.200
 customers look at all this here 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.620
 goes for asia for a german manufacturer 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.290
 of machines we are not so far from 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.090
 our clients know where they have 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.489
 the problems and we are the 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.140
 we solve we are not distributors of 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.140
 cables we are problem solvers 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.700
 solutions like this a customer wants 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.130
 transmit data and energy for the same 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.880
 cable without distortion in the signal 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.280
 even when there are overloads that bird 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.830
 measured in the laboratory how many cycles of 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.240
 Bending endures have to be millions 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:54.470
 Yes of course I'm going and where there are problems 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.470
 she will solve it
