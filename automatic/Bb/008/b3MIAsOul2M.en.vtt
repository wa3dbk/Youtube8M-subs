its gonna do is get a lot more out to

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.799 
its gonna do is get a lot more out to
CPU<00:00:35.810> and<00:00:35.930> a<00:00:35.989> GPU<00:00:36.370> inseams<00:00:37.370> of<00:00:37.489> graphics<00:00:37.910> and

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
CPU and a GPU inseams of graphics and

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.299 
CPU and a GPU inseams of graphics and
this<00:00:38.960> is<00:00:39.109> really<00:00:39.260> great<00:00:39.500> news<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.100> we're<00:00:40.219> gonna

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
this is really great news so we're gonna

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.569 
this is really great news so we're gonna
get<00:00:40.550> a<00:00:40.730> lot<00:00:41.300> better<00:00:41.480> SDKs<00:00:42.260> out<00:00:42.590> now<00:00:43.190> for<00:00:43.340> anyone

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
get a lot better SDKs out now for anyone

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.369 
get a lot better SDKs out now for anyone
who<00:00:43.640> doesn't<00:00:43.760> know<00:00:43.850> what<00:00:43.969> an<00:00:44.030> SDK<00:00:44.539> is<00:00:44.750> it's<00:00:45.079> a

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
who doesn't know what an SDK is it's a

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.340 
who doesn't know what an SDK is it's a
software<00:00:45.769> development<00:00:46.250> kit<00:00:46.489> for<00:00:46.850> developers

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
software development kit for developers

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.229 
software development kit for developers
so<00:00:48.350> what<00:00:48.469> it<00:00:48.559> means<00:00:48.590> is<00:00:48.920> just<00:00:48.980> easier<00:00:49.730> used<00:00:50.089> to

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
so what it means is just easier used to

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.029 
so what it means is just easier used to
develop<00:00:50.600> for<00:00:50.719> the<00:00:50.780> platform<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:51.890> you'll

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
develop for the platform so you'll

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.740 
develop for the platform so you'll
squeeze<00:00:52.280> more<00:00:52.730> juice<00:00:52.969> out<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.269> box

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
squeeze more juice out the box

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.959 
squeeze more juice out the box
so<00:00:54.230> you're<00:00:54.350> basically<00:00:54.469> gonna<00:00:54.890> get<00:00:55.129> better

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
so you're basically gonna get better

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.540 
so you're basically gonna get better
graphics<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:56.780> better<00:00:57.140> visuals<00:00:57.649> the

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
graphics and better visuals the

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.739 
graphics and better visuals the
developers<00:00:58.940> don't<00:00:58.999> have<00:00:59.089> to<00:00:59.210> play<00:00:59.420> around

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
developers don't have to play around

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:01.479 
developers don't have to play around
trying<00:01:00.050> to<00:01:00.109> find<00:01:00.440> I<00:01:00.559> was<00:01:00.679> how<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:00.829> develop<00:01:01.280> for

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
trying to find I was how to develop for

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.700 
trying to find I was how to develop for
it'll<00:01:01.879> to<00:01:01.969> be<00:01:02.059> easier<00:01:02.539> for<00:01:02.780> them<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:03.469> will<00:01:03.589> to

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
it'll to be easier for them so will to

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.620 
it'll to be easier for them so will to
get<00:01:03.859> better<00:01:04.070> games<00:01:04.370> and<00:01:04.760> it'll<00:01:04.940> come<00:01:05.120> faster

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
get better games and it'll come faster

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.899 
get better games and it'll come faster
and<00:01:05.930> obviously<00:01:06.830> look<00:01:07.220> a<00:01:07.250> hell<00:01:07.580> of<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.760> lot

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
and obviously look a hell of a lot

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.240 
and obviously look a hell of a lot
better<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:09.020> this<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.260> really<00:01:09.470> good<00:01:09.770> news<00:01:09.980> if

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
better so this is really good news if

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.180 
better so this is really good news if
you<00:01:10.340> got<00:01:10.430> an<00:01:10.520> Xbox<00:01:10.910> one<00:01:11.560> you<00:01:12.560> know<00:01:12.680> I've<00:01:12.980> seen

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
you got an Xbox one you know I've seen

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.060 
you got an Xbox one you know I've seen
before<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.520> Xbox<00:01:13.910> come<00:01:14.540> out<00:01:14.720> my<00:01:15.710> stuff<00:01:15.920> had<00:01:16.040> a

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
before the Xbox come out my stuff had a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.830 
before the Xbox come out my stuff had a
bit<00:01:16.280> of<00:01:16.370> time<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:16.940> like<00:01:17.060> go<00:01:17.240> back<00:01:17.450> in<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:17.690> up

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
bit of time so like go back in and up

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.810 
bit of time so like go back in and up
the<00:01:17.960> CPU<00:01:18.440> and<00:01:18.650> then<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.040> next<00:01:19.250> month<00:01:19.370> you<00:01:19.490> open

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
the CPU and then the next month you open

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.240 
the CPU and then the next month you open
a<00:01:19.880> GPU<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:21.350> Microsoft<00:01:21.770> have<00:01:21.860> known<00:01:22.040> about

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
a GPU and Microsoft have known about

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.670 
a GPU and Microsoft have known about
this<00:01:22.520> they<00:01:22.700> know<00:01:22.910> this<00:01:23.150> is<00:01:23.300> common<00:01:23.690> that's<00:01:24.440> why

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
this they know this is common that's why

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.530 
this they know this is common that's why
I<00:01:24.710> think<00:01:24.920> even<00:01:25.250> going<00:01:25.640> on<00:01:25.760> about<00:01:26.120> what's<00:01:26.270> yes

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
I think even going on about what's yes

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.840 
I think even going on about what's yes
ROM<00:01:26.870> and<00:01:27.280> Microsoft<00:01:28.280> know<00:01:28.460> about<00:01:28.700> this

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
ROM and Microsoft know about this

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.040 
ROM and Microsoft know about this
because<00:01:29.150> of<00:01:29.240> sleep<00:01:29.750> with<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.020> child

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
because of sleep with the child

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.470 
because of sleep with the child
resources<00:01:30.950> what<00:01:31.640> that<00:01:31.790> is<00:01:31.970> basically

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
resources what that is basically

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.260 
resources what that is basically
basically<00:01:32.990> is<00:01:33.470> they<00:01:33.620> can<00:01:33.770> store<00:01:34.010> six<00:01:34.700> gigs<00:01:35.000> of

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
basically is they can store six gigs of

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.570 
basically is they can store six gigs of
texture<00:01:35.750> files<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.440> it<00:01:36.890> takes<00:01:37.130> less<00:01:37.340> strain

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
texture files and it takes less strain

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.700 
texture files and it takes less strain
on<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.760> hardware<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:38.870> it<00:01:38.900> usually<00:01:39.050> 32

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
on the hardware so it usually 32

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.440 
on the hardware so it usually 32
megabytes<00:01:39.980> both<00:01:40.490> sites<00:01:40.730> here<00:01:40.940> at<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.150> 82

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
megabytes both sites here at the 82

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.840 
megabytes both sites here at the 82
megabytes<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.990> into<00:01:42.140> six<00:01:42.380> gigs<00:01:42.650> so<00:01:43.580> it's<00:01:43.700> quite

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
megabytes it into six gigs so it's quite

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.750 
megabytes it into six gigs so it's quite
complex<00:01:44.270> but<00:01:45.260> if<00:01:45.500> this<00:01:45.830> turns<00:01:46.370> out<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.520> be<00:01:46.610> true

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
complex but if this turns out to be true

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.290 
complex but if this turns out to be true
on<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:46.940> Xbox<00:01:47.330> one<00:01:47.540> this<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:48.170> great<00:01:48.440> news<00:01:49.300> but

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
on the Xbox one this is great news but

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.300 
on the Xbox one this is great news but

it's still early days and we're gonna
have<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.520> wait<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:52.820> see<00:01:52.880> how<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:53.510> plays<00:01:53.630> out<00:01:53.990> at

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
have to wait and see how it plays out at

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.700 
have to wait and see how it plays out at
GDC<00:01:54.880> but<00:01:55.880> at<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.450> moment<00:01:56.600> I'm<00:01:57.140> pretty<00:01:57.410> happy

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
GDC but at the moment I'm pretty happy

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.170 
GDC but at the moment I'm pretty happy
about<00:01:57.740> this<00:01:58.070> it's<00:01:58.280> sort<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.060> look

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
about this it's sort of you to look

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.150 
about this it's sort of you to look
forward<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.720> I<00:01:59.900> think<00:02:00.470> Microsoft<00:02:00.680> have<00:02:01.010> known

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
forward to I think Microsoft have known

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.350 
forward to I think Microsoft have known
this<00:02:01.340> has<00:02:01.490> come<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:01.820> I<00:02:01.850> think<00:02:01.970> it'd<00:02:02.060> be<00:02:02.090> very

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
this has come and I think it'd be very

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.260 
this has come and I think it'd be very
smart<00:02:02.630> on<00:02:02.900> this<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.700> will<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.820> pay<00:02:04.940> off<00:02:04.970> in<00:02:05.210> the

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
smart on this and will it pay off in the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.240 
smart on this and will it pay off in the
long<00:02:05.300> term<00:02:05.690> well<00:02:06.170> we<00:02:06.440> have<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.710> wait<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:06.980> see

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
long term well we have to wait and see
