speed<00:02:07.390> high<00:02:07.750> style<00:02:08.319> trick<00:02:08.890> there's<00:02:09.340> quite<00:02:09.489> a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
speed high style trick there's quite a

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:10.830 
speed high style trick there's quite a
few<00:02:09.610> options<00:02:09.759> where<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.420> can<00:02:10.539> take<00:02:10.690> different

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
few options where you can take different

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.449 
few options where you can take different
lines<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.380> get<00:02:11.470> down<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.739> pipes<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.130> lot<00:02:12.280> of

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
lines to get down the pipes a lot of

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:35.110 
lines to get down the pipes a lot of
opportunities<00:02:13.030> for<00:02:13.150> some<00:02:13.299> original

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120

this day and age you know it's pretty

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.729 
this day and age you know it's pretty
gnarly

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
gnarly

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.289
