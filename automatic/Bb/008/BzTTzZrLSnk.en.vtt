00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.780
 fantastic that counts for now 9 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.030
 tons still underway in Japan 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.309
 the top 6 is planned in France for the 4 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.050
 February and Volume 7 for April 1 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.730
 this mandate you know maybe I do not 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.860
 did not intend to get it for me 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.660
 the base is an office colleague who 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.739
 read it is next to me who knew me 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.270
 to convince me that I needed 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.770
 plunges into the series and I do not 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.879
 regret absolutely not for you 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.470
 summarize the story I can very 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.060
 just read you the fourth of 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.240
 cover of volume 1 which summarizes it 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.820
 excessively well in 2000 xx years 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.530
 totally unknown the current ones 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.509
 humans with supernatural powers are 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.280
 treated as outcasts and locked up on an island 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.290
 prison where the law of the strongest reigns 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.880
 this island these stops said it must 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.979
 know that twelve years ago we have a 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.110
 little flash at the beginning of the manga a star 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.759
 crashed on earth and provoked 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.530
 radiation species that makes that 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.060
 the people who have been affected by these 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.470
 radiation species have become 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.240
 mutants and have developed some 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.650
 powers and from there those people there 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.880
 are considered outcasts there 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.020
 are not considered at all 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.820
 humans are leaving the little ones 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.079
 shut up on the island reacted for them 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.420
 are all gathered at the same place 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.799
 and it's going to be a little bit the law of 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.329
 stronger first of all I ride the 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.799
 covers of the first five volumes that 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.380
 are just gorgeous with the blanket 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.009
 of volume 1 opening of the top 2 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.750
 the volume 3 on the 24th and finally the last one 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.399
 in the month of December the volume 5 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.110
 which immediately conquered me in this 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.119
 manga it's these characters that are 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.890
 very varied and especially at the level of 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.079
 powers here we have multos ad a little bit 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.610
 at the x men this theater of powers all 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.780
 as different from each other 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.399
 does not just have the one of fire 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.500
 that of the class had not changed 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.120
 that it 's nice to see the drawing 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.380
 is clearly one of the biggest 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.290
 forces of this world 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.630
 we have a very detailed side but at the 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.850
 once very dynamic proof so fluid it 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.290
 reads alone it's just beautiful 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.430
 if you want to start the series I 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.660
 advise you to like me 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.550
 you buy the first five volumes 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.290
 all of a sudden because they eat quickly enough 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.819
 and above all you stay a little bit on 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.530
 a dengue suspense at the end of each 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.000
 tome story is pretty dark the 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.130
 fights are very bloody is very 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.840
 unpredictable we have a lot of death from 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.620
 disappearance from the first volumes we have 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.390
 already in the first volumes 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.370
 the appearance of badass characters 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.959
 we know that new characters well 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.310
 badass months by being afterwards and 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.500
 just for that makes you want to read 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.910
 Volume from next editions pika done 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.350
 very nice job since at the beginning of 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.519
 each volume you have pages in 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.470
 color on glossy paper 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.120
 layton are rendered it seems to me price of 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.650
 7 euros vinci most of a little bit 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.850
 expensive but good side of the neck I have 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.260
 absolutely nothing wrong 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.180
 he smiles I strongly advise you if 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.459
 you are looking for a fantastic shonen with 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.530
 a lot of humor action of the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.120
 super characters tying a few 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.769
 flashbacks to explain how 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.630
 some characters got there 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.910
 and what were they before 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.049
 become species of 80 acts usa 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.400
 we could believe that the character 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.140
 mail on the cover of volume 1 is 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.400
 the main character but this is 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.260
 not really him but I leave you 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.880
 discover that it is good that this 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.650
 character there occupies a place enough 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.060
 important in the manga in short I 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.250
 regret not to have looked rather 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.540
 on the show she's really worth the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.160
 detour despite the fact that they are in 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.570
 course which puts me off a little bit 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.250
 buying so also the fact that the 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.140
 writer who worked on zone 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.730
 would be from there to spengler misions 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.709
 in quotation marks to make this series 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.030
 there I say eyelashes done the same with 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.440
 this series to resume yesterday even 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.180
 spencer it's not going to do it but 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.220
 apparently if we take them this year 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.750
 reacted continues his little man's 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.220
 way so it's really two skits 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.660
 which I highly recommend as well 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.430
 ends this video crush a 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.019
 little bit speed and I apologize 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.340
 I hope you will have liked 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.269
 do not hesitate to come to the comment this 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.190
 that you thought 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.870
 if you have already started reacting 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.030
 it's a series that tempts you or 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.350
 maybe not absolutely and I tell you 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.350
 see you soon for a next video
