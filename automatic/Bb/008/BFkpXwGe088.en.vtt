00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.360
 my sent a new gift to you 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.060
 to win a gift that is not other 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.220
 a bluetooth speaker a little bit 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.990
 particular since it was thought 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.150
 to resist splashing 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.730
 basically this speaker is going to you 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.980
 accompany everywhere is included in 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.950
 your bathroom like most 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.559
 pregnant of this type we will find on 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.330
 the picador bluetooth showrunner but the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.530
 softer that will allow him to 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.270
 communicate with any 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.100
 computer with any 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.230
 smartphone and with any 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.910
 touch pad you can very well 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.150
 use it at home connected to your 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.560
 pc or have fun with in the rer 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.610
 in the public transport in him 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.739
 playing music that is 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.509
 stored on your mobile or on your 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.770
 Tablet 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.020
 important clarification the enclosure itself 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.700
 comes in two colors we have a version 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.440
 white or a red version 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.340
 the model that I will make you win 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.800
 this is the red version and to know 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.110
 how to find out how 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.490
 leave with it well it will not be 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.200
 complicated since you will only have 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.630
 follow the link that will appear in the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.729
 video and that will send you back to my 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.350
 article 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.940
 after this light appetizer the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.080
 it's time to take a look 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.380
 firstly to packaging 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.869
 as you can see new god has 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.650
 opted for a box it's pretty enough 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.420
 with shades of black and orange 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.840
 at the level of characteristics when 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.700
 even we can recall them at the level 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.780
 of the enclosure we will find a chip 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.640
 bluetooth 3.0 at the scope level and 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.189
 well she will be able to communicate with a 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.200
 terminal being at maximum said m 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.060
 what is interesting is that 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.890
 the speaker incorporates a battery and she 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.630
 proposes an autonomy of 5 hours in 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.509
 listening or five hours in calls 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.400
 since we can also use it to 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.870
 take our communications at the level of 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.980
 audio outputs we will be entitled to a 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.620
 jack 3 5 mm and then if not otherwise and 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.170
 well 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.390
 at the signal-to-noise ratio we are 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.060
 on 85 db and on a power of 2 2 3 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.810
 watt 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.810
 charging time 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.530
 it is specified here it is from 2 to 3 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.260
 hours the battery capacity of 900 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.670
 millions loses and we are on a 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.400
 device that offers dimensions 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.360
 compact enough for a weight not exceeding 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.560
 not the 230 grams we go now 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.560
 when unpacking the beast 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:57.709
 I open the hood and I come face to face 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:01.269
 with the user manual that will do 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.799
 quick start guide office 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.940
 underneath I have a bag that contains 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.970
 of cables the first is a usb cable 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.230
 which will allow us to connect 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.620
 the speaker a computer or a plug 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.340
 sector to recharge it and then 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.989
 then we have a standard audio cable that 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.329
 will give us the opportunity to the 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.329
 connect to another equipment 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:33.380
 the housing for its part is under 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:38.660
 the secret hatch and she's facing us 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:40.669
 of course that's all the 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.010
 new jo in terms of design one is 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:45.889
 on something rather pretty nose 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.530
 rather refined with lines 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:50.949
 minimalist that will be able to 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.389
 finally with all the interiors 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.880
 the loudspeaker of the speaker is 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.390
 on that 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.720
 an upper face and they surround the 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.670
 single button of the device a button that 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.310
 will serve us to put it on 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.850
 or pair and with a smartphone and 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.280
 a tablet and others on the sides one 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.170
 nothing except a hatch that 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.940
 is vain of a language is rather a 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.970
 plastic tongue that conceals the 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.050
 micro usb port and jack 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.090
 needless to say that to ensure 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.060
 the tightness of the speaker it will be worth 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.540
 better ensure that this language is 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.529
 be well placed well close if not otherwise 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.419
 we risk is well 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:36.839
 we risk to fuck in the air while 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.849
 simply and then below we have here 

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:40.019
 a hole that will allow us to 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.269
 to live a life is so 

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:44.129
 to hang a wall speaker from our 

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:45.419
 of our apartment from our house this 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:49.619
 who could be nice when we want 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:53.579
 to make a small a little audio kit we're going 

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:55.889
 to say well groomed well oiled the idea 

00:04:53.579 --> 00:04:57.869
 now is going to be to pair the speaker 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.449
 novodio with a smartphone is here we go 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:02.969
 take for example - xperia of a 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.769
 compact so first thing to do on 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.289
 must press the central button 

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:10.759
 for at least three seconds until 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.759
 what a sound sound 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.000
 we can see here that we have two small 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.990
 blue heads that flash so that 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.509
 it's a good sign 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.720
 and now we just have to take 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:31.259
 the active xperia and bluetooth if this 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.659
 is not already done to go in 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:36.900
 settings 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:39.530
 1 the teeth the bluetooth is at 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.580
 search for a new device 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.470
 if we are lucky and this is the case 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.009
 currently we will locate the novodio 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.960
 shower 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.960
 so we press it for the pair and 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:56.550
 we wait a little bit and we have a 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.380
 confirmation message that we 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.550
 explains that both devices are 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.080
 well connected together and can 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:08.880
 dialogue and now we can swing 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.539
 music without any worries and everything 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.330
 what we have to do 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:16.349
 well, it's opening his reader or 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.870
 possibly spotify to fetch 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:24.960
 a title in a playlist 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:29.130
 so here I am going to boom boom and in 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:33.740
 starts playback to control the 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.740
 volume it will be from the smartphone 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.500
 and voila 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.000
 we have the speaker who is 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.770
 connected to our smartphone and that's it 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.139
 walk with anything no matter 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.729
 if you have an iphone 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:54.639
 if you have a tablet if you have 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:56.860
 of samsung if you had to move with the 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.940
 bluetooth anyway we will be able 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.470
 operate the speaker with 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.520
 any type of device and that 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.220
 it's still pretty cool 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.930
 the verdict is well and well the positive y 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.690
 it's a small enclosure that looks 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.010
 to be quite muscular enough I think that 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.419
 sound level she to send heavy 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:14.740
 it is in any case the impression I have 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:16.300
 had swaying a bit of tupac and what 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.710
 that it be good if you have any 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.389
 questions the comments are there for 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.380
 that and we find ourselves very quickly with 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:22.919
 another video 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.919
 see you soon
