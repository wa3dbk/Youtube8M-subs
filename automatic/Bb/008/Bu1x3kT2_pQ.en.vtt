00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.730
 the Costa Rican team will face 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.230
 to its similar from Honduras in a match 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.150
 where the Hondurans have left 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.219
 historically favored at this stage 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.990
 said meeting will be held on Sunday 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.730
 July 21 where the tricolor squad 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.220
 it looks like clear favorite to get 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.869
 The Costa Rica victory played against the USA 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.970
 recently in a very even meeting 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.039
 the first time he had some emotions 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.199
 but out of some diverted shots 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.970
 and deficient in front of the goal 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.769
 of both teams the two sets are 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.540
 they went to rest to return and 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.640
 try to leave strong during the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.170
 complement of the match in this 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.629
 I find the changes 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.640
 They marked difference from meeting to 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.019
 end of the game Costa Ricans 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.850
 they tried in all the ways that 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.500
 they could but luck and defense 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.059
 American people did not allow 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.100
 Central Americans to specify the well-deserved 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.350
 revenge relegating them to second place 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.390
 from the c costa rica group it looked very good 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.280
 playing with much desire and inspiration 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.589
 which shows that Ticos grow 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.790
 before large teams on the other hand 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.409
 catrachos were victims of the 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.239
 confidence before the Caribbean and 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.820
 it cost them the three points that really 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.439
 they did not need with mediocre victories 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.880
 before uncompetitive squads the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.829
 Hondurans are lazy in the current 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.330
 tournament and everything indicates that they will have to 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.680
 take advantage of the rivalry 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.420
 inhabitants to look for something 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.100
 inspiration that makes them overcome 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.980
 deficiencies presented throughout the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.300
 Turned Costa Rica- Luce as Favorite 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.130
 where the Ticos come from winning three 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.870
 matches tying one and losing those 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.560
 others losing another in the past 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.600
 five meetings 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.280
 On the other hand Honduras has won two 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.950
 lost two and tied one of his 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.850
 last five clashes 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.620
 historically honduras has the advantage 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 but the reality is that costa rica happens 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.350
 for much better time than 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.240
 Hondurans where the Ticos are from 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.800
 Second in the standings 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.500
 of the elimination phase towards the world 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.390
 Brazil-2014 and the Hondurans very much 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.650
 below them the betting house bwin 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.710
 has the victory of the Honduran team 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.840
 with a quota of 3.80 or more 280 while 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.240
 that we can find the tie at 3.40 or 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.540
 plus 240 and the costa rica share is in 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.250
 1.91 or 200 days online mericana a 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.960
 Despite unstable start in 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.729
 the costa rica tournament does not stop raising its 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.229
 level unlike other selections 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.150
 like the Honduran who does not show tease 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.770
 mode improve your deficiencies 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.270
 we can expect the ethical victory but not 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.709
 by many goals and that's why my 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.690
 Pick for the match is the proposition 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.980
 earns rich crust and now less than three and 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.470
 half goals in the encounter with a 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.780
 2.40 or more quota 140 American line
