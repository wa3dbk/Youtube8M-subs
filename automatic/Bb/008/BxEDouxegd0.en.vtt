gives<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.590> impression<00:02:44.709> that<00:02:45.100> you've<00:02:45.340> got

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
gives you the impression that you've got

gives you the impression that you've got
eight<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.790> them<00:02:46.120> shooting<00:02:46.479> off<00:02:46.660> even<00:02:47.470> though

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
eight of them shooting off even though

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.960 
eight of them shooting off even though
that's<00:02:47.680> not<00:02:47.799> quite<00:02:48.010> correct<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.549> five<00:02:48.729> on<00:02:48.910> the

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
that's not quite correct the five on the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.430 
that's not quite correct the five on the
backpack<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.540> course<00:02:49.810> are<00:02:49.989> going<00:02:50.109> to<00:02:50.199> be<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
backpack of course are going to be the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.990 
backpack of course are going to be the
ones<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.709> draw<00:02:50.949> most<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.370> your<00:02:51.489> attention

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
ones that draw most of your attention

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.640 
ones that draw most of your attention
but<00:02:52.660> I<00:02:52.720> really<00:02:52.989> like<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.260> way<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:53.530> the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
but I really like the way that the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.009 
but I really like the way that the
shoulders<00:02:54.040> come<00:02:54.280> through<00:02:54.669> there<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.120> he

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
shoulders come through there and he

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.069 
shoulders come through there and he
really<00:02:56.169> does<00:02:56.440> look<00:02:56.620> bald<00:02:56.859> out<00:02:57.160> tall<00:02:57.880> if<00:02:58.269> not<00:02:58.870> a

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
really does look bald out tall if not a

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.500 
really does look bald out tall if not a
little<00:02:59.350> bit<00:02:59.500> simple<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.430> there<00:03:01.299> could<00:03:01.479> have

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
little bit simple and there could have

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.030 
little bit simple and there could have
been<00:03:01.600> lining<00:03:01.870> he<00:03:02.199> really<00:03:02.440> does<00:03:02.620> give<00:03:02.889> me<00:03:02.919> the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
been lining he really does give me the

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.390 
been lining he really does give me the
impression<00:03:03.549> though<00:03:03.699> of<00:03:03.970> being<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.359> 1/100<00:03:05.169> as

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:23.199 
anime bring these out you can see that

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:24.599 
anime bring these out you can see that
in<00:03:23.290> terms<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.620> filled<00:03:23.829> out<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.190> provenance

many Gundams I think that are going to

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.550

even worse when you put it in hand

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:53.819 
even worse when you put it in hand
because<00:03:52.870> it's<00:03:53.049> just<00:03:53.199> going<00:03:53.320> to<00:03:53.380> flop<00:03:53.620> all<00:03:53.799> over

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
because it's just going to flop all over

because it's just going to flop all over
the<00:03:54.130> place<00:03:54.310> but<00:03:54.489> in<00:03:54.609> addition<00:03:54.729> to<00:03:55.030> that<00:03:55.120> you're

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
the place but in addition to that you're

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.330 
the place but in addition to that you're
going<00:03:56.049> to<00:03:56.169> lose<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.530> ability<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:57.009> bend<00:03:57.190> the

going to lose the ability to bend the
elbow<00:03:57.790> very<00:03:58.150> much<00:03:58.449> although<00:03:59.009> actually<00:04:00.009> you

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
elbow very much although actually you

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.770 
elbow very much although actually you
can<00:04:00.280> prop<00:04:00.519> it<00:04:00.669> up<00:04:00.759> there<00:04:01.000> even<00:04:01.570> though<00:04:01.630> it's

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
can prop it up there even though it's

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.749 
can prop it up there even though it's
going<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:01.989> offset<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.560> weight<00:04:02.590> so<00:04:03.489> maybe

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:03.759 
going to offset the weight so maybe

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.490 
going to offset the weight so maybe
putting<00:04:04.509> it<00:04:04.660> over<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:04.870> shoulder<00:04:05.079> is<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.380> only

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
putting it over the shoulder is the only

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.539 
putting it over the shoulder is the only
way<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:05.680> this<00:04:05.949> is<00:04:06.130> going<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.370> stay<00:04:06.549> in<00:04:06.699> place

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
way that this is going to stay in place

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.039 
way that this is going to stay in place
fully<00:04:09.549> armed<00:04:09.970> this<00:04:10.120> comes<00:04:10.359> across<00:04:10.479> as<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.840> guy

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
fully armed this comes across as a guy

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.830 
fully armed this comes across as a guy
who<00:04:11.109> has<00:04:11.259> a<00:04:11.680> ton<00:04:12.070> of<00:04:12.180> firepower<00:04:13.180> although

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
who has a ton of firepower although

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.140 
who has a ton of firepower although
there<00:04:14.169> are<00:04:14.259> a<00:04:14.320> few<00:04:14.560> problems<00:04:14.949> with<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:15.190> first

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
there are a few problems with it first

there are a few problems with it first
of<00:04:16.269> all<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.479> shield<00:04:16.720> losing<00:04:17.199> the<00:04:17.290> hand

doesn't<00:04:17.799> look<00:04:18.100> as<00:04:18.340> good<00:04:18.579> I<00:04:19.030> think<00:04:19.329> as<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:19.870> did<00:04:20.139> or

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
doesn't look as good I think as I did or

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.379 
doesn't look as good I think as I did or
as<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.430> thought<00:04:21.579> it<00:04:21.729> would<00:04:21.880> when<00:04:22.030> you<00:04:22.150> put<00:04:22.300> it

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
as I thought it would when you put it

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.719 
as I thought it would when you put it
together<00:04:22.479> and<00:04:22.870> that<00:04:23.410> beam<00:04:23.620> rifle<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.370> really

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
together and that beam rifle it really

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.100 
together and that beam rifle it really
gives<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.030> impression<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.570> because<00:04:25.720> the

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
gives the impression that because the

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.290 
gives the impression that because the
right<00:04:26.290> arm<00:04:26.440> can<00:04:26.620> only<00:04:26.740> move<00:04:26.919> 90<00:04:27.280> degrees<00:04:27.610> that

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
right arm can only move 90 degrees that

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.790 
right arm can only move 90 degrees that
it<00:04:28.419> comes<00:04:28.630> across<00:04:28.840> as<00:04:29.169> being<00:04:29.199> just<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.770> little

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
it comes across as being just a little

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.430 
it comes across as being just a little
bit<00:04:30.009> stumpy<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:30.699> too<00:04:30.970> short<00:04:31.259> certainly<00:04:32.259> not

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
bit stumpy and too short certainly not

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.960

what you'd expect from a Master Grade of
this<00:04:34.090> get<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.570> overall<00:04:34.840> impression<00:04:35.139> still

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
this get the overall impression still

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.040 
this get the overall impression still
good<00:04:36.070> but<00:04:36.610> I<00:04:36.940> almost<00:04:37.360> liked<00:04:37.660> him<00:04:37.840> better

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
good but I almost liked him better

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.460 
good but I almost liked him better

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
of this style so in terms of action not

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.140 
of this style so in terms of action not
bad<00:04:57.040> but<00:04:57.460> I<00:04:57.490> don't<00:04:57.670> know<00:04:57.730> how<00:04:57.850> many<00:04:57.910> other

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
bad but I don't know how many other

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.190 
bad but I don't know how many other
poses<00:04:58.360> there<00:04:58.720> are<00:04:58.900> going

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
poses there are going

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.190 
poses there are going
to<00:04:59.380> be<00:05:00.060> bringing<00:05:01.060> the<00:05:01.150> beam<00:05:01.330> rifle<00:05:01.510> across<00:05:01.870> the

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
other way is going to set up a new set

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.640 
other way is going to set up a new set
of<00:05:04.240> problems<00:05:04.420> just<00:05:04.900> because<00:05:05.140> that<00:05:05.290> shield

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
of problems just because that shield

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.350 
of problems just because that shield
isn't<00:05:06.040> going<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.550> work<00:05:06.670> if<00:05:06.880> you<00:05:06.970> want<00:05:07.150> to<00:05:07.210> bring

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
isn't going to work if you want to bring

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.030 
isn't going to work if you want to bring
the<00:05:07.510> hand<00:05:07.720> across<00:05:07.960> to<00:05:08.200> use<00:05:08.320> that<00:05:08.530> handle<00:05:08.830> and

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
the hand across to use that handle and

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.700 
the hand across to use that handle and
again<00:05:09.760> a<00:05:10.000> slight<00:05:10.570> breeze<00:05:10.870> is<00:05:11.200> going<00:05:11.410> to<00:05:11.530> not

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
again a slight breeze is going to not

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.070 
again a slight breeze is going to not
get<00:05:11.890> completely<00:05:12.340> out<00:05:12.550> of<00:05:12.580> whack<00:05:12.850> not<00:05:13.600> terrible

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
get completely out of whack not terrible

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.360 
get completely out of whack not terrible
but<00:05:14.290> something<00:05:14.680> that<00:05:14.710> you'd<00:05:14.950> certainly<00:05:15.160> want

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
but something that you'd certainly want

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.400 
but something that you'd certainly want
to<00:05:15.580> work<00:05:15.730> on<00:05:15.970> just<00:05:16.690> to<00:05:16.780> get<00:05:16.900> it<00:05:16.990> a<00:05:17.050> little<00:05:17.080> more

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
to work on just to get it a little more

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.490 
to work on just to get it a little more
impressive<00:05:17.770> looking<00:05:18.720> the<00:05:19.720> similar<00:05:20.080> pose<00:05:20.290> with

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
impressive looking the similar pose with

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.900 
impressive looking the similar pose with
a<00:05:20.590> new<00:05:20.710> weapon<00:05:20.890> the<00:05:21.190> feet<00:05:21.400> are<00:05:21.520> doing<00:05:21.700> a<00:05:21.760> pretty

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
a new weapon the feet are doing a pretty

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.310 
a new weapon the feet are doing a pretty
good<00:05:22.030> job<00:05:22.180> although<00:05:22.660> you<00:05:22.720> have<00:05:22.900> to<00:05:23.020> work<00:05:23.140> on

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
good job although you have to work on

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.200 
good job although you have to work on
that<00:05:23.350> center<00:05:23.710> of<00:05:23.770> balance<00:05:24.010> but<00:05:24.760> the<00:05:24.790> shield

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
that center of balance but the shield

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.640 
that center of balance but the shield
certainly<00:05:25.810> looks<00:05:25.990> a<00:05:26.080> lot<00:05:26.230> better<00:05:26.440> I<00:05:26.500> think

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
certainly looks a lot better I think

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.350 
certainly looks a lot better I think
when<00:05:26.950> it<00:05:27.070> hides<00:05:27.370> the<00:05:27.580> hand<00:05:27.910> and<00:05:28.150> when<00:05:28.240> it's

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
when it hides the hand and when it's

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.240 
when it hides the hand and when it's
coming<00:05:28.600> across<00:05:28.810> that<00:05:28.900> large<00:05:29.530> beam<00:05:29.860> saber

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
coming across that large beam saber

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.580 
coming across that large beam saber
completely<00:05:31.240> changes<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:31.690> visual<00:05:32.170> effect<00:05:32.500> of

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
completely changes the visual effect of

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.820 
completely changes the visual effect of
this<00:05:32.740> guy<00:05:32.920> from<00:05:33.160> a<00:05:33.250> range<00:05:33.490> guy<00:05:33.780> into<00:05:34.830> somebody

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
this guy from a range guy into somebody

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.320 
this guy from a range guy into somebody
that<00:05:35.890> you<00:05:36.100> don't<00:05:36.250> want<00:05:36.400> to<00:05:36.460> tangle<00:05:36.640> with<00:05:36.850> melee

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
that you don't want to tangle with melee

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.230 
that you don't want to tangle with melee
style<00:05:37.690> and<00:05:38.590> I'm<00:05:39.460> glad<00:05:39.640> it<00:05:39.760> looks<00:05:39.940> good<00:05:40.090> in<00:05:40.210> that

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
style and I'm glad it looks good in that

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.750 
style and I'm glad it looks good in that
one<00:05:40.480> pose<00:05:40.720> because<00:05:40.960> there's<00:05:41.410> not<00:05:41.680> really<00:05:42.220> too

many<00:05:43.120> variations<00:05:44.040> that<00:05:45.040> you<00:05:45.280> can<00:05:45.460> do<00:05:45.640> with

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
many variations that you can do with

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.730 
many variations that you can do with
this<00:05:46.030> because<00:05:46.390> the<00:05:46.780> arms<00:05:47.050> are<00:05:47.200> just<00:05:47.380> not<00:05:47.530> so

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
this because the arms are just not so

this because the arms are just not so
poseable<00:05:48.190> you<00:05:48.310> can't<00:05:48.550> get<00:05:48.670> into<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.320> very
