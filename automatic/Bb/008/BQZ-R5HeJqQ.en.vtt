00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.159
 the mother is not 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.440
 hello, I 'm felipe fonseca, I'll show you 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.450
 for you 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.000
 the issues that I have of man of 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.310
 iron of the movies is not this iron man 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.109
 1 I have a dvd and I have already made video 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.380
 showing it in one of my most 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.960
 old get out of my dvds collection but 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.320
 I decided to do it again here. 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.730
 in the new video on the occasion of the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.059
 Iron Man 3 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:39.950
 a beautiful edition on wahda glove with embossing 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:44.489
 very pretty and as a curiosity 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.920
 this movie is is the newest dvd that 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.239
 I have so I chose one 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.570
 other the dvd after him but in mine 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.760
 This collection is the most received film. 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.440
 let's say newer on dvd I think 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.510
 since 2008 it is exactly that of 2008 and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.000
 end means after 2008 I do not have 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.590
 no film after 2008 after the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.200
 iron man on dvd 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.640
 Then I stopped buying dvd and go 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.520
 both 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.430
 so I spoke with curiosity so the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.350
 People have this beautiful metallized go 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.700
 relief and then we have this cover 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:32.909
 whole being written very beautiful 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.659
 amateur without internal art without the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.020
 disks né 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.890
 was already paramount practice but in that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.570
 season started the game only in the majority 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.880
 of markets here to the americas market 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.640
 huh 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.360
 no art on the disk is only five 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.340
 securities in Europe is to continue to 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.829
 art is a matter of the Americas there, not 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.530
 I know if another place then the man of 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.200
 Iron that I really like was the movie. 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.930
 first film that began and of which 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.350
 initiative avengers ne 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:12.450
 and the iron man 2 began very well. 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.610
 there already in blu ray has a crucible came 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.250
 so the united states mail 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.380
 which was purchased on a promotion where 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.680
 a black friday of life was went well 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:27.740
 I paid and went before the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.740
 infamous early taxation, right? 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.470
 a is like I said the first time 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.840
 I did the video has many and if so the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.980
 new documentary making off very long and 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.020
 but as my default to 5 big deal in 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.450
 long shows quite a thing but she is 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.480
 Very well, it 's very good to say so. 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.040
 two years had the extras yet to 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.370
 We have a room charge with 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:58.830
 four draws and six losses 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.750
 indifferent and the origins of the black widow 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.930
 and a war machine and such scenes 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.930
 deleted 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.269
 I had more fun and seeing the man from 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.820
 iron 2 is last week than 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.070
 originally if I remembered so 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.590
 I do not know but there maybe that effect 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.130
 that always happens on the screen from home to 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:24.030
 people do not know our requirement is lower and 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.769
 and was in a marathon of films in that 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.580
 pass to the iron man 3 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:32.310
 I got carried away but I believe that my 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.290
 initial impressions of the film be 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.900
 the more correct in it is weaker than 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.160
 yesterday several problems so I think 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.430
 the script is such 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.250
 The way the villain is defeated I think 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.630
 very random so much points was 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.459
 that already 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.190
 but anyway it's cold as well 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.350
 fun is cool, very good to have 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.320
 here in the collection in blu ray a pictures 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.180
 sounds are beautiful and very short 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.950
 poetic and I'm going to enjoy it to show 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.110
 also insisted his cache book né 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.670
 because it is this material that has no way 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.670
 I will not be back here since it's already been 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:17.390
 I'll give him a chance , there's no way 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.160
 If I touch it, I'll keep it. 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.890
 cleaning leaving on the shelf to 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.540
 stay if this is the mouth did not have 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:29.150
 shown i believe i do not believe not 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.950
 demonstrating and I'm fine and if the 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.650
 dodô edu ardila on this channel 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.669
 and he only makes packages then 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.840
 comes with a disc only comes the packaging 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.550
 but then just out of curiosity 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.770
 because the other film that we have the man 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:49.400
 by car 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:51.830
 man of iron and man of 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.200
 iron is it 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.169
 I hope you enjoy it, I hope that you will watch and 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.120
 and enjoy sharing my 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.610
 critic of the Iron Man 3 video that the 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.220
 post here in my 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:08.650
 Youtube channel 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.650
 For now, it's just a hug and even more.
