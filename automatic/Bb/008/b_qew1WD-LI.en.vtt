my<00:01:12.630> original<00:01:12.810> additional<00:01:13.680> event<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.850> was<00:01:15.030> that

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
my original additional event it was that

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.010 
my original additional event it was that
wide<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.380> went<00:01:16.950> from<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.759> height<00:01:18.030> all

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
wide and it went from that height all

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.280 
wide and it went from that height all
the<00:01:19.500> way<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.860> ground<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:21.600> problem<00:01:22.140> with

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
the way to the ground the problem with

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.010 
the way to the ground the problem with
that<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.770> i<00:01:23.280> live<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.549> florida<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.180> i

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
that is that i live in florida and i

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.429 
that is that i live in florida and i
thought<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.799> with<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.490> long<00:01:26.880> vertical

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
thought that with that long vertical

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.249 
thought that with that long vertical
vent<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.560> back<00:01:28.740> plus<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.790> full<00:01:30.000> length

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
vent in the back plus the full length

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.840 
vent in the back plus the full length
and<00:01:31.259> width<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.740> screen<00:01:31.890> door<00:01:32.280> being<00:01:32.579> wide

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and width of the screen door being wide

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.100 
and width of the screen door being wide
open<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:33.360> i<00:01:33.420> thought<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.869> would<00:01:34.049> be

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
open but i thought that that would be

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.560 
open but i thought that that would be
enough<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.560> vent<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:37.250> greenhouse<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:39.090> not

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
enough to vent the greenhouse it was not

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.060 
enough to vent the greenhouse it was not
the<00:01:40.079> internal<00:01:40.500> temperature<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
the internal temperature in the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.280 
the internal temperature in the
greenhouse<00:01:41.520> got<00:01:42.420> some<00:01:42.600> fairly<00:01:42.810> worrying

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
greenhouse got some fairly worrying

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.539 
greenhouse got some fairly worrying
temperatures<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.220> 130<00:01:44.939> 140<00:01:45.299> degrees<00:01:46.549> so

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
temperatures you know 130 140 degrees so

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.420 
temperatures you know 130 140 degrees so
i<00:01:47.579> had<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.570> go<00:01:49.380> back<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.939> redo<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.060> i<00:01:52.430> widened

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
i had to go back and redo it i widened

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.990 
i had to go back and redo it i widened
it<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.619> added<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.280> section<00:01:56.670> of

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
it as you can see added a section of

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.440 
it as you can see added a section of
screening<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.560> same<00:01:58.770> width<00:01:59.009> as<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.450> front

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
screening the same width as the front

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.319 
screening the same width as the front
door<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.399> took<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.640> all<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.969> way<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> the

door and took that all the way to the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.010

ground<00:02:03.619> that<00:02:04.619> has<00:02:04.890> actually<00:02:05.399> helped<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.020> I

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
ground that has actually helped and I

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.499 
ground that has actually helped and I
didn't<00:02:07.229> also<00:02:07.530> find<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.039> suggestion<00:02:08.670> on

a<00:05:12.090> rough<00:05:12.690> surface<00:05:12.930> to<00:05:13.350> here<00:05:13.680> to<00:05:14.450> second<00:05:15.450> I

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
a rough surface to here to second I

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.600 
a rough surface to here to second I
recommend<00:05:16.070> putting<00:05:17.070> a<00:05:17.280> smaller<00:05:17.790> piece<00:05:18.180> of<00:05:18.330> PVC

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
recommend putting a smaller piece of PVC

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.930 
recommend putting a smaller piece of PVC
into<00:05:21.470> the<00:05:22.470> well<00:05:22.890> on<00:05:23.010> my<00:05:23.160> case<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.460> one-inch

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
into the well on my case the one-inch

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.090 
into the well on my case the one-inch

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
there about four feet long that is

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.780 
there about four feet long that is
actually<00:05:30.810> inside<00:05:31.500> and<00:05:31.980> reinforcing<00:05:32.760> that

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
actually inside and reinforcing that

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:41.240 
actually inside and reinforcing that
bend<00:05:36.890> sanding<00:05:37.890> and<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:40.500> four<00:05:40.740> foot<00:05:40.920> section

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
of PVC on the inside actually helped out

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.410

a<00:05:45.750> lot<00:05:45.990> you<00:05:46.740> can<00:05:47.490> still<00:05:47.820> see<00:05:48.030> that<00:05:48.240> there<00:05:48.390> is

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
a lot you can still see that there is

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.000 
a lot you can still see that there is
some<00:05:48.810> stress<00:05:50.840> there<00:05:51.840> are<00:05:51.960> some<00:05:52.200> miss<00:05:52.470> shaping

some stress there are some miss shaping

00:05:53.010 --> 00:06:01.630 
some stress there are some miss shaping
but<00:05:53.840> it's<00:05:54.840> holding<00:05:55.290> up<00:05:55.410> rather<00:05:55.680> well<00:05:57.950> skinning

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.850 

there's<00:06:02.640> a<00:06:02.820> lot<00:06:03.000> of<00:06:03.210> stuff<00:06:03.750> on<00:06:03.900> skinning<00:06:04.680> these

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
there's a lot of stuff on skinning these

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.690 
there's a lot of stuff on skinning these
things<00:06:05.660> some<00:06:06.660> people<00:06:06.690> say<00:06:07.290> that<00:06:07.650> if<00:06:08.340> you<00:06:08.430> pull

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
what you end up doing is as it expands

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.770 
what you end up doing is as it expands
and<00:06:14.490> contracts<00:06:14.880> and<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.120> heat<00:06:15.360> it<00:06:15.480> ends<00:06:15.690> up

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
and contracts and the heat it ends up
