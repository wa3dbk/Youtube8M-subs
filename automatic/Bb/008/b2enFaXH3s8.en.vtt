00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
really like this but let's see if we can

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.109 
really like this but let's see if we can
take<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> next<00:01:37.979> step<00:01:38.310> let's<00:01:38.340> let's<00:01:38.970> see

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
take it to the next step let's let's see

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.940 
take it to the next step let's let's see
if<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.450> make<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.750> better<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.650> made<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
if we can make it better so we made the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.460 
if we can make it better so we made the
inch<00:01:41.070> inch<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.000> three<00:01:42.210> quarter<00:01:42.570> samples<00:01:43.320> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
inch inch and three quarter samples and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.660 
inch inch and three quarter samples and
then<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.649> started<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.250> went<00:01:44.399> through<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
then we started we went through the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.539 
then we started we went through the
tweaking<00:01:44.880> process<00:01:45.420> again<00:01:45.750> now<00:01:46.649> Eric<00:01:47.399> has

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
tweaking process again now Eric has

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.310 
tweaking process again now Eric has
notoriously<00:01:50.420> detailed<00:01:51.420> about<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:51.810> he<00:01:52.020> likes

notoriously detailed about what he likes
and<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.549> I'm<00:01:54.210> curious<00:01:54.450> how<00:01:54.720> long<00:01:54.750> did<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.380> all

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and so I'm curious how long did this all

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.120 
and so I'm curious how long did this all
take<00:01:55.829> um<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.030> shy<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.479> two<00:01:57.780> years

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
take um just just shy of two years

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.310

nothing yeah
so<00:02:00.650> let's<00:02:01.460> flip<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:01.820> around<00:02:01.910> back<00:02:02.360> because<00:02:02.780> I

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
so let's flip it around back because I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.630 
so let's flip it around back because I
mean<00:02:03.320> that's<00:02:03.770> one<00:02:03.980> of<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.160> first<00:02:04.370> things<00:02:04.580> that

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
mean that's one of the first things that

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.100 
mean that's one of the first things that
popped<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:04.970> was<00:02:05.090> like<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:05.540> does<00:02:05.750> not<00:02:05.900> look

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
popped I was like that does not look

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.680 
popped I was like that does not look
like<00:02:06.310> most<00:02:07.310> speakers<00:02:07.610> you<00:02:07.880> see<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:08.420> tell<00:02:08.660> us

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
like most speakers you see so tell us

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.300 
like most speakers you see so tell us
about<00:02:08.929> what's<00:02:09.140> going<00:02:09.200> on<00:02:09.410> back<00:02:09.560> here<00:02:09.740> yeah

about what's going on back here yeah
well<00:02:10.490> this<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:10.759> an<00:02:10.880> Annika<00:02:11.300> magnet<00:02:12.080> this<00:02:12.230> is<00:02:12.380> a

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
well this is an Annika magnet this is a

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.230 
well this is an Annika magnet this is a
big<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:13.070> big<00:02:13.640> ring<00:02:13.910> magnet<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:15.520> then<00:02:16.520> this<00:02:17.060> is

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
big a big ring magnet and then this is

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.150 
big a big ring magnet and then this is
the<00:02:17.360> back<00:02:17.540> plate<00:02:17.840> it's<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.470> thick<00:02:18.680> back<00:02:18.890> plate

the back plate it's a thick back plate

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.460 
the back plate it's a thick back plate
for<00:02:19.460> magnetic<00:02:19.850> strength<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:21.200> how<00:02:21.320> many

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
for magnetic strength and how many

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.290 
for magnetic strength and how many
ounces<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.190> magnet<00:02:22.490> it's<00:02:22.670> 35<00:02:23.120> ounce

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
ounces is that magnet it's 35 ounce

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.210 
ounces is that magnet it's 35 ounce
magnet<00:02:24.130> okay<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:26.420> then<00:02:26.660> it's<00:02:26.780> got<00:02:27.220> Eric

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
magnet okay and then it's got Eric

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.020 
magnet okay and then it's got Eric
selected<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:28.730> color<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:30.110> powder<00:02:30.320> coating

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
he knew he knows a certain amount about

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.240 
he knew he knows a certain amount about
about<00:02:45.020> speakers<00:02:45.500> but<00:02:45.680> I'm<00:02:45.740> not<00:02:45.890> sure<00:02:46.070> if<00:02:46.130> he

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
about speakers but I'm not sure if he

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.199 
about speakers but I'm not sure if he
knows<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:48.530> exact<00:02:48.860> design<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.700> know<00:02:49.790> glue

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
knows the exact design you know glue

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.750 
knows the exact design you know glue
types<00:02:50.570> or<00:02:50.840> glue<00:02:51.380> types<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.890> stuff<00:02:52.070> like<00:02:52.250> that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
types or glue types and stuff like that

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.850 
types or glue types and stuff like that
but<00:02:53.120> he<00:02:53.209> definitely<00:02:53.840> knows<00:02:53.959> what<00:02:54.020> Tony<00:02:54.470> likes

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
but he definitely knows what Tony likes

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.430 
but he definitely knows what Tony likes
and<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.400> we<00:02:56.150> went<00:02:56.360> with<00:02:56.390> this<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:57.140> small

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
and and we went with this the small

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.370 
and and we went with this the small
conical<00:02:57.980> cap<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.970> end<00:02:59.209> because<00:02:59.989> he<00:03:00.140> liked

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
conical cap in the end because he liked

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.260 
conical cap in the end because he liked
what<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.739> did<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.130> eyes<00:03:01.459> he<00:03:01.760> wanted<00:03:02.030> he

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
what that did to the eyes he wanted he

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.360 
what that did to the eyes he wanted he
kept<00:03:02.480> wanting<00:03:02.660> more<00:03:02.980> articulation<00:03:03.980> on<00:03:04.280> the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
kept wanting more articulation on the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.460 
kept wanting more articulation on the
highs<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:04.880> we<00:03:05.390> settled<00:03:05.630> on<00:03:05.870> this<00:03:05.900> on<00:03:06.290> this

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
highs and we settled on this on this

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.130 
highs and we settled on this on this
this<00:03:07.070> type<00:03:07.310> of<00:03:07.340> cap<00:03:07.730> which<00:03:08.420> gave<00:03:08.660> us<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.989> right

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
this type of cap which gave us the right

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.229 
this type of cap which gave us the right
kind<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.440> house<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.310> what<00:03:10.489> is<00:03:10.580> he<00:03:10.700> using<00:03:10.880> these

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
kind of house so what is he using these

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.410 
kind of house so what is he using these
in<00:03:11.450> now<00:03:12.040> he<00:03:13.040> just<00:03:13.250> told<00:03:13.459> me<00:03:13.580> he's<00:03:14.030> using<00:03:14.330> them

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
in now he just told me he's using them

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.030 
in now he just told me he's using them
in<00:03:14.510> his<00:03:14.540> Marshall<00:03:15.019> stacks<00:03:15.260> right<00:03:15.530> now<00:03:15.709> and

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
in his Marshall stacks right now and

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.130 
in his Marshall stacks right now and
he'd<00:03:16.640> uh<00:03:16.670> he'd<00:03:16.850> like<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.480> eventually<00:03:17.930> get<00:03:18.019> them

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
he'd uh he'd like to eventually get them

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.560 
he'd uh he'd like to eventually get them
in<00:03:18.200> his<00:03:18.320> twins<00:03:18.620> as<00:03:18.799> well<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:20.330> just

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
in his twins as well and so that just

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.020 
in his twins as well and so that just
goes<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.080> show<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:21.290> how<00:03:21.500> versatile<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.610> speaker

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
goes to show you how versatile a speaker

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.880 
goes to show you how versatile a speaker
it<00:03:23.180> is<00:03:23.299> that<00:03:23.570> he<00:03:23.630> can<00:03:23.780> use<00:03:23.959> that<00:03:24.260> he<00:03:24.560> plans<00:03:24.799> to

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
it is that he can use that he plans to

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.410 
it is that he can use that he plans to
use<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.250> in<00:03:25.370> both<00:03:25.580> application<00:03:26.150> because<00:03:26.299> he's

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
use it in both application because he's

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.479 
use it in both application because he's
got<00:03:26.600> a<00:03:26.630> pristine<00:03:27.230> cleans<00:03:27.620> usually<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.340> then

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
got a pristine cleans usually and then

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.520 
got a pristine cleans usually and then
some<00:03:28.790> pretty<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.870> gets<00:03:30.110> pretty<00:03:30.320> fuzzy

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
some pretty it gets pretty fuzzy

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.170 
some pretty it gets pretty fuzzy
sometimes<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.220> those<00:03:31.340> singing<00:03:31.580> leads<00:03:31.940> and

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
sometimes and those singing leads and

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.250 
sometimes and those singing leads and
stuff<00:03:32.239> two<00:03:32.600> completely<00:03:33.019> different

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
stuff two completely different

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.690 
stuff two completely different
applications<00:03:34.040> that<00:03:34.100> he<00:03:34.250> wants<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.489> use<00:03:34.670> the

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
applications that he wants to use the

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.180 
applications that he wants to use the
same<00:03:35.030> speaker<00:03:35.450> for<00:03:35.660> so<00:03:35.900> you<00:03:36.350> can<00:03:36.500> imagine<00:03:36.709> how

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
same speaker for so you can imagine how

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.030 
same speaker for so you can imagine how
perfect<00:03:37.610> this<00:03:37.730> needs<00:03:38.209> to<00:03:38.299> be<00:03:38.500> cool<00:03:39.530> let's<00:03:39.890> hear

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
perfect this needs to be cool let's hear
