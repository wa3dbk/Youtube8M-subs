00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello my name is ivan 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.810
 A. Karpenko 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.280
 topic video global issues 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.759
 modern world 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.429
 and first you need to decide on 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.270
 what global issues mean and 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.680
 what problems and do not refer to the sick 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.210
 it is important to understand that those problems 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.800
 are called on the sick causes of which 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.259
 is a person and who 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.500
 extend to the whole society to the whole 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:34.910
 the world, for example, such reasons as 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.350
 possible meteorite fall is incorrect 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.480
 in this sense, relatively sick 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.909
 problems of mankind certainly from 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.190
 this will happen it will of course 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:44.059
 problems are very serious but a 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.920
 Social Studies 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.649
 when talking about global issues 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.070
 humanity has a saint exactly those still 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:55.210
 I repeat this very important problems 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.429
 the reasons for which we serve the man himself 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.910
 perhaps in some indirect way and which 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:05.269
 threaten the whole world 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.720
 humanity and require strongly in 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.360
 on immediate decision that's what 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.970
 called refers to the sick 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.970
 problems of the modern world or how else 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.330
 say the global problems of mankind 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.039
 to make it more clear what is at stake 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.840
 let's bring a few with you now 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:29.299
 specific examples and briefly consider 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:34.460
 illustrate to examples these very 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.970
 problems well, probably the most obvious 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.810
 an example that just suggests itself 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.790
 this is of course ecological for you 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.259
 problem 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.950
 it is obvious that the person is very 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:52.280
 significantly affects the environment due to 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.180
 its industrial activities due to 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.180
 use of natural resources and this 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.340
 use of natural resources 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.310
 leads to serious problems that 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.310
 expressed pollution 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.280
 in air pollution 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.269
 soil pollution of water bodies in the disappearance 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.540
 animal species that is completely 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:20.420
 It is obvious that the consequences are 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.910
 some man-made disasters in these 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.790
 conditions it is clear that the problems 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.430
 poses a threat to the whole society 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.310
 for the whole world community and of course 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.340
 requires an immediate solution but how 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.860
 you understand not enough 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.530
 easily solved problem because for 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.580
 order to solve different states 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.470
 must agree among themselves about 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.959
 acceptable use of nature and 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.349
 the limits of industrial production and 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:54.690
 emission of harmful substances and it is not very 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:59.140
 just that is, this problem is relevant 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.940
 it affects public health in 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.959
 the first place is that part of the population 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.090
 who lives in big cities 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.890
 megacities for focused 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.709
 much of the production and the other 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.730
 a problem that can be called this 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:19.840
 demographic problem is a threat 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.989
 overcrowding we say that Russia 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.510
 this is a problem in general is not particularly 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.590
 concerns there are very large 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.720
 uninhabited territory but on the whole and this 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.269
 the problem concerns the whole world 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:39.970
 because the world's population is humanity 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.609
 grows and grows fairly quickly and in 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.829
 over the next decades may 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:48.359
 there is such a problem 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:50.859
 overpopulation when not enough 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:54.670
 resources providing normal 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.870
 livelihoods at all yes and be 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.269
 actually oversupply 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.099
 hands but not so much work 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.470
 there will be no need for such 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.200
 number of hands this problem 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.650
 characteristic for example whether China 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.080
 for india for countries in which very 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.230
 large population and strictly speaking 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.139
 hard enough to feed properly 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.000
 way to provide this population 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.769
 necessary standard of living still to 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.910
 next problems of global problems 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.860
 can be attributed to the gap between countries 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.479
 developed and third world countries 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.910
 really existing big 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.120
 economic gap level gap 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.830
 life between the leading countries of the West and 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.320
 some other countries between 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.300
 for example African countries 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.060
 continent this problem is also very 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.720
 essentially requires of course strongly 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.410
 his decisions are another very important 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.050
 global problem is the threat of war in 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.330
 including the threat of nuclear war given 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.510
 that some countries have big 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:02.139
 nuclear potential this problem is worth 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.370
 hot enough and needs to be addressed is 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.820
 is a problem because 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.850
 the danger remains serious 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.590
 large-scale armed conflicts well and in 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.100
 As some other examples you can 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.320
 to name 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.419
 the threat of an epidemic earlier 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.120
 until there was a problem especially well and 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.470
 Now, too, there are a number of different 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.639
 diseases that supply 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.560
 quite serious threat and 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.180
 causes are spread 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.130
 the distribution of which is in 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.750
 in general, too, man and water, and that is 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.940
 here can be attributed 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.639
 addiction global issues 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.229
 humanity and can be attributed to terrorism and 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.770
 so on then there is a list of global 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.970
 problems it is wide enough we are with you 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.070
 called some who are most significant 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.840
 most important but the list is possible 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.300
 continue and absolutely absolutely 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.660
 It is obvious that the problem appears 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.570
 there will be new ones as we hope that 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.360
 as far as solving old problems yes bye 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:59.020
 what a regret these old problems they don't 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.450
 decide how to solve 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.650
 maybe these problems are called well 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:07.360
 the way in general it happens is that 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.220
 man's consciousness must change 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.320
 society's consciousness must change 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.760
 in such a way that a person must understand 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.600
 what 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.060
 you need to take care of the environment 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.780
 to other people and of course to 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.870
 to myself 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:27.730
 i.e. lifestyle changes 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:30.850
 but also unity before unity of people in all 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.700
 only thing that can do in the world 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.860
 can help solve these problems 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:40.450
