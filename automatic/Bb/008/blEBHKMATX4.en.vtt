 serving him 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.850
 out of that base paste talking 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.120
 it goes down I cover the pan again 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.920
 and maybe I have a hot pan we're going to lower the football that we eat 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.549
 hot 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.649
 and do the following let's go to santiago san pio for him 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.110
 there are gestures broaden the morbid and books in the market people ask me what I see 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.310
 in the market but I do not know what to do with the previous ones 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.889
 look let's do the following let's skip now a little onion 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.900
 We are going to contribute some onions in half 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.980
 we have agreed on a 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.579
 and the bull blades courtesy or noon we're fine 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.590
 boy so that you trust yourself much faster 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.730
 then I cut a julienne and onion tour 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.290
 well this way very simple 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.220
 and like him the sargenta is heating up the only thing I have to do 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.670
 is to put a little fat in this case to do 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.710
 I run just days before 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.530
 then once it's onion vienna yes china cut 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.850
 I come here a little bit of oil we add to the pan 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.120
 same we put the second one that is based softening peace 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.020
 now he took a red pepper that I have here so that a color note 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.610
 the dish actually 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.780
 like the pepper 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.880
 it's not cheap now let's just put a little bit we are going to reserve 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.569
 the rest for other preparation 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.569
 and the only thing I'm going to do is cubek and archeologist assured 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.310
 d although everything cut it into strips and mud 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.079
 another is like this to do this 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.889
 small square 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.859
 of red pepper of this one so that it gives a note of color in bengo coca 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.649
 the above added to the av to the onion 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:33.139
 and if now it is skipped all together 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:34.870
 the insurer lda society 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.400
 making it clear that it is cooking 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.780
 I do not know how the hosts 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.110
 negotiations because I have a calamaro look enlargement or mushroom 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.209
 paris that tremble crows to identify very easily 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.150
 not only cut in the mines 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.490
 but not so fine between pieces and I also added and always three pieces 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.490
 and I'll do it 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.429
 to skip everything next to see who is staying 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:04.319
 perhaps it is lengthening a scent a good bite here hit you with a bit of 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.119
 bacon 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:08.179
 smoked which will be taken in the house in tampico 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.439
 but Suarez and put ham 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.299
 cossÃ­o because you cooked ham 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.809
 Actually, what he's going to do now is give him that protein content that 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.509
 all these vegetables are missing 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.670
 I followed him and for this ham it was wonderful 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.960
 from our best that I and quotes from rosary refrigerator you could see all the 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:25.420
 country 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.039
 also that exports to the world as I always say 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:30.229
 he did not take revenge with a feta of ham 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.339
 that for this portion we are going to put a pair of one or more 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.419
 and it had already been pink 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.219
 let's brush like this 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.579
 and was to contribute 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.139
 juliana commune 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.489
 so nothing more than that very simple 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.379
 and now when you attack the pan with look 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.599
 jean ping jones the onion and the pepper is going to undo 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.849
 well this way 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.849
 and to be very very nice apart remember that 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:01.249
 it deserves with good flavor 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:04.889
 all the ingredients almost ready inside while cooking the pasta 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.059
 Now I'm lacking spice, let's put some salt 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:09.259
 little or nothing more 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.929
 farah and that is tasty but not so much 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:15.150
 and a little pepper I could because he remembered that he had to 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.449
 Mexico DF 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.449
 It was hard that they were spiced up but again 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.270
 there is the elongated a fantastic drama 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.360
 here I have a bit of chopped parsley we're going to put at the end 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.559
 so let's check the pasta to see how it is 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:32.069
 maybe I think it's almost ready 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.180
 let's drink 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.909
 to see how it is done 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.439
 and let's try like this 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:42.099
 maybe when the peace to work is done we are going to try 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.490
 perfect such since then I say we have to do now 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.759
 this has arrived 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.379
 just peace 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:50.969
 to this preparation 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:54.929
 we are going to strain there a little but a little of the cooking water we are going to leave 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.059
 we collaborate the spaghetti 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:00.839
 preparation wing 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:01.680
 leza moon 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.800
 are the mushrooms 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.800
 the strength of the Philistines 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.999
 just in 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:11.029
 that amount will be credited one point was the commission 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:13.610
 chili will look good also in jumps 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.689
 the Salta again 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:18.089
 we are almost ready vila to add 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:20.900
 the touch nothing more than a touch of cream 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.889
 never to defend that it is little or nothing more than that 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.229
 a little touch of fresh parsley on top of everything 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.949
 so there are many more 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.740
 little streaky cheese will paralyze this boffo case of power 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.349
 and what do you like the most? 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.229
