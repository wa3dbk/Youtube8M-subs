sights are too tight to get a clear shot
the<00:01:38.520> impact<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.150> pretty<00:01:39.420> low<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.320> fire

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
the impact is pretty low and the fire

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.340 
the impact is pretty low and the fire
rate<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.070> even<00:01:41.670> lower<00:01:41.880> now<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.509> do<00:01:42.600> love<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
rate is even lower now I do love the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.039 
rate is even lower now I do love the
concept<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.280> gun<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.060> think<00:01:45.450> changes

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
concept of this gun but I think changes

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.230 
concept of this gun but I think changes
are<00:01:46.200> needed<00:01:46.439> which<00:01:46.829> I'll<00:01:47.040> get<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.490> now<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
are needed which I'll get on to now the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.850 
are needed which I'll get on to now the
two<00:01:48.329> main<00:01:48.689> parts<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.259> weapons<00:01:49.680> are

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
two main parts of this weapons are

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.429 
two main parts of this weapons are
Mulligan<00:01:50.670> which<00:01:51.000> reads<00:01:51.299> missing<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.960> shot<00:01:52.229> has

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
Mulligan which reads missing a shot has

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.410 
Mulligan which reads missing a shot has
a<00:01:52.470> chance<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.950> return<00:01:53.159> ammo<00:01:53.670> directly<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
a chance to return ammo directly to the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.569 
a chance to return ammo directly to the
magazine<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.530> master<00:01:56.070> which<00:01:56.280> reads

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
magazine and the master which reads

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.510 
magazine and the master which reads
increased<00:01:57.149> precision<00:01:57.630> damage<00:01:58.079> kills<00:01:58.799> briefly

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
increased precision damage kills briefly

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.569 
increased precision damage kills briefly
increased<00:02:00.030> damage<00:02:00.299> against<00:02:01.140> next<00:02:01.619> target<00:02:02.130> now

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
increased damage against next target now

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.999 
increased damage against next target now
the<00:02:03.030> perks<00:02:03.329> are<00:02:03.570> self-explanatory<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.649> what

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
the perks are self-explanatory but what

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.740 
the perks are self-explanatory but what
you<00:02:05.130> guys<00:02:05.280> might<00:02:05.640> want<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.060> know<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.390> why<00:02:06.689> this

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
you guys might want to know is why this

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.169 
you guys might want to know is why this
weapon<00:02:07.350> isn't<00:02:07.560> too<00:02:07.950> effective<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.700> what

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
weapon isn't too effective and what

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.150 
weapon isn't too effective and what
could<00:02:09.420> do<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:09.810> some<00:02:10.020> tweaking<00:02:10.470> from<00:02:10.679> bungees

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
could do with some tweaking from bungees

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.640 
could do with some tweaking from bungees
in<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.879> first<00:02:12.209> up<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.629> fiery<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
in so first up is the fiery the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.530 
in so first up is the fiery the
weapon<00:02:13.950> fires<00:02:14.310> awfully<00:02:15.060> slow<00:02:15.329> which

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
weapon fires awfully slow which

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.360 
weapon fires awfully slow which
obviously<00:02:15.900> doesn't<00:02:16.530> allow<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.220> get

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
obviously doesn't allow you to get

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.220 
obviously doesn't allow you to get
another<00:02:17.640> shot<00:02:18.000> off<00:02:18.120> quick<00:02:18.420> enough<00:02:18.450> now<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
another shot off quick enough now the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.710 
another shot off quick enough now the
impact<00:02:19.799> on<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> other<00:02:20.159> hand<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.549> also<00:02:21.299> low<00:02:21.510> and

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
impact on the other hand is also low and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.780 
impact on the other hand is also low and
I<00:02:21.930> personally<00:02:22.379> think<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.739> disadvantage<00:02:23.670> of

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
I personally think the disadvantage of

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.270 
I personally think the disadvantage of
not<00:02:23.879> having<00:02:24.659> a<00:02:24.750> scope<00:02:25.079> this<00:02:25.650> weapon<00:02:26.099> should

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
not having a scope this weapon should

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.729 
not having a scope this weapon should
have<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.489> chance<00:02:26.909> to<00:02:27.420> be<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.599> one-shot<00:02:28.019> kill<00:02:28.560> in

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
have a chance to be a one-shot kill in

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.309 
have a chance to be a one-shot kill in
the<00:02:28.860> crucible<00:02:29.069> due<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.120> solo<00:02:30.420> fiery<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
the crucible due to the solo fiery the

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.470 
the crucible due to the solo fiery the
iron<00:02:31.560> sights<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.579> almost<00:02:32.970> impossible

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
iron sights and it's almost impossible

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.869 
iron sights and it's almost impossible
to<00:02:33.989> hit<00:02:34.200> your<00:02:34.379> target<00:02:34.890> then<00:02:35.250> hit<00:02:35.519> them<00:02:35.670> again

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
to hit your target then hit them again

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.880 
to hit your target then hit them again
with<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.390> second<00:02:36.840> shot<00:02:37.019> before<00:02:37.319> you're<00:02:37.680> dead

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
with a second shot before you're dead

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.130 
with a second shot before you're dead
now<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.430> course<00:02:38.670> if<00:02:38.909> you<00:02:39.299> get<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.540> headshot<00:02:39.780> it's

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
now of course if you get a headshot it's

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.170 
now of course if you get a headshot it's
a<00:02:40.230> one-shot<00:02:40.500> kill<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.579> iron<00:02:41.819> sights

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
a one-shot kill but as the iron sights

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.259 
a one-shot kill but as the iron sights
are<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:42.750> tight<00:02:43.079> it's<00:02:43.349> pretty<00:02:43.859> difficult<00:02:44.269> now

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
are so tight it's pretty difficult now

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.789 
are so tight it's pretty difficult now
the<00:02:45.329> reload<00:02:45.750> speed<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.200> magazine<00:02:46.590> capacity

the reload speed and magazine capacity

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.670 
the reload speed and magazine capacity
worked<00:02:47.519> very<00:02:47.879> well<00:02:48.000> but<00:02:48.659> it<00:02:48.780> still<00:02:49.170> leads<00:02:49.470> back

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
worked very well but it still leads back

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.619 
worked very well but it still leads back
to<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:50.040> fiery<00:02:50.370> what's<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.239> point<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:51.599> having

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629
