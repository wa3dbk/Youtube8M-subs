00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.220
 the name of the city was like Yen 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.900
 we had driven far to get here 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.710
 my brother and I had just gone out the aunt and we 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.809
 were stinking Mies on it 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.920
 the French countryside with its graceful tree-lined streets 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.810
 Hedges ordered fields and picture-book villages 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.689
 offered little fun 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.199
 my parents had weeks now kids have Loser Kringel IAEA and 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.819
 many meals in tense and ever more unpleasant are there 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.539
 Atmosphere he tolerates 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.070
 they dutifully had our TK shape 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.390
 Lenders ever 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.770
 Sorbitol Chamber and finally is ordered to vomiting 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.340
 they had endured our vegetables because the basins were too harsh 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.460
 Cushion too soft 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.829
 the neck rolls the toilets and the installation too weird 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.930
 they had allowed and even a bit watered wine 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.450
 since it was made obvious in France 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.900
 but also like that shut up 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.480
 they had my brother and not the two ugliest Americans 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.660
 taken everywhere 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.770
 that was different in Vienne 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.750
 they turned off the flashing new logo in the parking lot of a restaurant 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.880
 the pretty promising painter Nied was called 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.300
 An obviously bunkered state parent submitted us to us 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.220
 and then left us in the car 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.600
 it was a hard blow 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.049
 Little Brother and I were left in the car for over three hours 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.630
 an eternity for two poor children already half empty from boredom 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.910
 were 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.320
 i had easy time to ask myself 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.570
 what is there to surround such walls behind these walls? 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.720
 they ate that funny there 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.250
 and it was certainly a huge thing » 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.799
 even with my brainless nine years 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.770
 I could nervous excitement the excitement 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.259
 who knows almost something he is researching 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.600
 with which my troubled parents had approached in this hour 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.580
 and I remembered the skis that incident quite freshly 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.929
 Food could it seemed 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.310
 important 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.700
 it could be an event 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 it marks the 1st 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.960
 Of course, today I know the labyrinth as early as 1966 the center 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.379
 the culinary universe was 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.329
 Moculescu Troim Croo 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.909
 Everyone had had their time there had their bones of the time 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.419
 owner's legendary fearsome knout ver di Nord Bohr 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:26.279
 delivered 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.699
 Boere was the grand master of the cooking of the time 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:30.940
 Unger Dürer Nied 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.739
 was the McCafé Foods John Cleese 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.040
 for my seriously Francophile parents 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.209
 that was a pilgrimage 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.399
 and somehow 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:43.340
 That came in the back seat of the glowing hot parked car 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.419
 through to a tiny empty skull 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:48.999
 even then 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.159
 things changed 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.579
 he does not change 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.789
 First of all, I was pissed off 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.340
 evil has always been a great driving force in my life 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.769
 prompted me to become adventurous when it came to 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.019
 Food went 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.680
 I also took a look at these 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.019
 my food sound to outdo the parents 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.900
 At the same time I could teach my uninitiated brother that in Cologne 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.430
 I would show them who the gourmet is here 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.389
 smelly running cheese the skate the corpses feet 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:22.950
 fourth meat 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.659
 Dries herewith 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.169
 whatever the greatest shock value was the court of my choice 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:32.050
 the rest of this summer and in all the summers that followed 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.209
 I arrest everything 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.240
 I smiled sticky exhale 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.350
 Kaze learned to love native Norman butter 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.210
 especially if you smeared them on baguette and hot bitter ones 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.439
 Chocolate dipped 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.199
 I secretly drank red wine whenever possible 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.620
 Fryer tried fried whole fish 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.329
 and how Persil served 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.819
 and found it wonderful heads to eat eyes bones everything 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.809
 iCAS smoking in Burma continues 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:59.150
 SuS so alone 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.909
 Orlow Underwood kidneys 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.269
 and where Dormer blood sausage that bleeds blew me the child 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.269
 and me that my first oyster 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.259
 so that 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.959
 was really a significant event 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.959
 I remember it as well as the loss of my innocence 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.049
 and in many ways with more pleasure 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.440
 the August of this first summer we spent more in the test trains 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.669
 a tiny from Danndorf on the water and Arcor iridescent 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.759
 We lived with my aunt Schaan and you around siblings 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.759
 in the red-plastered white-plastered house in which a father as 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.099
 boy had spent the summer vacation 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.449
 then table on was a constantly dressed bespectacled something austere 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.059
 smelling old woman 

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:43.050
 awkward may an Obama 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.059
 in Oberalm with beret 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:48.799
 Hans rolled cigarettes until they disappeared on the tip of his tongue 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.330
 Inler's test had changed little in all these years 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.559
 the neighbors were still all foreign fishermen 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:58.800
 their families were still breeding rabbits 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.370
 and grew tomatoes behind the house 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.820
 the houses had two kitchens one inside and a fish kitchen outside 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.399
 There was a hand pump for drinking water from the well and a dump toilet all over 

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:11.779
 in the back of the garden 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.360
 everywhere were a Dixon and taste 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.090
 The biggest tourist attractions were the nearby Pillar stage 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.950
 Europe's largest sand dune 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.639
 and the resort town of Parker already in the waiver far away 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.159
 where the French all came together to Lego and Waco 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.710
 Television was a big event 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.380
 and 7 o'clock when the two national stations went on air 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.770
 Trautz my uncle shoots may with a serious face and a hip 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.650
 Chained and keys from his room 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.360
 and solemnly locked the cabinet doors to the screen hidden 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.669
 Animals were my brother and I happier 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.629
 Here we could get more businesses 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:52.620
 the beaches were the climate similar to the one we had at home 

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:53.490
 knew 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.289
 and this can be added to the added attraction of ubiquitous 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.629
 Zibung can 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:01.860
 there was no Dixon to hunt and destroy 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.760
 with easy-to-procurable Petras fresh bangs pops legally in the store 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.199
 could buy 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:12.250
 There was a wooded area within walking distance and in the Andean state 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:14.249
 Hermit lived 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.080
 my brother and I spent many hours there 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.360
 and spied on him from the undergrowth 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.360
 meanwhile I could read and enjoy French comics 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:26.119
 and of course Assig 

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:28.129
 I ate right 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:30.499
 Dull brown train cost 

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:31.930
 Tomato salad 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.319
 Marinate Muhl 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:34.700
 Poulet Basque is 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.710
 We were a few miles from the Basque Country 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.000
 we made day trips to KAP betrayed 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.980
 a wild deserted and old custom nen beautiful Atlantic beach 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.009
 with big billowing waves 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:47.410
 and we had the DAX 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.480
 Sushi like that and cheese wine and when we go with it 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.139
 at home at that time, bottled water was not known at all 

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:58.349
 a little further west the paint can do so 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:06:59.650
 a freshwater lake 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.229
 where my brother and I are there Lobo to rent 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:04.740
 and could kick around in the deep 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.900
 We hate Kufra delicious hot waffles with whipped cream and powdered sugar 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:13.560
 the two hottest songs of the summer in which you were watching Chorzow 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.009
 Reuter Shade of Pale by Procol Harum 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:19.009
 and the SWU is not action by Nancy Sinatra 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.980
 over and over again the French played these two songs 

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.920
 accompanied by popping when French Air Force chiefs on their way to one 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.610
 nearby military training area over the lake Carsten and thereby the 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.249
 Sound barrier broke through 

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:36.569
 with so much rock'n'roll good food and freely available explosives 

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:38.150
 finished reasonably happy
