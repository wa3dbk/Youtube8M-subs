00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
you know my two heads of lettuce another

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.499 
you know my two heads of lettuce another
because<00:01:02.050> I<00:01:02.170> planted<00:01:02.559> four<00:01:02.829> heads<00:01:03.100> here<00:01:03.489> and<00:01:03.670> so

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
because I planted four heads here and so

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.800 
because I planted four heads here and so
over<00:01:04.899> here<00:01:05.320> you<00:01:05.469> can<00:01:06.250> see<00:01:06.539> that's<00:01:07.539> out<00:01:07.780> of

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
over here you can see that's out of

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.899 
over here you can see that's out of
place<00:01:08.139> so<00:01:08.740> that's<00:01:09.009> a<00:01:09.159> weed<00:01:09.340> I<00:01:09.459> just<00:01:09.670> pull<00:01:09.880> out

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
place so that's a weed I just pull out

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.709 
place so that's a weed I just pull out
with<00:01:10.469> simple<00:01:11.469> pulling<00:01:12.340> out<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.880> I<00:01:13.539> look

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
with simple pulling out and I look

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.449 
with simple pulling out and I look
around<00:01:13.869> and<00:01:14.259> you<00:01:14.859> can<00:01:15.039> see<00:01:15.249> to<00:01:15.490> these<00:01:16.389> other

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:17.459 
around and you can see to these other

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:21.029 
around and you can see to these other
bits<00:01:18.459> are<00:01:18.759> weeds<00:01:19.469> because<00:01:20.469> they're<00:01:20.859> out<00:01:21.009> of

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
bits are weeds because they're out of

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.249 
bits are weeds because they're out of
place<00:01:21.459> they're<00:01:21.700> not<00:01:21.880> where<00:01:22.029> I<00:01:22.060> planted<00:01:22.659> so

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
place they're not where I planted so

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.760 
place they're not where I planted so
they're<00:01:23.439> easy<00:01:23.649> to<00:01:25.200> distinguish<00:01:26.200> when<00:01:26.439> you<00:01:26.529> got

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
they're easy to distinguish when you got

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.160 
they're easy to distinguish when you got
your<00:01:26.920> established<00:01:27.459> vegetables

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.219 

so<00:01:33.170> in<00:01:33.560> your<00:01:33.890> established<00:01:34.460> plant<00:01:34.880> squares<00:01:35.360> you

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
so in your established plant squares you

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.840 
so in your established plant squares you
can<00:01:36.409> start<00:01:36.619> to<00:01:36.710> recognize<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.399> weeds<00:01:37.610> more

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
can start to recognize the weeds more

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.929 
can start to recognize the weeds more
easily<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.450> you'll<00:01:39.259> be<00:01:39.380> able<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.649> tell<00:01:40.549> and

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
easily and you'll be able to tell and

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.090 
easily and you'll be able to tell and
your<00:01:41.720> other<00:01:41.750> squares<00:01:42.350> where<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:42.680> have<00:01:42.890> new

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
your other squares where you have new

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.550 
your other squares where you have new
things<00:01:43.399> coming<00:01:43.700> up<00:01:44.170> because<00:01:45.170> you've<00:01:45.350> seen

things coming up because you've seen
them<00:01:45.679> over<00:01:45.860> here<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.189> you<00:01:46.280> can<00:01:46.460> tell<00:01:46.700> that

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
them over here and you can tell that

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.690 
them over here and you can tell that
looks<00:01:47.270> like<00:01:47.420> a<00:01:47.479> weed<00:01:47.750> before<00:01:48.320> long<00:01:48.679> you'll<00:01:48.920> be

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
looks like a weed before long you'll be

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.100 
looks like a weed before long you'll be
able<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:49.970> identify<00:01:50.119> them<00:01:50.689> easily

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.590 

so<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.610> square<00:01:56.940> if<00:01:57.120> you're<00:01:57.300> going<00:01:57.420> to

so in this square if you're going to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.920 
so in this square if you're going to
plant<00:01:58.230> say<00:01:59.810> for<00:02:00.810> sale<00:02:01.710> lettuces<00:02:02.810> you're<00:02:03.810> going

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
plant say for sale lettuces you're going

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.910 
plant say for sale lettuces you're going
to<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.200> four<00:02:05.060> identical<00:02:06.060> looking<00:02:06.920> plants

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
to have four identical looking plants

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.620 
to have four identical looking plants
that<00:02:08.070> come<00:02:08.220> up<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.460> these<00:02:08.610> four<00:02:08.910> spots<00:02:09.330> that

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
that come up in these four spots that

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.820 
that come up in these four spots that
you<00:02:09.840> plant<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.830> on<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.970> you're<00:02:12.300> going<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.510> kno

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
you plant it on so you're going to kno

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.580 
you plant it on so you're going to kno
know<00:02:13.830> if<00:02:13.980> they'll<00:02:14.160> have<00:02:14.370> larger<00:02:14.850> leaves<00:02:15.030> too

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
know if they'll have larger leaves too

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.960 
know if they'll have larger leaves too
so<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:16.800> if<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.100> see<00:02:17.280> something<00:02:17.580> come<00:02:17.940> up

here or here you'll know that it's it's

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.480 
here or here you'll know that it's it's
a<00:02:20.280> weed<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.850> you'll<00:02:21.780> be<00:02:22.110> able<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.320> easily<00:02:22.500> pull

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
a weed and you'll be able to easily pull

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:30.400 
a weed and you'll be able to easily pull
that<00:02:23.700> out<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.940> get<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.330> out<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.630> way

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.430 

there's<00:02:31.040> something<00:02:31.370> here<00:02:31.610> by<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:31.820> seedling

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
there's something here by this seedling

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.050 
there's something here by this seedling
looks<00:02:33.440> like<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.710> might<00:02:33.860> be<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:34.010> weed<00:02:34.220> too<00:02:34.520> but<00:02:34.880> I

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
looks like it might be a weed too but I

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.420 
looks like it might be a weed too but I
think<00:02:35.330> I'll<00:02:35.450> wait<00:02:35.830> another<00:02:36.830> couple<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.370> days

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
think I'll wait another couple of days

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.660 
think I'll wait another couple of days
and<00:02:37.820> just<00:02:37.940> make<00:02:38.150> sure<00:02:38.740> so<00:02:39.740> there's<00:02:39.920> no<00:02:40.070> you

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
and just make sure so there's no you

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.970 
and just make sure so there's no you
know<00:02:40.790> there's<00:02:40.970> no<00:02:41.150> rush<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.780> pull<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:42.920> out

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
know there's no rush to pull that out

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.190 
know there's no rush to pull that out
what<00:02:43.310> it's<00:02:43.430> so<00:02:43.670> close<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.240> seedling<00:02:44.990> to<00:02:45.170> I

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
what it's so close to the seedling to I

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.460 
what it's so close to the seedling to I
don't<00:02:45.320> want<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.620> damage<00:02:45.770> this<00:02:46.040> evening
