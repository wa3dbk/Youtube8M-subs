seconds<00:03:26.340> for<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.549> Porsche<00:03:26.970> cheese<00:03:27.480> well<00:03:28.319> I<00:03:28.350> mean

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
seconds for a Porsche cheese well I mean

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.440 
seconds for a Porsche cheese well I mean
it<00:03:28.799> did<00:03:28.950> have<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.160> better<00:03:29.549> model<00:03:29.819> with<00:03:30.180> quicker

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
it did have a better model with quicker

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.740 
it did have a better model with quicker
specs<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.470> does<00:03:31.620> have<00:03:31.829> some<00:03:32.250> merit<00:03:32.639> but<00:03:33.420> not

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
specs so it does have some merit but not

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.270 
specs so it does have some merit but not
enough<00:03:34.049> because<00:03:34.200> apparently<00:03:34.650> made<00:03:34.859> number<00:03:35.069> 5

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
enough because apparently made number 5
