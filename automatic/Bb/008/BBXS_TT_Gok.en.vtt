techies and today i'm going to show you

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.419 
techies and today i'm going to show you
how<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.400> make<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> screw<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.389> 3ds<00:00:10.110> max<00:00:10.410> i'm<00:00:10.679> going

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
how to make a screw in 3ds max i'm going

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.919 
how to make a screw in 3ds max i'm going
to<00:00:11.490> show<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:11.849> because<00:00:12.059> it's<00:00:12.450> kind<00:00:12.870> of

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
to show you this because it's kind of

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.780 
to show you this because it's kind of
cool<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.530> i<00:00:13.710> just<00:00:13.889> learned<00:00:14.040> how<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.219> do<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.580> and

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
cool and i just learned how to do it and

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.430 
cool and i just learned how to do it and
it<00:00:14.940> shows<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.420> how<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.540> do<00:00:15.780> some<00:00:15.990> pretty<00:00:16.199> neat

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
it shows you how to do some pretty neat

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.220 
it shows you how to do some pretty neat
stuff<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:17.100> let's<00:00:18.000> get<00:00:18.180> started<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:19.199> first

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
stuff so let's get started the first

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.320 
stuff so let's get started the first
thing<00:00:19.590> we're<00:00:19.800> going<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.949> do<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.430> make<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> cone

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
thing we're going to do is make a cone

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.370 
thing we're going to do is make a cone
which<00:00:21.840> will<00:00:22.109> be<00:00:22.260> like<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.740> shaft<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
which will be like the shaft of the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.000 
which will be like the shaft of the
screw<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.670> that<00:00:26.670> looks<00:00:27.199> kind<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.439> not<00:00:28.680> right

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
screw and that looks kind of not right

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.240 
screw and that looks kind of not right
so<00:00:29.340> let's<00:00:29.550> reduce<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.840> radius<00:00:31.289> okay<00:00:31.949> we're

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
so let's reduce that radius okay we're

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.580 
so let's reduce that radius okay we're
good<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.899> let's<00:00:33.899> flip<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.230> upside<00:00:34.559> down

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
good and let's flip it upside down

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
good and let's flip it upside down
because<00:00:35.600> screws<00:00:36.600> all<00:00:36.840> are<00:00:37.219> upside<00:00:38.219> down<00:00:38.250> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
because screws all are upside down and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.819 
because screws all are upside down and
whatnot<00:00:39.680> usually<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.520> yeah<00:00:42.329> there<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.780> go<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
whatnot usually so yeah there we go and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.220 
whatnot usually so yeah there we go and
now<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.160> interesting<00:00:44.579> bit<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.450> not<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
now the interesting bit it's not the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.440 
now the interesting bit it's not the
cone<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.860> actually<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> thread<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.300> we're

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
cone it's actually the thread that we're

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.270 
cone it's actually the thread that we're
going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> put<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.129> going

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
going to put on it and that we are going

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.180 
going to put on it and that we are going
to<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.610> through<00:00:51.030> some<00:00:51.239> sweeping<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.050> first<00:00:52.829> we

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
to do through some sweeping so first we

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.520 
to do through some sweeping so first we
need<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.579> get<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> shapes<00:00:54.239> into<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> shapes

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
need to get the shapes into the shapes

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.680 
need to get the shapes into the shapes
tab<00:00:55.829> right<00:00:56.039> here<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.460> we're<00:00:57.270> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.449> do<00:00:57.660> a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
tab right here and we're going to do a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.510 
tab right here and we're going to do a
helix<00:00:58.230> that's<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.770> give<00:00:58.920> us<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.250> path

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
helix that's going to give us the path

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.459 
helix that's going to give us the path
that<00:00:59.969> we're<00:01:00.149> going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.359> sweep<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.079> thread

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that we're going to sweep the thread

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.359 
that we're going to sweep the thread
around<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:02.100> go<00:01:02.789> ahead<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.000> select<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
around so go ahead and select that and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.399 
around so go ahead and select that and
get<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.640> bottom<00:01:05.909> radius<00:01:06.420> there<00:01:06.720> move<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.290> up

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
get the bottom radius there move it up

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.859 
get the bottom radius there move it up
and<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.250> want<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.670> about<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.210> same<00:01:09.600> height<00:01:09.840> as

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
and you want it about the same height as

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.530 
and you want it about the same height as
your<00:01:10.200> cone<00:01:10.439> here<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.030> second<00:01:12.030> radius<00:01:12.330> you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
your cone here and second radius you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.760 
your cone here and second radius you
don't<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> worry<00:01:13.080> about<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.409> right<00:01:13.590> now

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
don't have to worry about that right now

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.310 
don't have to worry about that right now
if<00:01:13.950> you've<00:01:14.610> never<00:01:14.790> messed<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.840> helix

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
if you've never messed with the helix

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.800 
if you've never messed with the helix
before<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.430> probably<00:01:17.939> looks<00:01:18.210> something<00:01:18.570> like

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
before it probably looks something like

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.999 
before it probably looks something like
this<00:01:19.320> which<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.680> obviously<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:20.790> what<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.150> want

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
this which is obviously not what we want

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.039 
this which is obviously not what we want
first<00:01:23.009> thing<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.340> want<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.240> increase

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
first thing you want to do is increase

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.940 
first thing you want to do is increase
the<00:01:25.110> turns<00:01:25.740> right<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.670> -<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.270> don't<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:28.020> ten

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the turns right here - I don't like ten

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.980 
the turns right here - I don't like ten
is<00:01:29.159> good<00:01:29.369> right<00:01:29.610> now

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
is good right now

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.230 
is good right now
maybe<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.680> bit<00:01:31.860> less<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.100> not<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.000> mess

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
maybe a bit less but not we can mess

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.270 
maybe a bit less but not we can mess
with<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.540> later<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.040> see

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
with that later and then you can see

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.740 
with that later and then you can see
that<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.640> doesn't<00:01:35.880> match<00:01:36.119> up<00:01:36.150> with<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> cone

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
that this doesn't match up with the cone

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.679 
that this doesn't match up with the cone
at<00:01:36.930> all<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.320> let's<00:01:37.740> change<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:39.390> want<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
at all so let's change that you want to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.830 
at all so let's change that you want to
turn<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:41.490> radius<00:01:41.970> right<00:01:42.150> here

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
turn the this radius right here

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.690 
turn the this radius right here
probably<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.680> all<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.009> way<00:01:44.100> down<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.460> zero

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
probably not all the way down to zero

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.480 
probably not all the way down to zero
but<00:01:44.820> close<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:45.740> since<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:46.950> descending

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
but close to there since it's descending

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.240 
but close to there since it's descending
to<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> point<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.210> then<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.020> will<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:49.950> like

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
to a point and then that will be like

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.609 
to a point and then that will be like
that<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.729> let's<00:01:51.090> move<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.930> top<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.500> our

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
that and let's move this on top of our

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.280 
that and let's move this on top of our
cone<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.180> judge<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.810> little<00:01:55.140> better

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
cone so we can judge this little better

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.830 
cone so we can judge this little better
and<00:01:55.560> I'm<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.310> eyeball<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.479> here

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
and I'm just going to eyeball this here

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.280 
and I'm just going to eyeball this here
you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.200> align<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.969> better<00:01:59.969> if<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.049> want<00:02:01.200> it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
you can align it better if you want it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.859 
you can align it better if you want it
to<00:02:01.409> take<00:02:01.619> more<00:02:01.829> time<00:02:02.040> I'm<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.329> increase

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
to take more time I'm going to increase

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.590 
to take more time I'm going to increase
this<00:02:04.350> increase<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.969> just<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.299> know<00:02:06.390> what

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
this increase that so just I know what

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.270 
this increase that so just I know what
I'm<00:02:06.719> doing<00:02:07.110> okay<00:02:08.450> cool<00:02:09.479> now<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.950> interesting

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
I'm doing okay cool now the interesting

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.550 
I'm doing okay cool now the interesting
part<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.849> going<00:02:12.300> into<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.660> modify<00:02:13.050> tab<00:02:13.290> which

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
part is going into the modify tab which

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.820 
part is going into the modify tab which
you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.920 
you
should<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.070> there<00:02:14.280> already<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.820> down<00:02:15.630> in<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
should be there already and down in the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.770 
should be there already and down in the
modifier<00:02:16.350> list<00:02:16.460> you're<00:02:17.460> going<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.880> select<00:02:18.270> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
modifier list you're going to select the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.090 
modifier list you're going to select the
sweep<00:02:19.470> modifier<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:21.180> got<00:02:21.330> crazy<00:02:21.720> things

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
sweep modifier and you got crazy things

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.210 
sweep modifier and you got crazy things
this<00:02:23.180> modifier<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.450> takes<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.140> shape<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.860> it

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
this modifier it takes a shape and it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.150 
this modifier it takes a shape and it
like<00:02:26.490> sweeps<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.600> all<00:02:27.810> over<00:02:28.110> way<00:02:28.230> around<00:02:28.770> your

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
like sweeps it all over way around your

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.060 
like sweeps it all over way around your
spline<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.630> did<00:02:30.780> there<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.110> right<00:02:31.890> now

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
spline that you did there and right now

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.740 
spline that you did there and right now
you<00:02:32.130> can<00:02:32.400> see<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:32.820> kind<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.030> crazy<00:02:33.390> all

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
you can see that it's kind of crazy all

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.040 
you can see that it's kind of crazy all
over<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.110> place<00:02:35.510> first<00:02:36.510> thing<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.870> need<00:02:36.990> to

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
over the place first thing you need to

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.870 
over the place first thing you need to
change<00:02:37.350> in<00:02:37.500> here<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.860> get<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.400> way<00:02:38.430> we<00:02:38.700> want

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
change in here to get it the way we want

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.240 
change in here to get it the way we want
it<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.540> change<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.290> shape<00:02:41.010> right<00:02:41.220> here

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
it is to change this shape right here

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.130 
it is to change this shape right here
we're<00:02:41.670> going<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.850> make<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.180> bar<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.750> then

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
we're going to make it a bar and then

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.450 
we're going to make it a bar and then
that'll<00:02:43.620> be<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:45.170> square<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:47.160> can<00:02:47.310> see

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
that'll be like a square you can see

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.390 
that'll be like a square you can see
right<00:02:47.670> there<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.880> original<00:02:48.870> shape<00:02:49.310> but<00:02:50.310> it

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
right there the original shape but it

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.580 
right there the original shape but it
still<00:02:50.580> looks<00:02:50.760> like<00:02:50.820> garbage<00:02:51.300> so<00:02:51.600> we<00:02:52.350> got<00:02:52.470> to

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
still looks like garbage so we got to

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.110 
still looks like garbage so we got to
change<00:02:52.830> this<00:02:53.100> up<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.370> bit<00:02:53.520> let's<00:02:53.850> change<00:02:54.530> this

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
change this up a bit let's change this

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.060 
change this up a bit let's change this
size<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.450> down<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.660> bit

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
size of it down a bit

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.710 
size of it down a bit
okay<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.310> what<00:02:59.850> really<00:03:00.180> makes<00:03:00.450> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
okay and what really makes the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.210 
okay and what really makes the
difference<00:03:00.750> here<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.470> going<00:03:01.920> all<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.190> way

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
difference here is going all the way

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.400 
difference here is going all the way
down<00:03:02.280> here<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:02.880> turning<00:03:03.209> off<00:03:03.450> banking<00:03:04.200> and

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
down here and turning off banking and

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.290 
down here and turning off banking and
there<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.130> can<00:03:05.280> see<00:03:05.490> that<00:03:05.520> it's<00:03:05.820> all<00:03:05.940> uniform

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
there you can see that it's all uniform

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.630 
there you can see that it's all uniform
and<00:03:06.870> stuff<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.350> it's<00:03:08.040> still<00:03:08.250> kind<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.459> big

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
and stuff and it's still kind of big

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.520 
and stuff and it's still kind of big
though<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:09.000> I'm<00:03:09.180> gonna<00:03:09.240> change<00:03:09.810> this<00:03:10.170> down

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
though so I'm gonna change this down

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.940 
though so I'm gonna change this down
really<00:03:10.920> quick<00:03:12.590> okay

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950

same size and now our thread is kind of

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.160 
same size and now our thread is kind of
weird<00:03:20.610> it's<00:03:20.820> not<00:03:20.880> going<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.150> do<00:03:21.269> anything<00:03:21.450> to

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
is we're going to change the angle up a

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.509 
is we're going to change the angle up a
bit<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.140> um<00:03:30.230> yeah<00:03:31.260> around<00:03:32.250> 45<00:03:32.760> should<00:03:33.360> be<00:03:33.510> good

can do with that we can either mess with

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.460 
can do with that we can either mess with
helix<00:03:50.760> which<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.090> still<00:03:51.510> accessible<00:03:51.930> which<00:03:52.320> is

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
helix which is still accessible which is

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.030 
helix which is still accessible which is
awesome<00:03:52.980> or<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.970> can<00:03:54.090> select<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:55.040> shaft

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
awesome or you can select the shaft

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.650 
awesome or you can select the shaft
right<00:03:56.280> here<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.610> make<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.940> bigger<00:03:57.239> which<00:03:57.510> is

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
right here and make that bigger which is

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.780 
right here and make that bigger which is
probably<00:03:58.110> an<00:03:58.260> easier<00:03:58.739> option<00:03:58.830> for<00:03:59.459> us<00:03:59.519> right

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
probably an easier option for us right

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.420 
probably an easier option for us right
now<00:03:59.820> so<00:03:59.970> I'm<00:04:00.390> going<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.630> do<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.530> scale<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.340> up

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
now so I'm going to do that scale it up

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.020 
now so I'm going to do that scale it up
a<00:04:02.670> bit<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:04.519> yep<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:06.030> move<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:06.989> because<00:04:08.030> we

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
a bit and yep and move it because we

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.090 
a bit and yep and move it because we
want<00:04:09.300> that<00:04:10.070> scale<00:04:11.070> at<00:04:11.190> sideways<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:12.680> want<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.769> do

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
want that scale at sideways I want to do

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.240 
want that scale at sideways I want to do
this<00:04:14.989> kind<00:04:15.989> of<00:04:16.229> relish<00:04:16.830> so<00:04:18.109> well<00:04:19.109> I<00:04:19.350> mean<00:04:19.560> yeah

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
this kind of relish so well I mean yeah

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.250 
this kind of relish so well I mean yeah
there<00:04:20.459> you<00:04:20.580> go<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.910> get<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.150> point<00:04:21.479> it's<00:04:22.020> all

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
there you go you get the point it's all

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.730 
there you go you get the point it's all
fine-tuning<00:04:23.220> from<00:04:23.430> here<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:23.880> then<00:04:24.660> if<00:04:25.260> you

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
fine-tuning from here and then if you

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.410 
fine-tuning from here and then if you
wanted<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.280> add<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:26.580> cap<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:27.120> this

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
wanted to add a cap to this

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.120 
wanted to add a cap to this
screw<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:27.930> can<00:04:28.220> do<00:04:29.220> a<00:04:30.560> sphere<00:04:31.560> or<00:04:31.710> something

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
screw you can do a sphere or something

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.060 
screw you can do a sphere or something
put<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:32.970> on<00:04:33.180> there<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.420> then<00:04:34.070> hemisphere

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
put that on there and then hemisphere

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.360 
put that on there and then hemisphere
that<00:04:35.280> away<00:04:36.710> there<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.800> go

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
that away there you go

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.400 
that away there you go
something<00:04:39.000> like<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.780> then<00:04:40.140> you<00:04:40.290> can

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
something like that and then you can

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.800 
something like that and then you can
boolean<00:04:40.890> out<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.070> little<00:04:41.360> rectangle<00:04:42.360> out<00:04:42.630> of

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
boolean out a little rectangle out of

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.780 
boolean out a little rectangle out of
that<00:04:42.930> to<00:04:43.110> get<00:04:43.230> the<00:04:43.530> where<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.130> screwdriver

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
that to get the where the screwdriver

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.390 
that to get the where the screwdriver
goes<00:04:45.030> in<00:04:45.240> but<00:04:45.960> yeah<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.740> get<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:46.980> idea

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
goes in but yeah you get the idea

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.640 
goes in but yeah you get the idea
there<00:04:47.580> you<00:04:47.640> go<00:04:47.730> there's<00:04:48.060> your<00:04:48.120> screw<00:04:48.450> and<00:04:48.660> to

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
there you go there's your screw and to

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.990 
there you go there's your screw and to
put<00:04:49.830> everything<00:04:50.040> together<00:04:50.310> make<00:04:50.760> it<00:04:50.790> look

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
put everything together make it look

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.310 
put everything together make it look
nice<00:04:51.210> you<00:04:51.510> can<00:04:53.570> boolean<00:04:54.570> it<00:04:54.690> together<00:04:54.990> and

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
nice you can boolean it together and

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.520 
nice you can boolean it together and
it'll<00:04:56.220> be<00:04:56.610> cool<00:04:56.850> and<00:04:57.120> one<00:04:57.900> last<00:04:58.110> thing<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.350> I

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
it'll be cool and one last thing that I

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.980 
it'll be cool and one last thing that I
want<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.740> show<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:58.920> is<00:04:59.250> how<00:05:00.060> much<00:05:00.390> you<00:05:00.630> can<00:05:00.780> do

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
want to show you is how much you can do

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.930 
want to show you is how much you can do
with<00:05:01.410> this<00:05:01.620> thread<00:05:02.040> still<00:05:02.340> now<00:05:02.490> that's<00:05:02.790> on

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
with this thread still now that's on

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.430 
with this thread still now that's on
there<00:05:03.150> it's<00:05:03.240> all<00:05:03.330> positions<00:05:03.780> and<00:05:03.930> stuff<00:05:04.200> so

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
there it's all positions and stuff so

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.010 
there it's all positions and stuff so
you<00:05:04.530> can<00:05:04.680> mess<00:05:05.220> with<00:05:05.400> it<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:05.760> can<00:05:05.940> stock<00:05:06.870> the

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
you can mess with it you can stock the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.920 
you can mess with it you can stock the
helix<00:05:07.380> here<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:07.740> if<00:05:08.310> you<00:05:08.400> wanted<00:05:08.640> like<00:05:09.000> less

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
helix here and if you wanted like less

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.260 
helix here and if you wanted like less
of<00:05:10.110> a<00:05:10.200> thread<00:05:10.530> here<00:05:10.830> you<00:05:10.950> can<00:05:11.130> just<00:05:11.790> turn<00:05:12.030> the

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
of a thread here you can just turn the

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.320 
of a thread here you can just turn the
turns<00:05:12.480> down<00:05:12.780> like<00:05:13.260> that<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:13.740> it'll<00:05:14.670> be<00:05:15.030> cool

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
turns down like that and it'll be cool

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.720 
turns down like that and it'll be cool
but<00:05:16.200> yeah<00:05:16.290> you<00:05:16.350> can<00:05:16.500> see<00:05:16.740> that<00:05:16.950> you<00:05:17.190> can<00:05:17.310> do<00:05:17.580> all

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
but yeah you can see that you can do all

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.670 
but yeah you can see that you can do all
sorts<00:05:17.760> of<00:05:18.060> stuff<00:05:18.270> here<00:05:18.540> it's<00:05:18.690> it's<00:05:19.110> nice<00:05:19.440> I

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
sorts of stuff here it's it's nice I

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.390 
sorts of stuff here it's it's nice I
like<00:05:19.950> it<00:05:20.540> and<00:05:21.540> increase<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:22.440> height<00:05:22.800> if<00:05:23.130> you

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
like it and increase the height if you

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.860 
like it and increase the height if you
want<00:05:23.640> to<00:05:23.850> if<00:05:23.970> you<00:05:24.090> want<00:05:24.270> to<00:05:24.360> make<00:05:24.450> it<00:05:24.570> go<00:05:24.600> all

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
want to if you want to make it go all

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.810 
want to if you want to make it go all
the<00:05:25.020> way<00:05:25.050> into<00:05:25.290> the<00:05:25.380> cap<00:05:25.590> or<00:05:25.890> only<00:05:26.310> part<00:05:26.670> of<00:05:26.730> the

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
the way into the cap or only part of the

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.910 
the way into the cap or only part of the
way<00:05:26.940> down<00:05:27.150> there<00:05:28.140> you<00:05:28.170> go<00:05:28.350> you<00:05:28.410> can<00:05:28.530> do<00:05:28.740> that

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
way down there you go you can do that

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.840 
way down there you go you can do that
and<00:05:29.820> as<00:05:30.480> for<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:30.960> tip<00:05:31.200> right<00:05:31.440> here<00:05:31.500> I<00:05:31.980> don't

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
and as for the tip right here I don't

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.670 
and as for the tip right here I don't
I'm<00:05:33.000> not<00:05:33.030> I<00:05:33.390> don't<00:05:33.540> think<00:05:33.750> that<00:05:33.900> there's<00:05:34.110> a<00:05:34.500> way

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
I'm not I don't think that there's a way

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.460 
I'm not I don't think that there's a way
to<00:05:34.710> automatically<00:05:35.700> get<00:05:35.970> rid<00:05:36.180> of<00:05:36.210> that<00:05:36.390> tip<00:05:36.690> but

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
to automatically get rid of that tip but

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.470 
to automatically get rid of that tip but
you<00:05:38.070> can<00:05:38.220> just<00:05:38.400> convert<00:05:38.790> the<00:05:38.940> whole<00:05:39.090> thing<00:05:39.330> to

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
you can just convert the whole thing to

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.420 
you can just convert the whole thing to
an<00:05:39.600> editable<00:05:39.840> poly<00:05:40.050> one<00:05:40.680> once<00:05:41.040> you<00:05:41.130> are

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
an editable poly one once you are

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.940 
an editable poly one once you are
boolean<00:05:42.090> it<00:05:42.210> and<00:05:42.420> then<00:05:42.540> just<00:05:42.750> mess<00:05:43.590> with<00:05:43.800> the

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
boolean it and then just mess with the

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.770 
boolean it and then just mess with the
vertices<00:05:44.400> there<00:05:44.640> it's<00:05:44.820> not<00:05:45.060> that<00:05:45.240> hard<00:05:45.420> you

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
vertices there it's not that hard you

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.670 
vertices there it's not that hard you
see<00:05:46.470> it<00:05:46.560> yeah<00:05:47.010> it's<00:05:47.220> good<00:05:47.640> so<00:05:48.570> yeah<00:05:49.050> that's<00:05:49.380> the

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
see it yeah it's good so yeah that's the

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.000 
see it yeah it's good so yeah that's the
basics<00:05:50.130> of<00:05:50.250> a<00:05:50.760> screw<00:05:51.600> and<00:05:51.930> I<00:05:52.380> hope<00:05:52.530> you<00:05:52.710> enjoyed

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
basics of a screw and I hope you enjoyed
