00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.160 
the opportunity to to go to market you
got<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.979> exposure<00:02:01.399> in<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:02.390> summer<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:02.990> had<00:02:03.140> a

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
lot of success in summer so there's an

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.820 
lot of success in summer so there's an
example<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.450> kid<00:02:05.660> getting<00:02:06.050> a<00:02:06.229> lot<00:02:06.380> out<00:02:06.410> of<00:02:06.619> it
