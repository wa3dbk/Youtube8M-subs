number<00:05:08.560> one<00:05:14.700> right<00:05:15.700> here<00:05:15.910> in<00:05:16.090> one<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.330> the

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
number one right here in one of the

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.760 
number one right here in one of the
earlier<00:05:17.020> rooms

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
earlier rooms

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.760 
earlier rooms
I<00:05:17.920> think<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.120> second<00:05:19.720> room<00:05:20.080> of<00:05:20.350> the<00:05:20.500> entire

I think the second room of the entire

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.700 
I think the second room of the entire
area<00:05:21.090> it's<00:05:22.090> a<00:05:22.210> rather<00:05:22.360> confusing<00:05:23.110> area<00:05:23.320> with
