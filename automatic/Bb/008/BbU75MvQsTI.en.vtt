it I've thrown a lot of Mythology from
the<00:01:57.299> earlier<00:01:57.689> refugium<00:01:58.320> some<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.369> them

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the earlier refugium some of them

the earlier refugium some of them
economic<00:02:00.479> value<00:02:00.899> has<00:02:01.049> gone<00:02:01.259> white<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:02.009> means

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
economic value has gone white that means

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.870 
economic value has gone white that means
dying<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.479> some<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.869> them<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.229> growing<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.850> I

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
dying but some of them is growing so I

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.249 
dying but some of them is growing so I
hope<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.479> see<00:02:06.689> some<00:02:06.719> life<00:02:07.610> after<00:02:08.610> some<00:02:08.819> time

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.250 
hope to see some life after some time
maybe<00:02:10.259> like<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.770> month<00:02:10.950> or<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.750> if<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.020> light<00:02:13.230> is

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
maybe like a month or so if the light is

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.059 
maybe like a month or so if the light is
proper

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
proper

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.770 
proper
it's<00:02:14.519> only<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.360> watch<00:02:15.769> LEDs<00:02:17.269> but<00:02:18.269> I<00:02:18.420> am

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
it's only can watch LEDs but I am

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.809 
it's only can watch LEDs but I am
planning<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.500> increase<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.220> turn<00:02:20.459> in<00:02:20.580> water

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
planning to increase it to turn in water

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.070 
planning to increase it to turn in water
maybe<00:02:22.280> perhaps<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.549> might<00:02:24.180> buy<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.450> myself<00:02:24.720> of

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
maybe perhaps I might buy it myself of

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.970 
maybe perhaps I might buy it myself of
fluorescent<00:02:25.739> bulb<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.940> anyway<00:02:27.560> now<00:02:28.560> it's<00:02:28.769> in

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
fluorescent bulb so anyway now it's in

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.180 
fluorescent bulb so anyway now it's in
the<00:02:29.190> right<00:02:29.400> sequence<00:02:30.680> rather<00:02:31.680> than<00:02:31.950> putting

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
the right sequence rather than putting

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.089 
the right sequence rather than putting
my<00:02:32.580> refugium<00:02:33.450> over<00:02:33.720> here<00:02:34.140> on<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.470> box<00:02:34.739> which

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
my refugium over here on the box which

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.670 
my refugium over here on the box which
was<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.760> risk<00:02:36.150> because<00:02:36.720> I'd<00:02:37.080> have<00:02:37.230> crushed<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
was a risk because I'd have crushed the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.559 
was a risk because I'd have crushed the
bottom<00:02:38.069> because<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.940> its<00:02:39.090> weight

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
bottom because of its weight

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.360 
bottom because of its weight
I<00:02:39.650> have<00:02:40.650> bought<00:02:41.129> myself<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.790> new<00:02:42.000> separator<00:02:42.540> to

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
I have bought myself a new separator to

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.610 
I have bought myself a new separator to
