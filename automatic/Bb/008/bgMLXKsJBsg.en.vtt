how<00:00:02.590> do<00:00:02.650> we<00:00:02.830> create<00:00:03.070> a<00:00:03.370> focused<00:00:03.939> start<00:00:04.480> line

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:04.630 
how do we create a focused start line

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.650 
how do we create a focused start line
stay<00:00:05.160> well<00:00:06.160> what<00:00:06.340> most<00:00:06.550> people<00:00:06.880> do<00:00:07.059> when<00:00:07.479> they

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
stay well what most people do when they

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.900 
stay well what most people do when they
reward<00:00:08.019> their<00:00:08.080> stays<00:00:08.530> at<00:00:08.710> all<00:00:08.860> is<00:00:09.130> that<00:00:09.490> they

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
reward their stays at all is that they

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.300 
reward their stays at all is that they
lead<00:00:10.360> out<00:00:10.390> to<00:00:10.570> their<00:00:10.870> position<00:00:11.350> test<00:00:11.950> the<00:00:12.130> dog

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.310 
lead out to their position test the dog

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.340 
lead out to their position test the dog
a<00:00:12.340> little<00:00:12.700> bit<00:00:12.820> and<00:00:13.060> then<00:00:13.390> go<00:00:13.630> back<00:00:13.810> and<00:00:14.019> reward

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.350 
a little bit and then go back and reward

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.359 
a little bit and then go back and reward
a<00:00:14.790> lot<00:00:15.790> of<00:00:15.880> people<00:00:16.209> will<00:00:16.390> also<00:00:16.710> reward<00:00:17.710> right

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
a lot of people will also reward right

a lot of people will also reward right
there<00:00:18.670> at<00:00:18.789> the<00:00:18.910> point<00:00:19.180> of<00:00:19.330> the<00:00:19.570> start<00:00:19.840> line

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
there at the point of the start line

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.310 
there at the point of the start line
stay<00:00:20.410> before<00:00:21.280> they've<00:00:21.670> even<00:00:21.699> led<00:00:22.539> out<00:00:22.780> and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
stay before they've even led out and

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.380 
stay before they've even led out and
this<00:00:24.100> is<00:00:24.250> for<00:00:24.430> a<00:00:24.460> couple<00:00:24.610> of<00:00:24.850> reasons<00:00:24.970> one<00:00:25.330> of

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
this is for a couple of reasons one of

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.660 
this is for a couple of reasons one of
them<00:00:25.600> is<00:00:25.840> it's<00:00:26.230> kind<00:00:26.619> of<00:00:26.770> tiring<00:00:27.220> for<00:00:27.580> the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
them is it's kind of tiring for the

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.279 
them is it's kind of tiring for the
handler<00:00:28.060> to<00:00:28.240> go<00:00:28.390> back<00:00:28.570> and<00:00:28.779> forth<00:00:28.990> and<00:00:29.230> back

neither<00:00:34.059> one<00:00:34.329> of<00:00:34.359> those<00:00:34.600> is<00:00:34.899> enough<00:00:35.379> by<00:00:35.859> itself

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359 
neither one of those is enough by itself

neither one of those is enough by itself
you<00:00:37.359> have<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:38.050> build<00:00:38.440> up<00:00:38.620> a<00:00:38.769> reinforcement

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
you have to build up a reinforcement

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.860 
you have to build up a reinforcement
history<00:00:39.850> with<00:00:39.999> your<00:00:40.149> dog<00:00:40.389> that<00:00:41.289> tells<00:00:41.679> them

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
history with your dog that tells them

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.569 
history with your dog that tells them
reinforcement<00:00:43.870> may<00:00:44.079> be<00:00:44.139> coming<00:00:44.579> anywhere

reinforcement may be coming anywhere

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.709 
reinforcement may be coming anywhere
along<00:00:46.389> this<00:00:46.659> entirely<00:00:47.229> doubt<00:00:47.739> and<00:00:48.479> there's<00:00:49.479> no

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
along this entirely doubt and there's no

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.930 
along this entirely doubt and there's no
predictor<00:00:50.289> whether<00:00:50.799> I'm<00:00:51.100> looking<00:00:51.339> at<00:00:51.639> you<00:00:51.789> or

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
predictor whether I'm looking at you or

not whether my arm is up or not whether
I've<00:00:55.479> turned<00:00:55.839> my<00:00:55.989> shoulders<00:00:56.589> back<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:57.249> you<00:00:57.399> or

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
not none of those things matter the

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.000 
not none of those things matter the
reinforcement<00:01:01.479> can<00:01:01.539> just<00:01:01.989> appear<00:01:02.589> at<00:01:02.769> any

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
reinforcement can just appear at any

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.310 
reinforcement can just appear at any
point<00:01:03.429> so<00:01:03.969> you<00:01:04.089> better<00:01:04.330> be<00:01:04.510> paying<00:01:04.720> attention

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
point so you better be paying attention

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.790 
point so you better be paying attention
to<00:01:05.440> me

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
to me

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.790 
to me
and<00:01:06.460> that's<00:01:06.700> how<00:01:06.910> you<00:01:06.970> get<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.480> focused<00:01:08.170> start

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
and that's how you get a focused start

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:17.580 
and that's how you get a focused start
line<00:01:08.980> stay<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:16.390> this<00:01:16.600> session<00:01:16.840> with<00:01:17.110> rook<00:01:17.350> I

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
I reward the start line and of course I

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.870 
I reward the start line and of course I
don't<00:01:22.240> do<00:01:22.690> this<00:01:23.020> many<00:01:23.320> repetitions<00:01:23.880> every

time I put my dog at the start line but
I<00:01:27.010> usually<00:01:27.310> do<00:01:27.820> at<00:01:28.240> least<00:01:28.570> two<00:01:28.990> or<00:01:29.170> three<00:01:29.200> for

make sure that my distribution of
