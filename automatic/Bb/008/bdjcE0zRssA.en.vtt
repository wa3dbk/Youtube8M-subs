so tonight I got asked a question what

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.529 
so tonight I got asked a question what
is<00:00:09.969> the<00:00:10.419> best<00:00:11.139> thing<00:00:11.289> to<00:00:11.530> eat<00:00:11.650> before<00:00:11.769> work<00:00:12.249> out

is the best thing to eat before work out

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.989 
is the best thing to eat before work out
and<00:00:13.539> that<00:00:13.599> answer<00:00:14.169> depends<00:00:14.769> on<00:00:14.889> how<00:00:15.459> far<00:00:15.789> in

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:15.999 
and that answer depends on how far in

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.759 
and that answer depends on how far in
advance<00:00:16.119> you're<00:00:16.539> eating<00:00:16.990> before<00:00:17.410> that<00:00:17.590> work

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
eating on empty stomach so you're

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.670

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
you're moving around in your workout you

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.780 
you're moving around in your workout you
can't<00:01:44.350> do<00:01:44.500> as<00:01:44.649> much<00:01:44.680> because<00:01:45.070> you<00:01:45.280> just<00:01:45.490> feel

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
can't do as much because you just feel

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.109 
can't do as much because you just feel
like<00:01:46.000> crap<00:01:46.299> so<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:48.100> closer<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.549> are<00:01:48.579> to<00:01:48.670> work

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
like crap so the closer you are to work

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.819 
like crap so the closer you are to work
out<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.390> less<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:49.659> want<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:49.899> eat<00:01:50.020> but<00:01:50.469> I<00:01:50.530> think
