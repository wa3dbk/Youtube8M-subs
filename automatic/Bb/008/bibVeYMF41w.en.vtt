right here this is the 1812 can scale
Aussie<00:02:06.030> painting<00:02:07.030> dear<00:02:07.150> Pula<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:08.619> know

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
Aussie painting dear Pula so you know

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.250 
Aussie painting dear Pula so you know
I'll<00:02:09.069> see<00:02:09.369> they<00:02:10.209> have<00:02:10.360> big<00:02:10.569> scale<00:02:10.899> so<00:02:11.140> of

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
I'll see they have big scale so of

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.839 
I'll see they have big scale so of
course<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.620> opinion<00:02:11.980> gets<00:02:12.129> bigger<00:02:12.400> than<00:02:12.640> the

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
course the opinion gets bigger than the

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.410 
course the opinion gets bigger than the
mini<00:02:13.330> 4<00:02:13.540> wheel<00:02:13.569> drive<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:15.060> all<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.240> needed

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
mini 4 wheel drive so all you needed

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.710 
mini 4 wheel drive so all you needed
this<00:02:16.630> piece<00:02:16.840> right<00:02:16.990> here<00:02:17.050> so<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:18.640> piece

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
this piece right here so this piece

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.060 
this piece right here so this piece
actually<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:21.100> is<00:02:22.230> adjustable<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.590> can<00:02:23.830> see

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
actually it is adjustable you can see

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.640 
actually it is adjustable you can see
the<00:02:24.250> angle<00:02:24.700> right<00:02:24.730> here<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.260> fit<00:02:26.500> to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
the angle right here so it fit to

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.280 
the angle right here so it fit to
different<00:02:27.040> size<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:28.450> pinning<00:02:28.720> here<00:02:28.990> of

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
different size of the pinning here of

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.040 
different size of the pinning here of
