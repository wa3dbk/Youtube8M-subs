00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.850 
but I felt pretty consistent on the
first<00:01:43.030> three<00:01:43.299> days<00:01:43.479> on<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:43.780> Viper<00:01:44.020> Scorpion

and the shark today the chameleon the
pattern<00:01:49.689> blew<00:01:49.990> up<00:01:50.200> more<00:01:51.009> than<00:01:51.159> I<00:01:51.280> expected<00:01:51.430> and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
pattern blew up more than I expected and

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.999 
pattern blew up more than I expected and
I<00:01:52.540> wasn't<00:01:53.259> able<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.470> strike<00:01:53.710> as<00:01:53.860> much<00:01:54.070> but<00:01:54.430> just
