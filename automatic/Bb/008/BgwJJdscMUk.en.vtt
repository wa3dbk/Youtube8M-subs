00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:15.020
 we walk nearby 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.270
 make him go near you 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.450
 situation when he wants to leave you 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.069
 the side 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.069
 [music] 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.970
 that is, go the other way on 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.840
 clockwise to be between 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.280
 the dog and the object she seeks 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.640
 so you need to wear him another normal 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:41.680
 leash not tape measure tape here hands 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.320
 you cut a normal leash he put 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.800
 I hear a normal leash to him 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.800
 put on 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.110
 mean when we go near the dog 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.660
 which is excited and distracted by 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.869
 some foreign object need 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.270
 clearly distinguish between 2 situations when 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.630
 the dog does not understand anything and you need 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.810
 just at all costs keep the dog when 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.899
 we take the collar to tighten the leash 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.789
 you can put a dog on your hind legs 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.910
 There are you dogs and are struggling in every way 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.950
 lest she get hit by a car 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.560
 bit the man did not run after the cat 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.140
 did not jump there did not lick someone else 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.430
 child when we do 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.650
 training does not need to leash the leash 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.780
 that is, there is a team leash shedding you 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.010
 beside 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.420
 chill clearly too 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.040
 these situations should not be confused 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.070
 if under the command next you stretch 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.030
 the leash you teach the dog on command 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.340
 near pull 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.100
 it means not necessarily working here 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.900
 jerk not necessarily work jerk 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.690
 because the main thing is that the dog should 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.640
 understand that here's a comfort zone 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.640
 when he leaves the comfort zone he 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.429
 gets a jerk but just as well can it 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.280
 from the outside 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.990
 do not limit slap it 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.510
 to abuse so that he does not jump out 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.510
 from under the arm but in principle you can of course 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.450
 we can act not only jerk two 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.959
 limit the outside 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.060
 so wait and the wonderful thing is 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.860
 stern collar 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:38.420
 which many perceive as sadism 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:40.620
 but why is he so good that his hand has stopped 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.739
 the fact that he gives the opportunity to man 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.860
 trainer without attaching any 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.980
 tremendous titanic effort to do 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.150
 small weak jerks 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.040
 which will already render bad 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.560
 stopped 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.790
 influences the behavior of this 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.320
 if you don't commit any 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.950
 global very large physical 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:05.330
 effort then you think more when 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.510
 where as with what force to pull the dog 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.160
 effective dog training rises 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.829
 because always great physical 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.650
 heavy effort it leads to the fact that 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.450
 lost accuracy and correctness of this 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.360
 impacts 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.780
 therefore it is better to sell them to wear 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.820
 Strogach and normal dog work and 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.360
 get the behavior you need to sit down 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.150
 beside 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.630
 and then praise her well let me eat 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.090
 or play with a toy than not having 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.820
 sufficient strength to fight big 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.739
 large dog to teach her to pull 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.750
 team near and train and not respect 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.110
 host 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.110
 all died 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.190
 I let Z to A 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.860
 See that the leash is slack and give 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.690
 give him food no need to take food 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:10.270
 you need to enter it now 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.830
 and feed sometimes reward that is 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.850
 the impact you have now is 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.519
 stern collar 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:22.049
 and the food is just a reward for obedience 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.049
 look so it was sagging 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.660
