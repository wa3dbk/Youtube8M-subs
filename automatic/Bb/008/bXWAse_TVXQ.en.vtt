00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.129
 p clueless in other things not simply engage in public affairs 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.700
 I think it does very well 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.340
 fruit of what he says no but thinking alone or junglee generates more doubts 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.610
 and marketing does very well very unequal restless always with a 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.050

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.569
 the date number 2 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.069

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.809
 well these things 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.809
 A) Yes 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.489
 ten days later 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.739
 according mercedes gallizó who have received me very well 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:49.980
 All my colleagues have given me a lot of confidence, people have treated me very 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:50.859
 all right 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.449
 I'm enjoying you too 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.999
 and it is something that also dreams 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:59.039
 something that I dreamed and that today was being fulfilled and 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.339
 I can only ask 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:02.749
 the name of mexico 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:04.919
 of Mexican football very high 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.639
 they say that dreams are the basis of success on and off the courts that 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.180
 chiquititas matter 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.119
 josé quintero 

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:13.879
 it's a dream it's a dream 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.479
 You are fulfilled because I am a fanatic 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.969
 of videogames 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:22.109
 because the president had a vision the video games are producing 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.479
 preferred door on a cover with great relief 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.559
 before kevin with pain because it is something but something dreamed and desired 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.370
 I'm going to enjoy it a lot, I'm enjoying it very much 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.240
 in football, the theater of dreams, old trafford, you also expect it 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.909
 in the champions 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.669
 is very complicated and a test with an expert hand in management turned out to be a 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.860
 example is a candidate like belgium 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.159
 act with celtic with copenhagen person 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.509
 very important 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.090
 then you have to enjoy but in the recent tour 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.680
 I fought responsible by contributing 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.169
 of winning to see with American investment for example 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.139
 this goal with the benfica shirt is until now the most awaited moment 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.669
 when he formulated are fabulous 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.059
 I do not know because 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:09.489
 obviously the important duel of triumph in the collective but I like 

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:11.069
 forward put 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:12.529
 the food 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:13.509
 avoided the goal 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.009
 ross the power to score a goal in no time in less than 90 minutes leading 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.559
 played 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:21.539
 in Beijing on the team then 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.539
 It gave me a lot of confidence gave me a lot of joy 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:29.550
 hours now, the workouts for 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.559
 the companions the truth 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:36.419
 I'm super grateful to them because there was a famine taken very well up 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.899
 the goal and all the teammates are there with me I'm looking for something that she 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:44.020
 I was surprised and kirchner 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.770
 very much and gave me a lot of confidence to them not because they with that gesture 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.309
 they let me know at the end 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:53.069
 because in a goal in a friendly match 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.740
 andy murray that the moment seems to be missing the goalkeeper only I was left 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.979
 far away, can not customers 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.979
 his nine companions happiness film in india or brazil 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.789
 or is a spectacular gesture did not intimidate very much the express trip easter 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:12.009
 Mexican territory also includes 200 of another project is another dream 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:13.580
 realized that starts 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.879
 the British boost that in September 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:18.360
 marquez 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.819
 very veteran to be able to support 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:22.669
 Mexican and I have many 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.669
 probably many projects but we started in September 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:27.650
 stadium facilities 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.499
 so what are they for? 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:33.939
 portugal is every minute closer because the boy can already say that has 

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:36.939
 indicated 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:47.739
 finish
