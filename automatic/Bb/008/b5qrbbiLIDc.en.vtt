00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.540 
distributors I'll change that the
igniter<00:02:10.550> plate<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:12.940> unit

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
igniter plate the the unit

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.990 
igniter plate the the unit
that's<00:02:15.210> underneath<00:02:15.960> here<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.950> know<00:02:17.070> those<00:02:17.880> of

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
that's underneath here you know those of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.640 
that's underneath here you know those of
you<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.240> know<00:02:18.390> these<00:02:18.600> 3<00:02:18.930> G's<00:02:19.200> will<00:02:19.410> know<00:02:19.620> that

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
you that know these 3 G's will know that

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.890 
you that know these 3 G's will know that
and<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:22.800> think<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:24.150> best<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.690> get<00:02:24.870> a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
and I think it's best just to get a

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.360 
and I think it's best just to get a
whole<00:02:25.110> new<00:02:25.140> distributor<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.160> start

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
whole new distributor if you start

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.650

messing<00:02:26.580> with<00:02:26.700> these<00:02:26.880> distributors<00:02:27.390> because

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
messing with these distributors because

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.380 
messing with these distributors because
the<00:02:28.080> cam<00:02:28.920> sensors<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.490> there<00:02:29.640> too<00:02:29.850> it's<00:02:30.210> got
