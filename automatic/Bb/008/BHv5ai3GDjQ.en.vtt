00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.540
 and now the one on my foot 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.150
 she called me a paqui if she clings to a farm 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.150
 were all their faces sure 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.230
 and then beauty guys who were active 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.119
 are very welcome but a video 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.869
 staff already wanted to make a blog hit a 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.039
 Talk to you is obviously the content 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.080
 entertainment fun but today is a 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.320
 A little bit more serious people here is the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.390
 next time I see what the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.420
 which is to participate and represent in the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.149
 Brazilian gaming market and even 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.270
 I'm already really happy with the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.129
 enough that we have reached the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.110
 during these two years of production and 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.670
 more focused on youtube such 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.050
 Since I got in I did not want to be 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.120
 one more here on youtube since I 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.969
 I did not want to be a guy who 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.760
 to put my face here and make a game 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.350
 play fun and only and you know you do not have this 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.850
 kind of thing then for example when 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.770
 I'm on a mad influence by 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.480
 6 3 in the individual to all and close 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.270
 partnerships I do not know what I really 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.400
 I want to have a positive influence here. 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.750
 in the brazilian gaming market is because 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.250
 It was something I always think is chic. 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.409
 I always find it very cool, I think 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.119
 the example of reference but the people 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.340
 have for example the brt is to seduce a guy 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.110
 which I admire for fucking size of 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.299
 influence on the gaming market that a 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.040
 dude, this guy has caouses and I want 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.960
 really that's the goal i think 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.670
 of youtube today with obvious that the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.950
 largest was at the moment is reach 1 million 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.020
 of subscribers to that board but very 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.060
 besides, I really want to have a 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.970
 important key role in the market 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.710
 games of Brazil I think mexico 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.979
 communicates with many people think that 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.030
 it is fundamental that people understand that 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.030
 there is behind it a 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.280
 responsibility knows a burden to 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.439
 and I really like this. 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.700
 late of this face that I like that 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.100
 You can make the channel 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.740
 I like having this very strong contact. 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.840
 I do not want to be with you. 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.790
 Legal events I make a point of 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.290
 participate in one of the things that I am 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.600
 really making a big question 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.880
 recently that I think currently 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.170
 by the size of the channel and by the public 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.280
 I have accuracy without a good public. 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.720
 I have a different face public 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.940
 watch various games and have a 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.490
 public of several tribes so I have 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.250
 the guys twitter but not only 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.230
 the intel has the rockets not the guys 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.600
 just from the old rock era I have a 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.580
 people from various games of 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.300
 conversations underneath reflections and 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.070
 blogs 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.930
 so I find it really interesting 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.340
 cool, that's what we know 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.470
 this exchange of experience has brought this 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.060
 exchange of information and it is no wonder that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.130
 I read the comments is not so much read 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.200
 the tweets is because I really like 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.700
 enough to see what you have to say 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.970
 I find it interesting with the 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.710
 games as he has garbage as well is focused 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.280
 You know how much of Italy in all these 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.470
 niches introduce the community of air 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.600
 made such a strong community 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.400
 present the guy and sometimes they are just 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.510
 really it in the air made from the 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.710
 moment I wanted content from a 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.300
 Take some people out of this meal. 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.790
 community I think we can 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.470
 seminar good ideas and plant good 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.970
 in addition to this community that is 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.920
 the community that I think has to go 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.140
 grow a lot and that should grow 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.910
 a lot then I think it's really cool 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.220
 I think the halting of the communities of 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.020
 October, okay, cool way I gave it 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.400
 example of air made printing example of 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.100
 well ramped hard drive ram 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.800
 control of the channel but coach 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.540
 mini crash has gt's galley up 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.360
 now knows all the games in the arena of 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.130
 it's normal for you to enter an expensive channel 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.350
 You've never heard that guy 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.380
 It has to be the 600 thousand subscribers he plays 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.810
 only euro truck simulator knows the guy 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.270
 has an ally of subscribed just for playing 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.100
 again in the sensational stretch I think 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.530
 the internet opens this door very cool and 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.030
 there is a next step that I already give 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.400
 in fact but I want to continue giving 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.950
 This step and I just want to clarify this. 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.290
 For you it is the step of supporting 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.870
 Brazilian developers of games to 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.150
 guys i every time i see a game 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.490
 Indian is a game one of Brazilians going out 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.370
 I really really like to support and 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.510
 I do not in case I contact 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.100
 the company the company contacted 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.130
 with me and I think a lot of content comes out 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.690
 good thing he already left the satellite rush and 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.570
 It was really cool because I posted the video. 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.520
 and the guys came to me fucking 1 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.290
 last October you know and I think 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.180
 This is a very nice contact, I think. 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.280
 It's a way of people encourages one 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.180
 very strong market adds the market 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.130
 of brazilian games 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.080
 we have a market for games more 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.210
 expensive in the expensive world and yet we 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.940
 comes from countless games that we see 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.900
 that our community is very passionate 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.520
 god island 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.620
 much more time up here after 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.030
 taxes I really think it has a 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.000
 has very strong potential in this 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.650
 market and that you and I have as 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.740
 to help this market develop 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.330
 Stronger you know, it's obvious I do not 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.520
 I hope that in the next five years 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.139
 We have a rockstar in Brazil. 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.509
 knows how to win a Brazilian company 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.150
 in such a large size but I think 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.669
 You can actually own to support some 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.620
 companies and fell due to the delay 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.150
 is a game type rodrigues came out of a 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.009
 a small company and suddenly 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.500
 is a burst knows 40 million 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.000
 downloads in the world so I think 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.860
 This is a way I can help. 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.479
 quite the Brazilian unit of games and 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.479
 I count on your support is obvious 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.889
 I do not work alone what I 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.410
 help which will greatly help the 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.030
 push you guys so I wanted 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.919
 just for releasing real to you guys that I 'm going 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.750
 yes yes bring some indy and only games 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.570
 some different games eg wheel 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.190
 It has brought us days that are sensational and it is 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.440
 a Brazilian producer 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.720
 the satellite rush I get in touch with 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.370
 the two companies to bring these games 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.020
 that this does not mean that 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.240
 the content of the channel you are going to send will have 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.570
 Cta will grab you velox he 'll have the 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.070
 games the games ripped the tincans did 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.780
 but I really want to help 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.260
 brazilian games industry 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.599
 I think I have an audience that I 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.400
 construct and is a conscious public to a 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.020
 public that you are not a gang 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.690
 You're an asshole, you're not the tastie. 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.400
 we can not go play mano shit I 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.620
 I see the staff here really when 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.389
 There is something new, he explained. 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.449
 he goes behind and I think companies that 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:00.530
 need to have this kind of incentive and I 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.669
 I want to do my part, I'm 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.470
 making it clear to you that 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.210
 we will have enough alternative games 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.650
 shall we say here in the channel has 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.940
 enough because the company does not 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.039
 producing so many games 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.610
 but while the Brazilian company produces 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:16.130
 games I really want to invest in it 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.870
 this is my time on it I think I 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.400
 I help a lot more an Indian company to 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.900
 sometimes bringing a video by placing ten 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.120
 people to collaborate on their project 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.919
 than I necessarily of the year then 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.180
 I'll do my part in both 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.979
 I feel because I really want to see 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.289
 beliefs but I'm really going to start 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.699
 see a lot of that stuff here in the 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.130
 beauty channel I want to know the opinion of 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.840
 You about this and if you have 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.219
 game recommendations compatible with 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.289
 this project seems to be very good 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:41.849
 just send me I will not blame 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:45.240
 only for this project because I have 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:47.669
 enough is fear that blows either hand 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.409
 collective funding at this time 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:50.669
 Portuguese easier and I have a 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:53.580
 little afraid of this to be very honest 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:55.830
 Why have you ever had a game of mange games? 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.349
 that have fallen, but I think the 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.059
 Brazilian is a little more faithful to 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:02.279
 these commitments I really think that 

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:04.199
 a Brazilian gaming company begins to 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:06.119
 to form coming is a dream a person who 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.589
 It's at stake so I just wanted to 

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:09.449
 really clarify this point you 

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:11.069
 say that we will have more frequency 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:12.509
 now some alternative games and that
