Temple not the actual instance these
guys<00:00:47.730> are<00:00:48.329> incredibly<00:00:48.899> easy<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> kill<00:00:49.350> I'm

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
guys are incredibly easy to kill I'm

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
guys are incredibly easy to kill I'm
wearing<00:00:50.579> dps<00:00:50.940> gear<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.420> actually<00:00:51.600> take<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
wearing dps gear so I actually take a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.420 
wearing dps gear so I actually take a
decent<00:00:52.140> amount<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.500> damage<00:00:52.860> throughout<00:00:53.190> this

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
decent amount of damage throughout this

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.209 
decent amount of damage throughout this
but<00:00:53.789> could<00:00:54.449> theoretically<00:00:54.840> pull<00:00:55.320> forever<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
but could theoretically pull forever you

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.700 
but could theoretically pull forever you
do<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.579> pull<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.960> go<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.199> top<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
do this pull and then you go up top and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.020 
do this pull and then you go up top and
you<00:00:58.859> kill<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> few<00:00:59.219> guys<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.699> then<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.820> come

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
you kill a few guys and then you come

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.880 
you kill a few guys and then you come
back<00:01:00.059> down<00:01:00.390> when<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:00.660> all<00:01:00.780> respond<00:01:01.199> doesn't

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
back down when they all respond doesn't

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.920 
back down when they all respond doesn't
take<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.129> long<00:01:02.190> you'd<00:01:02.640> probably<00:01:03.600> make<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
take that long you'd probably make a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.770 
take that long you'd probably make a
good<00:01:04.640> 40<00:01:05.640> cloth<00:01:06.000> /<00:01:07.159> set<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.340> kills<00:01:08.780> not

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
good 40 cloth / set of kills not

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.330 
good 40 cloth / set of kills not
including<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.229> ones<00:01:10.409> up<00:01:10.560> top<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.100> just

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
including the ones up top that you just

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.649 
including the ones up top that you just
kill<00:01:11.490> randomly<00:01:11.970> while<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.240> wait<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.420> these

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
kill randomly while you wait for these

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.149 
kill randomly while you wait for these
to<00:01:12.689> respawn<00:01:13.760> so<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.850> get<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> 40<00:01:15.570> cloth<00:01:16.159> take

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
to respawn so you get the 40 cloth take

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.460 
to respawn so you get the 40 cloth take
the<00:01:17.340> poll<00:01:17.520> takes<00:01:17.880> literally<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.689> minute<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the poll takes literally a minute and a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.820 
the poll takes literally a minute and a
half<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.299> then<00:01:21.299> all<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.650> do

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
half and then all you have to do

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.800 
half and then all you have to do
basically<00:01:24.830> is<00:01:25.830> turn<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.700> cloth<00:01:27.060> into<00:01:27.540> bags

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
basically is turn that cloth into bags

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.920 
basically is turn that cloth into bags
and<00:01:28.369> each<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.549> those<00:01:29.670> stacks<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:30.450> basically

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
and each of those stacks are basically

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.109 
and each of those stacks are basically
worth<00:01:31.200> eight<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.979> twelve<00:01:32.220> gold<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.880> let's<00:01:33.000> say

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
worth eight to twelve gold so let's say

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
worth eight to twelve gold so let's say
it's<00:01:33.240> worth<00:01:33.329> ten<00:01:33.659> gold<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.960> stack<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:35.040> two

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
it's worth ten gold a stack you get two

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.789 
it's worth ten gold a stack you get two
of<00:01:35.369> them<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.880> two<00:01:36.180> minutes<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:37.110> go<00:01:37.259> up<00:01:37.350> top<00:01:37.560> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
of them in two minutes you go up top you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.230 
of them in two minutes you go up top you
get<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.009> not<00:01:38.310> including<00:01:38.670> what<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.850> get<00:01:38.970> up<00:01:39.000> top

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
get it not including what you get up top

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.630 
get it not including what you get up top
when<00:01:39.450> you're<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.720> farming<00:01:40.049> random<00:01:40.350> stuff

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
when you're just farming random stuff

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.039 
when you're just farming random stuff
let's<00:01:41.640> say<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.210> cycle<00:01:42.570> every<00:01:42.659> five

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
let's say you do this cycle every five

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.359 
let's say you do this cycle every five
minutes<00:01:43.350> that's<00:01:44.009> 10<00:01:44.430> gold<00:01:44.729> 45<00:01:45.689> minutes<00:01:46.369> which

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
minutes that's 10 gold 45 minutes which

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.060 
minutes that's 10 gold 45 minutes which
is<00:01:47.399> basically<00:01:47.909> 200<00:01:48.659> Goulding<00:01:48.990> cloth<00:01:49.290> alone<00:01:49.740> in

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
is basically 200 Goulding cloth alone in

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.120 
is basically 200 Goulding cloth alone in
an<00:01:50.220> hour<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.939> doesn't<00:01:51.329> include<00:01:51.590> greys<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
an hour that doesn't include greys and
