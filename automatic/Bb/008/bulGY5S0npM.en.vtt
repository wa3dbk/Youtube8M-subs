00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.740

 100 people 'behind the my sport 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.950
 has to finish quickly 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.000
 she probably has to pee off well we 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.590
 sitting there was an end too thick because 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 I stand by the first come on, we can 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.159
 this roughly I am partly on the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.119
 first place because he can also reach 140 points 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.979

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.260
 a 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.330
 I know a lot and then exciting too 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.920
 just again next to it is really a bit 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.600
 angry and in this folder like I said 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.480

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.280

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.459

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.900

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.720
 the 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.000
 tensioning system man he could not doorway 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.440

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.500
 really happens 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.030
 you estimate it in a series of jazz 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.590
 Criticism to address Johan must come anyway 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.819
 Once a've won the game 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.800
 the game is also leaking a little bit there 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.150
 I'm already not so happy with that 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.320
 tensioning system 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.300

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.550

 man so I don't get it either 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.959
 a large folder would make you think after it 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.600
 flushing system will be a bit good 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.580

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.019
