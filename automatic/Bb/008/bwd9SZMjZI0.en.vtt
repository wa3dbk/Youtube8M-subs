00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.210 
drifting is like your friend just drift
everywhere<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:52.350> even<00:01:52.590> even<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:53.040> there

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
everywhere you see even even if there

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.550 
everywhere you see even even if there
isn't<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.729> turn<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.689> drift<00:01:55.049> for<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> sake<00:01:55.530> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
isn't a turn just drift for the sake of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.609 
isn't a turn just drift for the sake of
it<00:01:56.600> all<00:01:57.600> right<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:57.990> I'm<00:01:58.200> tip<00:01:58.469> number

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
it all right so that's I'm tip number

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.840 
it all right so that's I'm tip number
two<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.100> for<00:01:59.729> tip<00:01:59.909> number<00:02:00.090> three<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:01.219> um<00:02:02.250> I

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
two and for tip number three I um I

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.280 
two and for tip number three I um I
don't<00:02:03.000> think<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.240> applies<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.960> everybody

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
don't think this applies to everybody

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.490 
don't think this applies to everybody
but<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:05.009> put<00:02:05.490> my<00:02:05.640> sensitivity<00:02:06.360> all<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.290> way<00:02:07.380> up

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
but I put my sensitivity all the way up

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.859 
but I put my sensitivity all the way up
high<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.979> hundred<00:02:08.369> percent<00:02:08.520> because<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.509> feel

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
high on a hundred percent because I feel

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.720 
high on a hundred percent because I feel
that<00:02:09.899> when<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.590> started<00:02:10.979> out<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.160> fifty<00:02:11.580> percent

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that when it started out a fifty percent

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.270 
that when it started out a fifty percent
I<00:02:12.120> couldn't<00:02:12.629> really<00:02:12.780> turn<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.770> car<00:02:13.980> really

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
I couldn't really turn the car really

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.970 
I couldn't really turn the car really
smoothly<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:15.060> was<00:02:15.180> really<00:02:15.480> slow<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.080> stuff<00:02:16.349> so

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
smoothly it was really slow and stuff so

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.369 
smoothly it was really slow and stuff so
I<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:17.239> like<00:02:18.239> cranked<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.780> up<00:02:18.900> all<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.260> way<00:02:19.349> to

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
I just like cranked it up all the way to

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.680 
I just like cranked it up all the way to
hundred<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.700> know<00:02:20.879> kept<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.300> there<00:02:21.450> I

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
hundred and you know kept it there I

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.040 
hundred and you know kept it there I
think<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.260> doing<00:02:22.500> good<00:02:22.650> for<00:02:22.860> me<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:24.390> yeah<00:02:24.780> so

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
think it's doing good for me and yeah so

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.170 
think it's doing good for me and yeah so
that's<00:02:25.620> another<00:02:25.920> tip<00:02:26.280> if<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.610> want<00:02:26.640> if<00:02:27.060> you

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
that's another tip if you want if you

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.570 
that's another tip if you want if you
guys<00:02:27.300> wanna<00:02:27.629> you<00:02:27.900> know<00:02:27.930> put<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.860> up<00:02:28.950> 200<00:02:29.430> go

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
guys wanna you know put it up 200 go

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.300 
guys wanna you know put it up 200 go
ahead<00:02:29.849> yeah<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.810> think<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.319> runs<00:02:31.470> smoother<00:02:32.099> and

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
ahead yeah I think it runs smoother and

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.660 
ahead yeah I think it runs smoother and
much<00:02:32.489> easier<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.180> control<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.599> car<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.670> yeah

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
much easier to control the car and yeah

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.990 
much easier to control the car and yeah
so<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.720> then<00:02:36.989> another<00:02:37.410> thing<00:02:37.769> is<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:38.250> had<00:02:38.940> a

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
so and then another thing is I had a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.100 
so and then another thing is I had a
question<00:02:39.180> okay<00:02:39.870> um<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.500> don't<00:02:40.860> maybe<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:42.690> haven't

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
question okay um I don't maybe I haven't

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.839 
question okay um I don't maybe I haven't
looked<00:02:43.560> at<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.800> yet<00:02:43.950> but<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.640> was<00:02:44.790> just

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
looked at it yet but I was just

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.259 
looked at it yet but I was just
wondering<00:02:45.060> like<00:02:45.599> can<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.110> move<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:47.000> break<00:02:48.000> in

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
wondering like can you move the break in

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.589 
wondering like can you move the break in
the<00:02:48.300> nitro<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.260> stuff<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.920> had<00:02:50.610> no<00:02:50.790> idea<00:02:50.910> cuz<00:02:51.360> I

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
the nitro and stuff I had no idea cuz I

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.830 
the nitro and stuff I had no idea cuz I
looked<00:02:52.560> for<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.129> think<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.060> didn't<00:02:54.330> find<00:02:54.569> it

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
looked for it I think I didn't find it

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.009 
looked for it I think I didn't find it
not<00:02:55.260> sure<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.830> actually<00:02:56.700> look<00:02:56.849> again<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.870> I'm

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
not sure it actually look again but I'm

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.339 
not sure it actually look again but I'm
just<00:02:58.230> asking<00:02:58.590> if<00:02:58.709> any<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.159> know<00:02:59.340> out<00:02:59.519> there

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
just asking if any of you know out there

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.809 
just asking if any of you know out there
so<00:03:01.349> yeah<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:01.680> was<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.980> part<00:03:02.220> where<00:03:02.430> he<00:03:02.670> gets

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
so yeah this was the part where he gets

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.990 
so yeah this was the part where he gets
up<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.209> me<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.599> it's<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.620> close<00:03:05.069> one<00:03:05.099> on<00:03:05.550> one<00:03:05.819> to

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
up to me and it's a close one on one to

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.430 
up to me and it's a close one on one to
the<00:03:06.120> finish<00:03:07.069> but<00:03:08.069> yeah<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.700> also<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.810> don't

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
the finish but yeah and also I don't

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.290 
the finish but yeah and also I don't
recommend<00:03:10.739> doing<00:03:10.980> what<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.640> barrel<00:03:12.030> rolls

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
recommend doing what the barrel rolls

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.990 
recommend doing what the barrel rolls
and<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.659> flat<00:03:12.930> spins<00:03:13.319> on<00:03:13.590> this<00:03:13.800> map<00:03:14.069> I<00:03:14.400> don't

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
and the flat spins on this map I don't

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.309 
and the flat spins on this map I don't
know<00:03:15.090> see<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.450> ramp<00:03:15.750> right<00:03:15.930> there<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
know see the ramp right there to the

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.990 
know see the ramp right there to the
right<00:03:16.409> I<00:03:16.769> don't<00:03:17.159> recommend<00:03:17.640> doing<00:03:17.909> that

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
right I don't recommend doing that

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.820 
right I don't recommend doing that
because<00:03:18.239> last<00:03:18.480> time<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:18.750> did<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.110> wrecked<00:03:19.500> I

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
because last time I did it I wrecked I

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.270 
because last time I did it I wrecked I
think<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.610> good<00:03:20.819> map<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.330> do<00:03:21.480> is<00:03:21.690> like<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.280> don't

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
think a good map to do is like I don't

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.039 
think a good map to do is like I don't
know<00:03:23.370> what<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.640> map<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.940> called<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.810> think

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
know what the map is called and I think

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.170 
know what the map is called and I think
it's<00:03:25.170> Tokyo<00:03:25.680> yeah<00:03:25.920> Tokyo<00:03:26.670> is<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.819> really<00:03:27.030> good

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
it's Tokyo yeah Tokyo is a really good

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.539 
it's Tokyo yeah Tokyo is a really good
place<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.780> do<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.560> barrel<00:03:28.890> spins<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.489> all

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
place to do the barrel spins and all

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.990 
place to do the barrel spins and all
that<00:03:29.760> stuff<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.269> yeah<00:03:31.310> stay<00:03:32.310> tuned<00:03:32.640> for<00:03:32.849> more
