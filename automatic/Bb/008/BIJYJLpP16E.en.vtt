 momentum 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.580
 it is also actually being made 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.200
 but we must not forget that this is until the middle of the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.920
 social agogic worldview can only reach that worldview in the sixties 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.210
 in a radical way 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.270
 That is a huge growth of the welfare state and hair one 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.650
 facilities that you are actually expressed in this picture because it too

 he must certainly give you aloofness 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.310
 I've had to be sure yes it does the line should be just the worst 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.310
 that you make people dependent on you 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.390
 and if you want that whole story summary to go a board or there is a picture then 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.730
 it is about this image 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.430

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.460
 garage owner where to take your car

 to the idea of ​​the roadside assistance to your target group 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.460
 two the tendency is that you see 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.530
 that a lot of new professional the remedy we have in the last ten years 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.429

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.030
 world

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.239
 such a change 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.129
