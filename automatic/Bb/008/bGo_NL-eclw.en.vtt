00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
of property an island in this case you

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.910 
of property an island in this case you
can<00:00:30.269> trade<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.810> off<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> things<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.800> you

eat and consume every day and you can do
that<00:00:34.800> for<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.100> long<00:00:35.280> time<00:00:36.290> but<00:00:37.290> eventually<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
that for a long time but eventually you

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.830

run<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.460> property<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.210> then<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
run out of property and then you have to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.479 
run out of property and then you have to
work<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.200> whole<00:00:40.320> lot<00:00:40.530> harder<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.070> provide<00:00:41.340> your

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
work a whole lot harder to provide your

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
have long-term consequences but

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.760 
have long-term consequences but
sometimes<00:00:48.510> people<00:00:48.780> don't<00:00:48.840> think<00:00:49.050> about<00:00:49.170> in

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
sometimes people don't think about in

eight years this country has started

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.729 
eight years this country has started
consuming<00:01:00.230> considerably<00:01:01.230> more<00:01:01.469> than<00:01:01.649> it

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
consuming considerably more than it

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.889 
consuming considerably more than it
produces<00:01:02.160> because<00:01:03.000> we're<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.300> rich<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.809> do

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
produces because we're so rich we can do

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.270 
produces because we're so rich we can do
it<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.199> long<00:01:04.350> time<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.010> do<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.189> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
it for a long time and we can do it a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.789 
it for a long time and we can do it a
large<00:01:05.519> scale<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.180> can't<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.570> forever

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
large scale that we can't do it forever

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.630 
large scale that we can't do it forever
eventually<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.890> run<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.189> mean<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.520> like
