00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.750
 the power like 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.669
 geared to the differential 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.500
 Three bring writes that way 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:37.760
 that the advice is with the differential 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.610
 Housing connected via the differential 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.399
 Housing and balancing ski the wheels 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.769
 the two will be half past eight conical wheels 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.320
 driven 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:51.670
 the balancing device transmit the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.219
 power on half past eight wheels 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:00.580
 the half kilo wheels transfer the 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:03.199
 force on the prosimians the lager 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:08.030
 support the differential in the 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:10.270
 gearbox housing over the sharp babel 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.509
 will the circuit of 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.119
 differential lock actuated 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:22.250
 The city must move the lock 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:24.979
 bolt the lock bolt connect the 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.270
 differential housing with the half-fare 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.390
 cone rat is the differential function 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.090
 disabled 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.020
 spear bolts lock may only at 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.000
 driving straight ahead 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.880
 otherwise the gear can be big 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.870
 get damaged 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.970
 what happens now when driving straight ahead 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.860
 Differential housing is from the engine 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:58.909
 powered with the differential housing 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.970
 the balancing gate wheel will move it 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.640
 stands still and does not turn around 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.619
 own axis 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:12.769
 Garath distributes the power 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:16.760
 evenly on both wheels at the 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:20.180
 Wheels are the same way back and 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.580
 have equal speed and what 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.610
 happens now on a curve drive 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.580
 the differential housing also becomes 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.970
 powered by the engine 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:37.050
 Differential housing will compensate 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.240
 It is now turning around 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.150
 own axis 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:46.110
 The outside wheel has to be faster 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:50.430
 turn as the inside wheel as it turns 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.460
 must go another way 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.440
 balancing cone advice resembles the 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.440
 Speed ​​differences off 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.680
 skilled pro bubba we'll see each other 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.680
 Again, that's clear
