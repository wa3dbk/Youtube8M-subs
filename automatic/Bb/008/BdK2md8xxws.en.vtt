too<00:00:31.140> much<00:00:31.349> okay<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.009> riff

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
too much okay on this riff

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.250 
too much okay on this riff
now<00:00:34.399> let's<00:00:35.399> start<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:36.000> what's<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.020> left

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
now let's start with what's the left

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260 
now let's start with what's the left
hand<00:00:37.530> here<00:00:37.829> it's<00:00:38.309> sort<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.700> D<00:00:38.879> chord<00:00:39.149> form

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
hand here it's sort of a D chord form

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.650 
hand here it's sort of a D chord form
it's<00:00:39.660> really<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> D<00:00:40.469> 5<00:00:40.800> chord<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.850> all<00:00:42.510> that

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
it's really a D 5 chord and all that

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.970 
it's really a D 5 chord and all that
means<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.170> don't<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.559> third<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
means is we don't have the third of the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.540 
means is we don't have the third of the
chord<00:00:44.250> there's<00:00:44.430> no<00:00:44.550> f-sharp<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.300> it

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.220 

we're<00:00:49.550> gonna<00:00:49.640> have<00:00:49.940> second<00:00:50.690> thread<00:00:50.900> here<00:00:51.110> on

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.120 
we're gonna have second thread here on
the<00:00:51.350> g-string

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
the g-string

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.970 
the g-string
now<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.550> g-string<00:00:53.239> is<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:54.230> third<00:00:54.500> one<00:00:54.710> up

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980
