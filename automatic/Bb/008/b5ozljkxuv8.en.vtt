in a station on this radio it's a three
dialer<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> t<00:00:35.070> RF<00:00:35.460> circuit<00:00:40.340> here<00:00:41.340> you

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
dialer and it is a t RF circuit here you

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.209 
dialer and it is a t RF circuit here you
can<00:00:41.640> see<00:00:44.239> two<00:00:45.239> variable<00:00:45.899> capacitors<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.870> the

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
can see two variable capacitors and the

here's what the bottom of the radio

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.290 
here's what the bottom of the radio
looks<00:04:00.900> like<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:02.430> can<00:04:02.610> see<00:04:02.820> that<00:04:03.060> they<00:04:03.270> just

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
looks like you can see that they just

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.920 
looks like you can see that they just
ran<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:03.900> wires<00:04:05.030> where<00:04:06.030> they<00:04:06.240> needed<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.750> go

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
ran the wires where they needed to go

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.670 
ran the wires where they needed to go
and<00:04:06.980> staple<00:04:07.980> them<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.410> bottom<00:04:10.410> of<00:04:10.560> the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
and staple them to the bottom of the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.900 
and staple them to the bottom of the
board<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:12.600> we've<00:04:13.470> got<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.890> couple<00:04:14.190> of<00:04:14.400> stickers

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
board and we've got a couple of stickers

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.080 
board and we've got a couple of stickers
and<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:16.440> parts<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:17.510> we<00:04:18.510> do<00:04:18.720> have<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:20.090> need

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
and the parts that we do have that need

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.450 
and the parts that we do have that need
to<00:04:21.209> be<00:04:22.130> in<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.820> radio<00:04:24.210> they<00:04:25.050> just<00:04:25.410> dug<00:04:26.040> out<00:04:26.250> the

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
to be in the radio they just dug out the

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.360 
to be in the radio they just dug out the
wood<00:04:26.750> so<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:28.110> part<00:04:29.010> would<00:04:29.250> fit<00:04:31.070> take<00:04:32.070> a<00:04:32.100> look

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
wood so the part would fit take a look

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.930 
wood so the part would fit take a look
closer<00:04:32.880> look<00:04:33.270> at<00:04:33.390> those<00:04:33.600> stickers<00:04:37.880> now<00:04:38.880> the

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
closer look at those stickers now the

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.330 
closer look at those stickers now the
item<00:04:39.420> that's<00:04:39.630> on<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.990> right<00:04:40.200> that's<00:04:41.010> the

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.940 
item that's on the right that's the
on/off<00:04:42.150> switch<00:04:44.540> here's<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.780> other<00:04:45.870> sticker

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:55.160 

and<00:04:50.960> here's<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:52.020> capacitor<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:54.270> original<00:04:54.900> one

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
and here's a capacitor the original one

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.840 
and here's a capacitor the original one
of<00:04:55.380> course<00:04:55.860> is<00:04:56.070> long<00:04:56.310> gone<00:04:56.640> but<00:04:58.430> you<00:04:59.430> can<00:04:59.580> see

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
of course is long gone but you can see

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.830 
of course is long gone but you can see
that<00:05:00.150> they<00:05:02.990> made<00:05:03.990> room<00:05:04.380> by<00:05:05.510> taking<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.660> wood

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
that they made room by taking the wood

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.860 
that they made room by taking the wood
away<00:05:07.400> so<00:05:08.400> they<00:05:08.610> could<00:05:08.670> put<00:05:08.910> a<00:05:08.970> capacitor<00:05:09.210> in

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
away so they could put a capacitor in

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:16.189 
away so they could put a capacitor in
there<00:05:12.860> okay<00:05:13.860> you<00:05:13.919> want<00:05:14.190> to<00:05:14.280> tune<00:05:14.520> in<00:05:14.700> a<00:05:14.820> station

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
there okay you want to tune in a station

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.050 
there okay you want to tune in a station
on<00:05:16.740> this<00:05:16.949> Atwater<00:05:17.520> camp

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
on this Atwater camp

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.210 
on this Atwater camp
and<00:05:19.510> I<00:05:19.600> like<00:05:19.810> to<00:05:19.990> start<00:05:20.290> at<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.650> antenna<00:05:20.980> in

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
and I like to start at the antenna in

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.800 
and I like to start at the antenna in
and<00:05:21.430> work<00:05:22.300> in<00:05:22.540> this<00:05:22.810> direction<00:05:24.420> okay<00:05:25.420> let's

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
and work in this direction okay let's

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.260 
and work in this direction okay let's
turn<00:05:26.050> on<00:05:26.230> power

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.629 

and<00:05:31.819> turn<00:05:32.819> up<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.030> rheostats<00:05:34.130> so<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.370> tubes

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
and turn up the rheostats so the tubes

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:43.969 
and turn up the rheostats so the tubes
are<00:05:36.000> lit<00:05:36.870> as<00:05:37.020> bright<00:05:37.319> as<00:05:37.500> they<00:05:37.710> can<00:05:37.889> be<00:05:42.590> okay<00:05:43.590> we

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
are lit as bright as they can be okay we

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:49.070 
are lit as bright as they can be okay we
can<00:05:44.130> hear<00:05:44.340> noise<00:05:44.639> but<00:05:45.090> no<00:05:45.270> station<00:05:47.270> and<00:05:48.270> each

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
can hear noise but no station and each

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.200 
can hear noise but no station and each
one<00:05:49.349> of<00:05:49.470> these<00:05:49.620> is<00:05:49.830> supposed<00:05:50.130> to<00:05:50.250> be<00:05:50.400> about<00:05:50.849> the

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
one of these is supposed to be about the

00:05:51.210 --> 00:06:00.709 
one of these is supposed to be about the
same<00:05:54.979> so<00:05:55.979> we'll<00:05:56.280> keep

00:06:05.359 --> 00:06:05.369 
turning them up starting at the antenna

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:15.179 
turning them up starting at the antenna
in<00:06:06.289> working<00:06:07.289> toward<00:06:07.559> the<00:06:08.869> 3/2<00:06:09.869> violin
