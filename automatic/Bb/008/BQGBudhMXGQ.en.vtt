bitch<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:10.659> this<00:03:10.840> actually<00:03:11.109> works<00:03:11.680> now

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
bitch so this actually works now

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.399 
bitch so this actually works now
hopefully<00:03:13.030> this<00:03:13.209> will<00:03:13.329> work<00:03:13.390> also<00:03:13.720> next<00:03:14.200> time

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
hopefully this will work also next time

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.380 
hopefully this will work also next time
but<00:03:14.950> it's<00:03:15.310> gonna<00:03:15.430> be<00:03:15.519> hard<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.819> say<00:03:15.970> after<00:03:16.120> all

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
but it's gonna be hard to say after all

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.000 
but it's gonna be hard to say after all
the<00:03:16.480> hype<00:03:16.599> around<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:17.140> for<00:03:17.319> iron<00:03:17.650> banner<00:03:17.829> and

reset will happen it will deny you
access<00:03:23.919> from<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.430> tower<00:03:24.639> just<00:03:25.389> trying<00:03:25.750> hop

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
access from the tower just trying hop

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.599 
access from the tower just trying hop
into<00:03:26.109> a<00:03:26.169> friend's<00:03:26.470> game<00:03:26.709> that's<00:03:27.040> already<00:03:27.280> at

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
into a friend's game that's already at

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.059 
into a friend's game that's already at
the<00:03:27.970> tower<00:03:28.290> after<00:03:29.290> you<00:03:29.650> know<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.919> actual

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
the tower after you know the actual

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.860 
the tower after you know the actual
reset<00:03:30.489> happens<00:03:30.880> when<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.180> iron<00:03:31.389> banner<00:03:31.569> gates

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
reset happens when the iron banner gates

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.440 
reset happens when the iron banner gates
are<00:03:32.019> open<00:03:32.380> and<00:03:32.560> fucking<00:03:33.519> it<00:03:33.700> works<00:03:33.970> that's

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
are open and fucking it works that's

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.210 
are open and fucking it works that's
amazing<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.019> of<00:03:35.319> course<00:03:35.379> prior<00:03:35.859> to<00:03:36.069> all<00:03:36.190> this

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
amazing and of course prior to all this

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.460 
amazing and of course prior to all this
make<00:03:36.639> sure<00:03:36.669> that<00:03:36.940> you<00:03:37.030> have<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.569> solid<00:03:37.900> rank<00:03:38.290> and

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
make sure that you have a solid rank and

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.830 
make sure that you have a solid rank and
iron<00:03:38.709> banner<00:03:38.919> from<00:03:39.340> last<00:03:39.669> time<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.209> go<00:03:40.450> do<00:03:40.660> this

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
iron banner from last time to go do this

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.270 
iron banner from last time to go do this
because<00:03:41.200> essentially<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.680> way<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:41.889> works<00:03:42.069> is

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
because essentially the way it works is

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.520 
because essentially the way it works is
if<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:42.519> go<00:03:42.609> to<00:03:42.669> destiny<00:03:43.060> status<00:03:43.389> calm<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:44.440> can

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
if you go to destiny status calm you can

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.170 
if you go to destiny status calm you can
actually<00:03:44.650> see<00:03:44.829> all<00:03:45.099> your<00:03:45.250> faction<00:03:45.669> reps<00:03:45.849> ever

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
actually see all your faction reps ever

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.539 
actually see all your faction reps ever
essentially<00:03:47.079> so<00:03:47.440> last<00:03:47.799> time<00:03:48.010> I<00:03:48.040> played<00:03:48.190> iron

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
essentially so last time I played iron

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.400 
essentially so last time I played iron
banner<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:48.910> fucking<00:03:49.389> grind<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:49.989> out<00:03:50.079> all<00:03:50.349> the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
banner I fucking grind it out all the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.039 
banner I fucking grind it out all the
way<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.709> rank<00:03:51.340> 5<00:03:51.639> iron<00:03:51.910> banner<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.510> this<00:03:52.870> time

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
way to rank 5 iron banner and this time

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.210 
way to rank 5 iron banner and this time
around<00:03:53.139> because<00:03:53.410> i<00:03:53.590> did<00:03:53.709> this<00:03:53.799> glitch<00:03:54.069> it

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
around because i did this glitch it

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.030 
around because i did this glitch it
actually<00:03:54.489> held<00:03:54.730> on<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.449> my<00:03:55.480> iron<00:03:56.410> banner<00:03:56.709> rank

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
actually held on to my iron banner rank

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.559 
actually held on to my iron banner rank
and<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.459> reason<00:03:57.760> for<00:03:57.910> this<00:03:57.970> is<00:03:58.030> because<00:03:58.150> they

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
and the reason for this is because they

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.930 
and the reason for this is because they
actually<00:03:58.900> don't<00:03:58.959> reset<00:03:59.410> your<00:03:59.530> rank<00:03:59.829> until<00:04:00.669> the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
actually don't reset your rank until the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.150 
actually don't reset your rank until the
weekly<00:04:01.480> reset<00:04:01.900> for<00:04:02.349> when<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.560> event<00:04:02.650> happens

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
weekly reset for when the event happens

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.159 
weekly reset for when the event happens
so<00:04:03.760> when<00:04:03.879> you<00:04:03.970> go<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.120> destiny<00:04:04.510> status<00:04:04.780> calm

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
so when you go to destiny status calm

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:06.750 
so when you go to destiny status calm
even<00:04:05.590> when<00:04:05.769> there's<00:04:05.949> no<00:04:06.010> iron<00:04:06.280> banner<00:04:06.459> going

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
even when there's no iron banner going

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.059 
even when there's no iron banner going
on<00:04:06.879> and<00:04:07.090> you<00:04:07.150> hit<00:04:07.299> for<00:04:07.480> example<00:04:07.840> rank<00:04:07.989> 5<00:04:08.199> it

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
on and you hit for example rank 5 it

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.309 
on and you hit for example rank 5 it
still<00:04:09.370> shows<00:04:09.639> iron<00:04:10.030> man<00:04:10.180> in<00:04:10.299> rank<00:04:10.449> five<00:04:10.720> until

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
still shows iron man in rank five until

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.530 
still shows iron man in rank five until
you<00:04:11.609> reset<00:04:12.609> the<00:04:12.639> game<00:04:12.879> and<00:04:13.180> that's

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
you reset the game and that's

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.629 
you reset the game and that's
essentially<00:04:13.930> how<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:14.169> exploit<00:04:14.620> works<00:04:14.919> also

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
essentially how the exploit works also

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.129 
essentially how the exploit works also
