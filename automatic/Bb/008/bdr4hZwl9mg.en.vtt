track what we do after I've got it to

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.590 
track what we do after I've got it to
that<00:00:17.310> stage<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.850> need<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.119> get<00:00:18.269> the<00:00:18.390> door

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
that stage we need to get the door

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.680 
that stage we need to get the door
parallel<00:00:20.450> with<00:00:21.450> the<00:00:21.570> wall<00:00:21.750> or<00:00:23.300> with<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.420> glass

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
parallel with the wall or with the glass

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.830 
parallel with the wall or with the glass
sliding<00:00:25.760> section<00:00:26.760> inside<00:00:27.060> there<00:00:27.360> they<00:00:27.660> can

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
sliding section inside there they can

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.660 
sliding section inside there they can
push<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> door<00:00:28.830> up<00:00:28.920> against<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.430> you<00:00:29.550> can

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
push the door up against it and you can

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.220 
push the door up against it and you can
see<00:00:29.850> how<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.660> already<00:00:31.289> parallel<00:00:32.989> so<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.079> need

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
see how it's already parallel so we need

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.160 
see how it's already parallel so we need
to<00:00:34.320> adjust<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.800> bottom<00:00:35.039> rollers<00:00:35.430> up<00:00:36.210> half<00:00:37.050> a

to adjust the bottom rollers up half a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.360 
to adjust the bottom rollers up half a
turn<00:00:37.409> then<00:00:38.219> we'll<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.489> inside<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:40.249> adjust<00:00:41.249> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
turn then we'll go inside and adjust the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.369 
turn then we'll go inside and adjust the
top<00:00:41.519> rollers<00:00:41.879> now<00:00:42.479> that<00:00:42.719> we've<00:00:42.899> installed<00:00:43.019> the

and adjust the bottom wheels up a couple
of<00:01:02.969> turns<00:01:04.220> do<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> front<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> back

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
of turns do the front one in the back

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.220 
of turns do the front one in the back
one<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:08.880> get<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.120> parallel<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> side<00:01:10.050> of

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
one to get it parallel with the side of

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.180 
one to get it parallel with the side of
the<00:01:10.350> wall<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.130> frame<00:01:13.010> once<00:01:14.010> you're<00:01:14.130> happy

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
the wall and the frame once you're happy

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.980 
the wall and the frame once you're happy
with<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:15.320> you<00:01:16.320> move<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.800> top<00:01:16.980> wheels<00:01:17.190> and

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
with that you move to the top wheels and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.150 
with that you move to the top wheels and
adjust<00:01:18.990> them<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.260> as<00:01:19.410> far<00:01:19.620> as<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.830> would<00:01:20.010> go

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
adjust them up as far as that would go

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.440 
adjust them up as far as that would go
so<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> door<00:01:21.360> won't<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.410> any<00:01:22.650> movement<00:01:23.450> up

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
so the door won't have any movement up

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.390 
so the door won't have any movement up
and<00:01:24.690> down<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> front<00:01:28.770> one<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> back

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
and down to the front one and the back

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.990 
and down to the front one and the back
one

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.940 

and<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.720> door<00:01:32.900> should<00:01:33.110> slide<00:01:33.410> beautifully

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
and the door should slide beautifully

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.910 
and the door should slide beautifully
along<00:01:34.190> and<00:01:34.810> this<00:01:35.810> will<00:01:35.930> also<00:01:36.230> stop<00:01:36.620> the<00:01:36.740> door

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
along and this will also stop the door

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.500 
along and this will also stop the door
from<00:01:36.950> coming<00:01:37.370> off<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:37.550> truck<00:01:37.760> if<00:01:38.000> some<00:01:38.270> kids

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
from coming off the truck if some kids

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.480 
from coming off the truck if some kids
and<00:01:38.720> dogs<00:01:38.930> run<00:01:39.170> through<00:01:39.410> and<00:01:39.620> bash<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.280> side

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
and dogs run through and bash the side

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.330 
and dogs run through and bash the side
of<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.730> door<00:01:41.170> because<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.410> top<00:01:42.800> bowlers<00:01:43.160> will

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
of the door because the top bowlers will

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.220 
of the door because the top bowlers will
put<00:01:43.640> pressure<00:01:43.820> down<00:01:44.030> on<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:44.600> sliding<00:01:44.900> door

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
put pressure down on the sliding door

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.020 
put pressure down on the sliding door
alright<00:01:46.100> well<00:01:46.280> if<00:01:46.370> you're<00:01:46.400> lucky<00:01:46.670> enough<00:01:46.820> to

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
probably won't need one of these yeah

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.680 
probably won't need one of these yeah
this<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:54.770> water<00:01:55.010> closer<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:55.640> this<00:01:56.510> will

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
this is a water closer and this will

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.770 
this is a water closer and this will
attach<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.650> door<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:58.040> then<00:01:58.970> close<00:01:59.750> the
