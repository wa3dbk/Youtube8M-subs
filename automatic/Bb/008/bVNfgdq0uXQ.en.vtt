only just been released a couple of
weeks<00:00:15.809> ago<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.410> similar<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.730> previous

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
weeks ago is similar to the previous

generation<00:00:18.420> make<00:00:19.170> mini<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.500> only<00:00:19.650> difference

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
generation make mini the only difference

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.429 
generation make mini the only difference
being<00:00:20.250> internally<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:21.600> got<00:00:21.750> an<00:00:21.930> upgraded

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
being internally so it's got an upgraded

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.929 
being internally so it's got an upgraded
processor<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:23.220> Ivy<00:00:23.730> Bridge<00:00:23.970> it's<00:00:24.869> got<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.230> HD

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
processor the Ivy Bridge it's got the HD

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.210 
processor the Ivy Bridge it's got the HD
4000<00:00:26.939> graphics<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.930> upgraded<00:00:28.529> graphics<00:00:28.710> and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
4000 graphics so upgraded graphics and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.759 
4000 graphics so upgraded graphics and
finally<00:00:29.970> we've<00:00:30.119> got<00:00:30.330> them<00:00:30.480> all<00:00:30.689> important<00:00:31.260> USB

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
finally we've got them all important USB

particular version as we can see here

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.690 
particular version as we can see here
it's<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.120> server<00:00:42.750> version<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:44.190> box<00:00:44.399> is

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
it's the server version the box is

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.190 
it's the server version the box is
pretty<00:00:45.800> standard<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.850> nothing<00:00:48.629> too<00:00:48.870> special

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
pretty standard so nothing too special

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.110 
pretty standard so nothing too special
in<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> box<00:00:49.710> now<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> purchase<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> server

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
in the box now a purchase a server

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000 
in the box now a purchase a server
version<00:00:51.570> because<00:00:51.840> i'll<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.050> using<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.680> as<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
version because i'll be using it as a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.479 
version because i'll be using it as a
server<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:55.170> will<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.680> used<00:00:55.890> as<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> headless

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
server and it will be used as a headless

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.319 
server and it will be used as a headless
server<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.539> i<00:00:58.050> wanted<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> storage<00:00:59.329> rather

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
server so i wanted the storage rather

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.039 
server so i wanted the storage rather
than<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.140> mid<00:01:02.070> or<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.640> lower<00:01:03.000> Mac<00:01:03.629> minis

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
than the mid or the lower Mac minis

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.530 
than the mid or the lower Mac minis
which<00:01:04.229> came<00:01:04.500> which<00:01:04.760> came<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:05.790> lower<00:01:06.090> stories

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
which came which came with lower stories

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.230 
which came which came with lower stories
the<00:01:06.630> actual<00:01:06.869> server<00:01:07.110> version<00:01:07.590> comes<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.400> two

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the actual server version comes with two

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.960 
the actual server version comes with two
one<00:01:09.840> terabyte<00:01:10.409> hard<00:01:10.650> disks<00:01:11.100> that's<00:01:11.700> two

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
one terabyte hard disks that's two

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.020 
one terabyte hard disks that's two
terabytes<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.900> storage<00:01:13.130> overall<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> was

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
terabytes of storage overall so I was

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.940 
terabytes of storage overall so I was
after<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.570> storage<00:01:16.080> rather<00:01:16.380> than<00:01:16.530> anything

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
after the storage rather than anything

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.890 
after the storage rather than anything
else<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.280> could<00:01:17.520> upgrade<00:01:17.729> one<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.450> these<00:01:18.600> hard

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
else we could upgrade one of these hard

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.219 
else we could upgrade one of these hard
drives<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.920> an<00:01:20.100> SSD<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.420> boot<00:01:21.840> disk

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
drives to an SSD so have the boot disk

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.920 
drives to an SSD so have the boot disk
as<00:01:22.500> an<00:01:22.650> SSD<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.670> as<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:23.850> said<00:01:24.150> if<00:01:24.420> you're<00:01:24.689> using

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
as an SSD but as I said if you're using

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.929 
as an SSD but as I said if you're using
it<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.560> server<00:01:25.890> you're<00:01:26.310> really<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.729> going

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
it as a server you're really not going

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.899 
it as a server you're really not going
to<00:01:27.030> see<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> benefit<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.369> this<00:01:29.369> actual

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
to see the benefit of that this actual

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.319 
to see the benefit of that this actual
model<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> high-end<00:01:31.729> 2.6<00:01:32.729> gigahertz

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
model is the high-end 2.6 gigahertz

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.219 
model is the high-end 2.6 gigahertz
quad-core<00:01:33.570> i7<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.549> highest

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
quad-core i7 so this is the highest

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.870 
quad-core i7 so this is the highest
processor<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.680> currently<00:01:38.130> get<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
processor you can currently get in the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.330 
processor you can currently get in the
mac<00:01:39.060> mini<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.680> obviously<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:40.920> i<00:01:41.040> said<00:01:41.220> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
mac mini and obviously as i said it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.310 
mac mini and obviously as i said it
comes<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> two<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.420> terabyte<00:01:42.930> drives

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
comes with the two one terabyte drives

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.740 
comes with the two one terabyte drives
it<00:01:43.920> does<00:01:44.220> come<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.820> standard<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.390> four

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
it does come with the standard a four

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.600 
it does come with the standard a four
gig<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.170> ram<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.560> always<00:01:46.950> advisable<00:01:47.100> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
gig of ram is always advisable to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.090 
gig of ram is always advisable to
purchase<00:01:48.180> your<00:01:48.210> own<00:01:48.479> RAM<00:01:48.960> rather<00:01:49.619> than<00:01:49.799> buying

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
purchase your own RAM rather than buying

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.789 
purchase your own RAM rather than buying
the<00:01:50.340> upgrade<00:01:50.640> from<00:01:50.729> Apple<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.360> much<00:01:51.630> cheaper

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
the upgrade from Apple it's much cheaper

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.950 
the upgrade from Apple it's much cheaper
so<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.829> do<00:01:53.130> actually<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.670> crucial<00:01:54.450> memory

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
so I do actually have crucial memory

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.609 
so I do actually have crucial memory
right<00:01:55.740> here<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.759> I'll<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.270> using<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:58.020> all

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
right here that I'll be using and all

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.590 
right here that I'll be using and all
the<00:01:58.740> upgrading<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.549> either<00:01:59.700> eight<00:01:59.939> or<00:01:59.969> 16

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the upgrading this to either eight or 16

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.550 
the upgrading this to either eight or 16
gigs<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.110> RAM<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:03.240> box<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.659> now<00:02:03.960> been

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
gigs of RAM so the box is now been

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.760 
gigs of RAM so the box is now been
unwrapped<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.520> let's<00:02:05.790> take<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> look<00:02:06.420> inside<00:02:06.960> ok

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
unwrapped so let's take a look inside ok

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.029 
unwrapped so let's take a look inside ok
so<00:02:07.829> once<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.340> box<00:02:08.520> has<00:02:08.759> been<00:02:08.789> unwrapped<00:02:10.039> you

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
so once the box has been unwrapped you

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.400 
so once the box has been unwrapped you
simply<00:02:11.550> slide<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:12.150> across

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
simply slide this across

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.650 
simply slide this across
to<00:02:13.440> get<00:02:13.590> inside<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.310> there<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.480> actual

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
to get inside and there is the actual

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.380 
to get inside and there is the actual
mac<00:02:15.900> mini<00:02:16.260> itself<00:02:16.980> we'll<00:02:17.820> take<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.090> look<00:02:18.240> at

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
mac mini itself we'll take a look at

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.540 
mac mini itself we'll take a look at
that<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.990> second<00:02:19.470> inside<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.370> books

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
that in just a second inside the books

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.910 
that in just a second inside the books
all<00:02:20.730> we<00:02:20.880> get<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.420> your<00:02:21.750> standard<00:02:22.290> quick<00:02:22.620> start

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
guides and your apple stickers we have

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.250 
guides and your apple stickers we have
an<00:02:26.160> adapter<00:02:26.700> here<00:02:27.980> hdmi<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.760> DVI<00:02:30.120> adapter<00:02:31.110> for

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
an adapter here hdmi to DVI adapter for

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.930 
an adapter here hdmi to DVI adapter for
you<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.500> use<00:02:31.680> with<00:02:31.920> monitors<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.210> and

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
you to use with monitors and so on and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.170 
you to use with monitors and so on and
finally<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.120> have<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.530> standard<00:02:37.670> power<00:02:38.670> cable

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
finally we have the standard power cable

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.720 
finally we have the standard power cable
so<00:02:39.360> three<00:02:39.720> pin<00:02:40.020> European<00:02:40.800> power<00:02:41.100> cable<00:02:41.640> and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
so three pin European power cable and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.150 
so three pin European power cable and
there's<00:02:42.720> nothing<00:02:42.870> else<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.530> box<00:02:43.710> itself

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
there's nothing else in the box itself

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.480 
there's nothing else in the box itself
so<00:02:44.850> if<00:02:44.910> we<00:02:44.970> have<00:02:45.180> have<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.510> quick<00:02:45.810> look<00:02:45.840> at<00:02:46.350> the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
so if we have have a quick look at the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.300 
so if we have have a quick look at the
actual<00:02:47.490> mac<00:02:47.880> mini<00:02:48.210> itself<00:02:48.860> comes<00:02:49.860> wrapped<00:02:50.130> in

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
actual mac mini itself comes wrapped in

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.460 
actual mac mini itself comes wrapped in
its<00:02:50.430> normal<00:02:50.640> plastic<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:52.890> can<00:02:53.100> remove<00:02:53.550> that

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.940 

here<00:02:58.470> we<00:02:58.620> go<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.810> actual<00:03:00.930> mac<00:03:01.260> mini<00:03:01.500> itself

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
here we go so the actual mac mini itself

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.860 
here we go so the actual mac mini itself
as<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.280> said<00:03:02.460> it's<00:03:02.610> exactly<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.360> same<00:03:03.540> as<00:03:03.690> the

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
is that the mid comes with a single one

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.809 
is that the mid comes with a single one
terabyte<00:05:14.069> hard<00:05:14.819> drive<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.449> the<00:05:16.319> server

terabyte hard drive and the server

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.089 
terabyte hard drive and the server
version<00:05:17.819> comes<00:05:18.090> with<00:05:18.150> a<00:05:18.449> dual<00:05:18.870> to<00:05:19.560> one

terabyte<00:05:20.520> hard<00:05:20.759> drive<00:05:21.000> configuration<00:05:21.750> so<00:05:21.960> two

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
terabyte hard drive configuration so two

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.620 
terabyte hard drive configuration so two
hard<00:05:22.620> drives<00:05:22.800> now<00:05:23.190> it's<00:05:23.969> probably<00:05:24.330> more

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
hard drives now it's probably more

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.540 
hard drives now it's probably more
cost-effective<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.560> actually<00:05:25.979> purchase<00:05:26.310> the

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
because is not a hugely easy task it is

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.600 
because is not a hugely easy task it is
more<00:06:12.180> for<00:06:12.569> the<00:06:12.779> technically<00:06:13.319> savvy<00:06:13.650> if<00:06:14.400> you

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
more for the technically savvy if you

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.430 
more for the technically savvy if you

want to save the hassle of doing that go

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.680 
want to save the hassle of doing that go
for<00:06:16.620> the<00:06:16.710> server<00:06:16.949> version<00:06:17.520> if<00:06:17.909> not<00:06:18.300> if<00:06:18.539> you're

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
for the server version if not if you're

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.930 
for the server version if not if you're
okay<00:06:18.990> with<00:06:19.020> using<00:06:19.349> external<00:06:20.009> USB<00:06:20.370> three

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
okay with using external USB three

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.999 
okay with using external USB three
drives<00:06:21.360> external<00:06:21.659> Thunderbolt<00:06:22.500> drives<00:06:22.800> and

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
drives external Thunderbolt drives and

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.920 
drives external Thunderbolt drives and
so<00:06:23.279> on<00:06:23.460> because<00:06:23.940> there's<00:06:24.180> just<00:06:24.240> as<00:06:24.509> fast<00:06:24.750> as

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
so on because there's just as fast as

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.629 
so on because there's just as fast as
having<00:06:25.139> the<00:06:25.169> drive<00:06:25.469> internal<00:06:26.039> now<00:06:26.250> using

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
having the drive internal now using

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.839 
having the drive internal now using
those<00:06:26.990> connections<00:06:27.990> the<00:06:28.560> mid<00:06:28.949> model<00:06:29.639> is

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
those connections the mid model is

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.689 
those connections the mid model is
probably<00:06:30.569> the<00:06:31.080> more<00:06:31.289> cost-effective<00:06:32.190> of<00:06:32.430> the

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 
probably the more cost-effective of the

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.760 
probably the more cost-effective of the
three<00:06:32.969> so<00:06:33.719> there<00:06:33.900> we<00:06:34.020> go<00:06:34.169> that<00:06:34.349> was<00:06:34.469> a<00:06:34.500> quick

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
three so there we go that was a quick

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.589 
three so there we go that was a quick
unboxing<00:06:34.979> of<00:06:35.580> the<00:06:35.789> new<00:06:35.870> 2012<00:06:36.870> mac<00:06:37.469> mini<00:06:37.830> server

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 
unboxing of the new 2012 mac mini server

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.730 
unboxing of the new 2012 mac mini server
so<00:06:39.599> what<00:06:39.750> do<00:06:39.870> you<00:06:39.960> think<00:06:40.229> of<00:06:40.349> the<00:06:40.469> new

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740
