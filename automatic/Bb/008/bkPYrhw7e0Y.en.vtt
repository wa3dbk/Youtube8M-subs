00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.119 
preload I'm going to shoot the shutter
right<00:00:47.039> now<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:48.090> make<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.649> quicker<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> wind

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
right now to make it quicker to wind

this lever in the second here we go

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.819 
this lever in the second here we go
we've<00:00:52.649> shot<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.750> gun<00:00:54.750> shot<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.500> shutter

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
film in like this and all I have to do

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.949 
film in like this and all I have to do
is<00:02:15.770> take<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.040> across<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.700> side<00:02:16.970> or<00:02:17.630> take<00:02:17.840> it

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
is take it across the side or take it

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.770 
is take it across the side or take it
across<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.350> back<00:02:18.500> rather<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.450> feed<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.600> a

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
across the back rather and feed it a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.330 
across the back rather and feed it a
little<00:02:21.260> bit<00:02:21.500> down<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.920> way<00:02:22.040> that's<00:02:22.220> actually

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
little bit down that way that's actually

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.550 
little bit down that way that's actually
a<00:02:22.550> lot<00:02:22.730> more<00:02:22.760> than<00:02:23.180> needs<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.720> be<00:02:23.810> done<00:02:24.430> close

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
a lot more than needs to be done close

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.940 
a lot more than needs to be done close

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
turn it on that was the sound of it

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
going to do is I've got this set to 2000

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.310 
going to do is I've got this set to 2000
of<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.769> second<00:02:40.190> exposures<00:02:41.110> what<00:02:42.110> I'm<00:02:42.200> going

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
of the second exposures what I'm going

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
to do is I'm going to advance this

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.400 
to do is I'm going to advance this
through<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.850> entire<00:02:44.209> roll<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.570> film<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.260> show

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
through the entire roll of film to show

00:02:45.410 --> 00:03:03.410 
through the entire roll of film to show
you<00:02:45.470> how<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.830> rewinds

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.520 

end<00:03:04.190> of<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.310> roll<00:03:05.490> it<00:03:06.180> rewinds<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.930> chose<00:03:07.290> this

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
end of the roll it rewinds I chose this

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.559 
end of the roll it rewinds I chose this
one<00:03:07.770> because<00:03:08.069> it<00:03:08.190> doesn't<00:03:08.430> rewind<00:03:08.880> all<00:03:09.150> the

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
one because it doesn't rewind all the

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.050 
one because it doesn't rewind all the
way<00:03:09.860> leaves<00:03:10.860> me<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.040> little<00:03:11.100> bit<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.490> a<00:03:11.550> lead<00:03:11.819> and

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
way leaves me a little bit of a lead and

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.820 
way leaves me a little bit of a lead and
since<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:12.630> film<00:03:12.870> is<00:03:13.020> unexposed<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.680> had<00:03:13.800> a

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
since this film is unexposed I had a

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.920 
since this film is unexposed I had a
camera<00:03:14.520> body<00:03:14.850> cap<00:03:15.120> on<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.360> front<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:15.690> I

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
camera body cap on the front of that I

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.970 
camera body cap on the front of that I
can<00:03:16.530> still<00:03:16.740> use<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:17.069> in<00:03:17.250> another<00:03:17.490> camera

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
can still use this in another camera

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.740 
can still use this in another camera
those<00:03:19.980> are<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.220> two<00:03:20.430> basic<00:03:20.640> systems<00:03:21.300> for<00:03:21.600> how

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
those are the two basic systems for how

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.500 
those are the two basic systems for how
to<00:03:21.810> load<00:03:22.260> film<00:03:22.740> in<00:03:22.980> 35-millimeter<00:03:23.730> SLRs

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
to load film in 35-millimeter SLRs

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.980 
to load film in 35-millimeter SLRs
automatic<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.320> manual<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:26.450> as<00:03:27.450> far<00:03:27.720> as<00:03:27.870> I

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
automatic and manual and as far as I

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.800 
automatic and manual and as far as I
know<00:03:28.050> that<00:03:28.770> is<00:03:28.950> how<00:03:29.100> film<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.030> loaded<00:03:30.510> into

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
know that is how film is loaded into

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.640 
know that is how film is loaded into
most<00:03:31.680> if<00:03:31.950> not<00:03:31.980> all<00:03:32.370> thirty<00:03:33.030> five-millimeter

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
most if not all thirty five-millimeter

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.090 
most if not all thirty five-millimeter
SLRs<00:03:34.650> pretty<00:03:35.340> simple<00:03:35.730> pretty<00:03:36.030> painless<00:03:36.360> and

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
SLRs pretty simple pretty painless and

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.350 
SLRs pretty simple pretty painless and
they<00:03:38.100> did<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.520> camera<00:03:38.880> makers<00:03:39.120> have<00:03:39.209> done<00:03:39.330> a

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
they did the camera makers have done a

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.960 
they did the camera makers have done a
very<00:03:39.540> good<00:03:39.660> job<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:39.989> making<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.530> easy<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:41.100> load

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
very good job of making it easy to load

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.610 
very good job of making it easy to load
film<00:03:42.239> quickly<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.110> you<00:03:43.200> can<00:03:43.320> get<00:03:43.440> back<00:03:43.590> to

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
film quickly so you can get back to

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.269 
film quickly so you can get back to
taking<00:03:43.920> good<00:03:44.250> shots<00:03:44.310> with<00:03:44.760> your<00:03:44.910> cameras
