00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:14.619
 blows to the body 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:16.339
 they are straight either from below or from the side 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.220
 hitting the torso 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:22.970
 many underestimate them and very few 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.550
 punch as a rule though at the end and 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.099
 mean not in battles they affect that 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.769
 have churned breath 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:34.699
 carrying these beats to the heart area 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:36.949
 solar plexus liver area as 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.280
 the rule is these hitting the torso need 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:44.329
 put in a bundle that is in combinations 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.899
 in the form of singles, they do not want to go 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:52.449
 show you combinations that are more 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:57.620
 effective preparation 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:01:01.850
 deployment attack goes further goes 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:05.170
 distracting attack left straight from left 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:10.600
 foot step out of back foot steps to the right 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.740
 punch in tulu still hit from the bottom 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.270
 go back a long way 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.970
 You can also punch the left straight in 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.230
 head and lateral circumventing torso 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.530
 also downturn in hind leg and 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:31.760
 returning to a long distance also 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.160
 effective hit direct distracting 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.960
 left straight to head and right straight 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.150
 torso 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.900
 distracting with return to the farthest 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.830
 distance 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:47.210
 also make an attack in the right hand 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.350
 under the left foot we step out to 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.950
 shock distance 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.620
 right straight to the head and applied with 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.360
 tightening the left rear leg 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.130
 torso 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.939
 bottom exit 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.049
 long distance and also punch 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.439
 right smack in the head, and introducing 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:13.040
 left side 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:17.660
 torso like punching through the torso right 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.540
 accented we look for vulnerabilities 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.390
 it's under the heart of the solar plexus 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.950
 hit bottom in the body we are 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:32.360
 damage to the liver 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.840
 also more efficiently bundles of three 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.360
 beats 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.799
 two of which go straight to the head 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.860
 one two Three 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:45.590
 raising distracting from the torso by two 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.380
 blows we put tough 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.079
 accented blow to the body also 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.650
 starting with the right hand 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:58.000
 right straight left straight right in 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.069
 torso and go far 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.319
 also these beats are not classic 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:09.019
 performance from the bottom and side shocks 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:13.400
 but it is very important to strike 1 and not 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:15.290
 putting power in your head distracting and in 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.700
 further apply hard 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.819
 accented blow to the body 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.200
 not unimportant 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.720
 you need to pay foot work foot work where 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.540
 used shuttle movement on 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.000
 jumps and exit again to the far 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:40.040
 the distance to jump every two or three and 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.760
 exit back 1 2 3 and exit to the far 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.440
 distance 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.319
 if you strike hard I put in 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.880
 full body weight deploy hip back 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:56.180
 and even get to the defense through 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.780
 protection can break through the vulnerable point 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.480
 also striking a right straight punch here 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:07.400
 under the left foot here we are no longer 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.870
 we transfer body weight from foot to foot as 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.920
 classical performance 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:17.150
 left to right here we leave 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.269
 body weight on the left foot on the left foot and 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:26.919
 feed the whole body forward 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:31.460
 do throw forward further roll 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.880
 one-two and with this leg we push off 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.669
 go a long distance also 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:41.389
 punch 3 strike combination 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:46.010
 2 1 distraction and focus on the whole 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:50.660
 body mass throw in the body when 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:53.600
 boxing and kickboxing mixfight level 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.979
 high combination you need to beat with 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.440
 maximum speed 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.620
 when you start to throw weight in 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.300
 body legs to legs and then split second 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.500
 lost that is you 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.949
 every accent is far but no accent 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.630
 for every hit of a combination you will go to 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:15.340
 a certain hit you charge 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:19.460
 so it makes no sense to carry body weight 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:24.020
 back-forward ie you are fighting for 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:27.229
 speed is not recommended to be applied in 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.979
 trunk hitting left straight front 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.930
 hand in the body in the fall effectively blow 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:36.550
 to take your breath away 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:39.620
 the opponent of these blows need ten pieces 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.260
 throw there that is at the moment 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.210
 you can run into the counter right 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:48.500
 straight forward 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.380
 you can fly to such a meeting 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.260
 it makes sense to have him even like 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.570
 distraction does not work effect 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.080
 effectively right punch straight 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.750
 but you don't need to eat it either 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.360
 single too in the form of deployment 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:09.970
 can use the torso and again 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:14.770
 you can exit it to distract 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.770
 already the main blow to punch in the head
