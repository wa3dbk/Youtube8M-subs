what came in right fit package 1 which
is<00:02:40.920> just<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:42.040> pH<00:02:42.340> balances<00:02:43.470> we've<00:02:44.470> got<00:02:44.709> our

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
is just a pH balances we've got our

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.460 
is just a pH balances we've got our
classic<00:02:45.670> Cooper's<00:02:46.090> used<00:02:46.420> not<00:02:47.049> in<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.230> same

you hit me and then of course you've got
some<00:02:53.430> dexter<00:02:54.780> if<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:56.019> need<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.319> I'll<00:02:56.650> just

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
some dexter if you need it I'll just

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.640 
some dexter if you need it I'll just
dump<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.190> in<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:57.519> it's<00:02:57.640> stronger<00:02:58.410> let's<00:02:59.410> get

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650

this<00:02:59.829> rolling<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:06.720> okay<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:07.780> we<00:03:08.049> added<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.680> pH

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
this rolling you okay so we added the pH

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:15.580 
this rolling you okay so we added the pH
adjusted

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:57.140 
little bit of the way and then we'll
move<00:03:49.500> on<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:54.890> ok<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:55.950> these<00:03:56.280> kits<00:03:56.579> are<00:03:56.760> actually

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
move on it ok so these kits are actually

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.750 
move on it ok so these kits are actually
almost<00:03:57.420> too<00:03:57.840> easy<00:04:00.920> like<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.069> just<00:04:02.189> put<00:04:02.549> in<00:04:02.579> a

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
almost too easy like you just put in a

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.690 
almost too easy like you just put in a
you<00:04:02.969> seen<00:04:03.239> you<00:04:03.829> dumping<00:04:04.829> some<00:04:05.069> water<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.549> you

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
you seen you dumping some water and you

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.059 
you seen you dumping some water and you
jump<00:04:05.909> in<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.150> bag<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.719> then<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.989> can<00:04:07.439> stir<00:04:07.950> it

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
jump in the bag and then you can stir it

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:15.470 
jump in the bag and then you can stir it
up<00:04:08.189> add<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.329> yeast<00:04:10.010> it's<00:04:11.010> too<00:04:11.250> simple<00:04:14.480> you

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
up add the yeast it's too simple you

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.060 
up add the yeast it's too simple you
basically<00:04:15.720> get<00:04:16.079> it<00:04:16.229> done<00:04:16.470> in<00:04:16.620> probably<00:04:16.799> like

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
basically get it done in probably like

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.999 
basically get it done in probably like
10<00:04:17.579> minutes<00:04:18.139> so<00:04:19.139> it's<00:04:19.259> a<00:04:19.320> lot<00:04:19.470> shorter<00:04:19.500> than

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:20.009 
10 minutes so it's a lot shorter than

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.969 
10 minutes so it's a lot shorter than
the<00:04:20.130> Cooper's<00:04:20.519> get<00:04:20.789> sure<00:04:21.560> but<00:04:22.560> keep<00:04:22.830> in<00:04:22.949> mind

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
the Cooper's get sure but keep in mind

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.189 
the Cooper's get sure but keep in mind
you're<00:04:23.340> twice<00:04:23.520> as<00:04:23.580> expensive<00:04:27.050> so<00:04:28.050> yeah

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
you're twice as expensive so yeah

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.640 
you're twice as expensive so yeah
they're<00:04:28.470> just<00:04:28.560> throws<00:04:29.130> up<00:04:29.509> take<00:04:30.509> the<00:04:30.690> SG<00:04:31.139> and

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
they're just throws up take the SG and

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:46.310 
they're just throws up take the SG and
then<00:04:32.960> under<00:04:33.960> yeast<00:04:44.449> so<00:04:45.449> that's<00:04:45.720> really<00:04:45.930> nice

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
then under yeast so that's really nice

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.519 
then under yeast so that's really nice
free

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:49.529 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:52.009 

alright<00:04:50.279> so<00:04:50.429> we<00:04:50.549> got<00:04:50.579> our<00:04:50.729> SG<00:04:51.239> rating<00:04:51.689> it<00:04:51.869> was

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:52.019 
alright so we got our SG rating it was

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:54.079 
alright so we got our SG rating it was
one<00:04:52.199> point<00:04:52.469> zero<00:04:52.529> four<00:04:52.889> zero<00:04:52.949> which<00:04:53.759> is<00:04:53.909> the

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:54.089 
one point zero four zero which is the

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:58.249 
one point zero four zero which is the
perfect<00:04:54.509> reading<00:04:54.869> then<00:04:55.859> we<00:04:55.979> just<00:04:56.189> get<00:04:56.339> a<00:04:57.259> dump

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
perfect reading then we just get a dump

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:23.650 
perfect reading then we just get a dump
on<00:04:58.409> our<00:04:58.619> geese<00:05:07.219> data<00:05:08.219> side

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.360 

there's<00:05:24.200> a<00:05:24.230> lot<00:05:24.350> more<00:05:24.380> yeast<00:05:24.830> in<00:05:25.070> this<00:05:25.190> one

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
there's a lot more yeast in this one

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:32.780 
there's a lot more yeast in this one
then<00:05:27.010> normal<00:05:28.010> Cooper's<00:05:28.430> kid<00:05:28.700> that's<00:05:28.910> for<00:05:29.150> sure

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:39.410 

we<00:05:33.420> all<00:05:33.570> need<00:05:33.720> a<00:05:33.780> firm<00:05:34.290> and<00:05:34.470> a<00:05:34.560> lot<00:05:34.680> faster<00:05:38.420> let

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
we all need a firm and a lot faster let

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.470 
we all need a firm and a lot faster let
this<00:05:39.570> one<00:05:39.780> can<00:05:40.050> I<00:05:40.080> she's<00:05:40.790> going<00:05:41.790> to<00:05:41.940> secondary

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
this one can I she's going to secondary

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.650 
this one can I she's going to secondary
until<00:05:43.050> home<00:05:43.500> these<00:05:43.710> ones<00:05:43.830> are<00:05:44.010> finished<00:05:44.660> cuz

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
until home these ones are finished cuz

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.150 
until home these ones are finished cuz
that's<00:05:47.480> my<00:05:48.480> big<00:05:48.660> batch<00:05:48.900> has<00:05:49.140> just<00:05:49.290> fit<00:05:49.500> up<00:05:49.620> for

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
that's my big batch has just fit up for

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.520 
that's my big batch has just fit up for
different<00:05:50.490> Koufos<00:05:50.820> kiss<00:05:53.990> so<00:05:54.990> it'll<00:05:55.260> have<00:05:55.290> to

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
different Koufos kiss so it'll have to

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.700 
different Koufos kiss so it'll have to
wait<00:05:56.090> but<00:05:58.100> easter<00:05:59.100> is<00:05:59.130> coming<00:05:59.250> up<00:05:59.640> so<00:05:59.970> i<00:06:00.710> want

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
wait but easter is coming up so i want

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.330 
wait but easter is coming up so i want
to<00:06:01.740> make<00:06:01.800> sure<00:06:01.920> i<00:06:02.070> got<00:06:02.310> enough<00:06:02.610> beer<00:06:03.290> this

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
to make sure i got enough beer this

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:12.410 
to make sure i got enough beer this
holiday<00:06:05.340> season<00:06:07.640> it<00:06:08.640> was<00:06:10.220> 25<00:06:11.220> gallons<00:06:11.940> i<00:06:12.150> think

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.420 
holiday season it was 25 gallons i think

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.900 
holiday season it was 25 gallons i think
that<00:06:12.630> should<00:06:12.810> be<00:06:12.870> pretty<00:06:13.170> good<00:06:16.490> it's<00:06:17.490> been<00:06:17.700> my

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
that should be pretty good it's been my

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.710 
that should be pretty good it's been my
most<00:06:18.120> a<00:06:18.300> week<00:06:18.450> since<00:06:18.630> i<00:06:18.810> made<00:06:18.960> some<00:06:19.230> videos<00:06:19.350> so

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
most a week since i made some videos so

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.010 
most a week since i made some videos so
here's<00:06:22.320> one<00:06:23.270> I'm<00:06:24.270> going<00:06:24.360> to<00:06:24.450> be<00:06:24.510> doing<00:06:24.600> a<00:06:24.780> cool
