00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.670
 m tonight we did a tobacco 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.260
 functions 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.080
 if I take my bearings 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.630
 that's also part 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.460
 as early as this week in the colony 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.460
 and Article l 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.940
 while you can 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.620
 I put tonight 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.790
 if the idea is a remote access I thought it was 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.960
 safi on him but it is not obligatory 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960
 we could take time this slice not 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.430
 we must limit any other magnitude 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.230
 or no Libyan sky 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.230
 do not hesitate to be the same for all 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.060
 after a poor 10th account 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.570
 taylor lautner 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.570
 bow 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.780
 you know I have this contribution cut 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.970
 the biggest 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.970
 that's good because it seems to me 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.840
 on M 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.070
 a change 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.470
 to can 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.500
 although there are also legal proceedings of the Chilean coasts 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.980
 but I saw with small 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.420
 it's longer 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.300
 this crisis 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.920
 what makes us happy 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.850
 the record 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.590
 Yes 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.580
 policy 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.900
 justine who is considered crazy 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.900
 solicited by afp his criticism 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.740
 the leader 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.199
 unscathed 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:18.929
 by the way the last 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.929
 the arcep has just closed the circle of his friends 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.759
 the weight crb 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.709
 the whole lucic team 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:36.289

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.379
 on the other hand because a lot of people who come 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.069
 so all those who have the same problem 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.289

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:04.209

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.249
 that the problem is a pump hen the cold to 2 or 3% to your choice 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.939
