00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
to be able to 12 hatch and if he sees

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.530 
to be able to 12 hatch and if he sees
the<00:01:21.259> if<00:01:22.259> he<00:01:22.380> sees<00:01:22.850> it's<00:01:23.850> kind<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.150> large<00:01:24.330> map

oh my god I thought he was sending out a
drone<00:02:22.260> Scout<00:02:22.650> very<00:02:22.890> early<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:25.620> see<00:02:25.830> if<00:02:25.920> he

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
drone Scout very early to see if he

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.860 
drone Scout very early to see if he
could<00:02:26.130> safely<00:02:26.400> 12<00:02:26.880> hatch<00:02:27.120> but<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.420> looks<00:02:27.810> like

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
could safely 12 hatch but it looks like

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.680 
could safely 12 hatch but it looks like
he's<00:02:28.110> gone<00:02:28.410> for<00:02:28.739> twelve<00:02:29.130> hatch<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.690> Chuck

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
he's gone for twelve hatch in Chuck

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.390 
he's gone for twelve hatch in Chuck
space<00:02:33.800> hahahaha<00:02:36.380> one<00:02:37.380> two<00:02:37.530> three<00:02:37.860> four<00:02:38.130> five

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
space hahahaha one two three four five

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.850 
space hahahaha one two three four five
six<00:02:38.459> seven<00:02:38.670> eight<00:02:38.970> nine<00:02:39.030> ten<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.680> looks

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
six seven eight nine ten so it looks

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.210 
six seven eight nine ten so it looks
like<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.250> think<00:02:41.660> Chuck<00:02:42.660> went<00:02:43.080> for<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.380> 12<00:02:43.920> pool

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
like I think Chuck went for a 12 pool

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.940 
like I think Chuck went for a 12 pool
and<00:02:44.640> then<00:02:45.300> got<00:02:45.450> gas<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:46.319> what<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.650> looks<00:02:46.800> like

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
and then got gas is what it looks like

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.340 
and then got gas is what it looks like
and<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.250> looks<00:02:47.400> like<00:02:47.489> zero<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.209> went<00:02:48.420> for<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.750> I

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
and it looks like zero and went for it I

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.500 
and it looks like zero and went for it I
think<00:02:49.410> it's<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.739> 12<00:02:49.980> hatch<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.850> his<00:02:51.060> base<00:02:51.269> of

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
think it's a 12 hatch in his base of

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.210 
think it's a 12 hatch in his base of
this<00:02:51.600> couldn't<00:02:51.930> work<00:02:51.989> out<00:02:52.170> perfectly<00:02:52.769> for<00:02:52.860> him

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
this couldn't work out perfectly for him

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.479 
this couldn't work out perfectly for him
he's<00:02:53.940> got<00:02:54.180> yes<00:02:54.510> he<00:02:55.140> went<00:02:55.410> for<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.650> 12<00:02:56.010> hatch<00:02:56.250> in

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.460 
he's got yes he went for the 12 hatch in
his<00:02:56.610> base<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.060> then<00:02:57.150> pool<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.870> now<00:02:58.320> he's

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470

a<00:03:18.060> ton<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.269> Ling's<00:03:18.620> but<00:03:19.620> there<00:03:19.739> won't<00:03:19.829> be<00:03:20.010> an

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
a ton of Ling's but there won't be an

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.860 
a ton of Ling's but there won't be an
expansion<00:03:20.820> there<00:03:20.970> either<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.450> he<00:03:21.510> if<00:03:21.750> he

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
expansion there either and he if he

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.210 
expansion there either and he if he
looks<00:03:22.079> around<00:03:22.200> for<00:03:22.500> an<00:03:22.590> expansion<00:03:22.980> he's

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
looks around for an expansion he's

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.160 
looks around for an expansion he's
probably<00:03:23.370> look<00:03:23.670> around<00:03:23.910> at<00:03:24.120> other<00:03:24.750> crazy

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
probably look around at other crazy

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.410 
probably look around at other crazy
places<00:03:25.530> as<00:03:26.160> kind<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.579> adorable<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.239> two

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
places as kind of adorable the two

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.620 
places as kind of adorable the two
creeps

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
creeps

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.540 
creeps
kind<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.440> creeping<00:03:29.830> out<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.130> meet<00:03:30.250> each<00:03:30.370> other

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
kind of creeping out to meet each other

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.000 
kind of creeping out to meet each other
but<00:03:31.270> he<00:03:31.330> doesn't<00:03:31.690> have<00:03:31.750> any<00:03:31.960> the<00:03:32.440> creep<00:03:32.740> does

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
not actually have vision itself so the

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.440 
not actually have vision itself so the

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
drone I think inside Chuck's base and

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.410 
drone I think inside Chuck's base and
make<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:17.800> spire<00:05:18.340> there<00:05:18.610> is<00:05:18.760> what<00:05:18.940> I'm<00:05:19.060> thinking
