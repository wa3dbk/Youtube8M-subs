different<00:00:33.769> for<00:00:33.830> Guilty<00:00:34.250> Spark<00:00:34.280> we're

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
different for Guilty Spark we're

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.189 
different for Guilty Spark we're
actually<00:00:35.000> gonna<00:00:35.210> start<00:00:35.629> in<00:00:35.720> classic<00:00:36.170> mode

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
actually gonna start in classic mode

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:37.960 
actually gonna start in classic mode
you're<00:00:36.739> gonna<00:00:36.860> see<00:00:37.129> why<00:00:37.460> in<00:00:37.640> a<00:00:37.699> couple<00:00:37.940> of

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
you're gonna see why in a couple of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.460 
you're gonna see why in a couple of
seconds<00:00:38.269> but<00:00:38.420> this<00:00:38.570> is<00:00:38.690> just<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:38.960> really<00:00:39.290> fun

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
seconds but this is just a really fun

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.469 
seconds but this is just a really fun
level<00:00:39.830> to<00:00:39.920> go<00:00:40.010> in<00:00:40.159> a<00:00:40.250> classic<00:00:40.670> mode<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.059> then

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:41.479 
level to go in a classic mode and then

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.420 
level to go in a classic mode and then
switch<00:00:41.839> to<00:00:41.870> new<00:00:42.199> mode<00:00:42.379> because<00:00:42.710> this<00:00:43.100> kind<00:00:43.339> of

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
switch to new mode because this kind of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.250 
switch to new mode because this kind of
level<00:00:43.580> just<00:00:43.850> really<00:00:44.239> shows<00:00:44.479> off<00:00:44.750> how<00:00:45.199> great

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
level just really shows off how great

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.229 
level just really shows off how great
the<00:00:45.769> game<00:00:45.949> looks<00:00:46.220> and<00:00:46.370> how<00:00:46.489> much<00:00:46.640> fun<00:00:46.850> it<00:00:46.970> is<00:00:47.089> to

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
the game looks and how much fun it is to

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.670 
the game looks and how much fun it is to
go<00:00:47.330> back<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:47.690> forth<00:00:47.900> between<00:00:48.080> the<00:00:48.320> two<00:00:48.470> modes

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
go back and forth between the two modes

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.219 
go back and forth between the two modes
so<00:00:49.400> as<00:00:49.699> we<00:00:49.850> go<00:00:49.970> in<00:00:50.150> you're<00:00:50.360> gonna<00:00:50.449> see<00:00:50.690> this<00:00:51.019> is

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
emotion let's just see how technology

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:03.820 
emotion let's just see how technology
can<00:01:02.420> kind<00:01:02.629> of<00:01:02.720> help<00:01:02.839> it<00:01:02.960> out<00:01:03.049> a<00:01:03.110> little<00:01:03.290> bit<00:01:03.439> so

mode wow I just always loved doing the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.900 
mode wow I just always loved doing the

switch here it's just really cool to see

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.610 
switch here it's just really cool to see
how<00:01:11.090> far<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.540> technology<00:01:11.660> has<00:01:12.140> come<00:01:12.290> in<00:01:12.440> 10

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
how far the technology has come in 10

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.230 
how far the technology has come in 10
years<00:01:14.770> so<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:16.130> know<00:01:16.220> let's<00:01:16.490> let's<00:01:16.790> keep<00:01:16.910> going

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
years so you know let's let's keep going

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.640 
years so you know let's let's keep going
again<00:01:17.570> I'll<00:01:17.720> just<00:01:17.750> remind<00:01:18.050> you<00:01:18.200> as<00:01:18.380> we<00:01:18.500> go

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
again I'll just remind you as we go

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.560 
again I'll just remind you as we go
through<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:19.790> core<00:01:19.970> principle<00:01:20.360> of<00:01:20.420> this

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
through that the core principle of this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.820 
through that the core principle of this
game<00:01:20.810> was<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.140> make<00:01:21.260> sure<00:01:21.290> that<00:01:21.440> it<00:01:21.650> played

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
game was to make sure that it played

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.780 
game was to make sure that it played
exactly<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.490> same<00:01:22.670> as<00:01:22.790> it<00:01:22.910> did<00:01:23.030> 10<00:01:23.270> years<00:01:23.300> ago

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
exactly the same as it did 10 years ago

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.250 
exactly the same as it did 10 years ago
so<00:01:25.790> while<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.060> game<00:01:26.240> looks<00:01:26.540> very<00:01:26.660> different

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
so while the game looks very different

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.500 
so while the game looks very different
it's<00:01:28.220> gonna<00:01:28.400> feel<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:28.880> play<00:01:28.970> exactly<00:01:29.180> the

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
it's gonna feel and play exactly the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.290 
it's gonna feel and play exactly the
same<00:01:29.570> as<00:01:29.870> you<00:01:29.960> remember<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:31.820> we<00:01:31.910> got<00:01:32.030> a<00:01:32.060> couple

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
same as you remember and we got a couple

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.880 
same as you remember and we got a couple
of<00:01:32.480> other<00:01:32.600> benefits<00:01:32.810> from<00:01:33.230> this<00:01:33.409> as<00:01:33.560> well<00:01:33.740> and

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
of other benefits from this as well and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.380 
of other benefits from this as well and
again<00:01:34.010> this<00:01:34.220> is<00:01:34.370> a<00:01:34.400> great<00:01:34.640> level<00:01:34.909> to<00:01:35.030> highlight

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
again this is a great level to highlight

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.910 
again this is a great level to highlight
it<00:01:35.540> this<00:01:35.630> is<00:01:35.810> a<00:01:35.840> level<00:01:35.990> that<00:01:36.200> people<00:01:36.500> sometimes

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
it this is a level that people sometimes

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
because 3d Tech didn't exist ten years

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.729 
because 3d Tech didn't exist ten years
ago<00:03:02.909> but<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.659> really<00:03:03.840> adds<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.349> immersion

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
ago but it really adds to the immersion

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.140 
ago but it really adds to the immersion
of<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.890> experience<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.579> we<00:03:05.700> did<00:03:05.879> want<00:03:06.060> to

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
of the experience and we did want to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.789 
of the experience and we did want to
support<00:03:06.480> people<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.840> have<00:03:06.989> that<00:03:07.019> technology
