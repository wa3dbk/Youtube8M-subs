tremolo

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:22.790 
tremolo
if<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:10.200> tremolo<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.830> out<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.010> adjustment

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.970 

you<00:00:23.340> will<00:00:23.490> see<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:24.509> it<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.810> not<00:00:25.050> flat<00:00:25.679> as<00:00:25.949> it

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
you will see that it is not flat as it

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.799 
you will see that it is not flat as it
should<00:00:26.340> be

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.180

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
the base the base of the tremolo should

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.060 
the base the base of the tremolo should
be<00:00:37.340> flat<00:00:37.670> in<00:00:37.879> line<00:00:38.090> with<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:38.449> body<00:00:38.920> here<00:00:39.920> we

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
be flat in line with the body here we

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.709 
be flat in line with the body here we
see<00:00:42.309> here<00:00:43.309> we<00:00:43.460> see<00:00:43.670> it<00:00:43.820> is<00:00:43.910> clearly<00:00:44.210> going<00:00:44.600> up

see here we see it is clearly going up
on<00:00:44.930> an<00:00:45.019> angle<00:00:47.680> when<00:00:48.680> this<00:00:48.860> happens<00:00:50.680> you<00:00:51.680> want

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
on an angle when this happens you want

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.189 
on an angle when this happens you want
to<00:00:51.890> need<00:00:51.979> to<00:00:52.010> remove<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:52.670> base<00:00:52.850> plate<00:00:53.199> you

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.880 

if<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.579> tremolo<00:01:34.000> is<00:01:34.149> rising<00:01:34.689> you<00:01:35.590> will<00:01:35.740> need

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
if the tremolo is rising you will need

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.149 
if the tremolo is rising you will need
to<00:01:36.009> tighten<00:01:36.280> these<00:01:36.610> two<00:01:36.880> screws<00:01:37.270> here<00:01:38.159> only

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
to tighten these two screws here only

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.300 
to tighten these two screws here only
tighten<00:01:39.640> them<00:01:39.759> in<00:01:39.909> small<00:01:40.210> adjustments<00:01:40.899> and

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
tighten them in small adjustments and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.459 
tighten them in small adjustments and
tighten<00:01:42.310> them<00:01:42.780> by<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.840> same<00:01:44.140> adjustments

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
tighten them by the same adjustments

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:53.179 
tighten them by the same adjustments
each<00:01:45.899> will<00:01:46.899> make<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.439> quarter<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.399> turn<00:01:48.610> and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.340 

repeat<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.369> same<00:01:54.579> process<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.200> other

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
repeat the same process to the other

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.789 
repeat the same process to the other
spring

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:15.589 

no<00:02:04.799> chain<00:02:05.399> again<00:02:13.849> we<00:02:14.849> will<00:02:15.000> see<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.300> time

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
no chain again we will see this time

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.350 
no chain again we will see this time
that<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> bridge<00:02:16.410> has<00:02:16.590> risen<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:17.819> not<00:02:18.000> by<00:02:18.180> as

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
that the bridge has risen but not by as

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.930 
that the bridge has risen but not by as
much<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:19.860> we<00:02:19.980> will<00:02:20.130> need<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.400> give<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.640> another

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
much so we will need to give it another

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:43.160 
much so we will need to give it another
quarter<00:02:21.239> of<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.569> turn

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:53.720 

and<00:02:43.260> we<00:02:43.920> were<00:02:44.010> tuned<00:02:44.250> again<00:02:52.220> here<00:02:53.220> we<00:02:53.370> will<00:02:53.520> see

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
and we were tuned again here we will see

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.170 
and we were tuned again here we will see
the<00:02:53.970> bridge<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.420> actually<00:02:54.660> sitting

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
the bridge is actually sitting

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.870 
the bridge is actually sitting
horizontal<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.050> body<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.560> guitar

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
horizontal to the body of the guitar

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.750 
horizontal to the body of the guitar
this<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.180> correct<00:03:00.510> height
