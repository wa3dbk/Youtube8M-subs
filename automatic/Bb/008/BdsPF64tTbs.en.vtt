00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
I probably fished three or four times a

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.690 
I probably fished three or four times a
week<00:00:49.540> if<00:00:49.750> I<00:00:49.900> can<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.980> if<00:00:51.100> I<00:00:51.160> didn't<00:00:51.370> have<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.520> job

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
make it look alive you make the hackle

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.300 
make it look alive you make the hackle
pulse<00:01:27.670> yeah<00:01:28.510> you<00:01:28.810> move<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.680> fly<00:01:29.860> up<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.190> down

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
pulse yeah you move the fly up and down

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.160 
pulse yeah you move the fly up and down
in<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.700> water<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.270> fish<00:01:31.450> don't<00:01:31.630> know<00:01:31.930> that

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
in the water the fish don't know that

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.260 
in the water the fish don't know that
it's<00:01:32.320> fake<00:01:32.530> but<00:01:33.159> it's<00:01:33.340> moving<00:01:33.549> so<00:01:34.060> they're

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
it's fake but it's moving so they're

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.210 
it's fake but it's moving so they're
gonna<00:01:34.360> eat<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:34.780> because<00:01:34.869> it<00:01:35.110> looks<00:01:35.260> alive<00:01:35.530> one

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
gonna eat it because it looks alive one

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.910 
gonna eat it because it looks alive one
main<00:01:36.430> limitation<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.210> 10<00:01:37.390> kata<00:01:37.630> is<00:01:37.920> obviously

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
main limitation of 10 kata is obviously

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.770 
main limitation of 10 kata is obviously
you<00:01:39.130> don't<00:01:39.280> have<00:01:39.430> a<00:01:39.460> reel<00:01:39.729> so<00:01:40.119> landing<00:01:40.659> on<00:01:40.750> a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
you don't have a reel so landing on a

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.359 
you don't have a reel so landing on a
fish<00:01:41.020> is<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.260> little<00:01:41.710> bit<00:01:41.830> different<00:01:42.310> I

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
fish is a little bit different I

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.010 
fish is a little bit different I
wouldn't<00:01:42.670> say<00:01:42.850> it's<00:01:43.030> necessarily<00:01:43.540> harder

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
wouldn't say it's necessarily harder

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.310 
wouldn't say it's necessarily harder
it's<00:01:44.350> just<00:01:44.680> different<00:01:44.920> ten<00:01:45.310> kata<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:46.320> very

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
it's just different ten kata is very

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.859 
it's just different ten kata is very
very<00:01:47.650> diverse<00:01:48.040> on<00:01:48.369> how<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:48.549> can<00:01:48.790> cast<00:01:49.030> your
