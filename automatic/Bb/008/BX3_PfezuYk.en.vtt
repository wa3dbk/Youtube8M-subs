00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.910
 hi friends, this is the spark of the 

00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:08.189
 good life let's start by saying that 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.259
 this is one more video delivery 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.480
 botched made in coffee and also with 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.620
 a lot of mess because good as I have 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.050
 said on the blog 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.910
 I'm good, I made a move recently and 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.430
 I still have a lot to do 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:29.090
 this is the movie the spark of life 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.180
 whatever my sympathy and many 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.180
 others 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.260
 now I forget the name but 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.700
 great director who gave up the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.130
 presidency of the royal academy 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.630
 of cinema with the theme of the law sinde 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.630
 jolín look that I do not remember 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.570
 right now álex of the church of the 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.329
 good that has different that is 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.870
 watching this movie here on a television 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.750
 of living room 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.410
 because what is the device that is 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.410
 reproducing 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.700
 yes yes the galaxy nexus the galaxy nexus 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.550
 because because he has this adapter that 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.970
 I took by ebay and that also has this 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:21.400
 small detail that while while 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:24.670
 is using with a normal hdmi 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.770
 Normal size can be loaded bone 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.710
 at the same time I'm loading the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.230
 phone and playing the video 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.750
 taking him to television 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.730
 these are very interesting components 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.240
 to see a movie for example let's go 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.730
 hotel and if the television has hdmi then 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.060
 with the same galaxy nexus then we can 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.030
 have this but here is another component 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.000
 which makes it even more interesting 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.530
 a bluetooth keyboard and a trackpad a 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.159
 mouse 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.950
 these are those of imac 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.009
 which are compatible but it can be good 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.390
 any keyboard and mouse then what 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.390
 we do what happens 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.940
 this happens that we can 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.950
 handle in full 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.950
 our galaxy nexus 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.340
 this would be very interesting with 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.260
 example with the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.130
 we have a full-fledged computer 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:38.400
 ladies and gentlemen we can 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:40.310
 to see if I can get write 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.340
 and the letter eñe 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.160
 the keyboard goes perfectly 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.050
 I really was blown away 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.930
 when when I could check 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.410
 this I had to teach him 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.220
 it could not be otherwise 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.450
 It is also the little detail of the pointer there 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.450
 it is vital 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.800
 and good 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.550
 the possibilities are already more than this 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.960
 They are many 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.960
 here we have the browser 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.510
 a full-fledged computer right now 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:26.480
 what's wrong I'm holding the ipad 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.050
 which is quite heavy 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.460
 to record because the galaxy nexus then 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.770
 as you can see 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.590
 Well, I'm using it for others 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.890
 tasks 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.980
 but good here you have the handling is very 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.819
 good and good is approaching 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:51.670
 very much that of having a pocket pc 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:57.300
 and be able to catch a television screen 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:04:00.970
 and be able to have a 100% computer 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.590
 it would be magnificent no no no you think 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.960
 Well, good friends, the only thing 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.470
 we need is a bluetooth keyboard or a 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.950
 bluetooth mouse and this component 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.890
 wonderful it is therefore a converter 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.709
 the phone plug that is micro usb 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.699
 I think 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.069
 hdmi and that also has the added 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:27.860
 that can be charged because of course 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:31.720
 if the subject is not a bit complicated 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.449
 good to forgive for the mess and 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.900
 by this delivers more d 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.139
 due the good coffee tinker 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.979
 friends 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.979
 until another
