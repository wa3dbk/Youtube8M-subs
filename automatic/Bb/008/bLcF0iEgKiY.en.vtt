everyone<00:00:04.799> this<00:00:05.190> time<00:00:05.430> I'm<00:00:05.640> going<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.910> look<00:00:06.000> at

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.909 
everyone this time I'm going to look at
five<00:00:06.390> games<00:00:06.720> that<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:06.960> think<00:00:07.290> are<00:00:07.410> overhyped

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
five games that I think are overhyped

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.530 
five games that I think are overhyped
and<00:00:08.189> five<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.700> think<00:00:08.940> are<00:00:09.090> under<00:00:09.330> hyped

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
and five that I think are under hyped

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.660 
and five that I think are under hyped
now<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:09.960> might<00:00:10.200> be<00:00:10.230> thinking<00:00:10.490> isn't<00:00:11.490> this

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
now you might be thinking isn't this

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.209 
now you might be thinking isn't this
entire<00:00:12.210> channel<00:00:12.660> about<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.320> well<00:00:13.710> yeah<00:00:13.920> it

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
entire channel about that well yeah it

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.039 
entire channel about that well yeah it
is<00:00:14.400> but<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.790> figured<00:00:15.210> not<00:00:15.360> everyone<00:00:15.690> has<00:00:15.839> time

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
is but I figured not everyone has time

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.439 
is but I figured not everyone has time
to<00:00:16.350> slog<00:00:16.650> through<00:00:16.680> over<00:00:17.250> 100<00:00:17.490> videos<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.359> I'm

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
to slog through over 100 videos so I'm

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.880 
to slog through over 100 videos so I'm
going<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.750> boil<00:00:18.930> down<00:00:19.050> ten<00:00:19.500> games<00:00:19.740> in

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
going to boil down ten games in

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
mean a couple things either the game

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.130 
mean a couple things either the game
isn't<00:00:29.609> as<00:00:29.730> good<00:00:30.029> as<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.510> been<00:00:30.660> touted<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.080> be

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
isn't as good as it's been touted to be

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.749 
isn't as good as it's been touted to be
over<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.529> past<00:00:31.710> 20<00:00:32.009> years<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.610> hasn't

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
over the past 20 years and it hasn't

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.209 
over the past 20 years and it hasn't
held<00:00:33.059> up<00:00:33.239> over<00:00:33.510> time<00:00:33.690> or<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.500> game<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.890> seems

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
held up over time or a game that seems

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.010 
held up over time or a game that seems
like<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.550> should<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:35.820> good<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.300> paper<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:36.899> it

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
like it should be good on paper but it

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.750 
like it should be good on paper but it
just<00:00:37.140> isn't<00:00:37.380> or<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> same<00:00:38.100> concepts<00:00:38.610> and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
just isn't or the same concepts and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
just isn't or the same concepts and
mechanics<00:00:39.239> were<00:00:39.570> executed<00:00:40.170> much<00:00:40.320> better<00:00:40.620> in

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
mechanics were executed much better in

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.069 
mechanics were executed much better in
other<00:00:41.070> similar<00:00:41.430> games<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.420> underhyped<00:00:42.780> I

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
other similar games for underhyped I

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.090 
other similar games for underhyped I
just<00:00:43.290> mean<00:00:43.410> games<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.829> should<00:00:44.010> be

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
just mean games that should be

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.650 
just mean games that should be
considered<00:00:44.550> among<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.879> very<00:00:45.059> best<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.539> their

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
considered among the very best of their

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.590 
considered among the very best of their
kind<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.289> aren't<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.800> whatever<00:00:46.980> reason<00:00:47.600> now

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
kind but aren't for whatever reason now

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.209 
kind but aren't for whatever reason now
when<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.870> think<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.170> overhyped<00:00:49.680> Super<00:00:50.129> Nintendo

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
when I think of overhyped Super Nintendo

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.950 
when I think of overhyped Super Nintendo
games<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> first<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.420> comes<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.690> mind

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
games the first one that comes to mind

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.990 
games the first one that comes to mind
is<00:00:52.230> demon's<00:00:52.680> crest<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.309> game<00:00:53.550> has<00:00:53.760> great

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
control great graphics some cool ideas

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.490 
control great graphics some cool ideas
and<00:00:56.399> an<00:00:56.520> overall<00:00:56.789> badass<00:00:57.390> presentation<00:00:58.170> but

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and an overall badass presentation but

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.080 
and an overall badass presentation but
the<00:00:58.590> level<00:00:58.859> design<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.550> way<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.879> game<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
the level design and the way the game is

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.360 
the level design and the way the game is
structured<00:01:00.660> are<00:01:00.840> two<00:01:01.050> huge<00:01:01.530> flaws<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:01.949> I

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
structured are two huge flaws that I

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.520 
structured are two huge flaws that I
really<00:01:02.760> can't<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.180> around<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.780> got<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> return

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
really can't get around you got a return

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.010 
really can't get around you got a return
to<00:01:04.710> one<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> same<00:01:05.309> five<00:01:05.700> levels<00:01:06.240> over<00:01:06.750> and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
to one of the same five levels over and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.450 
to one of the same five levels over and
over<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.740> over<00:01:07.920> again

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
over and over again

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.800 
over and over again
and<00:01:08.700> that's<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.030> you're<00:01:09.060> lucky<00:01:09.180> enough<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and that's if you're lucky enough to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.850 
and that's if you're lucky enough to
figure<00:01:09.990> out<00:01:10.140> where<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> hell<00:01:10.680> you're

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
figure out where the hell you're

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.560 
figure out where the hell you're
supposed<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.250> go<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> first<00:01:11.909> place<00:01:12.210> it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
supposed to go in the first place it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.700 
supposed to go in the first place it
doesn't<00:01:12.869> help<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.290> levels<00:01:13.560> themselves

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
doesn't help that the levels themselves

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.039 
doesn't help that the levels themselves
are<00:01:14.100> pretty<00:01:14.250> blond<00:01:14.670> layout<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.570> would<00:01:15.810> avoid

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
are pretty blond layout I would avoid

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.570 
are pretty blond layout I would avoid
this<00:01:16.290> game<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.740> don't<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.400> worth

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
this game I just don't think it's worth

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.810 
this game I just don't think it's worth
it<00:01:17.850> an<00:01:18.409> under<00:01:19.409> hyped<00:01:19.619> action<00:01:20.040> platformer<00:01:20.640> is

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820

sparkster<00:01:21.330> I've<00:01:21.720> talked<00:01:22.110> about<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.439> game

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
sparkster I've talked about this game

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.260 
sparkster I've talked about this game
quite<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.920> bit<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.340> channel<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.729> far<00:01:24.119> but

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
quite a bit on this channel so far but

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.760 
quite a bit on this channel so far but
not<00:01:24.450> quite<00:01:24.720> enough<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.049> my<00:01:25.170> opinion<00:01:25.619> because

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
not quite enough in my opinion because
