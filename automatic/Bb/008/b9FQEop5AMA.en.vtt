00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.590 

antenna<00:01:55.250> that<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:55.700> know<00:01:55.760> felt<00:01:56.060> fold<00:01:56.300> it<00:01:56.480> up

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
antenna that you know felt fold it up

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.320 
antenna that you know felt fold it up
and<00:01:56.750> spread<00:01:57.050> out<00:01:57.290> right<00:01:58.190> here<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:59.060> there<00:01:59.210> was

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
and spread out right here and there was

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.600 
and spread out right here and there was
a<00:01:59.360> satellite<00:01:59.930> dish<00:01:59.960> up<00:02:00.500> there<00:02:00.800> that<00:02:01.040> came<00:02:01.370> with

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
a satellite dish up there that came with

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.950 
a satellite dish up there that came with
the<00:02:01.730> motor<00:02:01.940> home<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.300> I<00:02:02.330> bought<00:02:02.570> it<00:02:02.750> two<00:02:02.930> years

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
the motor home and I bought it two years

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.890 
the motor home and I bought it two years
ago<00:02:03.320> we've<00:02:04.280> never<00:02:04.460> used<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:05.000> satellite<00:02:05.540> dish

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
ago we've never used the satellite dish

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.180 
ago we've never used the satellite dish
and<00:02:06.350> we<00:02:07.220> don't<00:02:07.370> use<00:02:07.610> TV<00:02:08.119> in<00:02:08.509> here<00:02:08.929> so<00:02:09.320> I<00:02:09.560> didn't

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
and we don't use TV in here so I didn't

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.890 
and we don't use TV in here so I didn't
need<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.520> mug<00:02:10.670> those<00:02:10.910> antennas<00:02:11.630> on<00:02:11.780> the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
need the mug those antennas on the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.710 
need the mug those antennas on the
weight<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:15.130> cover<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.280> holes<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:17.630> the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
weight so I cover the holes and the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.360 
weight so I cover the holes and the
holes<00:02:17.750> for<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.170> antennas<00:02:18.680> was<00:02:18.890> about<00:02:19.160> that

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
holes for the antennas was about that

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.670 
holes for the antennas was about that
big<00:02:19.430> with<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.300> bunch<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.570> screw<00:02:20.810> hole<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:21.320> i<00:02:21.380> just

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
big with a bunch of screw hole so i just

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.580 
big with a bunch of screw hole so i just
took<00:02:21.770> my<00:02:22.360> some<00:02:23.360> aluminum<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.590> some<00:02:25.250> roof<00:02:25.459> tape

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
took my some aluminum and some roof tape

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.949 
took my some aluminum and some roof tape
and<00:02:27.590> what<00:02:28.040> i<00:02:28.070> do<00:02:28.190> i<00:02:28.310> put<00:02:28.730> this<00:02:28.880> down<00:02:29.120> over<00:02:29.780> the

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.010 
that I want to caution everybody is part
of<00:05:53.740> this<00:05:53.860> is<00:05:54.100> my<00:05:54.280> fault<00:05:54.310> because<00:05:54.820> I<00:05:55.060> took<00:05:55.600> the

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
of this is my fault because I took the

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.250 
of this is my fault because I took the
trim<00:05:56.290> rings<00:05:56.530> off<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:57.040> inside<00:05:57.460> to<00:05:58.330> paint<00:05:59.020> them

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
trim rings off the inside to paint them

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.820 
trim rings off the inside to paint them
and<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:01.060> windows<00:06:01.630> actually<00:06:01.870> broke<00:06:02.350> the<00:06:02.560> seals

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
and the windows actually broke the seals

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.120 
and the windows actually broke the seals
so<00:06:03.540> don't<00:06:04.540> take<00:06:04.780> the<00:06:04.960> trim<00:06:05.169> rings<00:06:05.440> off<00:06:05.860> unless

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
so don't take the trim rings off unless

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.220 
so don't take the trim rings off unless

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:23.289 
to use it's a half piece because on the

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:26.850 
to use it's a half piece because on the
windows<00:07:23.849> you<00:07:24.849> can<00:07:25.060> see<00:07:25.300> that<00:07:25.719> it's<00:07:25.870> just<00:07:26.080> go<00:07:26.800> to

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:26.860 
windows you can see that it's just go to

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.939 
windows you can see that it's just go to
use<00:07:27.219> anymore<00:07:27.490> just<00:07:28.000> it<00:07:28.270> all<00:07:28.930> down<00:07:29.199> inside<00:07:29.620> here

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:29.949 
use anymore just it all down inside here

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:33.149 
use anymore just it all down inside here
it<00:07:30.039> doesn't<00:07:30.189> do<00:07:30.370> any<00:07:30.580> good<00:07:30.689> so<00:07:31.889> this<00:07:32.889> is<00:07:33.039> the

00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:33.159 
it doesn't do any good so this is the

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:36.600 
it doesn't do any good so this is the
black<00:07:33.370> tape<00:07:33.669> that<00:07:33.879> we<00:07:34.029> use<00:07:34.270> now<00:07:35.159> to<00:07:36.159> get<00:07:36.339> this

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:36.610 
black tape that we use now to get this

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.279 
black tape that we use now to get this
caulking<00:07:37.539> out<00:07:37.860> it's<00:07:38.860> really<00:07:39.129> kind<00:07:39.580> of<00:07:39.759> a<00:07:39.909> pain

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:40.289 
caulking out it's really kind of a pain

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:43.800 
caulking out it's really kind of a pain
but<00:07:41.289> one<00:07:41.680> of<00:07:41.800> the<00:07:41.889> ways<00:07:42.069> to<00:07:42.430> do<00:07:42.580> it<00:07:42.789> is<00:07:42.909> you<00:07:43.779> just

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:43.810 
but one of the ways to do it is you just

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.610 
but one of the ways to do it is you just
take<00:07:44.199> a<00:07:44.229> roll<00:07:44.589> of<00:07:44.830> the<00:07:44.860> old<00:07:46.210> and<00:07:46.629> you

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:47.620 
take a roll of the old and you

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.529 
take a roll of the old and you
can<00:07:47.800> just<00:07:47.919> walk<00:07:48.279> around<00:07:48.490> it<00:07:48.849> like<00:07:48.969> this<00:07:49.240> and

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:49.539 
can just walk around it like this and

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:51.869
