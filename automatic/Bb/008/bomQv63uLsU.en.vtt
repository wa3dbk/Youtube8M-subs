00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.170
 come to my channel as it is 2013 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.500
 today we are going to learn how to rewind 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.800
 talking 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.050
 first of all you are a speaker who 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.790
 burned 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.660
 we have 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:20.310
 This is 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.830
 According to the description, 100 watts 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.669
 This is a 100 watt speaker and it has been 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.789
 burned the coil then to take out the 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:33.110
 coil we have to pour gasoline all 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.110
 around to take it off 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.750
 if we can not get out, it's going to break 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.989
 this comes like this he sees that way then 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.170
 we take this out with benzine we take out a 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.060
 side 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.660
 and later 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:53.170
 this we throw it more benzine oak here 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:57.510
 to take off the speaker that goes here not 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:01.649
 you have to take off what I and then 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.390
 we make a sheet like that and today it's over 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.270
 let me take you out of here to be able 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.689
 this highlight the coil short of this 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.689
 way 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.680
 once to the dust society also 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.400
 stays 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.540
 here between the return and the magnet 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.910
 then that makes you not want 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.760
 stuck like in this case is coil is 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:37.100
 he was stuck inside he can not go out anymore 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.100
 then this one 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.259
 so that the coil and the speaker are 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:46.250
 working well been in which is 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.620
 on the move in and out 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.690
 and when it does not come out it stays stuck like 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.450
 in this case that means that the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.909
 coil 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.939
 detached inside and has been 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.390
 embedded between the magnet and the cone that 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.909
 go here then we have to take out this 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.930
 government to make it another coil 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.899
 so let's see how we got it out 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.720
 I'm trying to take out the coil this 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:19.890
 sheet must be placed between the coil and 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.890
 in the nucleus to be able to take 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.640
 try to take out the coil 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.220
 I'm this way 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.220
 our coil has to come out 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.500
 wants to leave
