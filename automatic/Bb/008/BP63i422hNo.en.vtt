00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:18.110
 7 if we are so romantic and is that we 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.220
 we see a little more about the 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.460
 love story or the types up here 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.400
 wakes up in then in the room of 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.880
 this guy and still holding the 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.280
 from the clock in his hand of Moors and 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.309
 as we are still located 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.290
 I'm doing here and suddenly the guy 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.080
 stop is the strength that good I know that 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.870
 These guys 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.630
 like they do not get tired of seeing like that 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.260
 there is this connection between them very very 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:55.220
 deep enough that it even tells you its 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.470
 greatest secret to use English to which I 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.309
 I had an accident at age 6 I lost 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.250
 my parents 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.680
 thanks to that excellent 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.160
 but in my memory and the only thing 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.310
 I remember from that moment is that 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.810
 I need to find the silver crystal 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.690
 because I know it's the key to being able to 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.030
 remember who I am I do not know if I'm a love 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.840
 if you 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.170
 or 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.659
 or who 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.830
 she stays listening to them and also 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.450
 he confesses 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.270
 because he's looking for the crystal of the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.730
 silver what she explains is what it is 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.220
 good all you know is why moon 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.090
 He told him that he will look for it and what 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.369
 I was guarding 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.859
 suddenly of that sad look in the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.950
 He memoro eyes and she realizes 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:47.340
 that's not her I do not know if she did it intentionally 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.590
 but if it gets closer to him and he 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.319
 they stay like this for a moment connected with 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.259
 these looks so nice and when 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.130
 pixar reacts that I have to go 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.679
 I have to go 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.200
 the guy you do not know what motives to do 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.060
 stop the un take it out 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.820
 it was chila 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.050
 but it's that you feel it's not attention 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.780
 sexual 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.540
 you can feel it and the whole audience we can 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.930
 give an account of that we see the moon that 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.030
 it is also 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.489
 having a conversation with follower 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.439
 kinda suspect that it is she who is 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.120
 having this conversation and sir 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.730
 fifth tells him that it is already necessary that 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.420
 also all six recover them their 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.389
 memories of their past lives like that 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.719
 that is going to be the key to discovering 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:40.409
 there was in that past how they were 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:41.939
 them here in the world and I think it's going to 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.819
 be very very interesting 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.379
 we see how to use it and it does not have that 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.319
 internal conflict 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.580
 she believes deeply did not die there was no 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.250
 not a minute 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.350
 and in fact to such a degree that it starts 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.740
 hide them the true identity of 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.380
 love to all jealousy and to the one also 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.660
 and you're willing to take that risk 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.780
 if you know I will not share anything 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.540
 about the passage of my love 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.890
 this is how very mine is doing it 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.660
 very very of them what a romantic chapter 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.650
 and it means when the end 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.530
 they were fighting 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.230
 we see as a love 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.590
 he realizes that actually 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.150
 comparison of using silver crystal 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.640
 It is very far away 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.190
 here I go 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.410
 if I put it in comparison hikes and 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.400
 silver artists for god what did he choose if 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.130
 he does not even think about it and that's what he says 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.170
 God your smile the logo I have disgusted 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.540
 but when you give me your eyes and I see in you 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.330
 that active son's strength 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.940
 and romantics 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.680
 the fifth one appears helping these guys 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.020
 because they are beating up 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.020
 all six the cause guides his ceo more 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.439
 and it's getting pretty interesting 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.719
 because we also saw a white kitten and 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.390
 that's father I did not know anything 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:13.599
 about the white kitten and you want 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.600
 I can say in this version of de sailor 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.820
 moon crystal is charming me 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.880
 and I have not read the manga maybe it's because 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.550
 I'm enjoying it that much and 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.650
 I do not want I do not want boilers with favor 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.560
 so nothing to criticize things 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.490
 of the manga because I eat it very sad I know 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.460
 very much 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.169
 in your comments I read them all I 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.169
 I'm face and we're seeing each other here
