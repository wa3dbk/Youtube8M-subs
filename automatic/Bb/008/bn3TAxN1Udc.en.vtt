just<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> hardest<00:01:10.170> part

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
just like this this is the hardest part

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.890 
just like this this is the hardest part
is<00:01:10.650> maintaining<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.549> pinch<00:01:12.270> your<00:01:12.840> fingers

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
is maintaining that pinch your fingers

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.870 
is maintaining that pinch your fingers
might<00:01:13.439> get<00:01:13.650> cramped<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.430> start<00:01:14.729> getting

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
might get cramped if you start getting

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.030 
might get cramped if you start getting
in<00:01:15.090> lots<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.570> lots<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.840> ribbon<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.350> always<00:01:16.860> like

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
working from the right so switch it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.330

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
first loop you're going to create you

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.510 
first loop you're going to create you
can<00:01:27.140> make<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.350> different<00:01:28.799> variations<00:01:28.920> of

the way all the size but we're going to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.039 
the way all the size but we're going to
do<00:01:34.470> two<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:35.220> each<00:01:35.520> side<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.090> same<00:01:36.360> size<00:01:36.659> and

do two on each side the same size and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.109 
do two on each side the same size and
then<00:01:37.560> two<00:01:37.860> more<00:01:38.040> an<00:01:38.189> inch<00:01:38.369> bigger<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.909> then

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
then two more an inch bigger and then

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.240 
then two more an inch bigger and then
two<00:01:39.360> more<00:01:39.540> again<00:01:39.780> inch<00:01:40.020> bigger<00:01:40.320> than<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.770> so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
two more again inch bigger than that so

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.980 
two more again inch bigger than that so
we'll<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.640> total<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.030> six<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.540> each<00:01:42.570> side

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
we'll have a total of six on each side

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.710 
we'll have a total of six on each side
so<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.130> I'm<00:01:44.340> going<00:01:44.549> for<00:01:44.729> my<00:01:44.850> second<00:01:45.299> loop<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
so now I'm going for my second loop the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.710 
so now I'm going for my second loop the
same<00:01:45.960> size<00:01:46.380> again<00:01:47.130> pinch<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.909> gather<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.570> in

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
same size again pinch it gather it in

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.300 
same size again pinch it gather it in
and<00:01:48.930> then<00:01:49.170> you're<00:01:49.320> gonna<00:01:49.500> give<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.979> quick

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
and then you're gonna give it a quick

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.210 
and then you're gonna give it a quick
twist<00:01:50.790> all<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.180> way<00:01:51.329> around<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.350> side<00:01:52.950> is

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
twist all the way around so that side is

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.280 
twist all the way around so that side is
on<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.430> up<00:01:53.759> side<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.509> gives<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.869> nice

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
on the up side this gives you that nice

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.889 
on the up side this gives you that nice
pinch<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.130> look<00:01:56.340> at<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.610> center<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.630> flip

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
pinch to look at the center and you flip

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.510 
pinch to look at the center and you flip
it<00:01:58.049> around<00:01:58.140> now<00:01:58.409> maintain<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.070> pinch<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
it around now maintain that pinch in the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.429 
it around now maintain that pinch in the
center<00:01:59.939> we're<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.540> an<00:02:00.630> inch<00:02:00.840> bigger<00:02:01.140> so

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
center we're going for an inch bigger so

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.870 
center we're going for an inch bigger so
just<00:02:01.649> kind<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.920> line<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.340> up<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.640> other

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
just kind of line it up to the other

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.580 
just kind of line it up to the other
loops<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.509> eyeball<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:03.960> that's<00:02:04.320> close

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
loops just eyeball it that's close

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.249 
loops just eyeball it that's close
enough<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.850> then<00:02:06.479> gather<00:02:06.960> it

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
enough just like this and then gather it

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.080 
enough just like this and then gather it
