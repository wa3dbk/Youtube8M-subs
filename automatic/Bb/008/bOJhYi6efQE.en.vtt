00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.270
 Hello everyone and today in this video I'm going 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.300
 to teach how to make a delicious 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.150
 garlic soups the ingredients that 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.690
 we will need to be a trickle of 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.840
 olive oil a little milk a 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.500
 little sugar three or four teeth 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.310
 of garlic to taste and hard bread a bread that 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.330
 we have two or three days ago 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.030
 to start we will peel wash and chop 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.460
 Finite the garlic if you want a little trick 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.430
 so you do not repeat the garlic you can 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.470
 open them and remove the central part 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.470
 taquito that they bring that is what it repeats 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.370
 and we're going to put them in a pan that 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.420
 we have put a good jet of oil 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.340
 of olive and that is on medium-high heat 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.020
 we are letting them do little to 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.510
 little until they take a little bit of color 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.150
 when we see that garlic has already taken a 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.710
 golden color we will remove it from the fire and 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.280
 we will let the oil cool 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.930
 while the oil is cooling 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.119
 we can go biting with the help of a 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.490
 knife the hard bread into pieces 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.950
 small to our liking and we reserve 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.220
 when we see that the oil is already a 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.439
 little bit colder, we'll add it like a glass 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.930
 of water we will put back to the fire 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.320
 maximum and we will wait for it to start 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.320
 cook 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.490
 when the water is cooking we will add 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.829
 chopped bread 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.930
 we reduce the fire a little bit now 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.270
 we are going to go around with a 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.570
 wooden spatula until all the bread 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.590
 be soft alike once 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:55.009
 after about 5 minutes we see that the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.640
 bread is well tender comes the time 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.860
 pour a teaspoon of sugar but 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.939
 this goes to the taste if you want him 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:08.300
 better it has been well distributed and now 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:11.170
 we will pour a splash of milk too 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.170
 to taste 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.310
 so you see 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.770
 that is added a little bit and we must 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.930
 stir very well 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.690
 we give it a couple of laps with a 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.600
 wooden spatula and they would be ready 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.820
 to serve me apologize for the noise of 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.820
 background but it is worth the hood 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.230
 and once served this is how they are 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:44.269
 our delicious garlic soups I hope 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.269
 that you liked goodbye
