00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.170
 welcome to schemes that make a mark 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.759
 this time we will make a basic model of 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.060
 marquetry called the base cube for 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.300
 cut model 3 metal blade for 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.630
 cut cardboard cardboard x you base 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 half foot of white tail metal ruler 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.989
 of 30 or 50 centimeters instruments of 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.820
 drawing we start first graph about 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.649
 the cardboard selected the chosen model 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.379
 there may be many possibilities of 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.670
 generate the desired graph on what 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:51.480
 material we will make the launch 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:54.210
 with a single with the tip of a compass in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.100
 the vertices that contain said model 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:03.800
 basic this basic model has six 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.800
 vertices in two-dimensional development 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.280
 second delineate the points obtained 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.150
 by drawing instruments 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.040
 technical and verify the achievement of graphic 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.980
 action 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:24.000
 third using the instruments of 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.700
 technical drawing make total cuts or 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.350
 deep around the edge of the model 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.890
 obtained fourth once obtained the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.910
 Edge piece make partial cuts or 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:44.030
 very shallow for the doubles of each 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:47.030
 fifth side bend the sides of the model 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.720
 making its enclosure possible 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.450
 volumetric in this stage the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.540
 verification of its total enclosure of 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.780
 the surface you can exaggerate your 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.780
 fold so that the moment of your 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.100
 construction can easily achieve 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.600
 the sixth enclosure using the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.630
 synthetic glue for model 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.260
 paste the sides of the edge of the model 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.260
 basic 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:26.700
 finally verifying an exact bond 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.609
 press the joints for a few seconds to 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.359
 then get the piece a basic model 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.359
 expected
