00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:08.379
 how to plant a walnut walnuts are a 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.360
 very attractive deciduous tree that 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.850
 they grow in many parts of america 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.400
 north and other parts of the world the dense 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.109
 foliage and the height of this tree can 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.480
 give an authentic welcome to the 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.600
 guests to your property and provide 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.250
 a lot of shade on the hottest days 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.140
 not to mention some delicious 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.930
 snacks when the tree starts to give 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.630
 its fruits is quite easy to plant 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.940
 these trees from seeds by 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.069
 where to start the best you can do 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.019
 first of all before buying the 

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:41.589
 seeds of any tree is to find out 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:43.780
 that is growing around you 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.670
 This is a good indication to know 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.139
 if the seeds will succeed in 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.879
 germinate 

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:51.699
 it is always better to plant seeds that 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.219
 are native to your area this 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.469
 will ensure that the tree adapts well to 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.870
 climatic conditions and soil 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:02.260
 what do you have if you have seen nogales in your 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.809
 zone then forward when you plant there 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.030
 what to look for the best time to collect 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.320
 the seeds is in autumn the seed 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.990
 It has round shape 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.479
 it usually goes green to a color 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.820
 slightly yellowish you will have given 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.610
 realize that trees can be very 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.650
 very big and that nuts are not something 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.290
 that can be easily caught in the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.900
 most cases check the soil for 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.440
 if the squirrels have inadvertently done the 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.360
 work to collect the fruits 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.850
 preparation of the seeds the number of 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.640
 seeds that you take will depend on how many 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.520
 nogales plan to plant is not necessary 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.580
 remove the shells the only difference 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.280
 real planting without shells is that 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.649
 the nuts seem to germinate a little more 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.259
 fast in spring and have a little more 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.720
 of success when they germinate so the 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.460
 choice depends on you if you decide to remove 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.619
 the shell you should always use 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.890
 thick gloves the nuts have a 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.690
 very black substance that stains hands 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.399
 as much as a black dye and there's no 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.770
 no product that can clean the 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.479
 spots immediately so what 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.030
 next thing you should do is place 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.800
 some nuts in an old table catch 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.680
 a hammer and give a couple of blows 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.079
 firm to the shell these will be divided 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.079
 and you can pick the nut inside with 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:23.769
 quite easily equal to 9 is 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:25.719
 ready to plant sow a rule 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.540
 general for most seeds 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.969
 is not sow the most deeply of 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.010
 the width of the seed itself so 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:35.079
 basically what you have to do is 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.030
 a hole big enough 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.489
 so that the seeds remain 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.069
 covers you can plant them in any 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.629
 moment after having collected them 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.879
 nuts require a period of 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.250
 cold stratification to allow the 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.230
 germination in spring so the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.060
 sowing should be in autumn 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.340
 You can stratify the seeds with 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.409
 other methods but let the mother 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.549
 nature do this work is the 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.959
 easiest way 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.510
 you must plant more seeds than 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.609
 necessary to ensure success then 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.219
 you can always delete the most trees 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.590
 weak or simply transplant the to 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.900
 another area once you've planted them 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.669
 you can cover the floor with hay and cloth 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.159
 metal to prohibit squirrels 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:17.019
 steal our seeds although these 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.069
 small animals can be very 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.469
 persistent 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.030
 If everything goes well you will realize that 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:25.239
 your walnut begins to grow early 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.920
 of spring will grow more than 30 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.900
 centimeters during the first season 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.900
 maybe even 60
