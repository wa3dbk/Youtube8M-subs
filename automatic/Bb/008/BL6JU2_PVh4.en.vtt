00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello everyone in this short tutorial 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.000
 Basic 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.490
 we'll see how to shape a tip from 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.530
 drill in 3d blender using the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.830
 screw modifier is the tool 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.440
 bridgen loft the tutorial was 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.720
 made with version 2.68 of 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.730
 3d blender 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.230
 before starting we plan the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.510
 operations 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.420
 we will start modeling the section of the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.760
 drill post after by write 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.340
 we will get the extrusion with rotation 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.070
 thus creating the true tip mash 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.380
 and its own and finally we will deal with the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.780
 part indicates us and the tip 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.879
 in the first case by bridge loft e 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.879
 in the second with simple scaling 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.070
 let's start with a top view of the garden with the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.440
 profile definition by inserting a 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.350
 bezier circle which is an object of type 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.260
 care with 4 checkpoints as yes 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.940
 can check by going into edit mode 4 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.010
 checkpoints each with two 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.710
 handle to define interpolation 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.020
 between the points 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.390
 here I will not follow technical projects 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.490
 precise however if you have them you can 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.860
 use them as a background image and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.549
 model the bezier circle by tracing 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.369
 the image in my case I am selecting 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.030
 only the two pairs of handles of the two 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.560
 upper and lower control points 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.240
 carefully selected only the handles 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.840
 not checkpoints and by left e 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.880
 the mouse list or moving away in practice 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.520
 with them he entered scaling mode 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.860
 while with hicks I constrain scaling to 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.950
 only horizontal axis of the scene that 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.780
 in my case it is the horizontal verse for 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.600
 whose final effect is to scale the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.899
 selection horizontally by moving away i 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.060
 points with the same principle but 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.820
 climbing inwards and then 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.860
 approaching them I select this time either 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.009
 the checkpoints that the handles at 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.979
 center and with left and mouse 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.340
 I approach getting the visible figure 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.340
 on video 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.870
 at this point I return to object mode 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.300
 and in the modifier tab within the 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.210
 panel properties window select a 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.470
 modifier literally writes to life 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:27.080
 precisely the initial result e 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.030
 disappointing is a kind of circle but 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.370
 just because screwing was 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.459
 performed without depth 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.940
 increase the value of the campus crew e 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.530
 here is the shape we wanted 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.440
 let us then change this parameter a 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.200
 pleasure arranging quality with steps 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.940
 and the number of repetitions with tea 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.920
 nation's defined this portion of 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.380
 mesh we are already in the middle of the work 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.440
 we have to fix the tip and the part 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.230
 Civil ga but first we must apply 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.000
 the modifier to get the mash not 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.130
 you can apply writes to a 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.950
 curved object like the bayern 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.250
 circle for which with the selected object 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.610
 in object model we press alt ce 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.799
 choose mesh from curve 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.930
 now let's go into edit mode and 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:22.070
 select the upper ring of 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.980
 hadoop edges with alt and right click on 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.049
 an edge 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.900
 the idea is to scale the selection 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.670
 to 0 making it end in a point but for 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.519
 apply the effect even to a pair of 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.070
 subsequent hadoop we activate in the header 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.260
 of 3d view the proportional editing 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.420
 which will go adjusted with the wheel 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.220
 mouse to better visualize i 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.650
 results should go to a list 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.989
 front or side in ortho mode with 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.930
 the upper ring selected and the 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.780
 proportion all editing active then 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.269
 press s0 but before pressing enter 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.519
 to confirm we rotate the wheel of the 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.840
 mouse to include in a manner 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.820
 other hedge looks are also proportional 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.840
 when the result convinces, we press 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.099
 send to confirm 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.390
 we disable the proportional editing 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.390
 in the window header 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.280
 in reality the tip thus obtained is not 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.930
 just closed and this could be 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.840
 a problem for the management of 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.949
 geometries by blender 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.639
 then select the vertices that the 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.770
 make up 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.400
 simply with b for selection 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.350
 rectangular we press we from the menu 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.789
 specials that will appear at the crossroads 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.669
 we select merge at center 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.410
 let us now go to the lower base for 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.050
 switch from the tip shape of 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.870
 drill to a circle section of the base 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.810
 cylindrical we will use the bridge tool 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.270
 which takes two rings of edges and loops 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.900
 with the same number of vertices ed 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.870
 make inedit mode connections 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.720
 then we select read loop of 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.240
 base with alt and right click on one 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.000
 edge and we see at the top of the window 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:16.130
 of blender under vers 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.220
 how many are the vertices always inedit mod 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.550
 let's add a cercle match that will do 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.229
 then part of the original object 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.720
 setting the same number of vertices 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.460
 in the ge loops by typing this value 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.479
 in the tool shelf at the bottom left 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.370
 when adding the mash we scale 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.130
 this circle to give him the right 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.440
 diameter and position the under law 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.960
 loop we also select this element 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.199
 with a multiple selection to do with 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.050
 shift or alt and click then 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.630
 we press the space bar we type bridge 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.130
 and select the bridge tool ed 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:57.560
 lux to make the connection done 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:00.409
 the result could be disappointing 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.690
 for a simple reason the connections 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.990
 they tend to be straight vertical 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.039
 ignoring the curvature of the tip for 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.470
 solve the problem 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:12.050
 we select the circular loupes jean at 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.669
 base and rotate a little around the axis 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.669
 vertical with rz 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:23.269
 at the end we can exclude it towards the 

00:06:21.049 --> 00:06:29.359
 low to get the cylindrical part 

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:31.969
 of the drill bit to conclude 

00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:34.609
 missing three small steps close the 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:37.789
 basis to recalculate the normal e 

00:06:34.609 --> 00:06:38.749
 apply smooth for shading 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:41.629
 close the base 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:46.789
 select the loop law that composes it e 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:49.339
 press f for phil filled for 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:51.739
 recalculate the unpublished normal mod 

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:57.589
 we select everything with and click on 

00:06:51.739 --> 00:07:00.189
 more light recam in the chef tool for 

00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:03.199
 apply smooth shading 

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:08.179
 let's get back to object mode and the tool 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:09.860
 shelf click on smoothing if se 

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:12.139
 you want you can apply others 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.569
 modifiers such as sub division surface 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:19.069
 to sweeten even more deformed but 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:21.649
 it should not be necessary well for 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.399
 this short but hopefully useful tutorial is 

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.699
 all 

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:24.699
 See you soon
