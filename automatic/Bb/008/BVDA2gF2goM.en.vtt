00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello today we are going to learn how to make a 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.000
 Stingray 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.940
 high four-point color dot 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.940
 it's not a point 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.160
 at this point you think 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.960
 to this blanket we will be able to give you the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.380
 dimensions that you want 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.380
 the color 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.280
 the first thing you have to do 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.649
 is the alarm and in the store it will decide 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.750
 I'm going to make a blanket for baby one 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.070
 blanket that measures approximately 90 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.860
 centimeters 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.579
 I will use a wool for a simple 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.769
 three points 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.489
 and good then shows you the 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.489
 ion colors 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.000
 choose four colors knowing that all 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.750
 they are going to be dominant and two are going to be 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.160
 secondary organized as you want 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.470
 but that the first two are the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.400
 dominant is to say the ones that are most going to 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.340
 see in the tissue 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.659
 I chose blue as color I have 300 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.270
 grams of this color 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.609
 fuchsia as color of I have 300 grams 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.130
 these are also my two colors 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:20.439
 dominant 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.439
 raw my color is 200 grams 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.040
 and the purple is my color of I have 250 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.170
 grams of this color 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.040
 well then to start we're going to 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.590
 making a knot is nice 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.630
 like the one we do to start almost 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.990
 all projects in crochet or 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.990
 crochet 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.070
 so what are we going to do? 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:49.350
 chains and chains and chains 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.659
 until reaching the desired width 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.790
 look at them like 1 meter to not be 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.430
 counting hundreds and hundreds of chains 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.680
 what is a mess 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.050
 and when you reach your desired width in 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:05.400
 this case 90 centimeters we stop 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.400
 the account 1 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.009
 with 3 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.040
 4 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.910
 and five chains and in that fifth string 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.260
 you are going to be a 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.260
 with all kinds 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.630
 if you do not know do you double points 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.790
 I recommend my video 10 steps to 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.770
 start doing the crochet that is in 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.370
 my channel 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.580
 then we make a chain of successes and 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.010
 then we make another double point in the 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.230
 same hole in that same fifth string 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.230
 what we have done to double previous point 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:04.420
 then we count 1 2 3 chains and in that 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.889
 third chain we are going to link and do 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.889
 another double point 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.549
 chain 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.050
 and another double point 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.690
 then point v is double point 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.860
 chain and double point all in it 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.860
 hollow as you could see 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.510
 you are going to see a small vv and your tissue 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.420
 how to finish a line 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.090
 then we look for the last little hole 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.030
 available from the previous line and there 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.090
 let's make a double point set 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.650
 ordinary double there ready 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.950
 we finish our line then we do 1 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.410
 two 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.940
 chains 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.540
 we look at our work 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.760
 and we start a new line we look for the 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:21.430
 uve of the previous line 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.430
 and we double point 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.530
 chain 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.949
 and double point 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.789
 in such a way that one vee over another 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:45.100
 I ve in each book how we changed 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.470
 color let's do as if we were 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.470
 ending a common line 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.509
 but we leave the double point half is 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.410
 say the last two years we leave them 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:59.669
 without passing to pass the new color in 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.669
 this case the color b 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.229
 that yes it was very clear in this image 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.110
 but then I repeat these steps with others 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:11.039
 colors to make it clearer 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.039
 well here we do 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.540
 and we turn our work 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.550
 to continue normally 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.550
 the double point 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.650
 chain 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.350
 and double point 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.680
 what will happen here that the wool goes to 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.380
 get stuck to your work and it's not 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.970
 true then the easiest thing is to cut it 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.330
 because we're not going to use it much 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.750
 time we leave about 5 centimeters and 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.750
 we cut 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.360
 and we tie a knot with the wool 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.720
 double so that we do not undo the 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.150
 I work this wool then I sew 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:16.310
 inside the blanket with a needle to 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.310
 wool and it will not be noticed at all 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.070
 well here I'll show you how many 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.080
 lines you have to do with each color and 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.330
 in what order then does it show you a 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.660
 audiovisual example of the first 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.450
 sequence that is 4 blue 2 fuchsia 3 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.490
 of crude and 7 of abode continues with the 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.850
 two other sequences that I show you there 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:42.130
 and repeat the three sequences over and over 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.050
 again and again until it reaches the 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.530
 as long as you want for your brand or 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.530
 blanket
