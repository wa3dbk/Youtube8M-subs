00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
that and that usually catches the seeds

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.640 
that and that usually catches the seeds
which<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.270> don't<00:02:16.720> want<00:02:16.960> in<00:02:17.140> your<00:02:17.170> salad

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
which you don't want in your salad

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.620 
which you don't want in your salad
dressing<00:02:17.970> okay

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
dressing okay

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.920 
dressing okay
and<00:02:20.400> let<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.550> soak<00:02:21.850> for<00:02:22.210> about<00:02:22.480> ten<00:02:22.780> minutes

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
and let that soak for about ten minutes

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.830 
and let that soak for about ten minutes
in<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.530> case<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:24.550> shallot<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.150> kind<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.600> like

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
in this case the shallot is kind of like

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.070 
in this case the shallot is kind of like
raw<00:02:26.260> fish<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:27.040> you're<00:02:27.550> making<00:02:27.700> ceviche<00:02:28.210> right

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
raw fish and you're making ceviche right

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.140 
raw fish and you're making ceviche right
so<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.380> add<00:02:29.590> citrus<00:02:30.040> juice<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.550> ceviche<00:02:31.090> to

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
so you add citrus juice to ceviche to

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.390 
so you add citrus juice to ceviche to
have<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.750> cook<00:02:32.020> through<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.680> that's<00:02:33.220> we're

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
have it cook through and that's we're

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.740 
have it cook through and that's we're
doing<00:02:33.430> with<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.730> shallots<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.240> take<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.570> raw

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
doing with the shallots to take the raw

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.660 
doing with the shallots to take the raw
edge<00:02:35.020> off<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.770> after<00:02:36.220> they've<00:02:36.340> been<00:02:36.490> sitting

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
edge off and after they've been sitting

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.550 
edge off and after they've been sitting
there<00:02:36.850> for<00:02:37.030> about<00:02:37.060> 10<00:02:37.420> minutes<00:02:37.630> then<00:02:37.960> you<00:02:38.410> add

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
there for about 10 minutes then you add

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.680 
there for about 10 minutes then you add
in<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:38.920> little<00:02:39.160> bit<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.640> extra<00:02:40.180> virgin<00:02:40.270> olive
