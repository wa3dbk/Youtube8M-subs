00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:10.597
 Welcome to the World of Warcraft quick course for the Combat Thief. 

00:00:10.597 --> 00:00:14.394
 In this video we will give you a quick overview 

00:00:14.394 --> 00:00:17.604
 on how to play a Combat Thief at level 90. 

00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:23.274
 All thieves have two primary resources: energy and combo points. 

00:00:23.274 --> 00:00:28.331
 The energy regenerates itself quickly, and is used to launch skills 

00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:32.588
 which in return provide combo points. Combo points accumulate on the target 

00:00:32.588 --> 00:00:35.671
 and can be exploited to activate powerful resolution moves. 

00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:40.298
 Before you start fighting, make sure you've activated your Deadly Poison. 

00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:45.889
 And remember that as you level up, this poison will be replaced by the Instant Poison. 

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:50.702
 Once in combat, use up most of your energy for two main abilities, 

00:00:50.702 --> 00:00:53.102
 the first of which is Assesto Funesto. 

00:00:53.102 --> 00:00:57.077
 Bad Assault inflicts several damage and gives combo points. 

00:00:57.077 --> 00:01:00.904
 You can also cast Detective Assault, which applies a penalty to the opponent, 

00:01:00.904 --> 00:01:04.809
 which enhances your resolutive moves, and also gives Assault Funesto a chance 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.556
 to generate an additional combo point. You should keep this penalty active 

00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:13.680
 all the time, throwing Revealing Assault whenever it's needed. 

00:01:14.622 --> 00:01:18.863
 Once you have reached 5 combo points there are several ways to make the most of them. 

00:01:18.863 --> 00:01:23.383
 Furious Slashes provides you with a benefit that in practice increases your attack speed, 

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:26.234
 then try to keep it active for as long as possible 

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:30.679
 Otherwise, you can consume your combo points with Sventramento, which inflicts heavy 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.916
 damage, or Life Recovery, which provides you with periodic treatment, 

00:01:33.916 --> 00:01:35.583
 saving you from death. 

00:01:35.583 --> 00:01:39.511
 there is obviously much more to know to optimize your Thief 

00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:41.831
 but this quick overview should direct you 

00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:43.856
 towards the right direction. 

00:01:43.856 --> 00:01:47.810
 Once you have mastered the basics, we advise you to read well 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.885
 well the grimoire, the talents the glyphs to learn more 

00:01:51.885 --> 00:01:54.244
 on other skills that we have not mentioned. 

00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:57.645
 Thanks for watching this video, see you on Draenor!
