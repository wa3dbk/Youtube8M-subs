earthquake<00:00:49.620> would<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.520> demolished<00:00:51.030> his

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
earthquake would have demolished his

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.310 
earthquake would have demolished his
shit<00:00:51.390> he<00:00:51.570> would've<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:51.840> putting<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.140> body

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.920 
shit he would've not putting that body
back<00:00:52.559> early<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.489> uh<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.879> guess<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.360> expected<00:00:54.809> him

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
back early but uh I guess I expected him

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.200 
back early but uh I guess I expected him
to<00:00:54.989> switch<00:00:55.320> out<00:00:55.640> which<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.789> why<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:56.940> went<00:00:57.149> for

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
to switch out which is why I went for

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.369 
to switch out which is why I went for
the<00:00:57.360> stealth<00:00:57.510> rocks<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:57.930> whatever<00:00:58.170> doesn't

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the stealth rocks but whatever doesn't

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.840 
the stealth rocks but whatever doesn't
even<00:00:58.500> matter<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.160> he<00:00:59.250> goes<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.520> u-turn

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
even matter so he goes for the u-turn

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.000 
even matter so he goes for the u-turn
brings<00:01:00.600> into<00:01:00.780> spiritomb<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.469> as<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.800> see

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
brings into spiritomb and as you can see

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.770 
brings into spiritomb and as you can see
this<00:01:02.250> earthquake<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.699> gonna<00:01:03.000> do<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> fuck<00:01:03.539> ton

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
this earthquake is gonna do a fuck ton

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.469 
this earthquake is gonna do a fuck ton
spirit<00:01:04.589> soon<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.890> very<00:01:05.129> bulky<00:01:05.400> pokemon<00:01:05.939> so

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
spirit soon was a very bulky pokemon so

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.570 
spirit soon was a very bulky pokemon so
the<00:01:06.990> fact<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.409> earthquake<00:01:07.619> does<00:01:07.920> 40%

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the fact that this earthquake does 40%

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.700 
the fact that this earthquake does 40%
is<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:09.090> surprising<00:01:09.600> because<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.290> donphan

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
is not surprising because this donphan

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.679 
is not surprising because this donphan
has<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> lot<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.130> attack<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:12.299> not<00:01:12.450> playing

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
has a lot of attack and it's not playing

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.840 
has a lot of attack and it's not playing
any<00:01:12.900> games<00:01:12.930> with<00:01:13.260> any<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.710> fucking<00:01:14.159> ghost

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
any games with any of fucking ghost

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.760 
any games with any of fucking ghost
monster<00:01:15.780> thingies<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.229> don't<00:01:16.500> even<00:01:16.560> know<00:01:16.710> if

the<00:01:16.860> hell<00:01:16.979> spear<00:01:17.250> tomb<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.670> anyways<00:01:18.509> I'm<00:01:18.659> gonna

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the hell spear tomb is anyways I'm gonna

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.210 
the hell spear tomb is anyways I'm gonna
go<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.990> my<00:01:19.049> end<00:01:19.259> before<00:01:19.380> abandoned<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:19.979> in

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
go to my end before abandoned because in

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.539 
go to my end before abandoned because in
before<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> band<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.210> before<00:01:21.479> band<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.920> um<00:01:23.130> I

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
before a band is in before band so um I

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.520 
before a band is in before band so um I
actually<00:01:24.390> predicted<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.960> will<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.200> us<00:01:25.290> there

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
actually predicted the will of us there

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.530 
actually predicted the will of us there
which<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.130> why<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.250> switched<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.700> my<00:01:26.850> Vulpix<00:01:27.330> and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
which is why I switched in my Vulpix and

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.420 
which is why I switched in my Vulpix and
well<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.170> doesn't<00:01:28.619> do<00:01:28.740> anything<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.070> Vulpix

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
well it doesn't do anything the Vulpix

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.859 
well it doesn't do anything the Vulpix
but<00:01:29.610> he<00:01:29.670> actually<00:01:29.790> has<00:01:30.030> toxic<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.540> his<00:01:30.630> spirit

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
but he actually has toxic on his spirit

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.090 
but he actually has toxic on his spirit
tomb<00:01:30.990> which<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.229> kind<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.439> weird<00:01:31.619> never<00:01:31.860> really

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
tomb which is kind of weird never really

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.069 
tomb which is kind of weird never really
see<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.460> often<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:33.329> I'm<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.780> gonna<00:01:33.869> stay

Velvets at this point is really death

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.710 
Velvets at this point is really death
funny<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.030> Vulpix<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> very<00:01:39.420> weak

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
funny because Vulpix is a very weak

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.380 
funny because Vulpix is a very weak

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
but because as you saw earlier well I

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.740 
but because as you saw earlier well I
get<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> crit<00:02:21.000> there<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.390> doesn't<00:02:21.630> matter

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
get a crit there but that doesn't matter

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.990 
get a crit there but that doesn't matter
but<00:02:22.250> earthquake<00:02:23.250> there's<00:02:23.430> more<00:02:23.640> than<00:02:23.790> forty

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
but earthquake there's more than forty

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.280 
but earthquake there's more than forty
percent<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.510> he<00:02:24.660> had<00:02:24.750> less<00:02:24.930> than<00:02:24.959> forty

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
percent and he had less than forty

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.500 
percent and he had less than forty
percent<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:25.770> that's<00:02:26.069> an<00:02:26.250> easy<00:02:26.370> ko<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:27.360> he's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
percent so that's an easy ko so he's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.270 
percent so that's an easy ko so he's
gonna<00:02:27.600> go<00:02:27.750> up<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> sharp<00:02:28.260> cock<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.800> don't<00:02:29.040> I
