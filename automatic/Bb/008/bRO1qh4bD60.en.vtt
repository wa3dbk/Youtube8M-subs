spanner would be more proof in this case

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.759 
spanner would be more proof in this case
but<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> can't<00:00:26.550> find<00:00:26.820> mine<00:00:27.029> piece<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.019> paper<00:00:28.199> to

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
measure the slackness of the chain

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.069 
measure the slackness of the chain
they<00:00:30.420> take<00:00:30.630> measure<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.410> make<00:00:31.500> your<00:00:31.679> markings

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.450 

then<00:01:57.880> we<00:01:58.240> need<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.539> tie<00:01:58.750> in<00:01:58.929> the<00:02:00.539> first<00:02:01.539> ball

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
then we need to tie in the first ball

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.370 
then we need to tie in the first ball
take<00:02:03.460> your<00:02:03.609> spanner<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.659> as<00:02:04.840> you<00:02:04.960> tighten<00:02:05.200> it

where where to change as you tighten

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.640 
where where to change as you tighten
they<00:02:12.879> should<00:02:13.060> pull<00:02:13.299> the<00:02:13.870> way<00:02:14.019> wheel<00:02:14.260> benek

no tied up way too tight on this case
so<00:03:05.120> I'm<00:03:05.810> do<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.200> by<00:03:06.350> two<00:03:06.680> turns<00:03:06.980> of<00:03:07.070> each<00:03:07.190> side

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.130 

okay<00:03:17.950> right<00:03:18.950> I've<00:03:19.190> adjusted<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:20.660> nuts<00:03:20.930> on

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
okay right I've adjusted the nuts on

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.030 
okay right I've adjusted the nuts on
either<00:03:21.290> side<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.800> bolts<00:03:22.250> here<00:03:22.460> on<00:03:22.670> both<00:03:23.360> sides

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
either side the bolts here on both sides

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.130 
either side the bolts here on both sides
make<00:03:25.040> sure<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.490> wheel<00:03:25.700> is<00:03:26.000> still<00:03:26.330> level<00:03:31.090> and

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
make sure the wheel is still level and

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.780 
make sure the wheel is still level and
our<00:03:33.140> finger<00:03:33.680> tightened<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.400> lock<00:03:34.580> nuts

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
our finger tightened the lock nuts

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.240 
our finger tightened the lock nuts
afterwards<00:03:35.300> I<00:03:38.770> think<00:03:39.770> it's<00:03:39.860> our<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.130> lock

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
afterwards I think it's our the lock

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.500 
afterwards I think it's our the lock
nuts<00:03:40.490> and<00:03:41.080> measured<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.200> distance<00:03:42.590> between

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
nuts and measured the distance between

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.600 
nuts and measured the distance between
the<00:03:44.510> tire<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:45.140> frame<00:03:45.560> swing<00:03:47.230> make<00:03:48.230> sure

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
the tire and the frame swing make sure

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.700 
the tire and the frame swing make sure
the<00:03:49.610> wheel<00:03:49.880> is<00:03:50.150> Center<00:03:51.080> to<00:03:51.200> make<00:03:51.320> sure<00:03:51.440> hasn't

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
the wheel is Center to make sure hasn't

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.450 
the wheel is Center to make sure hasn't
pulled<00:03:51.830> off<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.100> one<00:03:52.220> side

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
pulled off to one side

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.890 
pulled off to one side
exactly<00:03:52.880> proof<00:03:53.060> defective<00:03:53.360> brakes<00:03:53.600> the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
exactly proof defective brakes the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.520 
exactly proof defective brakes the
operation<00:03:54.380> and<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:55.160> change<00:03:55.400> in<00:03:55.610> sprockets

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
operation and the change in sprockets

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.640 
operation and the change in sprockets
okay<00:03:57.530> now<00:03:57.740> I<00:03:58.010> will<00:03:58.250> simply<00:03:59.230> tighten<00:04:00.230> up<00:04:00.320> all

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
okay now I will simply tighten up all

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.780 
okay now I will simply tighten up all
bolts<00:04:01.070> and<00:04:01.460> then<00:04:01.940> take<00:04:02.210> it<00:04:02.330> for<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.480> wish<00:04:03.790> take
