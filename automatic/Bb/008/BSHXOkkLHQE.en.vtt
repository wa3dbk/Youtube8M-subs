00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.059 
Intelli match instructional demo here we
have<00:00:06.120> two<00:00:06.600> times<00:00:06.899> we<00:00:07.290> have<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.680> intellimouse

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
have two times we have the intellimouse

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.209 
have two times we have the intellimouse
-<00:00:08.700> -<00:00:09.090> which<00:00:09.630> can<00:00:09.900> be<00:00:10.019> used<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.440> pair<00:00:10.800> two

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
- - which can be used to pair two

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.390 
- - which can be used to pair two
servers<00:00:11.610> together<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.240> groups<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.900> two

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
servers together in groups of two

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.120 
servers together in groups of two
commonly<00:00:14.400> used<00:00:14.700> for<00:00:15.089> elevator<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.320> then<00:00:16.890> here

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
commonly used for elevator and then here

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.609 
commonly used for elevator and then here
we<00:00:17.250> have<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.150> telling<00:00:18.539> match<00:00:18.690> one<00:00:19.199> fall

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
we have the in telling match one fall

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.980 
we have the in telling match one fall
which<00:00:20.039> can<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.279> used<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.730> group<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:21.539> group<00:00:21.570> of

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
which can be used to group one group of

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.529 
which can be used to group one group of
four<00:00:22.439> servers<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.880> will<00:00:24.000> be<00:00:24.090> used<00:00:24.330> on

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
four servers so this will be used on

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.529 
four servers so this will be used on
your<00:00:24.600> rudder<00:00:25.019> or<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:26.220> large<00:00:26.760> scale<00:00:27.060> aileron

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539

your rudder or on a large scale aileron
okay<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:30.599> here<00:00:30.929> we're<00:00:31.050> talking<00:00:31.080> about<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.650> in

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
okay so here we're talking about the in

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.299 
okay so here we're talking about the in
telling<00:00:32.430> match<00:00:32.579> -<00:00:33.030> -<00:00:33.329> which<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.780> used<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.320> group

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
telling match - - which is used to group

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.700 
telling match - - which is used to group
-<00:00:35.579> ah<00:00:35.610> -<00:00:35.760> two<00:00:36.030> servers<00:00:36.450> together<00:00:36.660> now<00:00:37.230> starting

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
- ah - two servers together now starting

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.500 
- ah - two servers together now starting
from<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> bottom<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.700> your<00:00:38.879> app<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.329> a

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
from the bottom you have your app with a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.610 
from the bottom you have your app with a
one<00:00:39.809> output<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.829> two<00:00:41.059> output<00:00:42.059> B<00:00:42.329> 1<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.840> output<00:00:43.140> B

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
one output a two output B 1 and output B

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.520 
one output a two output B 1 and output B
-<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.430> put<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.030> 1<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> output<00:00:45.809> V<00:00:46.020> 1<00:00:46.260> V<00:00:46.500> 2

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
- so I put a 1 in the output V 1 V 2

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.459 
- so I put a 1 in the output V 1 V 2
master<00:00:47.340> servos<00:00:47.789> one<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.480> each<00:00:48.600> side<00:00:48.899> then

we<00:01:59.400> have<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.670> sit<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.210> maximum<00:02:01.020> throw<00:02:01.290> rates

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
we have to sit the maximum throw rates

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:17.740 
we have to sit the maximum throw rates
for<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.890> server

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.860 

now<00:02:18.750> once<00:02:18.990> this<00:02:19.140> has<00:02:19.290> been<00:02:19.320> done<00:02:19.500> get<00:02:20.340> your

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
now once this has been done get your

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.110 
now once this has been done get your
slave<00:02:21.870> server<00:02:22.230> for<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.710> side<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:23.760> plug

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
slave server for that side and just plug

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.790 
slave server for that side and just plug
it<00:02:24.270> into<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.540> one<00:02:24.690> underneath<00:02:25.080> which<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
it into the one underneath which is the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.000 
it into the one underneath which is the
slave<00:02:26.580> outside<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.380> hear<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> server's

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
slave outside you can hear the server's

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.030 
slave outside you can hear the server's
binding<00:02:30.260> because<00:02:31.260> they're<00:02:31.410> not<00:02:31.560> matched<00:02:31.770> up

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
binding because they're not matched up

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.030 
binding because they're not matched up
yet<00:02:32.250> now<00:02:32.850> we<00:02:32.910> get<00:02:33.300> an<00:02:33.510> arming<00:02:33.960> plug<00:02:34.230> we<00:02:34.650> plug<00:02:34.920> it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
yet now we get an arming plug we plug it

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.950 
yet now we get an arming plug we plug it
into<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.430> arming<00:02:36.200> battery<00:02:37.200> at<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.380> top<00:02:40.250> and

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
into the arming battery at the top and

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.380 
into the arming battery at the top and
then<00:02:45.740> we<00:02:46.740> just<00:02:46.920> hit<00:02:47.070> this<00:02:47.220> simple<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.790> button

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
then we just hit this simple a button

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.150 
then we just hit this simple a button
once<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.140> can<00:02:49.290> see<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.500> blue<00:02:49.740> LED<00:02:52.100> now<00:02:53.100> the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
once you can see a blue LED now the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.040 
once you can see a blue LED now the
elevator<00:02:53.700> will<00:02:53.940> go<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.120> its<00:02:54.330> maximum<00:02:54.660> throw

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
elevator will go to its maximum throw

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.160 
elevator will go to its maximum throw
range<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:57.240> can<00:02:57.360> hear<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.780> servos

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
range and you can hear the servos

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.470 
range and you can hear the servos
binding<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.800> then<00:02:58.860> stopping<00:02:59.190> so<00:03:00.150> that's<00:03:00.330> the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
binding and then stopping so that's the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.030 
binding and then stopping so that's the
master<00:03:00.900> server<00:03:01.080> setting<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.710> each<00:03:01.980> degree<00:03:04.040> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
master server setting in each degree and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.800 
master server setting in each degree and
then<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.250> slave<00:03:05.550> server<00:03:06.030> being<00:03:06.270> matched<00:03:06.510> to

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
then the slave server being matched to

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.310 
then the slave server being matched to
it<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:08.010> as<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:08.160> can<00:03:08.430> hear<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:09.780> buzz<00:03:09.990> starts

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
it and as you can hear the buzz starts

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.130 
it and as you can hear the buzz starts
and<00:03:10.770> then<00:03:11.130> for<00:03:11.340> each<00:03:11.460> range<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.360> movement<00:03:12.780> it

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
and then for each range of movement it

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.660 
and then for each range of movement it
stops

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.839 

perfect<00:03:17.150> matching<00:03:17.480> between<00:03:17.810> servers<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:19.730> will

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
perfect matching between servers it will

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.640 
perfect matching between servers it will
continue<00:03:20.240> to<00:03:20.360> do<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:20.660> through<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.319> entire

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
continue to do this through the entire

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.650 
continue to do this through the entire
range<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.130> motion<00:03:22.190> support<00:03:23.030> beam<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.599> you

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
range of motion support beam that you

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:31.929 
range of motion support beam that you
set<00:03:24.020> to<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.290> other

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.839 

and<00:03:32.939> as<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.209> may<00:03:33.359> have<00:03:33.390> noticed<00:03:34.430> not<00:03:35.430> all<00:03:35.609> the

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
and as you may have noticed not all the

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.020 
and as you may have noticed not all the
setting<00:03:36.299> time<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.230> same<00:03:37.579> that's<00:03:38.579> because

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
setting time is the same that's because

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.309 
setting time is the same that's because
the<00:03:39.719> servers<00:03:40.109> are<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:40.349> same<00:03:41.689> if<00:03:42.689> it<00:03:42.930> finds<00:03:43.170> a

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
the servers are the same if it finds a

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.979 
the servers are the same if it finds a
perfect<00:03:43.709> point<00:03:43.890> quicker<00:03:44.819> then<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.629> will<00:03:45.780> set

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
perfect point quicker then it will set

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.899 
perfect point quicker then it will set
it<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.109> that<00:03:46.319> point<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.859> there'll<00:03:47.430> be<00:03:47.459> no<00:03:47.639> us

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
it to that point and there'll be no us

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.089 
it to that point and there'll be no us
if<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:48.629> takes<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.870> little<00:03:49.019> bit<00:03:49.170> longer<00:03:49.379> it<00:03:49.980> will

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
if it takes a little bit longer it will

00:03:50.099 --> 00:04:15.650 
if it takes a little bit longer it will
still<00:03:50.310> find<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.609> perfect<00:03:50.849> point

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.449 

and<00:04:15.990> we're<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:16.530> reaching<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.070> end<00:04:17.160> event

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
and we're just reaching the end event

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:29.850 
and we're just reaching the end event
since<00:04:18.060> Rose

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.500 

now<00:04:30.430> will<00:04:30.670> travel<00:04:30.910> through<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.210> full<00:04:31.480> range

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
now will travel through the full range

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.080 
now will travel through the full range
of<00:04:31.780> motion

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
of motion

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.540 
of motion
back<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.080> Center<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.590> then<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.220> elevator

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
back to Center and then the elevator

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:43.550 
back to Center and then the elevator
will<00:04:40.550> now<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.610> matching<00:04:42.210> sequences<00:04:42.870> finished

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
will now the matching sequences finished

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.940 
will now the matching sequences finished
all<00:04:43.980> we<00:04:44.160> have<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.430> do<00:04:44.580> is<00:04:45.200> take<00:04:46.200> out<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.440> arming

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
all we have to do is take out the arming

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.700 
all we have to do is take out the arming
plug<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.540> cycle<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.630> power<00:04:48.870> now<00:04:49.350> this<00:04:49.530> can<00:04:49.680> be

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
plug and cycle the power now this can be

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.250 
plug and cycle the power now this can be
done<00:04:49.830> through<00:04:50.250> your<00:04:50.460> master<00:04:50.880> switch<00:04:51.150> but<00:04:51.870> for

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
done through your master switch but for

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.159 
done through your master switch but for
easy<00:04:52.470> purpose<00:04:53.100> I'm<00:04:53.340> just<00:04:53.580> going<00:04:53.730> to<00:04:53.790> do<00:04:53.910> this

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
easy purpose I'm just going to do this

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.700 
easy purpose I'm just going to do this
by<00:04:55.169> pulling<00:04:55.590> out<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:56.310> input<00:04:56.639> one<00:04:56.820> switch<00:04:57.150> and

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
by pulling out the input one switch and

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.340 
by pulling out the input one switch and
plugging<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:58.770> back<00:04:58.950> here<00:04:59.190> as<00:04:59.930> you<00:05:00.930> can<00:05:01.080> hear

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
plugging it back here as you can hear

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.730 
plugging it back here as you can hear
the<00:05:01.590> servos<00:05:01.980> are<00:05:02.130> now<00:05:02.280> on<00:05:02.490> I<00:05:03.889> stand<00:05:04.889> them<00:05:05.070> up

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
the servos are now on I stand them up

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.409 
the servos are now on I stand them up
there<00:05:07.740> is<00:05:07.830> a<00:05:07.860> very<00:05:08.100> minimal<00:05:08.520> buzz<00:05:08.760> and<00:05:09.300> I'll

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
there is a very minimal buzz and I'll

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.030 
there is a very minimal buzz and I'll
just<00:05:09.570> show<00:05:09.750> you<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:09.960> range<00:05:10.260> of<00:05:10.440> motion<00:05:10.620> with<00:05:11.010> the

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
just show you a range of motion with the
