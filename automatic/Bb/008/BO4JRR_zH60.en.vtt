okay I'm going to show you guys how the
cross<00:00:02.429> sea<00:00:02.639> squirt<00:00:02.939> works<00:00:03.179> in<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.480> horizontal

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
cross sea squirt works in a horizontal

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.050 
cross sea squirt works in a horizontal
fashion<00:00:04.310> so<00:00:05.310> I'm<00:00:05.430> going<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.580> do<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.850> quick

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
mains up I've got my field tees in you

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.700 
mains up I've got my field tees in you
will<00:00:14.400> notice<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.599> do<00:00:15.809> have<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> couple<00:00:16.440> of

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
will notice that I do have a couple of

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.519 
will notice that I do have a couple of
tees<00:00:16.949> clamped<00:00:17.580> off<00:00:17.730> right<00:00:18.000> now<00:00:18.289> those<00:00:19.289> are

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
tees clamped off right now those are

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.490 
tees clamped off right now those are
clamped<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.699> line<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.289> I'm<00:00:22.380> going

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
clamped to the line and what I'm going

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.460 
clamped to the line and what I'm going
to<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.949> show<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.779> just<00:00:24.779> how<00:00:24.900> effective<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
to do is show you just how effective the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.389 
to do is show you just how effective the
Cross<00:00:25.680> t-square<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.220> is

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.240 

so<00:00:33.399> as<00:00:33.460> you<00:00:33.579> can<00:00:33.700> see<00:00:33.760> got<00:00:34.660> my<00:00:34.870> gum<00:00:35.500> cut<00:00:35.800> and

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
so as you can see got my gum cut and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.510 
so as you can see got my gum cut and
I've<00:00:36.370> had<00:00:36.520> them<00:00:36.610> sitting<00:00:36.850> up<00:00:37.059> here<00:00:37.270> I<00:00:38.520> haven't

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
I've had them sitting up here I haven't

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.369 
I've had them sitting up here I haven't
really<00:00:39.790> flying<00:00:40.300> these<00:00:40.600> things<00:00:40.660> up<00:00:41.079> I<00:00:41.199> just

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
really flying these things up I just

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.410 
really flying these things up I just
have<00:00:41.590> them<00:00:41.800> holding<00:00:42.579> the<00:00:42.699> main<00:00:42.879> to<00:00:43.149> the<00:00:43.269> line

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
have them holding the main to the line

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.869 
have them holding the main to the line
so<00:00:43.899> what<00:00:44.079> I'm<00:00:44.140> going<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.320> do<00:00:44.440> now<00:00:47.100> simply<00:00:48.100> snap

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
so what I'm going to do now simply snap

00:00:48.879 --> 00:01:06.660 
so what I'm going to do now simply snap
the<00:00:48.909> cross<00:00:49.239> V<00:00:49.480> squared

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.040 

that's<00:01:07.670> what<00:01:07.880> we<00:01:08.000> can<00:01:08.120> grab<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.480> last<00:01:08.660> one

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.810 

we'll<00:01:15.050> take<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.320> tool<00:01:15.500> off<00:01:18.310> okay<00:01:19.310> but<00:01:19.520> since<00:01:19.729> I

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
we'll take the tool off okay but since I

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.430 
we'll take the tool off okay but since I
spent<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.150> first<00:01:20.390> since<00:01:20.720> I<00:01:20.840> set<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.229> first

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
spent the first since I set the first

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.350 
spent the first since I set the first
two<00:01:21.680> tees<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.310> line<00:01:22.520> these<00:01:22.910> other<00:01:23.120> ones

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
two tees to the line these other ones

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.210 
two tees to the line these other ones
line<00:01:23.570> up<00:01:23.720> to<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.960> line<00:01:24.110> automatically<00:01:24.800> so<00:01:25.070> now

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
line up to the line automatically so now

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.650 
line up to the line automatically so now
what<00:01:25.430> I<00:01:25.460> want<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.729> do<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.990> go<00:01:27.260> back<00:01:27.290> to<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:29.450> ones

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
what I want to do is go back to the ones

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.870 
what I want to do is go back to the ones
that<00:01:29.720> were<00:01:29.900> originally<00:01:30.320> class<00:01:30.650> to<00:01:31.580> be<00:01:31.729> this

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
that were originally class to be this

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.270 
that were originally class to be this

did<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:34.430> see<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.990> can<00:01:36.140> see<00:01:36.290> how<00:01:36.410> that<00:01:36.590> pulled

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
did you see you can see how that pulled

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.940 
did you see you can see how that pulled
that<00:01:37.009> right<00:01:37.160> over<00:01:37.759> where<00:01:37.910> it<00:01:38.030> needs<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.390> go<00:01:38.950> and

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
that right over where it needs to go and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.240 
that right over where it needs to go and
then<00:01:40.190> I'll<00:01:40.340> come<00:01:40.490> over<00:01:40.729> here<00:01:40.910> is<00:01:41.030> again<00:01:41.270> one

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
then I'll come over here is again one

anything<00:01:52.040> coming<00:01:52.430> out<00:01:52.550> here<00:01:52.700> want<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:52.850> make

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
anything coming out here want to make

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.969 
anything coming out here want to make
sure<00:01:53.030> that<00:01:53.360> I've<00:01:53.509> got<00:01:53.540> this<00:01:53.869> last<00:01:54.200> what<00:01:54.619> set<00:01:54.860> in

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
sure that I've got this last what set in

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.950 
sure that I've got this last what set in
to<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.160> line<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:56.330> boom<00:01:58.240> as<00:01:59.240> you<00:01:59.360> can<00:01:59.540> see<00:01:59.750> one

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
to the line and boom as you can see one

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.850 
to the line and boom as you can see one

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
two three four five perimeter key set in

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.950 
two three four five perimeter key set in
a<00:02:03.950> matter<00:02:04.160> of<00:02:04.280> about<00:02:04.369> a<00:02:04.580> minute<00:02:04.940> minute<00:02:05.570> a<00:02:05.780> few

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
a matter of about a minute minute a few

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.230 
a matter of about a minute minute a few
seconds<00:02:06.410> didn't<00:02:07.340> pull<00:02:07.490> my<00:02:07.580> tape<00:02:07.789> at<00:02:07.970> once

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
seconds didn't pull my tape at once

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.359 
seconds didn't pull my tape at once
that's<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.410> benefit<00:02:09.740> of<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:09.950> cross<00:02:10.160> T

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
that's the benefit of the cross T

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.870 
that's the benefit of the cross T
squared<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.890> next<00:02:12.890> we're<00:02:13.040> going<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.220> go<00:02:13.400> on<00:02:13.550> and

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
squared so next we're going to go on and

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.940 
squared so next we're going to go on and
show<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.090> how<00:02:14.300> this<00:02:14.480> works<00:02:14.709> vertically<00:02:15.709> for

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
show you how this works vertically for

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.690 
show you how this works vertically for
doing<00:02:16.190> soffit<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:16.819> let<00:02:17.060> me<00:02:17.120> get<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.390> set<00:02:17.660> up
