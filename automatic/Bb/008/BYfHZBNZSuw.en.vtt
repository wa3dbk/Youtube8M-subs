00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.690
 tightly as if holding a bag shape 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.150

 Of course I need to sew on the main 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.410
 frame 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:41.720

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:21.000
 I will walk along small stitches 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.370
 of my reason for not 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.680
 shifted 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.680

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.670
 walk along the perimeter can be done 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.960
 just a point can be fixed 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.180
 walk around the perimeter 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:02.709
 whoever you want so now I'm all this 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.700

 here is our bag is almost ready 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:17.510

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:20.380
 I will tell you what to do next 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.790
 in order to get more 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.060
 complete version first of all i 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:30.290
 bound the cover I wanted to do 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:33.580
 lid and tied it to one of 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:37.280

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.760
 bag and I'm here specifically for me 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.770
 sewed on just for a minute so you 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:52.790
 seen between the canvas bag and the lining 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.190
 and I inserted the lock and sewed them and so 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.979
 the way they sewed in the cap 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:02.169
