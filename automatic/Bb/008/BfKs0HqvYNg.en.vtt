00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
go to one of the 14 sorry 18 tunngle

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.959 
go to one of the 14 sorry 18 tunngle
room<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.770> an<00:00:55.920> example<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> picture

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
room so this is an example of a picture

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.000 
room so this is an example of a picture
I<00:00:57.120> took<00:00:57.329> earlier<00:00:57.690> today<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.140> there<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.620> 18

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
I took earlier today and there was 18

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.200 
I took earlier today and there was 18
networks<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.430> think<00:00:59.579> there's<00:00:59.730> more<00:00:59.820> networks

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
networks I think there's more networks

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.849 
networks I think there's more networks
actually<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.780> at<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.559> point<00:01:01.800> in

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
actually but at the at that point in

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.090 
actually but at the at that point in
time<00:01:01.890> there<00:01:02.160> were<00:01:02.309> over<00:01:02.930> 2,000<00:01:03.930> 285<00:01:04.860> players

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
time there were over 2,000 285 players

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.340 
time there were over 2,000 285 players
so<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.369> game<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.689> ridiculously<00:01:06.689> hot<00:01:07.020> right

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
so this game is ridiculously hot right

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.280 
so this game is ridiculously hot right
now<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.220> tunngle<00:01:08.580> program<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.260> I

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
now in the tunngle program so so what I

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.350 
now in the tunngle program so so what I
did<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.189> left<00:01:11.369> hand<00:01:11.549> side<00:01:11.790> here<00:01:12.090> you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
did is on the left hand side here you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.300 
did is on the left hand side here you
need<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.780> download<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.380> install<00:01:13.409> smart<00:01:14.070> steam

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
need to download and install smart steam

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.249 
need to download and install smart steam
basically<00:01:14.850> unzip<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.780> smart<00:01:16.020> steam

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
basically unzip the smart steam

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.020 
basically unzip the smart steam
executables<00:01:17.009> put<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.700> your<00:01:17.729> steam

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
executables put that in your steam

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.730 
executables put that in your steam
folder<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.570> run<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.020> smart<00:01:19.350> steam<00:01:19.560> is

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
folder and run it so smart steam is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.710 
folder and run it so smart steam is
running<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> background<00:01:20.670> which<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> way

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
running in the background which is a way

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.950 
running in the background which is a way
to<00:01:21.780> make<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.290> game<00:01:22.500> work<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.220> land<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.700> line

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
to make this game work the land on line

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.210 
to make this game work the land on line
indirectly<00:01:24.960> now<00:01:25.229> next<00:01:25.710> thing<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.040> need<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.719 
that's pretty easy right and then you
sit<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.409> them<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> tunngle<00:01:44.220> room<00:01:44.399> right

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
sit in them in the tunngle room right

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.520 
sit in them in the tunngle room right
and<00:01:45.600> let's<00:01:45.780> assume<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.350> already

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
and let's assume that you already

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.620 
and let's assume that you already
installed<00:01:47.460> Update<00:01:47.820> 3<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.149> your<00:01:48.270> game<00:01:48.479> is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
installed Update 3 so your game is

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.030 
installed Update 3 so your game is
updated<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.200> latest<00:01:49.259> version<00:01:49.530> whatever

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
updated to the latest version whatever

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.410 
updated to the latest version whatever
that's<00:01:50.250> going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:50.670> now<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.210> you're<00:01:51.329> going

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
that's going to be now if you're going

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.969 
that's going to be now if you're going
to<00:01:51.540> host<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.869> game<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.200> also<00:01:52.380> helps<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> make
