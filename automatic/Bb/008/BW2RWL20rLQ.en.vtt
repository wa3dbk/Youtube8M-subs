00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
that i show you how to do it in my last

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.550 
that i show you how to do it in my last
video<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.640> i<00:00:18.510> didn't<00:00:18.779> do<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.960> other<00:00:19.050> side<00:00:19.289> yet

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
video and i didn't do the other side yet

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.480 
video and i didn't do the other side yet
so<00:00:20.150> yeah<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.350> how<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.710> looks<00:00:22.769> if<00:00:23.369> you

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
so yeah so this is how it looks if you

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.790 
so yeah so this is how it looks if you
can<00:00:23.640> see<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.090> it's<00:00:24.810> harder<00:00:25.230> for<00:00:25.260> me<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.529> do<00:00:25.710> it

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
can see this it's harder for me to do it

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.320 
can see this it's harder for me to do it
on<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.039> side<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.310> that's<00:00:26.730> why<00:00:26.849> I'd<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.060> aside

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
on this side so that's why I'd it aside

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.519 
on this side so that's why I'd it aside
first<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:27.960> doesn't<00:00:28.140> look<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.260> great

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
first so it doesn't look that great

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.529 
first so it doesn't look that great
those<00:00:29.429> tight<00:00:29.670> turns<00:00:29.789> out<00:00:30.000> way<00:00:30.090> better<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.510> I

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
those tight turns out way better so I

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.049 
those tight turns out way better so I
just<00:00:30.720> started<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.080> off<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.560> haven't<00:00:31.859> even

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
just started this off and haven't even

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.600 
just started this off and haven't even
usually<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.120> separate<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.719> little<00:00:33.840> more<00:00:33.960> I

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
usually I separate this a little more I

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.520 
usually I separate this a little more I
did<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> French<00:00:36.090> braid<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.719> my<00:00:36.840> bangs<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.320> then

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
did a French braid on my bangs and then

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.900 
did a French braid on my bangs and then
I<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.860> turned<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.160> into<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.370> waterfall<00:00:38.790> braid

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.900 
have some hair dropping down right here
so<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.260> was<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.380> little<00:04:19.530> better<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:20.519> I<00:04:20.760> make

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
so it was a little better and I make

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
so it was a little better and I make
this<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.090> little<00:04:21.239> looser<00:04:23.479> but<00:04:24.479> yeah<00:04:24.600> it's<00:04:24.810> not

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
this a little looser but yeah it's not

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.490 
this a little looser but yeah it's not
perfect<00:04:25.350> but<00:04:26.389> it<00:04:27.389> looks<00:04:27.690> really<00:04:27.840> cool<00:04:28.200> and

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
perfect but it looks really cool and

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.840 
perfect but it looks really cool and
once<00:04:28.740> you<00:04:28.860> master<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.430> time<00:04:29.610> definitely

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
once you master a time definitely

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.030 
once you master a time definitely
haven't<00:04:30.240> mastered<00:04:30.630> it<00:04:30.750> yet<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:31.169> bet<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:31.830> will<00:04:31.889> be

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
haven't mastered it yet I bet it will be

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.450 
haven't mastered it yet I bet it will be
even<00:04:32.130> better<00:04:32.960> so<00:04:33.960> that's<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.919> waterfall
