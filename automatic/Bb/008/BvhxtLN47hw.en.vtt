 massage seats driving assistance systems great 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:14.260
 Motors agilis curve handling da thinks 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.220
 yes yes to upper class sedans than 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.040
 a truck 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.530
 but at Mercedes, driving dynamics are part of it 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.260
 and comfort also in the commercial vehicles 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:26.470
 after ten years of planning and development 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.140
 and 20 million test kilometers allowed 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.720
 the new actros finally official 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.760
 on the road can be between four 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.110
 body styles are chosen 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.329
 from classical to giga space the seat is 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.250
 naturally air-suspended endless 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.130
 adjustable and has on request one 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.079
 massage function the steering column is per 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.989
 foot pressure individually adjustable 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.520
 All instruments are clearly arranged 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.829
 arranged and a variety of 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.090
 Storage compartments provide space for the things 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.079
 of everyday life 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.640
 there are more uncomfortable jobs 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.699
 standard 12 8 liter 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.670
 six-cylinder diesel makes 421 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.709
 ps and meets the euro from 2014 onwards 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.240
 6 norm 

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:12.840
 this little part is not here 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.550
 Tank but the exhaust of the rain 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.050
 standing next to the base motorization 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:23.110
 three more engines with 450 480 and 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.890
 510 ps available with a maximum 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.640
 torque between 2100 and 2500 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.729
 newton meters 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.310
 the twelve gear automatic powershift is 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.050
 as standard but who likes the gears 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.190
 still comfortable by switch on 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.580
 Steering wheel insert and consumption 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.470
 in a record drive over 10,000 km 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.180
 the actros reached 25 tons 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.600
 load an average consumption 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.680
 of 25 liters so just 1 liter 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.990
 per ton charge under ideal conditions 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.850
 the standard fleetboard system should 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.340
 help in daily operations 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.780
 Consumption at least 5 to 15 percent 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.330
 to be able to lower 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.610
 Reducing fuel consumption at the truck means 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.500
 to reduce the driving resistance and 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.330
 to increase the efficiency of the power in it 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.770
 we have completely new engine in the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.820
 vehicle we have the aerodynamics 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.350
 we have improved the rolling resistance 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.360
 have improved a 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.270
 exhaust aftertreatment develops the in 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.130
 the balance with the internal combustion engine 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.110
 can provide these consumption values 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.690
 now a liter car is probably like that 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.360
 derived that we say if we the 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.950
 payload would be transferred to a car 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.510
 or if you put that in relation 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.030
 then a liter would be consumed 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.950
 come out the actros has so much 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.630
 ps like a sports car is natural 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.820
 not so light-footed 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.130
 Nevertheless, he lets himself through unerringly 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.680
 the pylons direct and mediate 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.760
 always load the feeling under everything 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.790
 to have control 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.239
 rock yourself up on the sinus wave 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.150
 Failure during the passage strong 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.340
 Motor on the country road at 850 um 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.310
 torque can be whispered to yourself 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.900
 the driving assistance systems are in perfect peace 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.060
 be tried 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.280
 lane assistant distance warden and the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.120
 onboard computer with its infinitely many 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.860
 Information leaves nothing to be desired 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.959
 however, with all this comfort and 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.310
 the electronic helper one 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.400
 completely lost 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.680
 the trucker romance is over with it 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.260
 the king of the road feeling is possible 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.510
 tough so the truck so fast and 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.910
 consumes as cheaply as possible from one 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.980
 place to move to another and there 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.290
 the driver degenerates to simple 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.110
 machine operator even if the machine 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.570
 that costs as much as a nice one 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.600
 a family house namely at least 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.600
 100,000 euros 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.410
 the new actros 40 like a normal car 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.180
 if there were not the dimensions the 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.160
 Parking in downtown something 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.590
 make it difficult for the convenience 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.180
 the driver was done a lot around 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.650
 the workplace as attractive as 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.440
 possible for the industry 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.150
 As you know, he's looking for new blood and what has 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.040
 the entrepreneur of the new acquisition 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.170
 clearly a much smaller one 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.250
 consumption compared to the previous model 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.290
 and various new systems the driver 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.020
 to achieve more economy so 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.550
 for example the fleet board system in 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.550
 this sense always good ride
