00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.170
 always difficult exhibitions cinema 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.159
 one 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.159
 they achieved one 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.300
 I think that he 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.079
 the entrepreneurial spirit is fundamental 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.640
 is always thinking about where new ideas can come out deep as they create 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.130
 new projects 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.510
 the entrepreneur spirit I think they go beyond 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.500
 what we do is manufacture pairs for climbing 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.200
 on the walls peace digs we call ourselves climbing walls 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.730
 they are not places where people who like the mountain 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.790
 the joust to the adventure to him 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.910
 the mountaineering Thursday was to deliver him on days in which to approach the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.910
 mountains natural walls 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.810
 in the year 1992 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.900
 the one that three climbing friends 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.290
 well, say in ee 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.190
 build a wall to climb 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.400
 to be able to train on winter days 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.130
 and from there 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.590
 I would have founded a national 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.590
 which then began to get calls then from lion 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.360
 I got up from Catalonia 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.210
 these three people who start with the project 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.420
 they find that with whom they have a company in their hands I do not know 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.910
 what happened what the passion for climbing transformed passion 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.580
 for doing business 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.990
 for creating jobs or for growing by building a project 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.990
 according to the principles a very small office 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.020
 with a telephone line 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.020
 exercise the duties of secretary and accountant 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 to do all the paperwork with telephone 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.759
 I even pass on calls to myself is not to say that I was calling a client 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.730
 but 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.880
 I tried after I saw a structure behind the company so that 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.720
 bet for it the difficulties I think 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.389
 the greatest assets 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.499
 at the beginning he 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.510
 Of course they are training or if you do not have a preparation 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.949
 the most always learns also the mayor 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.359
 a concert mistakes of terror not 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.599
 and then I think that to start a business project we need 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.919
 financing 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:27.119
 and of course with 23 years and shorts it is very difficult to get it 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.789
 maybe one of the satisfactions 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.869
 that I have been filled with the most is to create jobs ibercaja 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:34.129
 workers 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.199
 same thing 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.249
 we are very rewarding 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:40.389
 I think 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.969
 that the recipe to succeed in the world in the work tables 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.169
 there are no more ingredients 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:48.109
 and 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.629
 I have read and heard I have been told that you have to be lucky that there is a good idea 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.009
 everything influences but of course there is always a common denominator and it is another 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.569
 I'm always sad to hear the tics
