people know are pretty rough there was
Hardy<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.289> these<00:01:50.410> that<00:01:50.649> are<00:01:50.740> straight<00:01:51.069> I<00:01:51.310> had

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
Hardy and these that are straight I had

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.330 
Hardy and these that are straight I had
them<00:01:52.080> clear<00:01:53.080> gel<00:01:53.380> coat<00:01:53.619> um<00:01:53.800> so<00:01:54.160> I<00:01:54.190> had

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
them clear gel coat um so I had

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.520 
them clear gel coat um so I had
something<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:54.729> work<00:01:54.940> with<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:56.080> when<00:01:56.229> we<00:01:56.380> got

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
something to work with and when we got

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.100 
something to work with and when we got
him<00:01:56.740> we<00:01:56.770> fit<00:01:57.100> him<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.399> car<00:01:57.640> which<00:01:58.539> requires

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
him we fit him to the car which requires

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.680 
him we fit him to the car which requires
bodywork<00:01:59.709> so<00:02:00.009> that<00:02:00.160> was<00:02:00.280> tricky<00:02:00.580> not<00:02:01.000> wrecking

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
bodywork so that was tricky not wrecking

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.350 
bodywork so that was tricky not wrecking
the<00:02:02.110> carbon

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the carbon

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.390 
the carbon
the<00:02:03.420> panels<00:02:03.840> mean<00:02:04.110> where<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.500> body<00:02:04.740> lines<00:02:05.070> are

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
the panels mean where the body lines are

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.370 
the panels mean where the body lines are
right<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.240> always<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.660> do<00:02:06.750> bodywork<00:02:07.170> on

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
right you always have to do bodywork on

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.490 
right you always have to do bodywork on
the<00:02:07.590> hose<00:02:07.800> and<00:02:08.009> then<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.270> have<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.630> do<00:02:09.780> priming

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the hose and then you have to do priming

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.560 
the hose and then you have to do priming
and<00:02:10.619> sanding<00:02:11.130> in<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> painted<00:02:11.700> areas<00:02:12.090> right

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
and sanding in the painted areas right

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.960 
and sanding in the painted areas right
we<00:02:12.840> do<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.260> without<00:02:13.380> touching<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.430> carbon

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
we do that without touching this carbon

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.170 
we do that without touching this carbon
the<00:02:15.210> entire<00:02:15.540> process<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.440> job<00:02:17.180> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
the entire process of the job and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.600 
the entire process of the job and
including<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.990> three-stage<00:02:19.590> red<00:02:19.980> paint<00:02:20.340> job

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
including the three-stage red paint job

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.390 
including the three-stage red paint job
which<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.270> pearl<00:02:22.080> basic<00:02:22.680> Andy<00:02:23.010> right<00:02:23.190> in<00:02:23.340> a

clear and then pull all the tape off and
clear<00:02:26.970> coat<00:02:27.150> everything

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
clear coat everything

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.500 
clear coat everything
santé<00:02:28.890> buff<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.220> smooth<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.880> then<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.360> have

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
santé buff is smooth and then you have

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.250 
santé buff is smooth and then you have
this<00:02:30.630> carbon<00:02:32.090> gorgeous<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:33.750> nice<00:02:33.959> and

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
this carbon gorgeous and it's nice and

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.340 
this carbon gorgeous and it's nice and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
deep deep as opposed to an overlay which

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.410 
deep deep as opposed to an overlay which
is<00:02:37.500> more<00:02:37.709> common<00:02:38.160> right<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.880> carbon<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.390> can

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
is more common right this carbon you can

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.300 
is more common right this carbon you can
look<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.810> mile<00:02:40.020> intro<00:02:40.410> because<00:02:40.770> it's<00:02:40.920> actual

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
look a mile intro because it's actual

winter<00:03:16.440> we<00:03:16.680> did<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:16.950> few<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.190> these<00:03:17.370> shows<00:03:17.640> right

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
winter we did a few of these shows right

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.360 
winter we did a few of these shows right
is<00:03:18.600> see<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> circuit<00:03:19.320> that's<00:03:19.560> that's<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.100> he

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
is see a circuit that's that's it he

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.350 
is see a circuit that's that's it he
didn't<00:03:20.550> want<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.790> work<00:03:21.000> for<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.210> whole<00:03:21.330> year

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
didn't want to work for a whole year

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.230 
didn't want to work for a whole year
most<00:03:21.840> people<00:03:22.140> like<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.350> do<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.650> no<00:03:23.370> they<00:03:23.880> got

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
most people like to do that no they got

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.730 
most people like to do that no they got
it's<00:03:24.780> nice<00:03:24.930> showing<00:03:25.230> them<00:03:25.440> when<00:03:25.590> they're

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
it's nice showing them when they're

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.800 
it's nice showing them when they're
fresh<00:03:25.950> riders<00:03:26.670> they're<00:03:26.850> never<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:27.480> clean

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
fresh riders they're never this clean

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.660 
fresh riders they're never this clean
and<00:03:28.080> nice<00:03:28.200> when<00:03:28.440> they're<00:03:28.590> first<00:03:28.740> so<00:03:29.070> the

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
and nice when they're first so the

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.460 
and nice when they're first so the
timing<00:03:30.150> was<00:03:30.300> right<00:03:30.330> we<00:03:30.600> got<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.900> done<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.320> day

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
timing was right we got it done the day

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.680 
timing was right we got it done the day
before<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.950> ndis<00:03:32.520> see<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.760> show<00:03:33.120> was<00:03:33.360> straight

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
before the ndis see a show was straight

look pretty right and once the

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.010 
look pretty right and once the
fabrication<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.360> build<00:04:32.540> was<00:04:32.720> down<00:04:32.900> we

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
fabrication and the build was down we

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.080 
fabrication and the build was down we
took<00:04:33.140> apart<00:04:33.530> mated<00:04:34.010> laded<00:04:34.370> everything<00:04:34.760> right
