00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.599
Don’t fear this adventure! Show me your brave heart!

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.600
Don’t fear this adventure! Show me your heart!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.700
I’ll carry your will, I’ll promise that here and now

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:51.399
In order to protect everyone, I’ll draw my sword and take care of the beast lurking in the forgotten hell!

00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:01.249
The field lies all burned down, I’m sure I’ll meet you soon

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:11.200
Even if I’d lose everything, I won’t let you have my corpse

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.400
For I’ll make my coffin out of this stained stone wall!

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:34.900
I’ll become one with my courage, facing towards the hell

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:51.799
A black trap calling the depths of desperation, where decaying human bones will never disappear

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:01.499
If I’d fly towards that crimson path, I’ll probably be able to see your true face

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:11.500
That intense heat of hellfires melts the bottom of my heart

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.500
Reminding me of that nostalgic view of my hometown…

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:13.000
If I’d fly towards that crimson path, I’ll probably be able to see your true face

00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:23.000
Even if I’d lose everything, I won’t let you have my corpse

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:30.000
That stained stone wall it’s my coffin

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:40.000
Please, don’t let me see your tears, it’s better to sing for the people

00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:49.100
So, sing that lullaby when my life runs out!
