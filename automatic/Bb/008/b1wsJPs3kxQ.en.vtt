00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
last for up to a hundred hours right

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.119 
last for up to a hundred hours right
there<00:00:42.600> until<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.989> need<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.469> replace<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
there until you need to replace the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.959

little<00:00:44.579> coin<00:00:45.030> cell<00:00:45.329> battery<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.730> what<00:00:47.850> it

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
little coin cell battery so so what it

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:56.360 
little coin cell battery so so what it
is<00:00:50.329> basically<00:00:51.329> inside<00:00:53.660> this<00:00:54.660> little<00:00:55.370> circuit

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
is basically inside this little circuit

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.369 
is basically inside this little circuit
board<00:00:56.399> right<00:00:56.789> here<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.930> there's<00:00:58.260> this

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
board right here and then there's this

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.900 
board right here and then there's this
little<00:00:58.559> button<00:00:58.890> right<00:00:59.039> here<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.370> that's<00:00:59.760> what

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
little button right here so that's what

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.880 
little button right here so that's what
you're<00:01:00.090> pressed<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.469> got<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.650> this

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you're pressed and it's got this so this

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.539 
you're pressed and it's got this so this
actually<00:01:05.280> came<00:01:05.460> out<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.979> slap<00:01:07.979> bracelet

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
actually came out of the slap bracelet

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.090

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
one so it's just like this but it's a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.719

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
because what ended up happening for me

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.789 
because what ended up happening for me
is<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.479> slap<00:01:21.900> bracelet<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.350> metal<00:01:22.590> part

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
is that the slap bracelet the metal part

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.219 
is that the slap bracelet the metal part
inside<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.369> actually<00:01:23.780> sliced<00:01:24.780> through<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
inside it actually sliced through the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.170 
inside it actually sliced through the
nylon<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.100> they're<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.400> actually<00:01:26.580> came<00:01:26.970> out
