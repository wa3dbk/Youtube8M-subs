00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
light dark bush gray and then here you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.830 
light dark bush gray and then here you
can<00:01:47.189> see<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> bunch<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.700> other<00:01:47.790> pieces<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.810> I

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
can see a bunch of other pieces and so I

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.649 
can see a bunch of other pieces and so I
basically<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.409> have<00:01:49.740> most<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.850> my<00:01:50.909> bins<00:01:51.240> laid

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
basically just have most of my bins laid

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.450 
basically just have most of my bins laid
out<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.740> sit<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> stool

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
out here and I just sit in the stool

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.030 
out here and I just sit in the stool
right<00:01:53.610> here<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.060> then<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.680> take<00:01:55.680> kind<00:01:55.950> of

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
right here and then I just take kind of

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.649 
right here and then I just take kind of
each<00:01:56.130> section<00:01:56.520> apart<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.030> put<00:01:57.329> their<00:01:57.479> pieces

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
each section apart and put their pieces

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.990 
each section apart and put their pieces
away<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.280> if<00:01:59.280> you're<00:01:59.430> wondering<00:01:59.729> how<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> take

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
away so if you're wondering how I take

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.550 
away so if you're wondering how I take
apart<00:02:00.240> my<00:02:00.360> mark<00:02:00.570> sets<00:02:00.840> how<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.110> goes<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.939> on

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
apart my mark sets how that goes so on

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.700 
apart my mark sets how that goes so on
terms<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.740> new<00:02:04.920> MOC<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.399> new<00:02:05.759> schedule<00:02:06.270> -

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
terms of new MOC and new schedule -

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.650 
terms of new MOC and new schedule -
before<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.860> mentioned<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.729> schedule<00:02:09.420> however

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
before I mentioned a schedule however

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.449 
before I mentioned a schedule however
I'm<00:02:09.989> changing<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.800> mentioned<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.430> few

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
I'm changing that I mentioned it a few

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.600 
I'm changing that I mentioned it a few
weeks<00:02:11.760> before<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.060> uploaded<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.629> MOC

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
weeks before I uploaded the MOC

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.800 
weeks before I uploaded the MOC
so<00:02:14.610> instead<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:14.910> working<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.330> mini<00:02:15.600> mock

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
so instead of working on a mini mock

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.570 
so instead of working on a mini mock
before<00:02:16.140> my<00:02:16.260> mock<00:02:16.440> for<00:02:16.650> Brookwood<00:02:16.920> chicago<00:02:17.370> i

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
before my mock for Brookwood chicago i

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.880 
before my mock for Brookwood chicago i
realized<00:02:18.480> i<00:02:18.630> really<00:02:18.870> only<00:02:18.960> have<00:02:19.110> about<00:02:19.320> two

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
realized i really only have about two

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.470 
realized i really only have about two
months<00:02:20.250> until<00:02:20.400> brick<00:02:20.730> road<00:02:20.880> Chicago<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.420> I

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
months until brick road Chicago so I

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.570 
months until brick road Chicago so I
really<00:02:21.690> got<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.840> get<00:02:21.990> moving<00:02:22.980> on<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.250> mock<00:02:23.430> I

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
really got to get moving on that mock I

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.010 
really got to get moving on that mock I
don't<00:02:23.760> want<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:23.970> waste<00:02:24.120> any<00:02:24.300> time<00:02:24.390> on<00:02:24.630> that

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
don't want to waste any time on that

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.470 
don't want to waste any time on that
site<00:02:25.320> it's<00:02:25.530> gonna<00:02:25.650> be<00:02:25.800> awesome

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
site it's gonna be awesome

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
site it's gonna be awesome
the<00:02:27.480> bass<00:02:27.660> parts<00:02:27.960> can<00:02:28.110> be<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.200> little<00:02:28.380> bit

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the bass parts can be a little bit

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.040 
the bass parts can be a little bit
smaller<00:02:28.860> just<00:02:29.330> in<00:02:30.330> terms<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.780> conserving

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
smaller just in terms of conserving

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.600 
smaller just in terms of conserving
pieces<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.590> stuff<00:02:31.709> but<00:02:31.920> there's<00:02:32.310> gonna<00:02:32.459> be<00:02:32.580> a

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
pieces and stuff but there's gonna be a

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.490 
pieces and stuff but there's gonna be a

ton more detail than you've ever seen in
my<00:02:34.530> other<00:02:34.620> mocks<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.730> battlefield<00:02:36.060> it's

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
my other mocks and the battlefield it's

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.930 
my other mocks and the battlefield it's
gonna<00:02:36.540> be<00:02:36.720> ginormous<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:38.310> I'm<00:02:38.430> really<00:02:38.730> looking

out all kind of the base plates and
maybe<00:03:41.010> start<00:03:41.340> building<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:41.700> little<00:03:41.880> bit<00:03:42.090> on<00:03:42.269> the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.780 
maybe start building a little bit on the
MOC<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:42.989> nothing<00:03:43.560> huge<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:44.070> until<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:44.519> have

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
MOC but nothing huge it until I have

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.390 
MOC but nothing huge it until I have
that<00:03:44.940> done<00:03:45.150> like<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.540> said<00:03:45.739> maximum<00:03:46.739> three

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
that done like I said maximum three

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.949 
that done like I said maximum three
weeks<00:03:47.610> there<00:03:47.880> but<00:03:48.090> probably<00:03:48.510> take<00:03:48.630> about<00:03:48.750> two

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
weeks there but probably take about two

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.580 
weeks there but probably take about two
and<00:03:50.120> then<00:03:51.120> that's<00:03:51.660> pretty<00:03:51.810> much<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.170> in<00:03:52.320> terms

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
next weekend but the weekend after that

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.450 
next weekend but the weekend after that
and<00:05:47.330> I<00:05:48.080> don't<00:05:48.200> think<00:05:48.380> the<00:05:48.590> new<00:05:48.710> format<00:05:49.130> will<00:05:49.310> be

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
and I don't think the new format will be

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.390 
and I don't think the new format will be
available<00:05:50.120> then<00:05:50.270> but<00:05:50.539> maybe<00:05:50.840> and<00:05:51.320> the<00:05:52.070> next

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
available then but maybe and the next

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.029 
available then but maybe and the next
coming<00:05:52.700> episodes<00:05:53.120> you<00:05:53.450> might<00:05:53.660> see<00:05:54.020> the<00:05:54.470> entire

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
coming episodes you might see the entire

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:56.830 
coming episodes you might see the entire
format's<00:05:55.430> gonna<00:05:55.639> be<00:05:55.700> different<00:05:56.030> so<00:05:56.240> look

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
format's gonna be different so look

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.089 
format's gonna be different so look
forward<00:05:57.080> to<00:05:57.200> that<00:05:57.289> that<00:05:57.590> still<00:05:57.770> in<00:05:57.860> the<00:05:57.919> works

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
forward to that that still in the works

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:00.219 
forward to that that still in the works
and<00:05:58.460> I<00:05:59.120> think<00:05:59.300> that<00:05:59.419> pretty<00:05:59.570> much<00:05:59.660> sums<00:05:59.810> it<00:06:00.169> up

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
and I think that pretty much sums it up

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.170 
and I think that pretty much sums it up
