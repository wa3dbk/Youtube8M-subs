00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730 

I<00:00:00.500> had<00:00:01.500> done<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:01.920> project<00:00:02.520> before<00:00:03.589> but<00:00:04.589> the

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
I had done this project before but the

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.400 
I had done this project before but the
laser<00:00:05.009> pointer<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:05.879> used<00:00:06.210> had<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.020> very

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
laser pointer that I used had a very

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.660 
laser pointer that I used had a very
unusual<00:00:07.620> battery<00:00:08.460> configuration<00:00:10.639> so<00:00:11.639> I

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
unusual battery configuration so I

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.720 
unusual battery configuration so I
thought<00:00:12.000> I'd<00:00:13.040> redesign<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.929> using<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.730> typical

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
thought I'd redesign it using a typical

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.820 
thought I'd redesign it using a typical
laser<00:00:18.000> like<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.140> one<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.350> bought<00:00:19.650> from

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
laser like this one I bought from

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.880 
laser like this one I bought from
Staples<00:00:20.220> as<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.380> see<00:00:23.449> on<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:25.050> drawing<00:00:25.470> I

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
Staples as you can see on this drawing I

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.200 
Staples as you can see on this drawing I
just<00:00:26.820> have<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:28.099> triple-a<00:00:29.099> batteries<00:00:29.670> inside

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
just have to triple-a batteries inside

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.740 
just have to triple-a batteries inside
and<00:00:31.109> when<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.410> push<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.980> button<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:33.300> laser

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
and when you push the button the laser

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.299 
and when you push the button the laser
lights<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> took<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.649> batteries<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
lights so I took the batteries out and

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.740 
lights so I took the batteries out and
left<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.960> end<00:00:42.960> cap<00:00:43.739> at<00:00:44.550> home<00:00:44.820> also<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.570> just

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
left the end cap at home also and just

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.270 
left the end cap at home also and just
took<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.140> laser<00:00:46.350> empty<00:00:47.390> to<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.930> these<00:00:49.280> big

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
took the laser empty to one of these big

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.340 
took the laser empty to one of these big
commercial<00:00:51.239> stores<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.829> sells<00:00:54.350> hardware

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
commercial stores that sells hardware

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.569 
commercial stores that sells hardware
and<00:00:55.829> all<00:00:56.550> kinds<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.059> stuff<00:00:58.039> walking<00:00:59.039> around

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and all kinds of stuff walking around

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.280 
and all kinds of stuff walking around
trying<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.180> an<00:01:00.300> idea<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:02.780> how<00:01:03.780> I'm<00:01:03.989> going

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
trying to get an idea of how I'm going

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.260 
trying to get an idea of how I'm going
to<00:01:04.379> do<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:07.280> walked<00:01:08.280> all<00:01:08.520> over<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.030> place

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
to do this I walked all over the place

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.850 
to do this I walked all over the place
and<00:01:09.890> walked<00:01:10.890> past<00:01:11.780> where<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.200> dowel<00:01:13.470> rods

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and walked past where the dowel rods

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.340 
and walked past where the dowel rods
were<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:15.020> I<00:01:16.020> picked<00:01:16.890> one<00:01:17.009> up<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:18.170> that<00:01:19.170> was

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
were and I picked one up and that was

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.240 
were and I picked one up and that was
too<00:01:19.590> small<00:01:20.270> in<00:01:21.270> other<00:01:21.450> words<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:22.009> finally<00:01:23.009> found

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
too small in other words I finally found

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.630 
too small in other words I finally found
one<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.840> would<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.350> fit<00:01:26.180> plus<00:01:27.560> if<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.829> tried

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
one that would just fit plus if I tried

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.550 
one that would just fit plus if I tried
hard<00:01:29.970> enough<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:31.200> actually<00:01:31.530> made<00:01:32.070> threads<00:01:33.560> so

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
hard enough and actually made threads so

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.340 
hard enough and actually made threads so
I<00:01:34.950> thought<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:36.030> will<00:01:36.270> probably<00:01:36.869> work<00:01:37.079> we'll

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
I thought this will probably work we'll

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.929 
I thought this will probably work we'll
try<00:01:37.380> using<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.520> what<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.790> came

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
try using this and this is what I came

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.830 
try using this and this is what I came
up<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.670> didn't<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.090> need

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
up with you can see I didn't really need

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.550 
up with you can see I didn't really need
to<00:01:46.049> use<00:01:46.470> much<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> doll<00:01:48.140> but<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.409> see

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
to use much of the doll but you can see

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.840 
to use much of the doll but you can see
I<00:01:49.590> drilled<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.130> hole<00:01:50.159> down<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.119> center<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:52.850> in

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
I drilled a hole down the center and in

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.539 
I drilled a hole down the center and in
this<00:01:54.720> picture<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.490> can<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.920> I've<00:01:59.280> got<00:01:59.520> a

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
this picture you can see that I've got a

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.340 
this picture you can see that I've got a
nice<00:01:59.880> solder<00:02:01.219> blob<00:02:02.219> at<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.299> top<00:02:03.570> that's<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
nice solder blob at the top that's the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.980 
nice solder blob at the top that's the
center<00:02:04.710> connection<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.960> other

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
center connection and the other

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.930 
center connection and the other
connection<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:09.709> braided<00:02:10.709> wire<00:02:10.950> copper

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
connection that is braided wire copper

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.920 
connection that is braided wire copper
wire

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
wire

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.610 
wire
and<00:02:13.319> it's<00:02:13.560> from<00:02:14.150> like<00:02:15.150> RadioShack<00:02:15.959> solder

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
and it's from like RadioShack solder

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.170 
and it's from like RadioShack solder
zipper<00:02:17.269> type<00:02:18.269> stuff<00:02:18.689> and<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:20.610> works<00:02:20.849> real

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
zipper type stuff and that works real

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.509 
zipper type stuff and that works real
good<00:02:21.209> it's<00:02:21.629> you<00:02:22.590> know<00:02:22.709> pretty<00:02:23.010> much<00:02:23.220> pure

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
good it's you know pretty much pure

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.600 
good it's you know pretty much pure
copper<00:02:24.230> now<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.409> little<00:02:25.620> wooden<00:02:26.040> chip<00:02:26.340> right

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
copper now that little wooden chip right

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.470 
copper now that little wooden chip right
next<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.480> did<00:02:29.060> cut<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.810> out<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.980> small

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
next to it I did cut that out that small

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.190 
next to it I did cut that out that small
shallow<00:02:33.480> chip<00:02:34.519> from<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.790> grooved<00:02:36.510> or<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
shallow chip from the grooved or the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.309 
shallow chip from the grooved or the
very<00:02:37.560> end<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.420> allow<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:41.209> braided<00:02:42.209> wire<00:02:42.480> to

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
very end to allow the braided wire to

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.690 
very end to allow the braided wire to
seat<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.920> little<00:02:44.909> bit<00:02:45.209> better<00:02:46.400> here's<00:02:47.400> the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
seat a little bit better here's the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.690 
seat a little bit better here's the
drawing<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.409> can<00:02:49.590> see<00:02:49.859> it's<00:02:50.639> very<00:02:51.260> simple

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
drawing and you can see it's very simple

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.259 
drawing and you can see it's very simple
and<00:02:53.700> here<00:02:54.329> I<00:02:54.569> have<00:02:54.840> installed<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.650> batteries

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
and here I have installed the batteries

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.729 
and here I have installed the batteries
along<00:02:57.650> with<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.859> end<00:02:59.099> cap<00:02:59.400> and<00:03:00.260> now<00:03:01.260> I'm<00:03:01.439> going

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
along with the end cap and now I'm going

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.970 
along with the end cap and now I'm going
to<00:03:02.120> test<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.389> to<00:03:03.689> make<00:03:03.900> sure<00:03:04.139> it's<00:03:04.560> going<00:03:04.829> to

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
to test this to make sure it's going to

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.960 
to test this to make sure it's going to
work<00:03:05.689> and<00:03:06.689> I'm<00:03:07.470> gonna<00:03:07.980> hold<00:03:08.280> down<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.819> button

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
work and I'm gonna hold down the button

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.129 
work and I'm gonna hold down the button
on<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.720> laser<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.459> then<00:03:11.659> touch<00:03:12.659> the<00:03:12.689> two

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
on the laser and then touch the two

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.710 
on the laser and then touch the two
leads<00:03:13.470> together<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.760> can<00:03:14.939> see<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.450> the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
leads together and you can see that the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.150 
leads together and you can see that the
laser<00:03:16.699> does<00:03:17.699> light<00:03:19.849> here<00:03:20.849> I'm<00:03:21.090> connecting<00:03:21.720> the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
laser does light here I'm connecting the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.180 
laser does light here I'm connecting the
leads<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.549> stereo<00:03:24.329> plug<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.139> I'm<00:03:25.980> only

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
leads to a stereo plug and I'm only

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.949 
leads to a stereo plug and I'm only
going<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.609> be<00:03:26.699> using<00:03:27.030> two<00:03:27.480> wires<00:03:28.159> the<00:03:29.159> tip<00:03:29.430> and

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
going to be using two wires the tip and

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.550 
going to be using two wires the tip and
the<00:03:30.959> sleeve<00:03:31.650> ground<00:03:32.629> the<00:03:33.629> other<00:03:33.840> lead<00:03:34.169> that

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
the sleeve ground the other lead that

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.379 
the sleeve ground the other lead that
was<00:03:34.709> in<00:03:35.159> the<00:03:35.819> center<00:03:36.090> if<00:03:36.870> I'd<00:03:37.620> hooked<00:03:37.889> that<00:03:38.069> up

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
was in the center if I'd hooked that up

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.520 
was in the center if I'd hooked that up
it<00:03:39.389> would<00:03:39.919> short<00:03:40.919> to<00:03:41.159> ground<00:03:41.340> so<00:03:42.299> I'm<00:03:43.019> just<00:03:43.319> I

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
it would short to ground so I'm just I

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.550 
it would short to ground so I'm just I
just<00:03:43.680> cut<00:03:44.099> it<00:03:44.129> off<00:03:44.510> here<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.540> have<00:03:45.949> tied<00:03:46.949> up<00:03:47.220> the

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
just cut it off here I have tied up the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.030 
just cut it off here I have tied up the
braided<00:03:49.560> wire<00:03:50.209> with<00:03:51.209> dial<00:03:51.569> cord<00:03:51.989> now<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.739> could

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
braided wire with dial cord now I could

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.399 
braided wire with dial cord now I could
use<00:03:53.280> string<00:03:53.760> but<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.060> dial<00:03:54.599> cord<00:03:54.989> happened<00:03:55.349> to

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
use string but a dial cord happened to

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.189 
use string but a dial cord happened to
be<00:03:55.530> handy<00:03:55.949> here<00:03:56.159> and<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:57.150> wrapped<00:03:57.419> it<00:03:57.659> around<00:03:57.750> a

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199 
be handy here and I wrapped it around a

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:02.719 
be handy here and I wrapped it around a
few<00:03:58.229> times<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:59.720> super<00:04:00.720> glued<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.139> and<00:04:01.729> then

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:02.729 
few times and super glued it and then

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:07.000 
few times and super glued it and then
here<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.389> put<00:04:04.370> shrink<00:04:05.370> tubing<00:04:06.090> over<00:04:06.299> it<00:04:06.599> and

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
here I put shrink tubing over it and

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.349 
here I put shrink tubing over it and
also<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.250> little<00:04:08.909> electrical<00:04:09.810> tape<00:04:11.180> here's<00:04:12.180> a

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
also a little electrical tape here's a

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.670 
also a little electrical tape here's a
drawing<00:04:12.720> of<00:04:13.169> the<00:04:13.760> completed<00:04:14.760> connector<00:04:15.650> now<00:04:16.650> I

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
drawing of the completed connector now I

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.310 
drawing of the completed connector now I
have<00:04:17.659> screwed<00:04:18.659> that<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.949> end<00:04:20.280> of<00:04:20.669> the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
have screwed that to the end of the

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.740 
have screwed that to the end of the
laser<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:23.669> course<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.000> batteries<00:04:24.419> are<00:04:24.599> in

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
laser and of course the batteries are in

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.580 
laser and of course the batteries are in
there

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
there

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.850 
there
and<00:04:25.680> when<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.340> plug<00:04:26.700> that<00:04:26.760> into<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.450> radio

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
and when I plug that into the radio

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.560 
and when I plug that into the radio
which<00:04:28.860> has<00:04:29.130> a<00:04:29.540> transformer<00:04:30.540> output<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.740> also

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
which has a transformer output and also

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.170 
which has a transformer output and also
push<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.840> button<00:04:34.139> on<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.530> laser<00:04:34.790> it<00:04:35.790> lights

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
push the button on the laser it lights

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.360 
push the button on the laser it lights
and<00:04:37.370> how<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.700> is<00:04:38.880> modulated<00:04:39.720> is<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:41.160> output

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
and how this is modulated is the output

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.960 
and how this is modulated is the output
from<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.150> radio<00:04:42.680> through<00:04:43.680> that<00:04:43.889> secondary<00:04:44.639> of

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
from the radio through that secondary of

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.640 
from the radio through that secondary of
the<00:04:45.270> transformer<00:04:46.040> will<00:04:47.040> add<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.760> subtract

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
the transformer will add and subtract

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.710 
the transformer will add and subtract
from<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.889> battery<00:04:50.250> power<00:04:50.610> supply<00:04:51.180> in<00:04:51.540> the

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
from the battery power supply in the

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.200 
from the battery power supply in the
laser<00:04:51.980> so<00:04:52.980> this<00:04:53.280> is<00:04:53.600> am<00:04:54.600> modulation<00:04:55.410> and<00:04:56.220> now

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
laser so this is am modulation and now

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:23.710 
laser so this is am modulation and now
it's<00:04:57.419> time<00:04:57.690> for<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:58.139> test

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.860 

well<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:24.930> modulated<00:05:25.620> laser<00:05:26.430> light<00:05:26.880> worked

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
well the modulated laser light worked

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.890 
well the modulated laser light worked
very<00:05:28.200> well<00:05:28.290> and<00:05:29.330> I<00:05:30.330> like<00:05:31.289> this<00:05:31.560> design<00:05:31.669> because

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
very well and I like this design because

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.390 
very well and I like this design because
if<00:05:33.900> I<00:05:34.140> don't<00:05:34.350> want<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.590> use<00:05:34.830> it<00:05:34.860> for<00:05:35.280> this

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
if I don't want to use it for this

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.620 
if I don't want to use it for this
purpose<00:05:35.460> anymore

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
purpose anymore

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.010 
purpose anymore
I<00:05:36.660> can<00:05:37.320> just<00:05:37.560> unscrew<00:05:38.100> the<00:05:39.060> connector<00:05:39.600> I<00:05:39.630> made

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
I can just unscrew the connector I made

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.610 
I can just unscrew the connector I made
and<00:05:40.320> put<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.310> original<00:05:41.580> end<00:05:42.180> cap<00:05:42.419> back<00:05:43.169> on<00:05:43.440> the
