lineup on Friday against Michigan State

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.360 
lineup on Friday against Michigan State
as<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.090> talked<00:00:54.329> about<00:00:55.070> they<00:00:56.070> had<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> good

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
as we talked about they had a good

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.979 
as we talked about they had a good
opponent<00:00:56.640> that's<00:00:57.120> why<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.360> picked<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.719> match

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
opponent that's why we picked that match

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.630 
opponent that's why we picked that match
for<00:00:58.230> him<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.440> come<00:00:58.559> back<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.070> was<00:00:59.190> big<00:00:59.399> ten

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
little cartwheel something I trained him

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.100

to<00:02:12.690> do<00:02:12.840> on

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.400 
to do on
monday<00:02:13.500> we<00:02:13.680> spent<00:02:13.920> time<00:02:14.130> on<00:02:14.270> I<00:02:15.270> told<00:02:16.230> him<00:02:16.350> he

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
monday we spent time on I told him he

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.900 
monday we spent time on I told him he
could<00:02:16.530> hit<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.890> guy<00:02:17.100> he<00:02:17.490> didn't<00:02:17.730> think

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
could hit it on the guy he didn't think

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.360 
could hit it on the guy he didn't think
so<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.420> guess<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.320> was<00:02:19.470> right<00:02:19.590> he<00:02:19.800> was<00:02:19.920> wrong<00:02:20.130> and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
so I guess I was right he was wrong and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.070 
so I guess I was right he was wrong and
he<00:02:20.460> does<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.060> cartwheel<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.780> was<00:02:21.900> pretty

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
he does the cartwheel but it was pretty

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.920 
he does the cartwheel but it was pretty
cool<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:23.090> Ellen's<00:02:24.090> always<00:02:24.360> going<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.660> come<00:02:24.810> up
