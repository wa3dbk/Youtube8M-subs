00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.919
 what it means puts me at stake 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.039
 it is a book that speaks 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.890
 a person a concert and a person who has lost his job 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.169
 It's the first thing these 2 do when they meet 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.519
 and I share the common passion to get involved means to face oneself 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.119
 that then one of the most difficult things that we can be things 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.080
 I don't know if you agree or not but we see them twice 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.180
 the first 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.540
 for what they are in effect therefore from an objective point of view according to the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.930
 let us see with the eyes of that moment 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.030
 because our brain that commands us so write the blank pages 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.400
 of your personal booklet to our life is like a partly written book 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.910
 partly to write 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.350
 then the written part where we then put our thoughts 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.860
 it was cancel we take only the beautiful things that are of the past 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.350
 experience we write instead 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.439
 those new beautiful white the only ones on which we can engrave 80% of the 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.750
 our brain is projected to the past then we have large vessel 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.100
 where inside shampoo our whole life 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.140
 there are some large pisa stones that are smaller than the sand 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.250
 and what is sand we consider everyday things the things we do 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.390
 drag 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.260
 here is that thing there but completely overturned 2 do the actions overturn 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.260
 the one that has a lot of 20 of which I said the 80 put it for new projects not 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.490
 I will speak well I call sam and nothing ask yourself why there are so many kings 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.570
 conflicts 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.270
 inside the couple in work with their boss 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.460
 gianni girl simonato from home opened new horizons this evening sorry 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.020
 the trouble because I pass it in a cultural moment and I would like to emphasize 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.440
 with the assured applause 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.870
 the applause 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.140
 but they are people who serve have a recharge from has no strength rome energy 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.060
 in everyday life
