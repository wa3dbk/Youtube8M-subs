00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.400
 hi guys i'm karl bishop defeats 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.410
 al for this new video with which 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.530
 keep talking I'll tell you again 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.260
 a little something about this dragon teeth 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.350
 ok dragon sip for those who are 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.940
 pignoli because in short the maps of the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.070
 new mode we don't have the link 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.810
 spoken reality I don't review you 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.610
 I do not tell you this map is nice because 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.700
 I tell you something both concern more than 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.140
 I would like to move the shot 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.420
 of the goal of the video more on giving you a 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.400
 opinion at the end on the dlc that came out 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.810
 since I did not express myself from this 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.420
 point of view can never made the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.420
 revue de nava strike telling you then yes vi 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.820
 I recommend buying it or not in this 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.280
 case seen arouse already three dlc in short 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.119
 the fourth is missing but the stand here is the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.890
 more is done 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.940
 I would also like to give an opinion on that 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.550
 which I think the purchase of these is 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.430
 dlc if it is worth it or not in other words you have 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.680
 understood then let's start from the 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.000
 maps and from the new mode the maps 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.800
 you have seen more or less in the gameplay 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.770
 even in my last video there were more or 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.830
 less all lumphini garden for the market 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.110
 I don't know about propaganda and about a sunken cannes 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.789
 what's called dragon 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.310
 ok then they are maps with a big one 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.050
 footprint infantry meanwhile you like that 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.360
 they change a lot from the if mode 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.910
 you play i know rush no leave no 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.640
 much but if you play here we are in the link from 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.410
 conquest change maps not much 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.690
 but in essence it changes from the imprint 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.430
 infantry paying center at the dinner 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.110
 link meanwhile the new one from dan introduced 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.240
 only childhood of so we put the dots 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.540
 on i there are never means in that 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.310
 mode then the proper mode 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.440
 file infant in all life if 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.750
 go if you see the fashion the equivalent 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.670
 conquest of that map there are gods 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.380
 means but few guys in some 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.540
 they are not completely absent 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.370
 I'll give you an example of garden hooks solos 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.620
 tweeds and water bikes so anyway 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.090
 both and in any case they are large maps therefore 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.300
 we are not talking about a close quarter 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.160
 we talk about a clash of infantry in 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.680
 open field so definitely one thing 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.660
 original and also wanted because 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.700
 let's face it, guys, lovers 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.160
 infantry oil they don't want 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.080
 play domination and tdm in fans anyway 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.390
 they suck guys I say I'm the 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.220
 sagra del random 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.319
 what can they play at battlefield 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.420
 four boe operation locker which is not 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.510
 which sucks the most is a map without 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.069
 a sense and then operation meter now 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.720
 operation meter and I can't tell you that 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.090
 ugly because I have faith and I played with it 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.760
 a casino and there but for the same however there 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.190
 I say that sucks in via f 4 unfortunately 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.160
 because how I played via federation 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.260
 operation meter always attention no 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.239
 exclusive ok also in battlefield 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.180
 four are found without major problems 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.940
 non ex server so the problem is that in the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.680
 no exclusive of battlefield 4 there are 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.390
 a series of things that still explode 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.400
 like the flashbanks don't show you a 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.870
 fuck in combination whose flares that not 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.780
 make you see a killer I do n't even have those 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.150
 combined with smoke then two entries e 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.709
 it seems that he knows in a rave party rega between 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.239
 flash and smoke explosions really exist 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.680
 I miss the bob marley the friends 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.870
 find and genus environments ie 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.330
 guys really was so hateful 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.030
 eventually exploits bombards okay 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.340
 in short, these maps here are one thing 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.739
 new one thing they needed because if 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.780
 there are trustworthy people who are there 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.359
 who want what i know about or why 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.850
 must unlock a weapon or because they create 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.400
 I know that good night only shoots 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.950
 the sniffing infantry will be worrying 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.930
 of various means cocks and bunches son-in-law 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.200
 these maps here and have fun 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.250
 much much better casino 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.890
 of the completely random alternative 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.110
 of the pd is offered by the tdm and the 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.300
 domination attention because I said 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.280
 that I know beautiful but does not mean so easy 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.620
 boys and that is for market that I have it 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.860
 renamed flooded area not flooded 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.930
 because it is much like there is a bad 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.169
 an ugly fish to be peeled saying that 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.940
 have acacia raiuno fe mismo then vi 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.500
 it may happen the first time 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.660
 what a day a map to find yourself in 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.810
 difficulty and to say that it sucks this 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.350
 fucking dlc no the problem is that if not 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.410
 you move with knowledge of the facts 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.450
 in short randon vince to territories a 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.130
 respawn wheel areas and in that case 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.390
 no fun nobody I know perfectly 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.220
 agree with you 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.020
 regarding turn on links instead 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.850
 guys the new mode introduced well 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.070
 it's sort of with this domination 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.170
 because there are always flags in 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.410
 half the map I have already said that it is alone 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:26.050
 infantry and how to always lower i 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.580
 ticket to the opponent no starting with a 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.710
 touch of goethe then depends on how 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.320
 set server anyway fall a lot in 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.970
 faster than with it 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.070
 domination the question in high like 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.080
 there is what is there that makes them go down 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.900
 these tickets how we eat label 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.670
 the opponent simply not having the 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.810
 black ice are not the flag themselves and 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:48.790
 enough or better capture points to give us 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:52.060
 to make the points fall precisely to ours 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.680
 enemy but the link between these I make a 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.520
 example so understand immediately on the fly 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.850
 put 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.190
 realize that you have three flags ab and c 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.320
 no you actually have three phlegm two 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.360
 connections that is from abi and abec 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.890
 if your version so smart 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.430
 has already understood the mode alive to fuck 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.900
 be you from two links and you have zero 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.580
 basically continue to have two 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.280
 checkpoints on which you can 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.280
 marry but in reality you have nothing 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.260
 because you're not letting down on tickets 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.000
 in short, a very simple opponent 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.410
 I think you understood 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.210
 and it must also be said that it could come up 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.160
 on the flag and this is something I love 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.760
 there is flag attention and you catch them more or 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.040
 less with the same time 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.470
 of a flag of the fantastic domination 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.150
 but we can play on it 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.740
 and in fact while you are in the process of 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.570
 catch if maybe you are alone or 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.340
 think that someone can break us down 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.230
 look around and then once 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.480
 caught the flag knowing that no one can 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.370
 marry around cheers do not exist 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.530
 answers randomly in chains lane 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.420
 fantastic in fact the thing I like 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.670
 more than this mode is really 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.260
 this fact here the fact that one 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.720
 once caught the flag I know no one 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.480
 can marry randomly next to 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.680
 me played with the comrades is 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.660
 hilariously played alone 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.480
 you have to be good foxes 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:10.260
 I conclude the video guys then giving you 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.210
 an idea about buying not buying 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.400
 this dlc surely if you don't have 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.290
 bought second acquitted nava strike e 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.300
 you kept yours yourselves 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.950
 children because maybe I'm obviously 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.740
 speaking in a premium because the premiums 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:25.290
 they have all bought themselves then yes 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:29.010
 invested now I don't know how it will be now 

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:30.900
 the stand but guys this dlc is worth the 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:33.630
 worth having if you are a fan of 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.550
 battlefield 4 and above all with the net 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.770
 impression that from here to the exit of 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.840
 hart line or even later because pf 4am 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.000
 however, it will continue in parallel 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.450
 in short, they will be quite popular 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.310
 in short, they will find servers on this dlc 

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.230
 I think it will be the most played 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.540
 I tell you even not having seen 

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:53.340
 just the boys stand as always 

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.230
 if you like, put a like on it 

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.970
 blessed the ex you don't do as we think 

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.650
 we always catch ourselves here if he also had 

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.000
 in this case, sec defeats the for 

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.150
 another of these videos 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.150
 Hello
