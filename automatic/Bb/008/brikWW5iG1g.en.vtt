00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.090
 according to 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.710
 it's knee end up for a 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.840
 new video to click on 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.489
 the rise of small diplomacy 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.200
 when it is very simple for the whole 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.330
 first glee was found by fabien 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.040
 oger of knicks volume you 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.620
 just to do a little job and you m 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.360
 squatting right after and you'll be in 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.670
 this goal an invincibility just above 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.110
 of a window so I advise you to 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.610
 second fight because there would be 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.970
 zombies that will touch you here 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.040
 over there 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.390
 so if you will have green then and you 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.400
 you are going to shift from left to 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.620
 right and ben the zombies will you 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.930
 hit certainly but will not be able to 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.059
 kill because with my according to you would 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.530
 purely incidentally at first 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.410
 when you are going to do the job always 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.390
 advised to do it well even if 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.090
 a little file because there will be a 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.170
 wall year by year on a little neuneu that's going 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.300
 a little embarrass you when you go to do 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.220
 the job and appreciate you have a good 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.020
 does the job is to miss the mans 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.960
 transparent and ben you will be my client 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.759
 suffered their 2nd league gates 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.030
 it will be a ploy that in his eyes 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.550
 but my subscribers did not understand then 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.200
 for those stranger then it will be 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.330
 Allied risks rather earth passes pass 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.759
 then you will find your way 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.380
 function of the shadow that is on 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.810
 the stairs then you're going to jump 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.420
 towards the shadow towards the beginning the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.670
 world when you go do not really 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.280
 rhinestone but rather a little job like that 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.899
 did the job and after you go 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.849
 turn that side somehow 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.349
 and immediately after doing the job 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:52.240
 and no you are going to cut yourself 

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:54.399
 will have to jump and you will put 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.069
 says for the glitch the time for the 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.860
 public and for the second when Cedric 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.780
 are necessarily viable means to that 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.520
 if you squatted because there is 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.440
 a wall just between two months and a wall 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.670
 red tent or so we can not go back 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.860
 if we are standing then will 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.429
 must begin and kribi 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.530
 passing I recommend 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.599
 to your teammates to put you in this 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.430
 master to the door that is right 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.590
 next pass passes at least the 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.319
 zombies are attracted just by you and 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.810
 they too will be purely my target then 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.510
 a little thing your requests to put 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.760
