hey figured I'd stop real quick and show
you<00:00:06.470> white<00:00:07.470> pine<00:00:08.540> I<00:00:10.099> know<00:00:11.099> whenever<00:00:11.519> I'm<00:00:11.790> out

you white pine I know whenever I'm out

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.209 
you white pine I know whenever I'm out
with<00:00:12.719> people<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.380> lot<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.679> times<00:00:13.980> they<00:00:14.190> don't

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
with people a lot of times they don't

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.499 
with people a lot of times they don't
know<00:00:14.490> how<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.670> tell<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:14.969> difference<00:00:15.089> between

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
know how to tell the difference between

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.859 
know how to tell the difference between
the<00:00:16.100> species<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.430> pines<00:00:18.920> but<00:00:20.420> this<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.660> white

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
the species of pines but this is white

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.320 
the species of pines but this is white
pine<00:00:22.789> and<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:25.710> way<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.890> noticed<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.609> from<00:00:26.820> afar

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.030 

you<00:00:30.330> can<00:00:30.510> see<00:00:30.720> there's<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.990> few<00:00:31.289> white<00:00:31.470> pines<00:00:31.769> up

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
you can see there's a few white pines up

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.060 
you can see there's a few white pines up
in<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.520> but<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.380> has<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> much

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
in here but it just have it has a much

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.010 
in here but it just have it has a much
softer<00:00:35.550> look<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:38.129> needles<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.510> just

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
softer look to it the needles and just

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.310 
softer look to it the needles and just
the<00:00:40.170> way<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.860> mean<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.390> can<00:00:42.540> see<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.960> pine

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the way it I mean you can see this pine

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.069 
the way it I mean you can see this pine
right<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:44.870> not<00:00:45.870> sure<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:47.719> red<00:00:48.719> pine

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
right here not sure if that is red pine

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.600 
right here not sure if that is red pine
or<00:00:52.579> possibly<00:00:53.579> Scotch<00:00:54.120> pine<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:55.460> think<00:00:56.460> those

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
or possibly Scotch pine I think those

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.510 
or possibly Scotch pine I think those
might<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:56.940> Scotch<00:00:57.480> behind<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.109> hard<00:00:58.379> I'm<00:00:59.280> not

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
might be Scotch behind it's hard I'm not

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.610 
might be Scotch behind it's hard I'm not
entirely<00:00:59.879> sure<00:01:00.149> how<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.600> tell<00:01:00.870> those<00:01:01.140> apart

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
entirely sure how to tell those apart

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.520 
entirely sure how to tell those apart
but<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.850> way<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.030> tell<00:01:03.359> red<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.809> white<00:01:03.870> pine

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
but the way you tell red or white pine

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:14.060 
but the way you tell red or white pine
is<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.979> little<00:01:08.220> sets<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:09.000> needles<00:01:12.770> will<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.920> in

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
is the little sets of needles will be in

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:27.140 
is the little sets of needles will be in
fives<00:01:20.750> speedos<00:01:21.750> are<00:01:21.900> terrible

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.590 

but<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.270> needles<00:01:28.630> are<00:01:28.810> in<00:01:29.080> a<00:01:29.290> little<00:01:29.800> sets<00:01:30.130> and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
but the needles are in a little sets and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.280 
but the needles are in a little sets and
each<00:01:31.600> little<00:01:31.960> set<00:01:33.180> will<00:01:34.180> have<00:01:34.390> five<00:01:34.900> needles

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
each little set will have five needles

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.860 
each little set will have five needles
and<00:01:35.710> that's<00:01:36.010> how<00:01:36.190> you<00:01:36.250> tell<00:01:36.520> white<00:01:36.760> pine<00:01:37.030> up

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
and that's how you tell white pine up

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.550 
and that's how you tell white pine up
close<00:01:38.470> by<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:38.950> needles<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:39.729> then<00:01:40.720> from<00:01:41.140> afar

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
close by the needles and then from afar

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.890 
close by the needles and then from afar
the<00:01:42.369> way<00:01:42.520> I<00:01:42.550> distinguish<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.450> is<00:01:43.680> by<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:45.900> well

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
the way I distinguish it is by the well

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.480 
the way I distinguish it is by the well
the<00:01:47.200> younger<00:01:47.560> trees<00:01:47.800> generally<00:01:48.100> have

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
the younger trees generally have

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.950 
the younger trees generally have
smoother<00:01:49.030> bark<00:01:49.300> and<00:01:49.770> they<00:01:50.770> have<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.780> sort<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:52.840> a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
smoother bark and they have a sort of a

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.640 
smoother bark and they have a sort of a
dark<00:01:53.290> gray<00:01:53.650> almost<00:01:54.160> black<00:01:54.430> appearance<00:01:55.060> and

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
dark gray almost black appearance and

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
dark gray almost black appearance and
they<00:01:56.650> have<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:56.890> softer<00:01:57.790> look<00:01:58.000> overall<00:01:58.960> as

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
they have a softer look overall as

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.710 
they have a softer look overall as
compared<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:02.229> two<00:02:02.500> needle<00:02:02.890> Pines

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
compared to the the two needle Pines

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.010 
compared to the the two needle Pines
which<00:02:04.720> are<00:02:04.990> red<00:02:05.649> pine<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:06.640> believe<00:02:07.600> Scotch

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
which are red pine and I believe Scotch

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:17.460 
which are red pine and I believe Scotch
pine<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:10.270> couple<00:02:10.959> others<00:02:13.320> my<00:02:14.320> only<00:02:15.450> use<00:02:16.470> at

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
pine and a couple others my only use at

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.520 
pine and a couple others my only use at
this<00:02:18.220> point<00:02:18.519> for<00:02:18.760> white<00:02:19.030> pine<00:02:19.360> or<00:02:19.690> pine<00:02:20.320> in

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
this point for white pine or pine in

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.250 
this point for white pine or pine in
general<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.130> is<00:02:21.690> for<00:02:22.690> hunting<00:02:23.050> mushrooms

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
general is is for hunting mushrooms

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.509 
general is is for hunting mushrooms
because<00:02:24.959> certain<00:02:25.959> mushrooms<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:26.530> hunt<00:02:26.769> only

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
because certain mushrooms I hunt only

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.780 
because certain mushrooms I hunt only
grow<00:02:27.700> around<00:02:27.850> white<00:02:28.300> pine<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:29.790> other

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
grow around white pine and other

grow around white pine and other
mushrooms<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.660> hunt<00:02:32.790> only<00:02:33.790> grow<00:02:34.030> around<00:02:34.150> Norway

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
mushrooms I hunt only grow around Norway

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.120 
mushrooms I hunt only grow around Norway
spruce<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.750> don't<00:02:37.959> find<00:02:38.230> too<00:02:38.350> many<00:02:38.620> edible

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
spruce and I don't find too many edible

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.100 
spruce and I don't find too many edible
mushrooms<00:02:39.549> that<00:02:39.640> grow<00:02:39.790> around<00:02:40.090> red<00:02:40.480> pine<00:02:40.780> or

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
mushrooms that grow around red pine or

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.670 
mushrooms that grow around red pine or
Scotch<00:02:41.680> pine<00:02:42.070> in<00:02:42.430> my<00:02:42.970> area<00:02:43.269> in<00:02:43.690> other<00:02:44.230> parts<00:02:44.500> of

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
Scotch pine in my area in other parts of

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.340 
Scotch pine in my area in other parts of
the<00:02:44.739> country<00:02:44.829> and<00:02:45.340> stuff<00:02:45.640> people<00:02:46.049> people<00:02:47.049> seem

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
the country and stuff people people seem

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.520 
the country and stuff people people seem
to<00:02:47.380> do<00:02:47.620> good<00:02:47.829> around<00:02:48.130> red<00:02:48.579> pine<00:02:48.880> for<00:02:49.530> certain

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
to do good around red pine for certain

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.430 
to do good around red pine for certain
kind<00:02:50.769> of<00:02:50.860> mushrooms<00:02:51.220> but<00:02:52.049> doesn't<00:02:53.049> seem<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.320> be

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
kind of mushrooms but doesn't seem to be

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.440 
kind of mushrooms but doesn't seem to be
the<00:02:53.590> case<00:02:53.620> here<00:02:54.690> but<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.840> can<00:02:56.019> see<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:57.450> white

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
the case here but you can see the white

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.160 
the case here but you can see the white
pine<00:02:58.720> is<00:02:58.900> really<00:02:59.290> easy<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.650> distinguish

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
pine is really easy to distinguish

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.699 
pine is really easy to distinguish
because<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.320> has<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:02.739> soft<00:03:03.070> look<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:05.350> looks<00:03:05.590> a

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
because it has that soft look it looks a

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.860 
because it has that soft look it looks a
lot<00:03:05.860> cleaner<00:03:06.160> than<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:07.680> scruffier<00:03:09.570> red<00:03:10.570> and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
lot cleaner than the scruffier red and

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.290

and each little cluster of needles has
five<00:03:20.390> needles<00:03:21.460> there's<00:03:22.460> no<00:03:22.730> other<00:03:22.910> pine<00:03:23.300> that

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
five needles there's no other pine that

has five needles around here only white
pine<00:03:27.260> that's<00:03:27.860> how<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.100> distinguish<00:03:28.700> it<00:03:28.940> I

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
pine that's how you distinguish it I

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.460 
pine that's how you distinguish it I
just<00:03:30.470> figured<00:03:30.860> I'd<00:03:31.010> mentioned<00:03:31.460> that<00:03:32.230> I've<00:03:33.230> had

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
just figured I'd mentioned that I've had

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.260 
just figured I'd mentioned that I've had
a<00:03:33.500> lot<00:03:33.680> of<00:03:33.740> people<00:03:34.010> asking<00:03:34.580> how<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:34.790> tell<00:03:35.150> the

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
a lot of people asking how I tell the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.870 
a lot of people asking how I tell the
difference<00:03:36.190> that's<00:03:37.190> how<00:03:37.430> I<00:03:37.460> tell<00:03:37.730> the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
difference that's how I tell the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.830 
difference that's how I tell the
difference<00:03:39.820> another<00:03:40.820> good<00:03:41.000> thing<00:03:41.060> that<00:03:41.330> pine

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
difference another good thing that pine

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.800 
difference another good thing that pine
is<00:03:42.050> good<00:03:42.320> for<00:03:42.620> though<00:03:42.830> I<00:03:43.250> don't<00:03:44.240> use<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:44.630> too

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
is good for though I don't use it too

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.810 
is good for though I don't use it too
much<00:03:44.990> but<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.410> lot<00:03:45.620> of<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.740> bushcraft<00:03:45.950> guys<00:03:46.460> do

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
much but a lot of the bushcraft guys do

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:55.660 
much but a lot of the bushcraft guys do
is<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:48.290> sap<00:03:50.920> which<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:52.130> right<00:03:52.340> here<00:03:54.670> that

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
is the sap which is right here that

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.230 
is the sap which is right here that
works<00:03:55.940> really<00:03:56.150> good<00:03:56.420> for<00:03:56.660> starting<00:03:57.050> fires<00:03:57.320> and

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
works really good for starting fires and

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:06.660 
works really good for starting fires and
you<00:03:59.240> can<00:03:59.420> use<00:03:59.660> it<00:03:59.810> as<00:03:59.960> a<00:03:59.990> glue<00:04:00.380> or<00:04:01.130> a<00:04:01.480> cement<00:04:04.660> to

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
you can use it as a glue or a cement to

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.360 
you can use it as a glue or a cement to
glue<00:04:07.670> things<00:04:07.910> together<00:04:08.180> or<00:04:08.810> to<00:04:09.020> hold<00:04:12.370> hold

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
glue things together or to hold hold

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.840 
glue things together or to hold hold
things<00:04:13.640> together<00:04:14.740> I'm<00:04:15.740> not<00:04:16.010> that<00:04:16.220> experienced

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
things together I'm not that experienced

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.940 
things together I'm not that experienced
in<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:18.470> ways<00:04:18.500> of<00:04:19.010> the<00:04:19.160> bushcrafter<00:04:20.919> but<00:04:21.919> I

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
in the ways of the bushcrafter but I

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.540 
in the ways of the bushcrafter but I
have<00:04:22.250> gathered<00:04:22.760> some<00:04:23.030> pine<00:04:23.270> sap<00:04:23.600> and<00:04:24.310> used<00:04:25.310> it

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
have gathered some pine sap and used it

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.520 
have gathered some pine sap and used it
for<00:04:25.580> a<00:04:25.970> few<00:04:26.270> different<00:04:26.419> things<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:27.169> made<00:04:27.350> some

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
for a few different things I made some

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.460 
for a few different things I made some
primitive<00:04:27.800> fish<00:04:28.190> hooks<00:04:28.490> out<00:04:28.760> of<00:04:28.910> bone<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.470> I

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
primitive fish hooks out of bone and I

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.790 
primitive fish hooks out of bone and I
use<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:31.450> pine<00:04:32.450> sap<00:04:33.370> mixed<00:04:34.370> with<00:04:35.590> some<00:04:36.590> other

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
use the pine sap mixed with some other

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.220 
use the pine sap mixed with some other
ingredients<00:04:38.320> to<00:04:39.320> make<00:04:39.560> a<00:04:40.480> basically<00:04:41.480> a<00:04:41.600> cement

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
ingredients to make a basically a cement

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.200 
ingredients to make a basically a cement
or<00:04:42.410> a<00:04:42.440> glue<00:04:43.000> to<00:04:44.000> hold<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.390> string<00:04:44.780> on<00:04:46.210> to

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
or a glue to hold the string on to

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.680 
or a glue to hold the string on to
fasten<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:48.820> different<00:04:49.820> pieces<00:04:50.000> of<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.480> fish

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
fasten the different pieces of the fish

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.120 
fasten the different pieces of the fish
hook<00:04:50.930> together<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:51.680> it<00:04:52.550> holds<00:04:52.850> very<00:04:53.270> well

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
hook together and it holds very well

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.110 
hook together and it holds very well
it's<00:04:55.130> kind<00:04:55.520> of<00:04:55.580> like<00:04:55.790> the<00:04:56.240> I<00:04:57.760> compare<00:04:58.760> it<00:04:58.910> to

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
it's kind of like the I compare it to

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.250 
it's kind of like the I compare it to
hot<00:04:59.450> glue<00:04:59.740> hot<00:05:00.740> glue<00:05:01.010> sticks<00:05:01.480> it<00:05:02.480> pretty<00:05:03.050> much

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
hot glue hot glue sticks it pretty much

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.980 
hot glue hot glue sticks it pretty much
works<00:05:03.530> almost<00:05:03.950> the<00:05:04.310> same<00:05:04.550> way<00:05:04.820> as<00:05:05.000> a<00:05:05.270> hot<00:05:05.660> glue

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
works almost the same way as a hot glue

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
works almost the same way as a hot glue
stick<00:05:06.320> wood<00:05:06.590> and<00:05:08.110> you<00:05:09.110> can<00:05:09.260> even<00:05:09.410> use<00:05:09.560> it<00:05:09.890> the

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
stick wood and you can even use it the

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.180 
stick wood and you can even use it the
same<00:05:10.250> way<00:05:10.460> I<00:05:10.490> have<00:05:10.790> a<00:05:10.820> little<00:05:11.090> piece<00:05:11.390> that<00:05:11.780> i

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
same way I have a little piece that i

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.270 
same way I have a little piece that i
will<00:05:13.190> use<00:05:13.490> for<00:05:14.530> gluing<00:05:15.530> things<00:05:15.680> in<00:05:15.919> the<00:05:16.040> field

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
will use for gluing things in the field

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.630 
will use for gluing things in the field
if<00:05:16.430> I<00:05:16.520> need<00:05:16.760> to<00:05:16.790> and<00:05:17.230> all<00:05:18.230> I<00:05:18.320> do<00:05:18.500> is<00:05:18.650> heat<00:05:19.370> it<00:05:19.400> up

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
if I need to and all I do is heat it up

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.930 
if I need to and all I do is heat it up
with<00:05:19.820> a<00:05:19.850> lighter<00:05:20.180> and<00:05:20.530> let<00:05:21.530> the<00:05:21.800> pine<00:05:22.280> sap<00:05:22.640> drip

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
with a lighter and let the pine sap drip

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.820 
with a lighter and let the pine sap drip
onto<00:05:23.180> what<00:05:23.479> I'm<00:05:23.600> gluing

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
onto what I'm gluing

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.690 
onto what I'm gluing
and<00:05:24.920> then<00:05:25.430> let<00:05:25.640> it<00:05:25.670> set<00:05:26.570> up<00:05:26.720> as<00:05:27.130> it<00:05:28.130> cools<00:05:28.400> down

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
and then let it set up as it cools down

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.430 
and then let it set up as it cools down
it<00:05:28.760> works<00:05:29.150> really<00:05:29.360> good<00:05:29.630> it<00:05:29.840> works<00:05:29.990> just<00:05:30.080> about

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
it works really good it works just about

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.200 
it works really good it works just about
as<00:05:30.590> good<00:05:30.710> as<00:05:30.830> hot<00:05:31.010> glue<00:05:31.280> does<00:05:32.020> but<00:05:33.070> anyway

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
as good as hot glue does but anyway

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.600 
as good as hot glue does but anyway
that's<00:05:35.210> about<00:05:35.570> it<00:05:35.600> i<00:05:36.250> think<00:05:37.250> i'm<00:05:37.400> going<00:05:37.520> to

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
that's about it i think i'm going to

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.870 
that's about it i think i'm going to
call<00:05:37.790> it<00:05:37.820> quits<00:05:38.090> for<00:05:38.450> the<00:05:38.510> day<00:05:38.600> I've<00:05:39.020> had<00:05:39.880> it

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
call it quits for the day I've had it

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.850 
call it quits for the day I've had it
out<00:05:41.030> down<00:05:41.300> this<00:05:41.450> trail<00:05:41.780> for<00:05:42.140> about<00:05:42.530> two<00:05:42.830> hours

out down this trail for about two hours

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.960 
out down this trail for about two hours
and<00:05:43.870> looking<00:05:44.870> for<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.290> staghorn<00:05:45.830> sumac<00:05:46.640> which

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
and looking for the staghorn sumac which

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.180 
and looking for the staghorn sumac which
I<00:05:47.440> didn't<00:05:48.440> find<00:05:50.110> all<00:05:51.110> right<00:05:51.350> one<00:05:51.650> last<00:05:51.680> quick

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
I didn't find all right one last quick

I didn't find all right one last quick
