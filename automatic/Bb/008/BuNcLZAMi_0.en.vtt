I<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:03.080> this<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.739> nice<00:01:05.189> herbal

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700

smell

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.460 

but<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.000> nice<00:01:12.180> green<00:01:12.570> vegetation<00:01:13.080> smell

like a sack of cut grass

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.090 
like a sack of cut grass
third<00:01:17.509> reason<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:18.229> I<00:01:18.350> like<00:01:18.590> this<00:01:18.829> is<00:01:19.069> because

third reason that I like this is because

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.370 
third reason that I like this is because
you<00:01:19.520> see<00:01:19.640> this<00:01:19.759> big<00:01:19.939> little<00:01:20.630> container<00:01:20.990> this

you see this big little container this

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.450 
you see this big little container this
big<00:01:21.590> little<00:01:21.859> container

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
big little container

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.220 
big little container
you<00:01:22.790> see<00:01:22.940> this<00:01:23.060> container<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.690> goes<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:23.870> long

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
you see this container it goes a long

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.230 
you see this container it goes a long
way<00:01:24.860> two<00:01:25.130> people<00:01:25.430> have<00:01:25.550> actually<00:01:25.670> been<00:01:25.850> using

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
way two people have actually been using

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.390 
way two people have actually been using
this<00:01:26.630> for<00:01:26.840> an<00:01:26.930> entire<00:01:27.290> month

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
this for an entire month

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.220 
this for an entire month
and<00:01:28.700> if<00:01:28.790> you<00:01:28.880> see<00:01:29.030> our<00:01:29.150> grubby<00:01:29.540> little<00:01:29.570> Mexican

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
and if you see our grubby little Mexican

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.630 
and if you see our grubby little Mexican
imprint<00:01:30.650> in<00:01:31.310> there<00:01:31.520> that's<00:01:32.150> right<00:01:32.330> two<00:01:32.930> people

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
imprint in there that's right two people

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.170 
imprint in there that's right two people
so<00:01:34.640> a<00:01:34.850> little<00:01:35.180> goes<00:01:35.360> a<00:01:35.930> long<00:01:36.320> way<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.430> also

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
so a little goes a long way and also

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.300 
so a little goes a long way and also
when<00:01:38.479> you're<00:01:38.630> applying<00:01:38.930> it<00:01:39.229> because<00:01:40.010> it<00:01:40.160> goes

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
when you're applying it because it goes

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.310 
when you're applying it because it goes
on<00:01:40.460> thick<00:01:40.850> because<00:01:41.300> you<00:01:41.570> don't<00:01:41.780> have<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.110> apply

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
on thick because you don't have to apply

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.340 
on thick because you don't have to apply
that<00:01:42.530> much<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:43.850> actually<00:01:44.240> lets<00:01:44.840> your<00:01:45.020> hair

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
that much it actually lets your hair

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.790 
that much it actually lets your hair
come<00:01:45.740> out<00:01:45.940> thicker<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.300> if<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:47.930> see<00:01:48.170> my<00:01:48.440> hair
