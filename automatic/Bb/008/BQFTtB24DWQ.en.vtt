rhythm<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.670> faster<00:01:06.360> than<00:01:07.040> then<00:01:08.040> smeargle

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
rhythm is faster than then smeargle

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.250 
rhythm is faster than then smeargle
because<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:11.119> because<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.510> murder<00:01:12.900> moves

because the because it's murder moves
faster<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.280> uses<00:01:14.670> catch<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
faster and uses catch it's not going to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.539 
faster and uses catch it's not going to
learn<00:01:17.040> anything<00:01:17.220> because<00:01:17.970> no<00:01:18.799> no<00:01:19.799> pokemon<00:01:20.369> has
