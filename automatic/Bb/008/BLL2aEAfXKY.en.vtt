00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
they're going to start over and just be

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.430 
they're going to start over and just be
a<00:00:54.149> totally<00:00:54.570> different<00:00:54.840> universe<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.410> that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
a totally different universe and that

kind of thing so I doubt that they will
introduce<00:00:59.670> any<00:01:00.210> new<00:01:00.359> characters<00:01:00.930> like<00:01:01.260> that

introduce any new characters like that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.460 
introduce any new characters like that
like<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> Robin<00:01:02.489> desk<00:01:02.789> or<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:04.019> Joseph

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
like a Robin desk or have Joseph

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.080 
like a Robin desk or have Joseph
gordon-levitt<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.580> fill<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:08.220> role<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.490> Batman

because<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.450> end<00:01:51.600> now<00:01:52.250> after<00:01:53.250> this

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
because it's going to end now after this

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.700 
because it's going to end now after this
movie<00:01:53.820> as<00:01:53.909> far<00:01:54.119> as<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.329> know<00:01:54.570> unless<00:01:55.470> that's

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
movie as far as we know unless that's

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.889 
movie as far as we know unless that's
wrong<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.520> maybe<00:01:56.759> another<00:01:56.969> Batman<00:01:57.390> will<00:01:57.719> take

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
wrong and maybe another Batman will take

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.600 
wrong and maybe another Batman will take
over<00:01:58.229> after<00:01:58.549> i<00:01:59.549> would<00:01:59.850> say<00:02:00.180> probably<00:02:00.229> i<00:02:01.610> don't

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
over after i would say probably i don't

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.609 
over after i would say probably i don't
see<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:02.969> happening<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.689> don't<00:02:04.320> think<00:02:04.560> that

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
see that happening I don't think that

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.889 
see that happening I don't think that
Joseph<00:02:05.399> gordon-levitt<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.000> Rob<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.600> don't

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
Joseph gordon-levitt is Rob and I don't

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.139 
Joseph gordon-levitt is Rob and I don't
think<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.320> he<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:08.610> taking<00:02:08.849> up

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
think that he is going to be taking up

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.270 
think that he is going to be taking up
at<00:02:09.330> mez<00:02:09.569> mantle<00:02:10.080> at<00:02:10.319> near<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.830> end<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.099> movie

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
at mez mantle at near the end the movie

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.650 
at mez mantle at near the end the movie
or<00:02:11.640> anything<00:02:11.910> like<00:02:12.180> that

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
or anything like that

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.630 
or anything like that
I<00:02:12.720> think<00:02:13.350> he'll<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.680> be<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:13.860> helper<00:02:14.460> in<00:02:14.550> the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
I think he'll just be a helper in the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.580 
I think he'll just be a helper in the
movie<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.060> help<00:02:15.270> out<00:02:15.480> Bruce<00:02:15.780> Wayne<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.380> help

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
movie to help out Bruce Wayne to help

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.400 
movie to help out Bruce Wayne to help
out<00:02:16.770> Batman<00:02:17.040> with<00:02:17.370> what's<00:02:17.550> going<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.330> then

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
out Batman with what's going on and then

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.350 
out Batman with what's going on and then
after<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.590> um<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.640> know<00:02:20.760> they'll<00:02:21.000> totally

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
after this um you know they'll totally

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.000 
after this um you know they'll totally
reboot<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.840> nothing<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.380> was<00:02:22.500> done<00:02:22.710> in<00:02:22.740> this

reboot it nothing that was done in this

reboot it nothing that was done in this
trilogy<00:02:23.280> will<00:02:23.640> have<00:02:23.790> anything<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.780> do<00:02:24.900> with<00:02:25.140> it

trilogy will have anything to do with it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.560 
trilogy will have anything to do with it
I<00:02:25.470> don't<00:02:26.460> think<00:02:26.520> Christopher<00:02:26.940> Nolan<00:02:27.240> wants

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
I don't think Christopher Nolan wants

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.970 
I don't think Christopher Nolan wants
somebody<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.930> come<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.200> afterwards<00:02:28.620> and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
somebody to come in afterwards and

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.130 
somebody to come in afterwards and
create<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.520> know<00:02:29.550> more<00:02:29.970> movies<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.720> tacked<00:02:30.960> on

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
create you know more movies to tacked on

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.080 
create you know more movies to tacked on
to<00:02:31.380> his<00:02:31.530> trilogy<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.340> think<00:02:32.550> he<00:02:32.640> wants<00:02:32.940> his

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
to his trilogy I think he wants his

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.960 
to his trilogy I think he wants his
trilogy<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.660> be<00:02:33.890> standalone<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.400> his<00:02:35.610> work

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
trilogy to be standalone just his work

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.430 
trilogy to be standalone just his work
and<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.510> anybody<00:02:36.900> else<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.170> comes<00:02:37.260> in

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
and that anybody else that comes in

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.470 
and that anybody else that comes in
afterwards<00:02:37.920> have<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.910> develop<00:02:39.180> their<00:02:39.450> own

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
afterwards have to develop their own

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.210 
afterwards have to develop their own
franchise<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.320> speak<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.800> he'll<00:02:41.040> be

producer and help them a little bit but
in<00:02:43.980> terms<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.490> actually<00:02:44.970> directing<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.660> and

being involved with writing and that
kind<00:02:47.490> of<00:02:47.520> stuff<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.910> don't<00:02:48.570> know<00:02:48.630> how<00:02:48.750> much<00:02:48.930> you

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
kind of stuff I don't know how much you

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.230 
kind of stuff I don't know how much you
will<00:02:49.230> be<00:02:49.410> out<00:02:49.440> we<00:02:49.770> also<00:02:49.890> don't<00:02:50.070> know<00:02:50.280> what<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
will be out we also don't know what the

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.550 
will be out we also don't know what the
reboots<00:02:51.600> going<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.840> be<00:02:51.960> like<00:02:52.080> it's<00:02:52.380> going<00:02:52.500> to

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
reboots going to be like it's going to

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.980 
reboots going to be like it's going to
be<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.710> like<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> serious<00:02:53.730> tone<00:02:54.090> like<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.690> recent

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
be a like a serious tone like the recent

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.720 
be a like a serious tone like the recent
ones<00:02:55.140> have<00:02:55.290> been<00:02:55.320> or<00:02:55.740> if<00:02:56.280> they're<00:02:56.430> going<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:56.610> go

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
ones have been or if they're going to go

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.310 
ones have been or if they're going to go
a<00:02:56.760> different<00:02:56.850> route<00:02:57.330> which<00:02:57.690> would<00:02:57.990> make<00:02:58.110> sense

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
a different route which would make sense

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.350 
a different route which would make sense
to<00:02:58.440> since<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.640> know<00:02:59.730> they<00:02:59.850> usually<00:03:00.150> like<00:03:00.240> to

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
to since you know they usually like to

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.760 
to since you know they usually like to
change<00:03:00.570> things<00:03:00.810> up<00:03:01.020> they<00:03:01.200> don't<00:03:01.350> like<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.620> do

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
change things up they don't like to do

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.870 
change things up they don't like to do
one<00:03:02.130> particular<00:03:02.580> style<00:03:02.820> for<00:03:03.030> too<00:03:03.150> long<00:03:03.510> um

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
one particular style for too long um

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.070 
one particular style for too long um
although<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:05.910> like<00:03:06.210> the<00:03:06.330> serious<00:03:06.660> take<00:03:06.900> on

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
although I like the serious take on

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.600 
although I like the serious take on
Batman<00:03:07.530> sort<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.860> like<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.070> realistic

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
Batman sort of like the realistic

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.540 
Batman sort of like the realistic
approach<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.690> Christopher<00:03:10.140> Nolan<00:03:10.560> made

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
approach that Christopher Nolan made

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.420 
approach that Christopher Nolan made
famous<00:03:11.820> basically<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.650> would<00:03:14.010> imagine<00:03:14.190> if

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
famous basically so I would imagine if

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.950 
famous basically so I would imagine if
he's<00:03:14.580> producing<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.420> would<00:03:15.570> be<00:03:15.690> fairly

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
he's producing it it would be fairly

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.540 
he's producing it it would be fairly
serious<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.620> don't<00:03:16.770> think<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.100> would<00:03:17.220> be<00:03:17.340> like

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
serious I don't think it would be like

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.660 
serious I don't think it would be like
you<00:03:18.510> know<00:03:18.600> too<00:03:19.410> silly<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:20.280> kind<00:03:20.490> of<00:03:20.520> stuff

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
you know too silly that kind of stuff

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.610 
you know too silly that kind of stuff
like<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.970> early<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.420> think<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.900> DC<00:03:22.230> probably

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
like the early I think the DC probably

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.470 
like the early I think the DC probably
learned<00:03:22.800> from<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.310> Batman<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:23.880> Robin<00:03:24.300> and

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
learned from the Batman and Robin and

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.250 
learned from the Batman and Robin and
some<00:03:25.110> of<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.910> Batman<00:03:26.910> Forever<00:03:27.090> those<00:03:27.870> movies

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
years won't be number four so it'll be a
