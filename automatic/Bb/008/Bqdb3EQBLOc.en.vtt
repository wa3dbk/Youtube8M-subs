after an Anthony Jackson groove Anthony
I<00:00:52.079> was<00:00:52.680> known<00:00:52.920> for<00:00:52.950> playing<00:00:53.760> these<00:00:53.969> long

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
I was known for playing these long

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.889 
I was known for playing these long
fields<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.050> sometimes<00:00:55.500> started<00:00:55.950> after<00:00:56.190> one

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
fields that sometimes started after one

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.680 
fields that sometimes started after one
and<00:00:57.980> that<00:00:58.980> were<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.489> good<00:00:59.760> contrast<00:01:00.360> to<00:01:00.540> what

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
and that were a good contrast to what

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.720 
and that were a good contrast to what
happened<00:01:01.020> before<00:01:01.110> them<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:02.040> France<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.579> have

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
happened before them like France we have

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.380 
happened before them like France we have
this<00:01:02.879> short<00:01:03.120> groove<00:01:04.159> that's<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> main<00:01:05.430> motif

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.760 

then<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.479> come<00:01:12.630> off<00:01:12.780> from<00:01:12.990> out<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.260> nowhere<00:01:13.409> we

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
then we come off from out of nowhere we

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.789 
then we come off from out of nowhere we
come<00:01:14.070> up<00:01:14.220> with<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.049> groove<00:01:19.409> happens

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
come up with and that groove happens

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.850 
come up with and that groove happens
that<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.189> bassline<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.659> phrase<00:01:22.470> happens

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
that that bassline that phrase happens

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.550 
that that bassline that phrase happens
after<00:01:23.310> one<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.880> what<00:01:24.240> ended<00:01:24.689> -<00:01:24.840> did<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.260> -<00:01:25.409> did

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
after one so what ended - did you - did

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.020 
after one so what ended - did you - did
they<00:01:25.710> get<00:01:25.860> together<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.580> doesn't<00:01:26.880> happen

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
they get together so it doesn't happen

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.060 
they get together so it doesn't happen
on<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.689> downbeat<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.290> starts<00:01:28.619> after<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
on the downbeat it starts after the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.250 
on the downbeat it starts after the
downbeat<00:01:29.490> which<00:01:29.610> kind<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.000> gifts<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.330> a<00:01:30.659> lot<00:01:31.140> of

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
of thing it's a long and it seems kind

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.010 
of thing it's a long and it seems kind
of<00:01:39.990> busy<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.920> context<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.000> said<00:01:42.689> it's<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
of busy but in context I said it's at a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.810 
of busy but in context I said it's at a
point<00:01:43.290> normally<00:01:43.799> when<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> vocals<00:01:44.580> are

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
point normally when the vocals are

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.109 
point normally when the vocals are
little<00:01:45.659> more<00:01:45.750> legato<00:01:46.080> or<00:01:46.759> there's<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.850> set

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
little more legato or there's a set

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.550 
little more legato or there's a set
pattern<00:01:48.360> going<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.200> where<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.530> doesn't

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
pattern going on to where it doesn't

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.130 
pattern going on to where it doesn't
fight<00:01:50.159> with<00:01:50.460> what's<00:01:50.759> going<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.119> that's<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
fight with what's going on that's the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.749 
fight with what's going on that's the
critical<00:01:52.470> thing<00:01:52.619> when<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.100> play<00:01:53.340> things<00:01:53.579> are

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
critical thing when you play things are

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.910 
critical thing when you play things are
more<00:01:53.909> busy<00:01:54.150> like<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.750> Louis<00:01:55.650> Johnson

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
more busy like this Louis Johnson

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.230 
more busy like this Louis Johnson
actually<00:01:56.340> did<00:01:56.460> something<00:01:56.670> like<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
actually did something like that and

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.319 
actually did something like that and
Michael<00:01:58.520> McDonald's<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.670> keep<00:01:59.880> forgetting

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
Michael McDonald's I keep forgetting

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
that's a nice minor sounding groove it's

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.520 
that's a nice minor sounding groove it's
actually<00:02:12.180> interesting<00:02:12.450> because<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.689> starts

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
actually interesting because it starts

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.340 
actually interesting because it starts

there's a main pattern field that

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.750 
there's a main pattern field that
happens<00:02:40.900> get<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.320> down<00:02:41.560> before<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.250> rush<00:02:42.520> to
