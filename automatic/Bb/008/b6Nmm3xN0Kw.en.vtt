00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
small has a little heat sink here to

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.010 
small has a little heat sink here to
cool<00:02:37.230> down<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.950> North<00:02:38.820> Bridge<00:02:39.150> with<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.630> guess

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
cool down the North Bridge with I guess

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.490 
cool down the North Bridge with I guess
it's<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.590> old<00:02:40.680> board<00:02:40.950> graphics<00:02:41.960> South<00:02:42.960> Bridge

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
it's the old board graphics South Bridge

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.380 
it's the old board graphics South Bridge
cooler<00:02:43.830> as<00:02:44.010> well<00:02:44.190> take<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.580> look<00:02:44.790> at<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.060> and

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
cooler as well take a look at that and

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:53.750 
cooler as well take a look at that and
we<00:02:45.990> got<00:02:48.140> ya<00:02:50.630> speaker<00:02:51.630> here<00:02:52.080> at<00:02:52.470> front<00:02:53.340> panel

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
we got ya speaker here at front panel

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.340 
we got ya speaker here at front panel
connector<00:02:54.150> are<00:02:54.270> actually<00:02:54.600> over<00:02:54.690> here

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
connector are actually over here

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.310 
connector are actually over here
so<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.650> will<00:02:55.860> be<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.250> challenge<00:02:56.910> for<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.050> case

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
so that will be a challenge for the case

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.640 
so that will be a challenge for the case

a4 paper this size is a four it's so

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.420 
a4 paper this size is a four it's so
small<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.990> was<00:04:48.229> an<00:04:48.380> unboxing<00:04:48.740> video<00:04:49.070> guys

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
small that was an unboxing video guys
