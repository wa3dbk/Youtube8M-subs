00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.799
 good morning everyone fourth video of the 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.730
 day so if you always see me 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.889
 dressed like this and with this hair 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.660
 razed that I do n't know where they go 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.290
 be patient I got a little one 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.800
 lighting to make a video 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.380
 that I had not done for some time or 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.180
 talk about a product per season 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.160
 so it occurred to me to make you a 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:30.529
 video viewfinder with some lipstick that 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.890
 I think I will use this a lot 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.780
 spring was a video of a 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.020
 video preparation a kind of 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:44.120
 exhumation because I don't think so 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:48.890
 buy them lipsticks for quite a while there 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.030
 I would swear and those I show you if I do 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.220
 followed by some you will have some 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.740
 certainly already seen are also gods 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.530
 rather old lipsticks though 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.650
 still good, but we'll see anyway 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.790
 maybe I'll give you some ideas already 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.900
 going away the voice because I already have 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.290
 talked a lot 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.350
 so let's go a little by brand for 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.030
 color for I do not know we do by brand 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.909
 which is easier for me 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.329
 then let's start with imac which is fine 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.130
 they are always the largest number 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.229
 some are really old too 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.450
 still work because I don't see them 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.490
 should throw away 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.850
 have not undergone swear transformations 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:33.280
 then the first is this sexy file of 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.040
 a very old collection, the murphy 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.840
 these here and this is beautiful 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.080
 Campo 80 years, however , I still put it 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:49.970
 the other night and I like it is a nice fuchsia 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:52.990
 with iris cold sciences and 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.770
 this as in with very cold and fuchsia 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.380
 slightly giraud is not is not 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.390
 it is not beautiful covering that is with so many 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.820
 past becomes opaque but in short it is 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.860
 also very modular and this is a 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.560
 color that I do not use very often though 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.550
 sometimes I like to pull out of the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.709
 hat 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.000
 then there is always what remains on pink 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.700
 I know they know right now that 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.849
 nightmare that a beautiful light pink 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:27.549
 opaque cold not even very clear a 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:30.030
 see it from here to a pin maybe of di 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.030
 Inside there 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:37.150
 then another you saw me 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.900
 wear a few times you move on to 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.160
 big coral turned out then maybe here is 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.599
 I write everybody I didn't like because 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.880
 as you know my provinces is not that 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.730
 they are really phantasmagoric a 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:54.370
 what beautiful orange will tell the coral 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.829
 to see it so it seems little coral that 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.840
 the last one actually a new view new 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.690
 entry and I swear I didn't buy myself 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.870
 they gave him for my birthday 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:08.380
 and that is where the red that I am is red 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.470
 lacked because of rossini galore ed 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.799
 it is actually a red orange 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:19.000
 I have many pure reds and many reds with 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:21.819
 a bit of rose inside but of Russians 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.150
 actually orange and it is a color 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.440
 very nice i have to find a nice one 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.780
 dhabi pencil is born because all the 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.370
 red pencils I have are either too dark 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:38.109
 or too cold so it's fine and is 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.549
 this one here and I thank my very much 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:44.560
 antonella life that gave me this 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:47.470
 because he knows that I love passionately i 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.519
 lipsticks mark so it's fall let's say in 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:55.329
 walk the other colors I want 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:58.930
 show you are three then 1 always 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:01.790
 remaining on the coral orange is 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:07.280
 colorboost ii to revlon the color 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:10.189
 the 0 15 all the fruits and if I succeed to 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.409
 even opening this has had a means 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:15.439
 accident because it's dug I don't know what 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:18.340
 it happened to me and it's a nice orange though 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:25.280
 here it is totally change finish is 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:28.360
 rather shear buttery know bright if 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:33.530
 less spread even just up to driving 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:38.620
 another color was better then me 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:42.110
 really like it is the scandal of the masca 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.680
 if he complains fire can be re-protected 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.729
 of the masca are very models 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.900
 essential fig 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:57.349
 this is also a rose where I put it here 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:05:01.190
 there is also a piece then a rose with 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:04.270
 a tip of super opaque salmon ray 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.220
 opaque super covering these 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.789
 absolutely here with perfect lips 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.919
 because I often chapped lips if 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.289
 I put on lipstick so it marks me all 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.750
 so all the cuticles have one 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.570
 very good duration and the with this 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.030
 color 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.160
 I must have advised me carlotta 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.570
 may be inspired by one of the 630 videos 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.570
 in which the mask speaks of lipsticks 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.530
 but I really like it last but really 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.330
 last but not least this is a gift for 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.960
 which I will never thank enough 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:42.580
 tania and francesca is not really a 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:46.670
 lipstick but is a velveteen of line crime 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.710
 it's a wonderful color between the two that 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.780
 they gave me this, I must say that 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.220
 what inspires me most spring 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:58.130
 why and tibet 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.220
 if this you will never see it, there is 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.070
 let's make 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.780
 patience trust me is not really a 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.480
 lipstick because in the shape of a 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:12.050
 gloss however is practically a tint 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:15.080
 lips that once dry to a 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:18.440
 absolutely velvet finish and no 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.510
 transfer and does not even go to 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.790
 cry I must have already talked about it though 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:26.150
 I wore one of these the red one 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:28.400
 velvet at lunch on the second Christmas day 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.280
 and it lasted me throughout the lunch too 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.780
 then a super super product then 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.750
 I show it here and then I don't 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.980
 streaker or more because it will not come away anymore 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.650
 then just put on a finish 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:43.220
 slightly shiny but plan to be both 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:47.790
 escape now I leave you here so 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:52.680
 meanwhile you see it becomes precisely 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:55.170
 velvety opaque and does not even move to 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:07:00.810
 cry now we see out of time then 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:03.560
 I show them these are precisely one 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:06.930
 selection are not all lipsticks 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.580
 first true of spring inspiration that 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.260
 I have, however, a little those I have 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:14.280
 recovered and that inspired me 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:16.890
 this video so I then go here 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.900
 under a few names maybe a little 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.720
 also where to find them in the meantime this post 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.030
 is slowly drowning and one more 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.830
 a little shiny as you can see if 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:28.710
 let's say to dry completely 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.810
 it takes a few minutes but here 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:34.650
 advice always in application of 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:37.800
 velvet in precision steady hand because 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:40.740
 especially in the bow area of 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.440
 Cupid wrong and if you go out and 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:47.010
 fine and could no longer correct however 

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:50.730
 they are really products that is from the point 

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:52.590
 view of exceptional performance e 

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.360
 don't really have the voice anymore 

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.100
 so just close here and I'll do it 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.750
 see the Venetian colors again 

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:01.050
 unfortunately it has not dried yet 

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:05.090
 everything but otherwise I know we're here 

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:09.420
 I still don't know how much here I would say that 

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:12.600
 you've seen it enough and nothing for 

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.220
 this short video and everything i hope you in 

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.940
 somehow there was helpful and there 

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.390
 let's see to the next 

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.390
 bye Bye
