00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.800 
him in position yeah you want it you
don't<00:02:04.430> want<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:04.640> push<00:02:05.090> bells<00:02:05.330> too<00:02:05.510> soon<00:02:05.720> as

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
don't want to push bells too soon as

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.540 
don't want to push bells too soon as
you're<00:02:05.930> upside<00:02:06.290> down<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.680> probably<00:02:06.950> if<00:02:07.220> Ryan

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
you're upside down and probably if Ryan

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.340 
you're upside down and probably if Ryan
is<00:02:07.730> probably<00:02:08.000> okay<00:02:08.300> tell<00:02:08.600> them<00:02:08.750> they<00:02:08.990> turned

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
is probably okay tell them they turned

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.080 
is probably okay tell them they turned
this<00:02:09.470> car<00:02:09.710> over<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.130> then<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.369> can<00:02:10.550> get<00:02:10.730> out<00:02:10.940> of

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
this car over and then I can get out of

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.910 
this car over and then I can get out of
here<00:02:11.240> because<00:02:11.540> with<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:11.930> down<00:02:12.200> like<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:12.620> it

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
here because with it down like that it

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.560 
here because with it down like that it
makes<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.250> very<00:02:13.280> difficult<00:02:13.580> as<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.030> driver<00:02:14.300> to

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
makes it very difficult as a driver to

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.930 
makes it very difficult as a driver to
get<00:02:15.110> yourself<00:02:15.320> out<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.710> that<00:02:15.890> situation<00:02:16.280> so

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
get yourself out of that situation so

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.670 
get yourself out of that situation so
hopefully<00:02:17.420> that's<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.720> case<00:02:17.810> here<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.470> Ryan

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
hopefully that's the case here that Ryan

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.260 
hopefully that's the case here that Ryan
is<00:02:18.770> okay<00:02:19.070> he's<00:02:19.190> telling<00:02:19.430> me<00:02:19.520> turn<00:02:19.820> this<00:02:20.000> over

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
is okay he's telling me turn this over

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.380 
is okay he's telling me turn this over
and<00:02:20.570> we'll<00:02:20.930> get<00:02:21.110> out<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.290> here<00:02:22.240> again<00:02:23.240> the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
and we'll get out of here again the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:31.980 
and we'll get out of here again the
wings<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:23.990> aerodynamics<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:24.710> these<00:02:24.830> cars

time they've done this they had this

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.770

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
help but when that car lands on top even

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.210 
help but when that car lands on top even
though<00:03:05.420> these<00:03:05.930> cases<00:03:06.350> are<00:03:06.440> really<00:03:06.709> strong<00:03:06.920> it

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
though these cases are really strong it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.860 
though these cases are really strong it
will<00:03:07.340> push<00:03:07.550> that<00:03:07.730> roof<00:03:08.000> down<00:03:08.270> and<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:08.690> just

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
will push that roof down and it just

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.620 
will push that roof down and it just
makes<00:03:09.020> it<00:03:09.140> difficult<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:10.190> try<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.430> get<00:03:10.610> out<00:03:10.850> and

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
makes it difficult to try to get out and

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.090 
makes it difficult to try to get out and
I'm<00:03:11.750> sure<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:11.930> Ryan<00:03:12.290> was<00:03:12.410> communicating
