system but I can fill this up through

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.270 
system but I can fill this up through
the<00:02:41.940> top<00:02:42.200> takes<00:02:43.200> about<00:02:43.290> six<00:02:43.709> minutes<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.069> fill

the top takes about six minutes to fill

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.240 
the top takes about six minutes to fill
that<00:02:44.310> maybe<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.670> little<00:02:44.790> more<00:02:44.970> than<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:46.250> and

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
that maybe a little more than that and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.759 
that maybe a little more than that and
then<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.489> can<00:02:47.640> take<00:02:47.819> this<00:02:48.030> barrel<00:02:48.560> instead<00:02:49.560> of

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
drip irrigation system but that got me

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.420 
drip irrigation system but that got me
going<00:03:15.420> about<00:03:15.959> something<00:03:16.380> else<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:17.100> got<00:03:17.280> me

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
going about something else that got me

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.120 
going about something else that got me
going<00:03:17.459> about<00:03:17.910> rainwater<00:03:18.510> collection<00:03:19.130> our

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
going about rainwater collection our

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.490 
going about rainwater collection our
garage<00:03:20.459> has<00:03:20.700> no<00:03:20.850> gutter<00:03:21.090> on<00:03:21.299> it<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.630> i<00:03:22.350> was

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
garage has no gutter on it and i was

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.009 
garage has no gutter on it and i was
thinking<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.329> we<00:03:24.480> were<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.600> put<00:03:24.810> gutter

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
thinking that if we were to put gutter

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.729 
thinking that if we were to put gutter
on<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.290> garage<00:03:25.910> we<00:03:26.910> could<00:03:27.239> have<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.620> barrel<00:03:28.620> in

on the garage we could have a barrel in

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.349 
on the garage we could have a barrel in
the<00:03:28.920> back<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:30.420> bail<00:03:30.720> in<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.109> front<00:03:31.440> or<00:03:32.359> put

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359
