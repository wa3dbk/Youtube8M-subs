00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.329
 schleck 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:14.939
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:15.980
 with them 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.650
 you are going to compare that amount 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.470
 Of course they know funny 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.470
 how can it be so bad 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.210
 as well as a couple of minutes before tonight 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.280
 despite the unemployment situation explained is clear 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.870
 by devoting himself to making monkeys of youth this Romanian case as in 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.399
 Spain 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.440
 the only student free of right 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.780
 and is exposed to diseases and ill-treatment 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.780
 you should not buy something produced this way 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.750
 but as we see this specimen 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.200
 think more about your personal satisfaction in the whole 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.200
 as his companions 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.960
 that's where there was consumption through the conduit 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.240
 Caramba love packaged foods 6 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.850
 these data are very comfortable and quick to prepare 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.850
 the general message 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.090
 and each of them 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.460
 to create the large amount of waste 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.030
 gregorio towers 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.659
 I could separate them 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.659
 and deposit them in the different recycling containers 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.860
 but of course that would be very uncomfortable for him 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.170
 arrived with inputs that this is a night more alien to the consequences 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.120
 destructive of their actions 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.200
 about the resources of the planet 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.520
 they have also installed themselves in what they did 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.990
 Province 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.540
 with respect to the last boy fortunately there are individuals like 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.920
 you 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.079
 that have evolved 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.869
 towards responsible voting 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.029
 a new species very similar to you 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:17.029
 but the custom is much more reasonable 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.599
 ask him 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.599
 the evolutionary step 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.769
 this is 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.780
 in his homily that is evolving as with his muse as responsible light and not 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.490
 it seems too traumatic
