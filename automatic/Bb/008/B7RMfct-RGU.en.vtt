00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:09.240
 4 This time, let's look at changing the layout of the screen. 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.030
 I'll do it 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.839
 What does it mean to change the layout? 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.939
 Does 3dview now exist this way 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:26.119
 But we found out that we're switching to that quad view. Control Alt q 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:31.060
 Press to change this. 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.060
 There may be something like that, but we have more screen 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.050
 As I want 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:42.019
 There can be customized If you look Yogi 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:47.239
 Take a good look in the corner of the eo cursor at the end of the show so that is a slash 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:48.170
 If you move this, your cursor will turn into an arrow and a cross. 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.589
 That's it. 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.589
 Click on it and you'll see a left-hand side. 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:04.010
 4 What is this? 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.010
 This way, it's split into two. 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.840
 So this side as to what actions 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.130
 It's a different view from here . 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.320
 For example, if this is the only control Alt q, 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.570
 That's it. 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.390
 This is the top view 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.500
 We want to see front star in this side 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.420
 I can see it with the front desk like this . So it works smoothly. 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:38.190
 Sometimes it is necessary to change the layout in order to do so 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.420
 So let's see if you can change the layout of the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.930
 I am. 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.000
 One more look at Yoyogi has jumped to visit again 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.000
 Left-click and draw my 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.540
 If it goes down, the screen will end up in two. 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.540
 No. 6 This screen shows , for example, 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.880
 I pulled the emulsion out of the wet I guess the user perspective as the white perspective 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.810
 As we'll'm going to be all these things are possible 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.970
 I do not change with great freedom on the screen now, please do so, move 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:16.480
 I want to get rid of the girl again. 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:19.209
 How do I get rid of it? Leave the screen. 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.319
 The cursor to the arrow shown yeogida doeguyo 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:27.400
 If you put it up a little, you can see the arrow. 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.459
 You can see this. Now, in this state, 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.560
 Press simyeon float Add 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:38.890
 It'll fit you down. 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:42.130
 Likewise, the left side of the left side is not the right side. 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:48.250
 If I say I'm going to get rid of the right part, 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:51.910
 Left-click on the mouse and push it to the right to see if you can watch the second episode. 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.250
 In this state, the mouse jumps 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:03:00.110
 Then I left the left side 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:05.480
 There can be customized as you wish to do so, tax reasons materials 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:08.300
 So what eopgetjiman sseusil Whatever this way 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.110
 2 1 It's messy. 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.110
 I got it. 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:23.960
 Oh, is not it give you eliminate in this way do the job hasiguyo 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.960
 I now eat what I make this way 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:34.050
 I really want to save this layout to this zerg 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:37.620
 Then you can see that the release screen layout 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:43.920
 I can configure the layout to do things here in various ways. 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:48.870
 Yes Typically now we have a 3d printer modeling to output this 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:53.040
 Because you learn to use the default one than the other there is this 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.200
 If you want to save, press the plus button Here He 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.590
 Then the default is 00 days. 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:02.140
 I come out you see Press dwaeseo set automatically 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.340
 Suddenly 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.340
 You can change the name of the girl. 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:16.209
 My Layer 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:19.660
 If you try this way, you can actually see the different layouts 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:24.639
 If you put things in my layout 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:27.760
 10 You will be able to check the layout so you want to 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:32.350
 I know you can make changes as soon as you can . 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:39.280
 The purpose of this lecture but to'm gonna finally touch one more word 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:45.550
 Do not click on it yet with the cross shape at the end. 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.540
 Hold down Shift and click on the mouse to see what's been done. 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.990
 By way of 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:54.310
 I get it in a separate window. 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:59.710
 What if it 's useful to subtract a separate window like this 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.880
 For example, if you are currently using two or more monitors 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.900
 You'll be there. 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:08.770
 So if you put it on a separate monitor, you'll be a great pacemaker. 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:11.830
 So in that case it's useful to go on this road 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.720
 That shows once again I touch the cold source haebolkkayo 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:19.510
 After turning into a cross shape, press the easy frame 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:26.669
 Please click and move slightly . 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:26.669
 Then you can confirm that the same thing comes out separately.
