hi this is Jeff battling husband and one
of<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.010> engineers<00:00:02.490> at<00:00:02.730> valve<00:00:02.909> was<00:00:03.120> working<00:00:03.389> on

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
of the engineers at valve was working on

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.930 
of the engineers at valve was working on
the<00:00:03.659> controller<00:00:04.140> project<00:00:04.650> we<00:00:05.580> wanted<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.850> put

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
the controller project we wanted to put

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.540 
the controller project we wanted to put
together<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.240> gameplay<00:00:06.629> video<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:07.410> shows<00:00:07.770> how

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
together a gameplay video that shows how

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.830 
together a gameplay video that shows how
the<00:00:08.580> controllers<00:00:09.059> used<00:00:09.269> in<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.480> number<00:00:09.690> of

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
the controllers used in a number of

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.990 
the controllers used in a number of
different<00:00:10.139> types<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.800> games<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.400> we<00:00:11.670> have<00:00:11.790> some

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
different types of games so we have some

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.970 
different types of games so we have some
first-person<00:00:12.509> shooters<00:00:12.809> some<00:00:13.349> strategy

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
first-person shooters some strategy

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.010 
first-person shooters some strategy
games<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.969> some<00:00:15.120> other<00:00:15.240> just<00:00:15.540> mouse<00:00:15.690> pointer

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
games and some other just mouse pointer

type<00:00:16.320> games<00:00:16.619> we're<00:00:17.609> going<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.789> try<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:17.940> put

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
type games we're going to try and put

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.390 
type games we're going to try and put
together<00:00:18.420> these<00:00:19.380> updates<00:00:19.800> pretty<00:00:20.010> frequently

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
together these updates pretty frequently

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.849

of games you'd like to see go ahead and
let<00:00:26.880> us<00:00:26.970> know<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.240> comments<00:00:28.910> so<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.150> first

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
let us know in the comments so the first

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.550 
let us know in the comments so the first
game<00:00:30.420> we're<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> show<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.170> portal

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
game we're going to show you is portal

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
to one of the most important features of

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.720 
to one of the most important features of
the<00:00:34.350> controllers<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.160> two<00:00:35.280> track<00:00:35.489> pads

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the controllers that the two track pads

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.670 
the controllers that the two track pads
are<00:00:35.940> fully<00:00:36.120> configurable<00:00:36.750> what<00:00:37.530> we're

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
are fully configurable what we're

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.110 
are fully configurable what we're
showing<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.430> call<00:00:38.579> legacy<00:00:38.969> mode

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
showing here is what we call legacy mode

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.000 
showing here is what we call legacy mode
which<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.450> playing<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.079> game<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.469> hasn't<00:00:40.980> been

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
which is playing a game that hasn't been

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.319 
which is playing a game that hasn't been
modified<00:00:41.460> at<00:00:41.640> all<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.969> support<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
modified at all to support the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.520 
modified at all to support the
controller<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.379> standard

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
controller so this is just standard

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.430 
controller so this is just standard
keyboard<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.340> mouse<00:00:44.460> style<00:00:44.879> portal<00:00:45.570> 2<00:00:45.719> but

keyboard and mouse style portal 2 but

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.990 
keyboard and mouse style portal 2 but
the<00:00:46.530> controller<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.039> acting<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.730> mouse

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the controller is acting like a mouse

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.110 
the controller is acting like a mouse
and<00:00:48.239> keyboard<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.860> mapped<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.190> output

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120

keyboard<00:00:51.870> events<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.920> portal<00:00:53.340> expects

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
keyboard events that portal expects

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.400 
keyboard events that portal expects
since<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> two<00:00:54.750> track<00:00:54.960> pads<00:00:55.140> can<00:00:55.350> be

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
since the two track pads can be

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.250 
since the two track pads can be
configured<00:00:55.770> independently<00:00:56.660> we<00:00:57.660> use<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
configured independently we use the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.950 
configured independently we use the
right<00:00:58.559> hand<00:00:58.829> pad<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.750> one

right hand pad here to do a one to one
new<00:01:01.410> control<00:01:01.770> mode<00:01:02.210> it's<00:01:03.210> important<00:01:03.600> to

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
new control mode it's important to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.469 
new control mode it's important to
distinguish<00:01:04.500> between<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> joystick

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
distinguish between a like a joystick

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.390 
distinguish between a like a joystick
which<00:01:06.750> does<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> relative<00:01:07.560> or<00:01:07.710> velocity<00:01:07.950> based

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
which does a relative or velocity based

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.730 
which does a relative or velocity based
movement<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.170> mode<00:01:10.409> where

of auto and turned on this next demo is
a<00:03:38.099> game<00:03:38.250> called<00:03:38.400> papers<00:03:38.760> please<00:03:39.000> it's<00:03:39.359> a

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
a game called papers please it's a

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.539 
a game called papers please it's a
predominantly<00:03:40.079> mouse-driven<00:03:40.349> game<00:03:40.919> and<00:03:41.219> so

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
predominantly mouse-driven game and so

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.759 
predominantly mouse-driven game and so
we<00:03:41.700> can<00:03:41.879> use<00:03:42.030> both<00:03:42.299> track<00:03:42.629> pads<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.230> control

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
we can use both track pads to control

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.539 
we can use both track pads to control
the<00:03:43.859> mouse<00:03:43.980> alternately<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:46.230> two<00:03:46.950> mouse

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
the mouse alternately the two mouse

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.069 
the mouse alternately the two mouse
movements<00:03:47.969> get<00:03:48.090> blended<00:03:48.299> together<00:03:48.569> so<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.049> can

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
movements get blended together so I can

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.449 
movements get blended together so I can
move<00:03:49.349> with<00:03:49.530> my<00:03:49.650> left<00:03:49.859> thumb<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.280> then<00:03:50.370> my

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
move with my left thumb and then my

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.220 
move with my left thumb and then my
right<00:03:50.639> thumb<00:03:50.849> and<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.659> allows<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.079> do<00:03:52.200> a

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
right thumb and it allows you to do a

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.979 
right thumb and it allows you to do a
really<00:03:52.500> quick<00:03:52.560> walk<00:03:53.099> across<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.579> screen<00:03:53.989> it's

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
really quick walk across the screen it's

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.020 
really quick walk across the screen it's
a<00:03:55.139> very<00:03:55.530> comfortable<00:03:55.919> way<00:03:56.069> to<00:03:56.129> control<00:03:56.760> games

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
a very comfortable way to control games

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.300 
a very comfortable way to control games
that<00:03:57.329> need<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.109> move<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.500> mouse<00:03:58.650> or<00:03:58.829> precisely

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
that need to move the mouse or precisely

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.920 
that need to move the mouse or precisely
and<00:03:59.579> yet<00:03:59.699> over<00:03:59.940> large<00:04:00.150> distances<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.900> the
