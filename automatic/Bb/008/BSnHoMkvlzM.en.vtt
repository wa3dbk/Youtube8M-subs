00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.299
 hello girls welcome in this video 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.310
 I 'm going to share a beautiful 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:09.370
 Nail decoration for the feet with 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.170
 flowers and stay to watch this video 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.740
 we start girls I will use this 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.840
 black color and this golden color too 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.500
 I'm going to use this white color and this 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.060
 lemon green color below you 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.360
 I show in the sequence that we are going to 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.739
 paint our nails as next step 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.779
 let's decorate our first 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.780
 using a brush of detail of 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.880
 black paint let's make some petals 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.510
 this way in the corner part 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.030
 of the nail forming a flower 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.699
 when I apply lemon green on these 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.460
 nails first apply the color white and 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.010
 after the green layer is applied 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.909
 no this helps to have better 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.649
 green lemon view we are going to do 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.930
 the next flower where we are going to make it 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.649
 in the other corner of the nail in the part 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.719
 from above this type of brush that comes 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.609
 as the part down is very 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.580
 favorable to do others and to do 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.460
 flowers 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.390
 so greatly it facilitates work is one 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.150
 from my favorites 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.310
 This is how we are already 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.890
 our two flowers now we go to the 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.229
 next to the sides of the flowers 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.740
 let's do details with lines like 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.659
 curves like this in this step we're going 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.670
 to use a super detail brush 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.810
 delgadito to be provided for 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.909
 make these lines 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.070
 we will form the lines on the sides 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.310
 giving you that better vision for our 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.310
 decor 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.149
 right away we're going to take white paint and 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.939
 we're going to put it in the center of the flower 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.930
 in this way and the same thing we're going to do 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.930
 with the other flower 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.820
 right away we're going to take the lemon green and 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.930
 we are going to apply it to one side of the 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.310
 lines this will make them highlight those 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.380
 lines and look better more decoration 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.000
 I must tell you in this step that the flowers 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.920
 they are not going to stay with this white point 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.319
 we are also going to apply the green 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.930
 lemon 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.269
 we apply the color white and then the 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.780
 green color so you have better vision 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.909
 the green color know details as well as 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.209
 it is our first one we already passed to the 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:28.600
 third one on this nail we're also going to 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.910
 make two flowers one for each corner 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.800
 As you can see it's super easy to do 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.000
 this decoration and these flowers that 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.110
 we are doing are not difficult 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.330
 right away we are going to do the detail of 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.319
 the lines on the same side of the 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.510
 same way 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.370
 girls these were the colors that I 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.749
 I was inspired for this decoration I hope 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.189
 that you even with your colors 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:52.760
 favorites once we've finished the 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.469
 lines 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.799
 now let's apply white paint 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:59.930
 in the errors this is one more idea for 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.989
 decorate our nails super easy in 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.280
 home remember that what we can do 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.680
 in assuming the hands also what 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.510
 we can do to help the feet 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.040
 immediately we went to put the painting 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.040
 green on the lines 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.010
 good girls with our last 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.960
 details is how we come to the final 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.180
 of our adequacy finally we're going to 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.780
 apply a layer of protective gloss and 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.790
 it would be everything 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.230
 apply these are the final result of 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.819
 I hope our decor will
