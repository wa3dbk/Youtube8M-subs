neighborhood<00:00:27.739> of<00:00:27.770> Brussels<00:00:28.340> so<00:00:29.059> I<00:00:29.090> think<00:00:29.210> that

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
neighborhood of Brussels so I think that

view and the the movable tips all on the
interest<00:01:38.869> instruments<00:01:39.799> I<00:01:39.979> believe<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:40.999> the

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
learning curve is quite short now than

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.359 
learning curve is quite short now than
it<00:01:43.729> is<00:01:43.880> for<00:01:44.569> a<00:01:44.869> classical<00:01:45.439> laparoscopy<00:01:46.159> I

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
it is for a classical laparoscopy I

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.709 
it is for a classical laparoscopy I
don't<00:01:46.909> think<00:01:47.649> robotics<00:01:48.649> Elena<00:01:49.429> is<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:50.299> future

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
don't think robotics Elena is the future

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.800 
don't think robotics Elena is the future
but<00:01:50.990> to<00:01:51.469> me<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:51.799> is<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:51.979> present<00:01:52.569> robotics<00:01:53.569> is

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
but to me it is the present robotics is

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.679 
but to me it is the present robotics is
there<00:01:54.169> and<00:01:54.409> I'm<00:01:55.340> sure<00:01:55.639> robotics<00:01:56.209> is<00:01:56.359> there<00:01:56.539> to

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
there and I'm sure robotics is there to

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.260 
there and I'm sure robotics is there to
stay<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.259> can<00:01:58.130> only<00:01:58.310> evolve<00:01:58.939> in<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.179> future

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
stay and can only evolve in the future

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.339 
stay and can only evolve in the future
so<00:02:00.159> for<00:02:01.159> me<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.459> is<00:02:01.639> undoubtedly<00:02:02.419> so<00:02:02.990> that

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
so for me it is undoubtedly so that

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:08.050 
so for me it is undoubtedly so that
robotics<00:02:04.159> has<00:02:04.459> a<00:02:04.489> major<00:02:05.359> advantages<00:02:06.139> to<00:02:07.060> open

first of all in report to or in contrast
to<00:02:14.750> open<00:02:15.230> surgery<00:02:15.940> we<00:02:16.940> can<00:02:17.150> see<00:02:17.420> better

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
to open surgery we can see better

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.650 
to open surgery we can see better
because<00:02:18.200> we<00:02:18.440> have<00:02:18.680> did<00:02:19.010> not<00:02:19.250> only<00:02:19.430> a

three-dimensional view but you do the

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.309 
three-dimensional view but you do the
camera<00:02:21.920> tech

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
camera tech

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.250

we<00:02:22.950> also<00:02:23.099> have<00:02:23.249> an<00:02:23.579> enlargement<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:25.019> you

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
we also have an enlargement of this you

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.690 
we also have an enlargement of this you
and<00:02:26.120> due<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.739> specific<00:02:28.739> technique<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.639> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
and due to the specific technique of the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.050 
and due to the specific technique of the
and<00:02:30.030> wrists<00:02:30.420> arms<00:02:30.719> we<00:02:31.499> are<00:02:31.650> now<00:02:31.799> able<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.849> do

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
and wrists arms we are now able to do

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.099 
and wrists arms we are now able to do
really<00:02:33.540> microscopic<00:02:34.349> work<00:02:35.930> in<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.739> body<00:02:37.950> and

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
really microscopic work in the body and

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.470 
really microscopic work in the body and
so<00:02:40.109> for<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.439> patient<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.250> has<00:02:41.549> major

the robot in radical prostatectomy which

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.339 
the robot in radical prostatectomy which
is<00:03:24.719> today<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.109> major<00:03:25.439> indication<00:03:26.280> for

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
is today the major indication for

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.869 
is today the major indication for
robotics<00:03:28.349> in<00:03:28.650> urology<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:30.540> believe<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.879> first

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
robotics in urology I believe that first

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.300 
robotics in urology I believe that first
of<00:03:33.060> all<00:03:33.209> you<00:03:33.509> have<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.199> minimal<00:03:34.560> in<00:03:34.739> facility

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
of all you have the minimal in facility

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.550 
of all you have the minimal in facility
that<00:03:35.909> means<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.479> for<00:03:36.689> the<00:03:36.810> patient<00:03:37.349> it's

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
that means that for the patient it's

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.129 
that means that for the patient it's
less<00:03:37.799> painful<00:03:37.949> he<00:03:38.729> doesn't<00:03:39.090> have<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.299> scar<00:03:39.750> and

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
less painful he doesn't have a scar and

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.030 
less painful he doesn't have a scar and
so<00:03:40.709> on<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:40.979> so<00:03:41.069> on<00:03:41.659> it<00:03:42.659> is<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.290> have<00:03:43.439> also
