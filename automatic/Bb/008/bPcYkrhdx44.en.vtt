 Episode 4 is a bit 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.240

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.560
 as she was with the actual stuff 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.140
 then they would do it themselves 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.579
 Earn a sale would then occur 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.950
 even that the privy bank

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.910
 means no more coal for the new 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.010
 inmates because that is ripe for 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.900
 shut up 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.970

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.010
 Do you make such a small time jump the 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.560
 The prisons are running great 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.079
 Bolt is a velvet roller looking at that 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.000

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.620

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.530
 the end and I'm predicting for 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.390

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.310

 am so happy that it is now in 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.750
 the second half works fine too 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.300
 after that is over but that's just the way it is 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.970
 the end or the fate of every good one 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.920
 At some point she is over that was over 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.100
