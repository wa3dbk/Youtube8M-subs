me<00:00:24.470> so<00:00:25.470> everything<00:00:26.250> technically<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.390> running

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
me so everything technically is running

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.870 
me so everything technically is running
wirelessly<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.740> video<00:00:29.039> feed<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.400> running

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
wirelessly of the video feed is running

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.640 
wirelessly of the video feed is running
wirelessly<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.689> tracking<00:00:31.050> data<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.349> running

wirelessly the tracking data is running

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.580 
wirelessly the tracking data is running
wirelessly<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.669> still<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.630> weird<00:00:34.140> pin

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
wirelessly I still have that weird pin

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.090 
wirelessly I still have that weird pin
19<00:00:35.130> error<00:00:35.570> which<00:00:36.570> changes<00:00:37.020> black<00:00:37.290> green<00:00:37.800> you

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
19 error which changes black green you

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.139 
19 error which changes black green you
can<00:00:38.219> solve<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.610> by<00:00:38.760> snipping<00:00:40.100> pin<00:00:41.149> 19's

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
can solve that by snipping pin 19's

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.470 
can solve that by snipping pin 19's
cable<00:00:42.899> hdmi<00:00:43.500> cable<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.789> as<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.210> see

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480

there's<00:00:46.079> very<00:00:46.649> little<00:00:47.190> latency<00:00:47.910> within<00:00:48.750> um<00:00:48.930> I

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
there's very little latency within um I

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.160 
there's very little latency within um I
can't<00:00:49.980> show<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> video<00:00:50.579> feed<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:50.910> a

can't show you the video feed but a
tracking<00:00:52.170> data<00:00:52.410> wise<00:00:52.969> everything<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.120> working

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
tracking data wise everything is working

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.200 
tracking data wise everything is working
so<00:00:54.570> head<00:00:54.960> roll<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:56.250> rest<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.610> or<00:00:56.789> pex<00:00:57.059> is

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
head but I can turn on on the peak mode

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.840 
head but I can turn on on the peak mode
on<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:04.470> pics<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.979> look<00:01:05.100> around<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.460> screen

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
on for pics and look around the screen

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.410 
on for pics and look around the screen
and<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.590> swing<00:01:08.420> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and you can see that I can swing the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.460 
and you can see that I can swing the
riffs<00:01:10.040> around<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.460> mad<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:14.240> nothing<00:01:15.240> is

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
riffs around like mad and nothing is

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.230 
riffs around like mad and nothing is
doing<00:01:16.470> anything<00:01:18.350> like<00:01:19.350> crazy<00:01:20.009> at<00:01:20.310> all

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.930 

so<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.930> working<00:01:25.320> beautifully<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:28.560> then

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
so that's working beautifully and then

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.680 
so that's working beautifully and then
you<00:01:29.940> can't<00:01:30.180> see<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:30.960> well<00:01:31.470> through<00:01:32.040> this

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
you can't see very well through this

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.840 
you can't see very well through this
especially<00:01:33.690> with<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:35.780> hdmi<00:01:36.780> error<00:01:39.530> fix<00:01:40.530> that

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
especially with the hdmi error fix that

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.590 
especially with the hdmi error fix that
okay<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.840> um<00:01:43.460> yeah<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.670> hdmi<00:01:45.060> air<00:01:45.330> is<00:01:45.450> going

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
okay but um yeah that hdmi air is going

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.280 
okay but um yeah that hdmi air is going
to<00:01:45.770> persist<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.780> frame<00:01:49.050> rates

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
to persist but a the frame rates

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:58.870 
to persist but a the frame rates
actually<00:01:49.790> running<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:51.180> really<00:01:51.420> smoothly

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.600 

it's<00:01:59.880> just<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.900> for<00:02:01.290> pics<00:02:01.610> doing

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
it's just it's just for pics doing

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.160 
it's just it's just for pics doing
similar<00:02:02.940> things<00:02:03.950> but<00:02:04.950> um
