so<00:00:06.410> comparing<00:00:06.830> the<00:00:06.950> two<00:00:07.129> from<00:00:07.460> the<00:00:07.580> front<00:00:07.850> you

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 
so comparing the two from the front you

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.430 
so comparing the two from the front you
can<00:00:08.029> see<00:00:08.180> that<00:00:08.540> the<00:00:08.630> newer<00:00:08.809> generation

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
can see that the newer generation

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.560 
can see that the newer generation
obviously<00:00:09.889> has<00:00:10.340> a<00:00:10.370> bigger<00:00:10.670> four-inch<00:00:11.300> screen

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
obviously has a bigger four-inch screen

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.140 
obviously has a bigger four-inch screen
looks<00:00:12.049> a<00:00:12.349> bit<00:00:12.559> nicer<00:00:13.009> than<00:00:13.639> the<00:00:13.759> previous

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
looks a bit nicer than the previous

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.400 
looks a bit nicer than the previous
generation<00:00:14.210> they<00:00:14.750> both<00:00:14.900> have<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.230> home

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
generation they both have the home

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.080 
generation they both have the home
buttons<00:00:15.799> and<00:00:16.070> they<00:00:16.460> both<00:00:16.610> have<00:00:16.820> the<00:00:16.880> front

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
buttons and they both have the front

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.670 
buttons and they both have the front
facing<00:00:17.420> camera<00:00:17.720> the<00:00:17.900> camera<00:00:18.080> on<00:00:18.230> the<00:00:18.380> ipod

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
touch the newer one the front facing

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.170 
touch the newer one the front facing
camera<00:00:21.260> is<00:00:21.320> improved<00:00:21.770> a<00:00:21.980> lot<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:22.430> that's

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
camera is improved a lot and that's

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.100 
camera is improved a lot and that's
something<00:00:23.360> else<00:00:23.540> to<00:00:23.660> note<00:00:25.180> probably<00:00:26.180> the

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
something else to note probably the

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.170 
something else to note probably the
biggest<00:00:27.290> change<00:00:27.680> in<00:00:27.950> the<00:00:28.070> new<00:00:28.550> generation

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
biggest change in the new generation

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.030 
biggest change in the new generation
ipod<00:00:29.600> can<00:00:29.840> be<00:00:29.960> viewed<00:00:30.170> on<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.530> back<00:00:30.740> as<00:00:31.010> you

ipod can be viewed on the back as you
can<00:00:31.160> see<00:00:31.370> it's<00:00:31.520> a<00:00:31.610> lot<00:00:31.790> taller<00:00:32.059> and<00:00:32.360> it

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
can see it's a lot taller and it

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.900 
can see it's a lot taller and it
features<00:00:33.080> a<00:00:33.110> few<00:00:33.590> new<00:00:33.710> changes<00:00:34.190> it<00:00:34.580> doesn't

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
features a few new changes it doesn't

features a few new changes it doesn't
actually<00:00:35.000> tell<00:00:35.270> you<00:00:35.390> how<00:00:35.510> many<00:00:35.690> gigabytes<00:00:35.900> you

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
actually tell you how many gigabytes you

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.230 
actually tell you how many gigabytes you
can<00:00:36.500> see<00:00:36.680> where<00:00:37.430> it<00:00:37.520> does<00:00:37.700> on<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:37.940> older

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.240 
can see where it does on the older

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.810 
can see where it does on the older
generation<00:00:38.720> it<00:00:38.930> has<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.170> little<00:00:39.650> loop<00:00:40.490> clip

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
generation it has the little loop clip

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.640 
generation it has the little loop clip
right<00:00:41.030> here<00:00:41.090> which<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:41.840> previous<00:00:42.200> model<00:00:42.500> does

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
right here which the previous model does

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.060 
right here which the previous model does
not<00:00:42.710> support<00:00:43.190> it<00:00:43.550> has<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.330> jack<00:00:44.570> on<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:45.620> right

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
not support it has the jack on the right

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.250 
not support it has the jack on the right
side<00:00:46.340> which<00:00:46.970> is<00:00:47.150> a<00:00:47.180> little<00:00:47.360> different<00:00:47.870> than

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
side which is a little different than

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.069 
side which is a little different than
the<00:00:48.500> newer<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:49.400> older<00:00:49.640> ipod<00:00:49.940> touch<00:00:50.150> as<00:00:50.420> the

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
the newer the older ipod touch as the

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.280 
the newer the older ipod touch as the
Lightning<00:00:51.470> connector<00:00:51.620> it<00:00:52.370> has<00:00:52.610> speakers

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
Lightning connector it has speakers

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.410 
Lightning connector it has speakers
they're<00:00:54.290> more<00:00:55.070> like<00:00:55.220> the<00:00:55.370> iphone<00:00:55.700> 5<00:00:55.910> compared

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
they're more like the iphone 5 compared

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.350 
they're more like the iphone 5 compared
to<00:00:56.510> that<00:00:56.630> by<00:00:56.810> touch<00:00:57.020> 4th<00:00:57.320> generation<00:00:57.560> and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
to that by touch 4th generation and

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.420 
to that by touch 4th generation and
moving<00:00:59.360> up<00:00:59.600> you<00:00:59.989> can<00:01:00.140> see<00:01:00.380> obviously<00:01:01.280> it's

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
moving up you can see obviously it's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.979 
moving up you can see obviously it's
more<00:01:01.610> of<00:01:01.700> a<00:01:01.730> matte<00:01:01.970> finish<00:01:02.000> opposed<00:01:02.810> to<00:01:02.930> this

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
more of a matte finish opposed to this

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.689 
more of a matte finish opposed to this
really<00:01:03.649> scratch<00:01:03.920> bowl<00:01:04.189> metal<00:01:04.519> on<00:01:04.640> the

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
really scratch bowl metal on the

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.790 
really scratch bowl metal on the
previous<00:01:05.330> generation<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:06.170> then<00:01:06.350> we<00:01:06.440> move<00:01:06.650> up

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
previous generation and then we move up

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.469 
previous generation and then we move up
a<00:01:06.890> little<00:01:06.950> more<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:07.760> see<00:01:07.790> not<00:01:08.120> only<00:01:08.150> does

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
a little more and you see not only does

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.719 
a little more and you see not only does
it<00:01:08.510> have<00:01:08.720> an<00:01:08.840> LED<00:01:09.320> flash<00:01:09.590> but<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.040> camera<00:01:10.370> sort

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
it have an LED flash but the camera sort

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.820 
it have an LED flash but the camera sort
of<00:01:10.850> protrudes<00:01:11.690> out<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.990> device<00:01:12.350> a<00:01:12.380> little<00:01:12.710> bit

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
of protrudes out the device a little bit

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.770 
of protrudes out the device a little bit
it's<00:01:12.979> not<00:01:13.159> really<00:01:13.430> level<00:01:13.820> with<00:01:14.330> any<00:01:14.570> of<00:01:14.690> the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
it's not really level with any of the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.050 
it's not really level with any of the
other<00:01:14.930> device<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.530> it<00:01:15.590> looks<00:01:15.770> a<00:01:16.010> lot<00:01:16.190> better

quality and it is and you can see on the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.060 
quality and it is and you can see on the
older<00:01:20.450> generation<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.229> just<00:01:21.440> have<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.770> small

see<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.820> sides<00:01:26.090> of<00:01:26.299> both<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.630> devices<00:01:26.840> a

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
see the sides of both the devices a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.830 
see the sides of both the devices a
little<00:01:27.470> nicer<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.460> newer<00:01:28.760> ipod<00:01:29.090> touch<00:01:29.540> which

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
little nicer the newer ipod touch which

the sides very similar to the iphone 5

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.200 
the sides very similar to the iphone 5
we<00:01:36.200> can<00:01:36.409> show<00:01:36.860> that<00:01:36.890> really<00:01:37.220> quickly<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:38.030> does

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
we can show that really quickly it does

and the older ipod touch just gets more
scratched<00:01:48.350> up<00:01:48.530> i<00:01:48.740> don't<00:01:48.890> know<00:01:48.979> if<00:01:49.040> it's

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
scratched up i don't know if it's

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.469 
scratched up i don't know if it's
because<00:01:49.280> i've<00:01:49.520> had<00:01:49.640> it<00:01:49.729> for<00:01:49.760> more<00:01:49.970> time<00:01:50.180> or

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
because i've had it for more time or

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.270 
because i've had it for more time or
just<00:01:50.510> a<00:01:50.780> different<00:01:51.110> metal<00:01:51.470> but<00:01:51.979> it<00:01:52.070> does<00:01:52.250> look

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
just a different metal but it does look

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.760 
just a different metal but it does look
it<00:01:52.970> does<00:01:53.210> not<00:01:53.240> look<00:01:53.420> nearly<00:01:53.900> as<00:01:54.020> nice<00:01:54.350> as<00:01:54.650> the

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
it does not look nearly as nice as the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.460 
it does not look nearly as nice as the
newer<00:01:54.950> generation<00:01:55.780> moving<00:01:56.780> on<00:01:56.900> to<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.049> top<00:01:57.320> of

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
newer generation moving on to the top of

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.370 
newer generation moving on to the top of
the<00:01:57.560> device<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:57.799> can<00:01:58.070> see<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:59.330> angle<00:02:00.200> of

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
the device you can see that the angle of

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.249 
the device you can see that the angle of
the<00:02:01.220> bevel<00:02:01.580> on<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:02.240> ipod<00:02:02.540> touch<00:02:02.720> newer

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
the bevel on the ipod touch newer

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.560 
the bevel on the ipod touch newer
generation<00:02:03.830> is<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.189> little<00:02:04.490> more<00:02:04.670> like<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.270> box

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
generation is a little more like a box

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.910 
generation is a little more like a box
you<00:02:05.810> can<00:02:05.900> see<00:02:05.960> if<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.229> sort<00:02:06.439> of<00:02:06.500> angle<00:02:06.680> it

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
you can see if I sort of angle it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.699 
you can see if I sort of angle it
compared<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.970> older<00:02:08.269> device<00:02:08.629> and<00:02:09.019> that

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
compared to the older device and that

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.920 
compared to the older device and that
gives<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.549> nicer<00:02:10.879> feel<00:02:11.090> in<00:02:11.269> my<00:02:11.389> opinion<00:02:11.659> and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
gives a nicer feel in my opinion and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.610 
gives a nicer feel in my opinion and
then<00:02:12.439> the<00:02:12.560> button<00:02:12.799> on<00:02:12.889> the<00:02:12.950> top<00:02:13.129> is

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
then the button on the top is

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.670 
then the button on the top is
smoother<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.810> sticks<00:02:15.810> out<00:02:15.989> more<00:02:16.019> of<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.470> top

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
smoother and sticks out more of the top

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.350 
smoother and sticks out more of the top
opposed<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.400> where<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.790> kind<00:02:17.909> of<00:02:18.060> sticks

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
opposed to this where it kind of sticks

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.250 
opposed to this where it kind of sticks
out<00:02:18.540> as<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.810> slant<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.769> it's<00:02:19.920> harder<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.250> push

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
out as a slant and it's harder to push

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.750 
out as a slant and it's harder to push
side<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.440> both<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.769> devices<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.430> can<00:02:23.459> see

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
side of both the devices you can see

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.520 
side of both the devices you can see
that<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.299> volume<00:02:24.780> buttons<00:02:25.080> look<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.319> lot<00:02:25.470> nicer

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
that the volume buttons look a lot nicer

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.160 
that the volume buttons look a lot nicer
on<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.819> newer<00:02:27.030> generation<00:02:27.659> as<00:02:27.840> they're<00:02:28.019> not

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
on the newer generation as they're not

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.369 
on the newer generation as they're not
protruding<00:02:28.730> as<00:02:29.730> in<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.510> weird<00:02:30.720> angle<00:02:30.870> like<00:02:31.200> they

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
protruding as in a weird angle like they

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.740 
protruding as in a weird angle like they
are<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.190> older<00:02:32.459> device<00:02:32.849> so<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.540> can<00:02:33.629> see

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
are on the older device so you can see

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.809 
are on the older device so you can see
after<00:02:33.930> we<00:02:34.170> loaded<00:02:34.500> up<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.620> Geekbench<00:02:34.950> app<00:02:35.519> and

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
after we loaded up the Geekbench app and

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.809 
after we loaded up the Geekbench app and
turned<00:02:36.390> on<00:02:36.569> both<00:02:37.560> devices<00:02:37.829> you<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.400> see<00:02:38.640> that

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
turned on both devices you can see that

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.839 
turned on both devices you can see that
the<00:02:38.909> newer<00:02:39.120> one<00:02:39.390> scores<00:02:40.019> at<00:02:40.200> at<00:02:40.319> 625<00:02:40.860> compared

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
the newer one scores at at 625 compared

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.819 
the newer one scores at at 625 compared
to<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.060> older<00:02:42.269> one<00:02:42.390> which<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.720> only<00:02:42.870> 392<00:02:43.500> so

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
to the older one which is only 392 so

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.339 
to the older one which is only 392 so
you<00:02:43.920> can<00:02:44.010> see<00:02:44.159> that's<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.849> huge<00:02:45.120> improvement<00:02:45.750> so

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
you can see that's a huge improvement so

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.990 
you can see that's a huge improvement so
now<00:02:46.470> we'll<00:02:46.620> be<00:02:46.709> opening<00:02:47.069> up<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.310> nap<00:02:47.489> on<00:02:47.760> both<00:02:47.970> of

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
now we'll be opening up a nap on both of

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.750 
now we'll be opening up a nap on both of
the<00:02:48.239> ipod<00:02:48.540> touches<00:02:48.959> so<00:02:49.200> settings<00:02:49.950> ready<00:02:50.370> set

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
the ipod touches so settings ready set

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.720 
the ipod touches so settings ready set
go<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:52.170> see<00:02:52.349> it<00:02:52.560> loads<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.890> little<00:02:53.129> faster<00:02:53.549> on

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
go you see it loads a little faster on

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.210 
go you see it loads a little faster on
the<00:02:53.849> newer<00:02:54.060> device<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.019> we<00:02:55.620> can<00:02:55.739> try<00:02:55.950> another

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
the newer device and we can try another

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.479 
the newer device and we can try another
application<00:02:56.940> like<00:02:58.129> try<00:02:59.129> something<00:02:59.459> like

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
application like try something like

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.069 
application like try something like
photos<00:03:00.030> ready<00:03:00.989> set<00:03:01.909> so<00:03:02.909> you<00:03:03.000> see<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.629> appears<00:03:03.989> a

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
photos ready set so you see it appears a

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.569 
photos ready set so you see it appears a
little<00:03:04.290> faster<00:03:04.620> on<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.859> this<00:03:05.099> did<00:03:05.280> will<00:03:05.459> have

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
little faster on this this did will have

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.339 
little faster on this this did will have
one<00:03:05.819> photo<00:03:06.060> but<00:03:06.359> it<00:03:06.629> should<00:03:06.989> be<00:03:07.019> pretty<00:03:07.230> much

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
one photo but it should be pretty much

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.449 
one photo but it should be pretty much
the<00:03:08.069> same<00:03:08.280> in<00:03:08.579> that<00:03:08.640> regards<00:03:10.159> so<00:03:11.159> that's<00:03:11.340> a

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
the same in that regards so that's a

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.430 
the same in that regards so that's a
quick<00:03:11.609> comparison<00:03:11.879> from<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.690> new<00:03:12.840> ipod<00:03:13.260> touch

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
quick comparison from the new ipod touch

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.259 
quick comparison from the new ipod touch
5th<00:03:13.709> generation<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.549> ipod<00:03:14.849> touch<00:03:15.000> 4th

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
5th generation and the ipod touch 4th

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.940 
5th generation and the ipod touch 4th
generation<00:03:15.510> i<00:03:15.959> would<00:03:16.319> definitely<00:03:16.709> recommend

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
generation i would definitely recommend

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.979 
generation i would definitely recommend
getting<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.669> 5th<00:03:17.880> generation<00:03:18.239> for<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.599> extra

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
getting the 5th generation for the extra

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.409 
getting the 5th generation for the extra
100<00:03:19.290> bucks<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.620> has<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.769> way<00:03:20.010> bigger<00:03:20.910> screen

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
100 bucks it has a way bigger screen

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.949 
100 bucks it has a way bigger screen
it's<00:03:22.040> faster<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.310> lot<00:03:23.609> faster<00:03:23.819> it<00:03:24.419> looks<00:03:24.750> so

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
it's faster a lot faster it looks so

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.440 
it's faster a lot faster it looks so
much<00:03:25.079> but<00:03:25.470> nicer<00:03:25.889> it's<00:03:26.069> designed<00:03:26.459> nicer<00:03:26.849> more

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
much but nicer it's designed nicer more

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.960 
much but nicer it's designed nicer more
memory<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.109> it's<00:03:28.230> all<00:03:28.380> together<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:29.549> way

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
memory and it's all together a way

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.510 
memory and it's all together a way
better<00:03:30.090> device
