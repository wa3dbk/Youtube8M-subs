00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
kicks back on for the fire you're going

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.639 
kicks back on for the fire you're going
to<00:01:21.149> make<00:01:21.270> sure<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.840> temperature<00:01:22.560> on

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
to make sure that that temperature on

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.170 
to make sure that that temperature on
your<00:01:22.770> thermostat<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.369> also<00:01:23.610> what's<00:01:23.820> reading

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
your thermostat is also what's reading

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.490 
your thermostat is also what's reading
in<00:01:24.330> at<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> mamar<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:25.050> sitting<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.410> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
in at the mamar that's sitting in the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.790 
in at the mamar that's sitting in the
oil<00:01:25.710> alright<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.759> once<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.690> identify<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
oil alright so once you identify the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.590 
oil alright so once you identify the
problem<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.610> thermostat<00:01:30.090> being<00:01:30.360> off

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
problem of your thermostat being off

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.570

from<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> actual<00:01:31.229> fryer<00:01:31.649> oil<00:01:32.009> temperature

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
from the actual fryer oil temperature

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.520 
from the actual fryer oil temperature
the<00:01:33.180> first<00:01:33.390> place<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.750> look<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.080> your<00:01:34.320> high

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
the first place to look is your high

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.889 
the first place to look is your high
limit<00:01:35.009> switch<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> high<00:01:36.660> limit

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
limit switch and what the high limit

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.710 
limit switch and what the high limit
does<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> safety<00:01:38.009> precaution<00:01:38.390> saying<00:01:39.390> that

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
does is a safety precaution saying that

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.140 
does is a safety precaution saying that
it's<00:01:40.619> going<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.950> turn<00:01:41.130> off<00:01:41.340> your<00:01:41.580> fryer<00:01:41.850> at

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
it's going to turn off your fryer at

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.780 
it's going to turn off your fryer at
exactly<00:01:42.810> 450<00:01:43.560> degrees<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.130> never<00:01:44.369> go<00:01:44.549> higher

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
exactly 450 degrees and never go higher

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.490 
exactly 450 degrees and never go higher
than<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.840> what<00:01:45.990> we're<00:01:46.080> going<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.229> do<00:01:46.350> in

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
than that so what we're going to do in

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.850 
than that so what we're going to do in
here<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.970> take<00:01:48.240> your<00:01:48.479> two<00:01:48.840> wires<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.409> go

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
here is you take your two wires that go

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.950 
here is you take your two wires that go
to<00:01:49.920> your<00:01:50.040> high<00:01:50.250> limit<00:01:50.610> switch<00:01:50.760> and<00:01:51.750> we're<00:01:51.869> just

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
to your high limit switch and we're just

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.840 
to your high limit switch and we're just
going<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.200> unscrew<00:01:52.530> them<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.070> switch<00:01:53.520> them<00:01:53.700> in

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
going to unscrew them and switch them in

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.120 
going to unscrew them and switch them in
place<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.270> five<00:01:54.450> pass<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.920> we're<00:01:56.040> going

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
place to five pass that so we're going

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.740 
place to five pass that so we're going
to<00:01:56.250> take<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.790> gives<00:01:57.240> us<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.479> source

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
to take the one that gives us a source

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.830 
to take the one that gives us a source
to<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.200> thermo-pile<00:01:58.770> er<00:01:59.420> this<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.720> our

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
to the thermo-pile er this one is our

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.080 
to the thermo-pile er this one is our
actual<00:02:01.200> limit<00:02:01.530> we're<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.700> going<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.880> bypass

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
actual limit we're just going to bypass

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.270 
actual limit we're just going to bypass
it<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:03.990> go<00:02:04.409> instead<00:02:04.770> right<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it and just go instead right to the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.219 
it and just go instead right to the
thermo-pile<00:02:05.759> er<00:02:05.790> really<00:02:06.420> all<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.750> need<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.049> do

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
thermo-pile er really all you need to do

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.259 
thermo-pile er really all you need to do
is<00:02:07.740> get<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.130> one<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.459> connects<00:02:08.790> back<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
is get the one that connects back to the

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.150 
is get the one that connects back to the
thermo-pile<00:02:09.750> er<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.560> way<00:02:10.709> we<00:02:10.950> have<00:02:11.130> a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
thermo-pile er so that way we have a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.789 
thermo-pile er so that way we have a
constant<00:02:11.700> source<00:02:11.970> again<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.570> that<00:02:12.630> flame<00:02:13.140> all

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
constant source again of that flame all

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.530 
constant source again of that flame all
right<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.459> if<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.700> found<00:02:14.910> out<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.239> your<00:02:15.390> high

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.800 
to look is the combination safety gas
valve<00:02:56.900> um<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:58.970> not<00:02:59.120> an<00:02:59.270> easy<00:02:59.390> thing<00:02:59.570> to

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
valve um that is not an easy thing to

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.180 
valve um that is not an easy thing to
replace<00:03:00.140> it's<00:03:00.410> not<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> quick<00:03:00.860> thing<00:03:00.920> to

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
replace it's not a quick thing to

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.370 
replace it's not a quick thing to
replace<00:03:01.550> it's<00:03:02.330> not<00:03:02.450> necessarily<00:03:02.870> cheap<00:03:03.110> but

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
replace it's not necessarily cheap but

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.540 
replace it's not necessarily cheap but
it<00:03:03.470> is<00:03:03.590> something<00:03:03.830> that<00:03:03.950> needs<00:03:04.070> to<00:03:04.220> be<00:03:04.310> done

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
it is something that needs to be done

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.040 
it is something that needs to be done
and<00:03:04.730> it's<00:03:04.880> much<00:03:05.150> better<00:03:05.330> than<00:03:05.510> buying<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.870> whole

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
and it's much better than buying a whole

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.230 
and it's much better than buying a whole
new<00:03:06.080> fryer<00:03:06.500> itself<00:03:07.010> if<00:03:07.580> you<00:03:07.730> look<00:03:07.970> at<00:03:08.090> this

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
new fryer itself if you look at this

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.380 
new fryer itself if you look at this
particular<00:03:08.630> model<00:03:08.990> this<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.820> whole<00:03:11.000> unit

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390

of the safety gas valve itself cannot be
removed<00:03:14.600> from<00:03:14.720> right<00:03:14.930> here<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:15.320> what<00:03:15.440> you're

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
removed from right here so what you're

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.050 
removed from right here so what you're
going<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.710> do<00:03:15.860> is<00:03:16.240> find<00:03:17.240> your<00:03:17.360> closest<00:03:17.870> joints

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
going to do is find your closest joints

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.790 
going to do is find your closest joints
unscrew<00:03:20.060> those<00:03:20.210> and<00:03:20.630> your<00:03:21.290> other<00:03:21.410> one<00:03:21.620> right

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
unscrew those and your other one right

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.410 
unscrew those and your other one right
here<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.310> you're<00:03:22.820> actually<00:03:22.910> going<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.180> pull

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
here and you're actually going to pull

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.960 
here and you're actually going to pull
out<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.720> entire<00:03:24.080> device<00:03:24.470> with<00:03:24.770> all<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:25.190> the

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
out the entire device with all the the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.630 
out the entire device with all the the
component<00:03:26.480> pipes<00:03:26.780> associated<00:03:27.770> with<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.070> once

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
component pipes associated with it once

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.180 
component pipes associated with it once
you<00:03:28.730> pull<00:03:29.000> that<00:03:29.150> out<00:03:29.210> then<00:03:30.020> you<00:03:30.170> can<00:03:30.320> replace

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
you pull that out then you can replace

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.830 
you pull that out then you can replace
these<00:03:31.550> pipes<00:03:31.910> so<00:03:32.090> that<00:03:32.150> way<00:03:32.330> you<00:03:32.390> have<00:03:32.630> the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
these pipes so that way you have the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.440 
these pipes so that way you have the
actual<00:03:33.230> safety<00:03:33.440> pass<00:03:33.860> gas<00:03:34.250> valve<00:03:34.610> unit<00:03:35.000> itself

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
actual safety pass gas valve unit itself

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.750

and<00:03:35.750> then<00:03:36.200> you<00:03:36.320> can<00:03:36.470> get<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.770> replaced<00:03:37.250> you

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
and then you can get that replaced you

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.920 
and then you can get that replaced you
can<00:03:37.880> hook<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.120> back<00:03:38.240> up<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:38.600> your<00:03:38.690> previous

can hook it back up to your previous

can hook it back up to your previous

themselves<00:03:43.959> alright<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.260> your<00:03:45.440> last

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
themselves alright so your last

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
troubleshooting tip would be the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.540 
troubleshooting tip would be the
thermostat<00:03:48.080> itself<00:03:48.709> if<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.010> find<00:03:49.400> you've

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
thermostat itself if you find you've

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.680

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
gone through all that stuff and your

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.720 
gone through all that stuff and your

you're<00:03:53.000> not<00:03:53.030> holding<00:03:53.780> temperature<00:03:54.260> through

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
you're not holding temperature through

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.650 
you're not holding temperature through
what<00:03:54.709> you<00:03:54.830> had<00:03:54.950> calibrated<00:03:55.550> earlier<00:03:56.240> and<00:03:56.540> it's

not being consistent odds are the

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.880 
not being consistent odds are the

time those just don't get cleaned out
the<00:04:34.100> same<00:04:34.280> way<00:04:34.430> that<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.960> oil<00:04:35.960> basin<00:04:36.410> itself

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
the same way that the oil basin itself

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.990 
the same way that the oil basin itself
gets<00:04:36.980> clean<00:04:37.250> so<00:04:37.490> you're<00:04:37.640> going<00:04:37.760> to<00:04:37.820> want<00:04:37.970> to

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
gets clean so you're going to want to

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.370 
gets clean so you're going to want to
check<00:04:38.180> those<00:04:38.419> on<00:04:38.660> a<00:04:38.690> monthly<00:04:39.080> or<00:04:39.110> quarterly

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
check those on a monthly or quarterly

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.680 
check those on a monthly or quarterly
basis<00:04:39.980> and<00:04:40.280> try<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:40.760> clean<00:04:40.940> out<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.090> soot<00:04:41.480> and

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
basis and try and clean out the soot and

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.560 
basis and try and clean out the soot and
if<00:04:42.110> so<00:04:42.320> if<00:04:42.530> it's<00:04:42.710> kicked<00:04:42.980> in<00:04:43.160> there<00:04:43.340> odds<00:04:44.210> are

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
if so if it's kicked in there odds are

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.380 
if so if it's kicked in there odds are
you<00:04:44.750> might<00:04:44.780> need<00:04:45.080> a<00:04:45.140> new<00:04:45.200> fryer<00:04:45.590> as<00:04:45.770> well<00:04:46.010> um

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
you might need a new fryer as well um

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.040 
you might need a new fryer as well um
another<00:04:47.390> common<00:04:47.930> mistake<00:04:48.050> is

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
another common mistake is

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.510 
another common mistake is
we're<00:04:50.169> opening<00:04:50.710> two<00:04:50.919> natural<00:04:51.099> gas

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
we're opening two natural gas

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.059 
we're opening two natural gas
conversions<00:04:52.389> those<00:04:52.870> are<00:04:53.050> one-way<00:04:53.500> valves

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
conversions those are one-way valves

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.249 
conversions those are one-way valves
there<00:04:54.250> so<00:04:54.490> to<00:04:54.940> convert<00:04:55.330> from<00:04:55.449> natural<00:04:55.870> gas<00:04:56.020> to

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
there so to convert from natural gas to

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.770 
there so to convert from natural gas to
liquid<00:04:56.590> propane<00:04:56.770> propane<00:04:57.490> there's<00:04:58.180> one<00:04:58.509> valve

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
liquid propane propane there's one valve

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.020 
liquid propane propane there's one valve
for<00:04:59.050> that<00:04:59.199> to<00:04:59.650> go<00:04:59.800> from<00:04:59.979> liquid<00:05:00.190> propane<00:05:00.520> to

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
for that to go from liquid propane to

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.700 
for that to go from liquid propane to
natural<00:05:01.509> gas<00:05:01.690> there's<00:05:02.139> a<00:05:02.199> different<00:05:02.530> valve

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
natural gas there's a different valve

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.170 
natural gas there's a different valve
for<00:05:02.889> that<00:05:03.009> one
