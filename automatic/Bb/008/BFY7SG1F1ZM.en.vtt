map at the top a lot of 90-degree
corners<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.390> pretty<00:00:39.809> high<00:00:40.020> speed<00:00:40.610> a<00:00:41.870> track

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
corners so pretty high speed a track

corners so pretty high speed a track
like<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.199> with<00:00:43.410> such<00:00:43.559> long<00:00:43.770> straightaways

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
like this with such long straightaways

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.770 
like this with such long straightaways
as<00:00:44.400> well<00:00:44.580> will<00:00:44.790> be<00:00:44.910> obviously<00:00:45.239> very<00:00:45.330> good<00:00:45.540> for

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
as well will be obviously very good for

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.310 
as well will be obviously very good for
passing<00:00:47.330> for<00:00:48.330> the<00:00:48.420> record<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.900> is<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.170> me

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
passing for the record this is not me

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.740 
passing for the record this is not me
driving<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:50.250> wouldn't<00:00:51.239> be<00:00:51.330> going<00:00:51.420> down<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
driving I wouldn't be going down the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.060 
driving I wouldn't be going down the
straightaway<00:00:51.900> on<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> inside<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.860> I

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
straightaway on the inside like this I

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.790 
straightaway on the inside like this I
don't<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.250> who<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.730> only<00:00:54.660> kidding

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
don't know who this is only kidding

don't know who this is only kidding
track<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:58.070> very<00:00:59.070> interesting<00:00:59.750> standpoint

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
track is a very interesting standpoint

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.590 
track is a very interesting standpoint
of<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.140> basically<00:01:01.579> being<00:01:02.579> composed<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.120> 93

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
of it basically being composed of 93

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.939 
of it basically being composed of 93
corners<00:01:03.960> these<00:01:04.110> two<00:01:04.320> corners<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.830> we're

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
corners these two corners that we're

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.120 
corners these two corners that we're
going<00:01:05.070> through<00:01:05.280> now<00:01:05.369> or<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:07.590> most<00:01:07.800> unique

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
going through now or the most unique

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.560 
going through now or the most unique
because<00:01:08.369> they're<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:08.790> close<00:01:08.940> together<00:01:09.180> it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
because they're so close together it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.510 
because they're so close together it
kind<00:01:09.690> of<00:01:09.810> turns<00:01:09.990> into<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.350> corner<00:01:10.740> this

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
kind of turns into one corner this

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.770 
kind of turns into one corner this
corner<00:01:11.580> we're<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.180> through<00:01:12.330> now<00:01:12.420> it's

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
corner we're going through now it's

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.760 
corner we're going through now it's
probably<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> most<00:01:13.350> important

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
probably one of the most important

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.020 
probably one of the most important
corners<00:01:14.070> because<00:01:14.190> it<00:01:14.340> leads<00:01:14.490> onto<00:01:14.700> such<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
corners because it leads onto such a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.120 
corners because it leads onto such a
long<00:01:15.270> straightaway<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.440> a<00:01:16.649> good

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
long straightaway and it's a good

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.570 
long straightaway and it's a good
potential<00:01:17.399> passing<00:01:17.880> area<00:01:19.280> with<00:01:20.280> these<00:01:20.369> long

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
potential passing area with these long

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.340 
potential passing area with these long
straightaways<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.149> with<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.899> formula<00:01:22.289> V

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
straightaways and with the formula V

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.100 
straightaways and with the formula V
batteries<00:01:22.800> they'll<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.390> good<00:01:24.390> overtaking<00:01:24.990> at

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
batteries they'll be good overtaking at

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.320 
batteries they'll be good overtaking at
the<00:01:25.200> end<00:01:25.410> you<00:01:26.399> know<00:01:26.490> depending<00:01:26.789> on<00:01:26.940> how<00:01:27.090> people

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
the end you know depending on how people

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.850 
the end you know depending on how people
are<00:01:27.570> managing<00:01:27.780> their<00:01:28.140> batteries<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.770> their

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
are managing their batteries and their

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.969 
are managing their batteries and their
coasting<00:01:29.360> this<00:01:30.360> corner<00:01:30.660> coming<00:01:30.869> up<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.319> a<00:01:31.350> very

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
coasting this corner coming up is a very

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.469 
coasting this corner coming up is a very
sharp<00:01:32.280> one<00:01:32.429> actually<00:01:32.819> I<00:01:32.850> expect<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.300> to<00:01:33.360> be

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
sharp one actually I expect this to be

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.850 
sharp one actually I expect this to be
one<00:01:33.690> of<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> more<00:01:33.990> problem<00:01:34.590> spots

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
one of the more problem spots

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.010 
one of the more problem spots
potentially

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
potentially

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.889 
potentially
to<00:01:36.289> get<00:01:36.500> into<00:01:37.159> trouble<00:01:37.310> there<00:01:37.579> and<00:01:37.899> then

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
to get into trouble there and then

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.810 
to get into trouble there and then
heading<00:01:39.679> into<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:39.890> last<00:01:39.979> quarter<00:01:40.429> pretty

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
heading into the last quarter pretty

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.350 
heading into the last quarter pretty
straight<00:01:41.119> forward<00:01:41.149> 90<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.729> back<00:01:43.729> home<00:01:43.969> to<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
straight forward 90 and back home to the

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.419 
straight forward 90 and back home to the

to the finish line hope you guys enjoyed

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.810 
to the finish line hope you guys enjoyed
it<00:01:46.640> see<00:01:47.000> out<00:01:47.119> there<00:01:47.299> on<00:01:47.450> Saturday
