00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.100
 this video is sponsored by copy 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.510
 jones 4 the application that allows you to 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.070
 transfer the content of your idevice 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.810
 to your computer 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.680
 hello his ipod touch taxes and 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.420
 today I will show 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.710
 the app passes ac for your 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.560
 idevice that is not already lighter or 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.269
 jabri that would relieve 6.0 more 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.529
 so you know when you 're not 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.420
 already breakÃ©es unfortunately you 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.580
 can not hide the icons that are 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.110
 by default in various for example 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.910
 if i want to delete the app notes 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.320
 I maintain there are no small 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.730
 etc what appears on it does that I have 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.430
 not the possibility to delete it 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.670
 which is still a disadvantage 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.980
 for in the highway 6 then well 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.539
 sure we did not find a method that is 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.960
 available on the internet who will you 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.879
 allow for just deleted 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.649
 default icons in your idevice 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.059
 so I'm selling removes a copy too 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.129
 I have no need like the game 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.600
 center itunes facebook etc 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.670
 so I'm going to show you this 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.680
 application that bores him ac 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.210
 it's called then everything you have 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.400
 to face went into Safari 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.780
 afterwards here you go carpet here at 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.509
 point like bass slash ac like this I 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.369
 do not know that it's called fights 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.159
 a redirect to the website 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.990
 that allow in the bottom used 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.880
 a flaw in the iowa 6 to remove 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.530
 the icons on the springboard of your 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.909
 idevice that can not be deleted 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.380
 so all you have to do 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.320
 it's going down then 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.430
 click on add to pass book in that 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.650
 know how to do it is that it will use 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.369
 a flaw that is in the paas book that 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.990
 you see here 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.610
 so all you have to face and 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.500
 support had at the top right me 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.540
 I was already so pressed is added 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.549
 once it 's added we can 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.530
 close safari no longer need there 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.439
 have to go in passbooks then 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.110
 pass boukili for me no I am 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.270
 above and when I get on it we see 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.909
 here blah blah blah was made by whom and c 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.570
 is the smallest is in the bottom right must 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.820
 press it 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.790
 no we press the little one and you see 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.770
 here that was stopped the 10 minutes in 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.000
 the bastion delete you can do just 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.100
 the little trash that took me away the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.110
 sheet done there you can hide the app 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.530
 store the calculator the calendar the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.120
 camera the clock the camp because we 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.520
 have the compass the contacts the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.980
 facetime for those who have an ipod touch 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.450
 thereafter the game center itunes but 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.209
 to maps 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.660
 voice memo message museum nor at the booth 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.989
 The notes rank facebook phone 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.760
 photo safari reminders stock you do not have 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.129
 a package finally you can any case 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.560
 in the icons that are by default in 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.030
 life will then all you have to 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.230
 do at the same time I was hiding the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.599
 calendar that is the case last year 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.849
 relay I press the link that is there 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.590
 so we press it 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.510
 bring on the website has the 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.680
 must be done in store once 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.319
 it's done we'll see that the calendar 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.810
 who was that place is not able 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.069
 to settle down so laughed sadly gives 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.170
 all we have in front and press 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.000
 on it and there will be an ex who will 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.430
 then appear a flaw that has been 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.220
 used in oases I'm sure 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.110
 in 6.0.1 or 6.1 stops because I have 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.230
 so in my opinion it's going to be fair 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.640
 compatible font does that once 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.349
 that they suppress and I was able to 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.599
 calendar of a month and device then 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.579
 I would have taken on the central button and 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.640
 We can see that here we do not have the 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.140
 calendar nor in the other pages on 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.670
 learn more calendar I used 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.900
 yes callander who is another 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.120
 application continues I use 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.829
 not much by college default calendar 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.540
 is otherwise we do the same thing to my 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.260
 temples at best at the stand so thomas 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:37.569
 pass book we had supported this is it 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.910
 go away hide just I know country 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.100
 where the link of a packet package makes it 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.650
 really need to research to find the 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.900
 good thing so we'll go up a little bit 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.150
 it's she newstele here we support have 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.160
 done installed and we see this position 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.489
 there were the kiosks at the parties 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.459
 gives the maintain have made x elite ore 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.980
 and masbou night we no longer have the kiosk 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.480
 lanata device this one all for this 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.480
 application their who had by 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.280
 safari that uses a flaw so this 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.840
 evening it will be corrected shortly but 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.090
 for now this is the method that is 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.420
 used for devices that are not 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.090
 jailbreaked so that's all for this 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.620
 application their pass pass tackle just 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.750
 a little note if you want to deliver 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.820
 the condemned time you want to put your 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.590
 schedule finally all you have 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.830
 face and restart you and device because 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.880
 that yes if you restart your idevice 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.810
 unfortunately the app will come back 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.490
 have set themselves as goal 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.889
 he returns all the applications by 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.540
 default every restart so tonight 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.490
 that if you look at married accounts 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.410
 are going to come back all that so if all for 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.480
 the application available via safari for 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.060
 your idevice jabri keun-ho sun west 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.740
 6.0 so I have not really put any 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.210
 canvases on this application there because 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.650
 that this is not compatible in the 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.180
 upcoming late versions that are devoted to 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.470
 nothing to put a star but I am 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.000
 often your opinion do you 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.130

 reject no dock for what they 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.930
 thought from left to right a little 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.060
 it's bottle here that I found that 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.310
 it was just temporarily time 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.410

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.910
 applications on the iphone 5 that's it 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.910
 temporary a bag that's all
