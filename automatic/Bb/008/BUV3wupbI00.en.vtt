00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.610
 Hello such friends youtube them 

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:09.630
 I'm going to teach how to put together the motorcycle bati 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:12.500
 batman the lego first we need a 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.500
 piece of these 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.860
 after one of these 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.860
 that goes on the reverse 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.770
 after or another of these 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:38.920
 so we would stay 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.920
 we continue with 1 floor of 2 x 4 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.520
 it would be like this 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.490
 we continue with two pieces of these 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.780
 that go on the tip of the rice 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.520
 or black 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:07.600
 so we would stay 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:10.260
 then we need one of these 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.409
 four of these 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.780
 one on each side 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.780
 and so we would stay 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.830
 then we need two blacks of these 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.830
 that go like this 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.450
 after four of these 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:45.479
 in the holes 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.479
 well in these holes 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.400
 A) Yes 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.660
 then you are four 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.660
 that go like this 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.560
 and so we would stay 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.580
 then we need four of these that 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.580
 they go in these holes 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.200
 then we need four of these 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.500
 thin 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.500
 or if you do not have two of these thicknesses 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.530
 and so we would have the motorcycle 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.750
 now to follow us we need two of 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.190
 these are 6 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.190
 2 and 6 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:12.000
 21 of 6 and so we would need to 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 two of these after one of these 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.079
 we would sink 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:22.319
 so we would stay with one of 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.319
 these 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.829
 that goes here 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.829
 after one of these 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.180
 we continue with one of these 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:45.650
 we have to leave a space for 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.060
 let the doll be, then we continue with 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.060
 one of these 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.440
 Y 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.440
 two of these 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.200
 and finally two of these pieces 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.480
 what is the steering wheel practically 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.690
 that go in the holes 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.760
 that had shown up a minute ago 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.370
 and so we would stay 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.960
 then we put it on the motorcycle 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.530
 and so we would stay 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.970
 and if you want to add some weapons 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.970
 we can put some missiles 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.850
 what if we would stay 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.100
 and that was all for the boys if they want 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:00.880
