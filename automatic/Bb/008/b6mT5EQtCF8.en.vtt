now usually we end up getting her stuff

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.930 
now usually we end up getting her stuff
that<00:00:10.170> she<00:00:10.440> can<00:00:10.620> either<00:00:10.710> chew<00:00:11.010> on<00:00:11.219> or<00:00:11.490> play<00:00:11.700> with

and<00:00:12.290> fortunately<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.380> stuff<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.040> really

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
and fortunately that stuff is really

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.010 
and fortunately that stuff is really
starting<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.580> pile<00:00:14.759> up<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.179> think<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.660> dog<00:00:15.809> has

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
starting to pile up I think that dog has

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.470 
starting to pile up I think that dog has
more<00:00:16.289> toys<00:00:16.500> than<00:00:16.529> any<00:00:17.070> dog<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.580> know<00:00:17.699> so

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
more toys than any dog that I know so

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.939 
more toys than any dog that I know so
this<00:00:18.690> year<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.900> decided<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.410> get<00:00:19.560> her<00:00:19.710> something

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
this year I decided to get her something

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.830 
this year I decided to get her something
that's<00:00:20.310> functional<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:21.029> she<00:00:21.240> can<00:00:21.390> use<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
that's functional that she can use and

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.929 
that's functional that she can use and
that<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.260> use<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.100> decided<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.699> I

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
that we can use so I decided that I

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.300 
that we can use so I decided that I
would<00:00:24.330> replace<00:00:24.600> her<00:00:24.810> harness<00:00:25.050> now<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.189> don't

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
would replace her harness now I don't

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.580 
would replace her harness now I don't
want<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> say<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.090> she's<00:00:27.240> gotten<00:00:27.570> fat<00:00:27.810> but

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
want to say that she's gotten fat but

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.019 
want to say that she's gotten fat but
the<00:00:28.769> original<00:00:29.010> harness<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.699> bought<00:00:29.880> her

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
which is pink and we moved up from a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.960 
which is pink and we moved up from a
medium<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> large<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.790> should

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
medium to a large so this should

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.420 
medium to a large so this should
definitely<00:01:24.119> fit<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.780> her<00:01:25.070> you<00:01:26.070> want<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> try

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
definitely fit on her you want to try

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.060 
definitely fit on her you want to try
this<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.750> maybe<00:01:27.750> we'll<00:01:27.900> cut<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.530> actual

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
this on maybe we'll cut to the actual

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.800 
this on maybe we'll cut to the actual
having<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.729> her<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.150> let's<00:01:30.509> give<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.720> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
having it on her but let's give it a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.090 
having it on her but let's give it a
shot<00:01:30.840> here<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.380> think<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.710> goes<00:01:31.860> like<00:01:32.070> this

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
shot here I think it goes like this
