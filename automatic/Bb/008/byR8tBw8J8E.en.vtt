awesome<00:00:08.280> would<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:08.429> be<00:00:08.519> if<00:00:08.820> we<00:00:09.000> could<00:00:09.150> just

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
awesome would it be if we could just

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.970 
awesome would it be if we could just
shrink<00:00:09.510> one<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.870> these<00:00:09.990> trees<00:00:10.320> out<00:00:10.500> here<00:00:10.800> and

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
shrink one of these trees out here and

00:00:10.980 --> 00:01:01.520 
shrink one of these trees out here and
put<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.460> on<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> layout<00:00:59.690> hey<00:01:00.690> all<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.170> welcome

through making some very realistic and
very<00:01:07.890> cheap<00:01:08.520> pine<00:01:08.850> trees<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.200> achieve<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
very cheap pine trees you can achieve a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.560 
very cheap pine trees you can achieve a
lot<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.830> variation<00:01:11.490> using<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:11.909> method<00:01:12.390> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
lot of variation using this method and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.140 
lot of variation using this method and
make<00:01:12.840> many<00:01:13.110> different<00:01:13.500> species<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:14.010> pine<00:01:14.250> so

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
make many different species of pine so

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.030 
make many different species of pine so

grows<00:01:36.659> quite<00:01:37.110> fast<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:38.360> look<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.540> these<00:01:39.659> stems

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
grows quite fast I look for these stems

that<00:01:40.140> are<00:01:40.290> reasonably<00:01:41.189> straight<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.729> use

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
that are reasonably straight and use

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.109 
that are reasonably straight and use
those<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.720> trim<00:01:43.079> off<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.710> pine<00:01:43.979> trees

not all of the trim stems will be

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.190 
not all of the trim stems will be
straight<00:01:50.789> so<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> hang<00:01:51.450> them<00:01:51.630> with<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> small

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
straight so I hang them with a small

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.660 
straight so I hang them with a small
weight<00:01:52.439> attached<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> bottom<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.520> help

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
straighten them as they dry you'll

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.120 
straighten them as they dry you'll
probably<00:01:57.689> need<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> couple<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.469> months<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.979> let
