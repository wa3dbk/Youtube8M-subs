00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
what look like pre-cut thermal pads so

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.170 
what look like pre-cut thermal pads so
well<00:02:51.410> i'll<00:02:51.590> be<00:02:51.709> doing<00:02:51.829> in<00:02:52.180> installation

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
well i'll be doing in installation

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.550 
well i'll be doing in installation
videos<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.750> keep<00:02:53.900> an<00:02:53.989> eye<00:02:54.049> out<00:02:54.079> on<00:02:54.230> that

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
videos to keep an eye out on that

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.809 
videos to keep an eye out on that
because<00:02:54.769> if<00:02:54.890> they<00:02:55.010> are<00:02:55.160> pre-cut<00:02:55.579> that's

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
because if they are pre-cut that's

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.780 
because if they are pre-cut that's
actually<00:02:56.239> really<00:02:56.420> nice<00:02:57.400> but<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.459> don't<00:02:58.670> know

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
actually really nice but I don't know

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.479 
actually really nice but I don't know
for<00:02:58.819> sure<00:02:59.019> the<00:03:00.019> LM<00:03:00.680> elects<00:03:01.069> to<00:03:01.190> two<00:03:01.970> LEDs<00:03:02.599> and

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
for sure the LM elects to two LEDs and

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.840 
for sure the LM elects to two LEDs and
you'll<00:03:04.489> see<00:03:04.989> this<00:03:05.989> is<00:03:06.230> kind<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.769> one<00:03:07.370> reason

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
you'll see this is kind of one reason

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.360 
you'll see this is kind of one reason
why<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.060> went<00:03:08.359> with<00:03:08.540> this<00:03:08.690> wow<00:03:09.260> man<00:03:09.560> it's<00:03:09.829> really

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
why I went with this wow man it's really

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.610 
why I went with this wow man it's really
heavy<00:03:10.660> it's<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:11.750> lot<00:03:11.870> heavier<00:03:12.049> than<00:03:12.380> I<00:03:12.500> actually

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
heavy it's a lot heavier than I actually

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.490 
heavy it's a lot heavier than I actually
expected<00:03:12.859> it<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.489> be<00:03:13.519> to<00:03:13.760> be<00:03:13.880> honest<00:03:14.180> with<00:03:14.329> you

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
expected it to be to be honest with you

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.710 
expected it to be to be honest with you
I<00:03:15.500> have<00:03:16.220> not<00:03:16.430> done<00:03:16.670> any<00:03:16.880> water<00:03:17.150> cooling<00:03:17.600> bills

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
I have not done any water cooling bills

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.509 
I have not done any water cooling bills
yet<00:03:17.989> so<00:03:18.769> we<00:03:18.889> have<00:03:19.010> xspc<00:03:19.489> thermal<00:03:20.239> compound

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
yet so we have xspc thermal compound

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.069 
yet so we have xspc thermal compound
which<00:03:22.519> I<00:03:22.850> have<00:03:23.030> no<00:03:23.269> idea<00:03:23.389> if<00:03:23.660> it's<00:03:23.780> good<00:03:23.959> or<00:03:23.989> bad

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
which I have no idea if it's good or bad

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.620 
which I have no idea if it's good or bad
i'll<00:03:24.380> actually<00:03:24.530> have<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.920> do<00:03:25.329> look<00:03:26.329> up<00:03:26.480> some

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.479 
and ass piece of copper this thing is
really<00:03:59.819> heavy<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.920> most<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:02.129> it<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.430> that

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
piece of copper because the rest of it

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:11.780 
piece of copper because the rest of it
is<00:04:06.860> clear<00:04:07.860> plastics<00:04:08.610> for<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.209> LEDs<00:04:10.670> we<00:04:11.670> have

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
is clear plastics for the LEDs we have

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.380 
is clear plastics for the LEDs we have
the<00:04:11.909> same<00:04:12.120> kind<00:04:12.629> of<00:04:12.920> finish<00:04:13.920> on<00:04:14.159> the<00:04:14.940> top<00:04:15.150> here

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
the same kind of finish on the top here

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.680 
the same kind of finish on the top here
that's<00:04:15.450> on<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.959> back<00:04:16.139> plate<00:04:16.560> nice<00:04:17.190> xspc<00:04:17.760> logo

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
that's on the back plate nice xspc logo

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.170 
that's on the back plate nice xspc logo
we<00:04:19.680> have<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.949> nice<00:04:20.130> big<00:04:20.959> multi-port<00:04:22.880> in<00:04:23.880> out

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
we have the nice big multi-port in out

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.750 
we have the nice big multi-port in out
so<00:04:24.960> off<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.979> top<00:04:26.160> of<00:04:26.190> my<00:04:26.280> head<00:04:26.430> I<00:04:26.490> can't

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
so off the top of my head I can't

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.060 
so off the top of my head I can't
remember<00:04:27.030> which<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.210> which<00:04:27.389> but<00:04:27.570> you<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.860> want

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
remember which is which but you you want

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.060 
remember which is which but you you want
you<00:04:29.370> no<00:04:29.490> one<00:04:29.699> is<00:04:29.880> in<00:04:30.030> one<00:04:30.270> is<00:04:30.449> out<00:04:30.630> or<00:04:31.350> I<00:04:31.770> think

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
you no one is in one is out or I think

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.560 
you no one is in one is out or I think
you<00:04:32.130> can<00:04:32.250> switch<00:04:32.460> them<00:04:32.639> around<00:04:32.699> but<00:04:33.260> so<00:04:34.260> in<00:04:34.919> out

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
you can switch them around but so in out

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.810 
you can switch them around but so in out
and<00:04:36.570> you<00:04:36.660> can<00:04:36.690> do<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.050> from<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.979> sides<00:04:38.280> you<00:04:38.760> can

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
and you can do it from the sides you can

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.939 
and you can do it from the sides you can
do<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.060> from<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.510> top<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:40.289> can<00:04:40.410> do<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.650> from

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
do it from the top you can do it from

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.310 
do it from the top you can do it from
you<00:04:41.639> know<00:04:41.729> the<00:04:41.760> top<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.419> bottom<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.990> front

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
you know the top the bottom the front

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.360 
you know the top the bottom the front
does<00:04:43.760> everywhere<00:04:44.760> basically<00:04:44.940> has<00:04:45.389> a<00:04:45.419> fork<00:04:46.370> and

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
does everywhere basically has a fork and

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.490 
does everywhere basically has a fork and
I<00:04:47.520> really<00:04:47.820> mean<00:04:47.970> everywhere<00:04:48.539> has<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.810> port<00:04:50.060> so

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
I really mean everywhere has a port so

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.100 
I really mean everywhere has a port so
we'll<00:04:52.500> see<00:04:52.740> how<00:04:52.770> this<00:04:52.889> does<00:04:53.130> against<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.210> the

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
we'll see how this does against the the

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.180 
we'll see how this does against the the
big<00:04:55.349> boys<00:04:55.650> of<00:04:56.099> water<00:04:56.400> cooling<00:04:57.199> so<00:04:58.199> like<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.130> said

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
big boys of water cooling so like I said

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.930 
big boys of water cooling so like I said
guys<00:04:59.460> real<00:05:00.060> quick<00:05:00.090> unboxing<00:05:00.979> just<00:05:01.979> wanted<00:05:02.370> to

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
guys real quick unboxing just wanted to

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.890 
guys real quick unboxing just wanted to
get<00:05:03.030> it<00:05:03.180> out<00:05:03.270> and<00:05:03.449> get<00:05:03.599> it<00:05:03.660> ready<00:05:03.870> for<00:05:04.460> the

get it out and get it ready for the
installation<00:05:06.900> video<00:05:07.470> which<00:05:07.740> I'll<00:05:07.919> have

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
installation video which I'll have

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.370 
installation video which I'll have
coming<00:05:08.460> and<00:05:08.669> thankfully<00:05:09.479> I<00:05:09.660> have<00:05:09.960> two<00:05:10.139> chances
