00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.190 

and<00:00:03.490> what<00:00:04.490> I<00:00:04.520> was<00:00:04.670> trying<00:00:04.939> to<00:00:05.029> do<00:00:05.300> while<00:00:05.990> I<00:00:06.020> was

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
and what I was trying to do while I was

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.520 
and what I was trying to do while I was
comping<00:00:06.650> cuz<00:00:07.270> on<00:00:08.270> the<00:00:08.600> rhythm<00:00:08.840> track<00:00:09.080> we<00:00:09.410> have

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
comping cuz on the rhythm track we have

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.560 
comping cuz on the rhythm track we have
the<00:00:09.680> bass<00:00:09.860> and<00:00:10.129> we<00:00:10.250> have<00:00:10.370> the<00:00:10.459> drums<00:00:10.730> so

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
the bass and we have the drums so

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.930 
the bass and we have the drums so
there's<00:00:12.080> a<00:00:12.170> lot<00:00:12.380> of<00:00:12.410> space<00:00:12.710> to<00:00:12.980> fill<00:00:13.160> out<00:00:13.309> and<00:00:13.639> I

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
there's a lot of space to fill out and I

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.910 
there's a lot of space to fill out and I
was<00:00:14.120> imagining<00:00:14.389> that<00:00:14.809> I<00:00:14.870> was<00:00:15.110> accompanying<00:00:15.559> a

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
was imagining that I was accompanying a

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.850 
was imagining that I was accompanying a
soloist<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:16.960> what<00:00:17.960> I<00:00:17.990> was<00:00:18.140> doing<00:00:18.500> I<00:00:18.649> was

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
soloist and what I was doing I was

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.790 
soloist and what I was doing I was
trying<00:00:19.189> to<00:00:19.369> play<00:00:19.610> chords<00:00:20.079> maybe<00:00:21.079> to<00:00:21.290> find<00:00:21.590> some

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
trying to play chords maybe to find some

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.159 
trying to play chords maybe to find some
nice<00:00:21.980> voicings<00:00:22.730> on<00:00:22.970> maybe<00:00:23.300> just<00:00:23.509> like<00:00:23.810> two<00:00:23.960> top

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
nice voicings on maybe just like two top

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.950 
nice voicings on maybe just like two top
four<00:00:24.500> strings<00:00:24.730> not<00:00:25.730> using<00:00:26.270> the<00:00:26.360> bass<00:00:26.540> too<00:00:26.779> much

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
four strings not using the bass too much

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.780 
four strings not using the bass too much
because<00:00:27.169> then<00:00:27.380> you're<00:00:27.559> in<00:00:27.649> the<00:00:27.770> bass<00:00:28.550> with

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
because then you're in the bass with

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.490 
because then you're in the bass with
register<00:00:29.360> and<00:00:29.540> the<00:00:29.630> bass<00:00:29.779> is<00:00:29.960> already<00:00:30.230> playing

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
register and the bass is already playing

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.450 
register and the bass is already playing
that<00:00:30.739> so<00:00:31.399> I<00:00:31.430> was<00:00:31.579> trying<00:00:31.880> to<00:00:31.939> find<00:00:32.270> like<00:00:32.509> a<00:00:32.570> line

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
that so I was trying to find like a line

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.830 
that so I was trying to find like a line
let's<00:00:34.460> say<00:00:34.580> if<00:00:34.730> we<00:00:34.820> start<00:00:35.140> maybe<00:00:36.140> like<00:00:36.350> this

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
let's say if we start maybe like this

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.010 
let's say if we start maybe like this
this<00:00:38.840> is<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:38.990> b-flat<00:00:40.210> six<00:00:41.860> we<00:00:42.860> have<00:00:43.010> this<00:00:43.780> D<00:00:44.780> on

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
this is a b-flat six we have this D on

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.520 
this is a b-flat six we have this D on
top<00:00:45.290> and<00:00:45.590> D<00:00:46.550> is<00:00:46.820> actually<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.540> third<00:00:47.810> of<00:00:48.170> B

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
top and D is actually the third of B

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
top and D is actually the third of B
flat<00:00:48.890> major<00:00:49.360> so<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:51.800> notes<00:00:52.100> are<00:00:52.250> b<00:00:52.460> f<00:00:53.950> g<00:00:54.950> and<00:00:55.160> d

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.790 

then<00:00:58.450> it's<00:00:58.600> important<00:00:59.020> for<00:00:59.110> me<00:00:59.230> to<00:00:59.260> find

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
then it's important for me to find

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.310 
then it's important for me to find
another<00:01:00.399> voicing<00:01:01.300> for<00:01:01.450> the<00:01:01.540> next<00:01:01.809> chord<00:01:02.079> F

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
another voicing for the next chord F

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.149 
another voicing for the next chord F
minor<00:01:02.590> seven<00:01:03.040> that<00:01:03.220> is<00:01:03.250> you<00:01:03.700> know<00:01:04.830> quite<00:01:05.830> close

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
minor seven that is you know quite close

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.490 
minor seven that is you know quite close
so<00:01:06.490> I<00:01:06.520> don't<00:01:06.729> jump<00:01:07.180> too<00:01:07.420> much<00:01:07.659> around<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.320> neck

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
so I don't jump too much around the neck

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.730 
so I don't jump too much around the neck
like<00:01:08.530> this<00:01:08.890> it's<00:01:09.130> better<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.520> find<00:01:09.760> a<00:01:10.740> nice

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
like this it's better to find a nice

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.420 
like this it's better to find a nice
melody<00:01:12.040> on<00:01:12.369> top<00:01:12.400> that<00:01:12.850> leads<00:01:13.060> maybe<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:15.460> this

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
melody on top that leads maybe like this

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.920 
melody on top that leads maybe like this
you<00:01:18.430> have<00:01:18.520> f<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:19.240> don't<00:01:19.300> even<00:01:19.479> have<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.750> play

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
you have f you don't even have to play

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.300 
you have f you don't even have to play
it<00:01:20.020> F<00:01:20.140> that's<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.440> route<00:01:20.650> you<00:01:20.680> can<00:01:20.950> just<00:01:21.159> play

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
it F that's the route you can just play

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.210 
it F that's the route you can just play
the<00:01:21.460> B<00:01:21.580> flat<00:01:21.790> a<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:24.220> e-flat<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.810> G<00:01:26.409> flat<00:01:26.710> and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
the B flat a the e-flat the G flat and

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.320 
the B flat a the e-flat the G flat and
the<00:01:27.310> seen<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:28.840> this<00:01:29.729> that's<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.940> F<00:01:31.060> minor

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
the seen like this that's the F minor

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.980 
the seen like this that's the F minor
chord<00:01:31.720> and<00:01:31.899> then<00:01:32.470> for<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.830> B<00:01:33.630> flat<00:01:34.630> dominant

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
chord and then for the B flat dominant

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.330 
chord and then for the B flat dominant
chord<00:01:35.759> why<00:01:36.759> not<00:01:36.940> just<00:01:37.119> keep<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.600> note<00:01:38.340> this

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
chord why not just keep that note this

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.770 
chord why not just keep that note this
was<00:01:39.580> like<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:40.149> fifth<00:01:40.570> of<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.490> f<00:01:42.490> -<00:01:43.210> seven<00:01:43.630> and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
was like the fifth of the f - seven and

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.950 
was like the fifth of the f - seven and
it's<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.200> ninth<00:01:44.440> on<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:46.149> dominant<00:01:46.330> chord<00:01:46.780> of

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
it's the ninth on the dominant chord of

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.150 
it's the ninth on the dominant chord of
the<00:01:47.020> B<00:01:47.560> flat<00:01:48.509> seven<00:01:49.509> so<00:01:50.050> why<00:01:50.800> not<00:01:50.920> do<00:01:51.160> like<00:01:51.280> this

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
the B flat seven so why not do like this

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:01.440 
the B flat seven so why not do like this
that's<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.280> B<00:01:54.460> flat<00:01:54.670> 13<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:56.670> flat<00:01:57.670> D<00:01:58.240> G<00:01:59.170> C<00:02:00.300> so<00:02:01.300> then

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
that's a B flat 13 a flat D G C so then

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.779 
that's a B flat 13 a flat D G C so then
we<00:02:01.539> have<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.619> then<00:02:06.429> why<00:02:06.610> not<00:02:06.789> do<00:02:06.970> like<00:02:07.119> this

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
we have and then why not do like this

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.809 
we have and then why not do like this
this<00:02:09.789> is<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.000> flat<00:02:10.270> 9<00:02:10.539> this<00:02:11.440> is<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.590> sharp<00:02:11.890> 5

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.050 

it<00:02:15.819> leans<00:02:16.090> chromatically<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:19.620> e-flat<00:02:20.620> major

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
it leans chromatically to e-flat major

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.660 
it leans chromatically to e-flat major
and<00:02:22.060> I'm<00:02:22.299> doing<00:02:22.629> like<00:02:22.889> have<00:02:23.889> a<00:02:23.920> third<00:02:26.639> have<00:02:27.639> a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
and I'm doing like have a third have a

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:38.640 
and I'm doing like have a third have a
sixth<00:02:28.290> 509<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.859> a<00:02:30.129> 5th<00:02:30.599> so<00:02:37.019> next<00:02:38.019> chord<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.469> flat

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
sixth 509 and a 5th so next chord a flat

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.339 
sixth 509 and a 5th so next chord a flat
seven<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:42.310> keep<00:02:42.969> that<00:02:43.150> same<00:02:43.389> voicing<00:02:43.900> and

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
seven and I keep that same voicing and

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.490 
seven and I keep that same voicing and
then<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:44.829> a<00:02:44.859> ninth<00:02:45.129> on<00:02:45.549> top<00:02:47.579> G<00:02:48.579> flat<00:02:49.389> C<00:02:50.230> F

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
then I have a ninth on top G flat C F

00:02:50.500 --> 00:03:03.209 
then I have a ninth on top G flat C F
and<00:02:51.310> b-flat<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.629> next<00:03:01.900> chord<00:03:02.169> is<00:03:02.829> the<00:03:02.889> G

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:03.219 
and b-flat and the next chord is the G
