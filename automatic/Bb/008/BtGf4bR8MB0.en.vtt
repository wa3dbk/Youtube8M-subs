00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.600
 good guys we are here braden more with 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.850
 the cars drink and maintain and today they 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.550
 let's do the first session of 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.740
 kitchen today we're going to teach how to do 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.950
 some super rich cheese balls 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.690
 approximately are for 10 people if 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.220
 put these cheese balls we can 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.410
 do in any meeting that we have 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.940
 with our family friends for 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.279
 do something different that you like to everything 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.940
 the world and not always be with the same 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.769
 but do new things 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.309
 exactly and then the ingredients 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.900
 that we are going to need are 200 grams of 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.100
 corn flour 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.200
 if half of grated cheese that can 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.170
 be pecorino parmesan 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.000
 for pasta 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.810
 humble water 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.630
 and salt the amount of salt that we go to 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.320
 put is going to be depending on how salty 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:05.190
 that is our cheese exactly 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.340
 let's start the first we pour the flour 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.340
 of corn 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.070
 and then we throw all the cheese 250 grams 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.460
 now let's take the salt 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.369
 as I told you before 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 the amount of salt depends on the 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.810
 city ice cream that we are going to use 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.600
 we are now going to put a 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.210
 tip the tip of the teaspoon of 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.270
 Salt 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.340
 let's see adding little water to 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.340
 little until it gets hard 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.000
 we also have to say that cheese 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.860
 what we say has to be like the one 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 We put ourselves preferably in 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.280
 dust because if we put a cheese of a 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.490
 larger size or in a cheese a 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.460
 bit or the one that is grated as in 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.090
 then fry them to fry them is more 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.090
 complicated 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.829
 we keep adding water 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.450
 more or less has to be left with this 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.690
 contexture and now we start doing the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.690
 balls 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:39.930
 more or less of this size 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.930
 so that they are only an appetizer 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.120
 how to stick 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.720
 these have not left more or less 40 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.590
 balls after we have them 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.380
 all ready 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.930
 we put the oil to heat and let's go 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.870
 adding the this you have to do it with 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.070
 help from an adult if you are a minor 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.070
 and we start frying 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.530
 while we are placing them so that 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.920
 those that we put them do not have 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.459
 already when we have them all put 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.459
 we increase the flame 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.500
 and we are waiting to turn it around 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.750
 when we see them all golden 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.230
 everywhere we're going to start 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.230
 take them out 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:12.050
 We are going to put them on a plate with 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.050
 napkins to observe the oil 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.360
 when you are already all we put in a 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.720
 dish and ready to give them to our 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.760
 guests 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.670
 yes good and the balls also the 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.060
 we can accompany barbeque sauce or 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.840
 barbecue sauce as they call it and salsa 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.160
 pink and they are exquisite good guys 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.900
 and here's the program for today 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.450

 that they have or something they would like 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.500
