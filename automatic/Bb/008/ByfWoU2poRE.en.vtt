that level of confidence in the machine

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.750 
that level of confidence in the machine
that<00:02:53.989> you're<00:02:54.170> operating<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:55.250> find<00:02:55.489> out<00:02:55.640> that

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
that you're operating you find out that

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.120 
that you're operating you find out that
you<00:02:55.880> could<00:02:56.060> push<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.540> limit<00:02:56.870> far<00:02:57.800> greater

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
you could push the limit far greater

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.280 
you could push the limit far greater
than<00:02:58.250> you've<00:02:58.520> ever<00:02:58.640> really<00:02:59.450> been<00:02:59.720> able<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.020> do

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
than you've ever really been able to do

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.949 
than you've ever really been able to do
before<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:01.459> it's<00:03:02.060> it's<00:03:02.360> rare<00:03:02.570> that<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.750> get<00:03:02.930> a

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
before and it's it's rare that you get a

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.530 
before and it's it's rare that you get a
car<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.320> actually<00:03:03.550> it<00:03:04.550> links<00:03:05.120> that<00:03:05.300> closely

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
car that actually it links that closely

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.449 
car that actually it links that closely
together<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.200> really<00:03:06.410> don't<00:03:06.590> know<00:03:06.800> all<00:03:07.190> the

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
together and I really don't know all the

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.420 
together and I really don't know all the
elements<00:03:07.910> is<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.920> what<00:03:09.920> we<00:03:10.070> know<00:03:10.280> what

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
elements is that what we know what

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.340 
elements is that what we know what
element<00:03:10.790> really<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.330> is<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.080> the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
element really is it is it the the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.930 
element really is it is it the the
engineering<00:03:12.860> that<00:03:13.010> goes<00:03:13.070> into<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:13.880> that

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
engineering that goes into it is that

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.170 
engineering that goes into it is that
the<00:03:14.180> emotional<00:03:15.070> kind<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:16.310> know<00:03:16.430> connection

the emotional kind you know connection

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.509 
the emotional kind you know connection
that<00:03:17.360> you<00:03:17.480> have<00:03:17.510> with<00:03:18.040> kind<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.130> like<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.310> car

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
that you have with kind of like a car

that you have with kind of like a car
that<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:20.360> know<00:03:20.450> it's<00:03:20.570> a<00:03:20.630> sport<00:03:20.930> compact<00:03:21.350> and

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
that you know it's a sport compact and

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.199 
that you know it's a sport compact and
if<00:03:21.680> you're<00:03:21.800> into<00:03:21.950> spark<00:03:22.190> compact<00:03:22.610> hatches<00:03:23.060> you

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
if you're into spark compact hatches you

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.729 
if you're into spark compact hatches you
have<00:03:23.300> a<00:03:23.330> little<00:03:23.600> bit<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:24.290> tend<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.560> really

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
have a little bit you tend to really

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.880 
have a little bit you tend to really
like<00:03:24.800> them<00:03:25.130> more<00:03:25.459> than<00:03:25.700> other<00:03:25.880> things<00:03:26.890> but

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
like them more than other things but

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.229 
like them more than other things but
when<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.040> look<00:03:28.280> at<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.459> lot<00:03:28.580> of<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.730> magazine's

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
when I look at a lot of the magazine's

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.910 
when I look at a lot of the magazine's
they<00:03:29.360> all<00:03:29.570> seem<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:29.900> really<00:03:30.110> rave<00:03:30.380> about<00:03:30.560> this

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
they all seem to really rave about this

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.670 
they all seem to really rave about this
car

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
car

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.350 
car
and<00:03:31.860> they<00:03:32.340> seem<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.670> think<00:03:32.700> about<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.330> same

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
and they seem to think about it the same

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.540 
and they seem to think about it the same
way<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.780> do<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.260> it's<00:03:34.410> just<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:34.830> rowdy

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
way I do that it's just this rowdy

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.580 
way I do that it's just this rowdy
little<00:03:36.030> hot<00:03:36.269> hatch<00:03:36.540> there's<00:03:36.930> just<00:03:37.470> an

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
little hot hatch there's just an

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.470 
little hot hatch there's just an
absolute<00:03:38.040> riot<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.640> drive<00:03:38.879> it<00:03:39.060> kind<00:03:39.300> of<00:03:39.330> brings

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
absolute riot to drive it kind of brings

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.800 
absolute riot to drive it kind of brings
back<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.440> pure<00:03:40.940> joy<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:41.970> driving<00:03:42.330> kind<00:03:42.690> of

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
back the the pure joy of driving kind of

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.300 
back the the pure joy of driving kind of
like<00:03:42.900> when<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.050> drive<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.230> go<00:03:43.830> kart<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:44.220> know

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
like when you drive a go kart you know

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.670 
like when you drive a go kart you know
it's<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.489> little<00:03:44.580> five<00:03:44.849> horse<00:03:45.150> go<00:03:46.080> kart<00:03:46.379> at<00:03:46.560> an

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
it's a little five horse go kart at an

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.949 
it's a little five horse go kart at an
amusement<00:03:46.890> park<00:03:47.190> it's<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.299> lot<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.569> fun<00:03:48.720> but<00:03:48.840> it

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
amusement park it's a lot of fun but it

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.589 
amusement park it's a lot of fun but it
surely<00:03:49.170> isn't<00:03:49.500> like<00:03:49.830> mind<00:03:50.700> blowing<00:03:51.030> ly<00:03:51.299> fast

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
surely isn't like mind blowing ly fast

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.180 
surely isn't like mind blowing ly fast
but<00:03:51.989> it's<00:03:52.140> just<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.500> idea<00:03:52.830> that<00:03:52.950> you're

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
but it's just the idea that you're

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.759 
but it's just the idea that you're
you're<00:03:53.849> driving<00:03:54.299> something<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.989> is<00:03:55.319> really

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
you're driving something that is really

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.479 
you're driving something that is really
the<00:03:56.040> pure<00:03:56.310> joy<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.819> being<00:03:57.510> behind<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.080> wheel

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
the pure joy of being behind the wheel

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.759 
the pure joy of being behind the wheel
and<00:03:59.489> I<00:03:59.910> think<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.540> Fiesta<00:04:00.930> ST<00:04:01.049> does<00:04:01.530> that

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
and I think the the Fiesta ST does that

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.089 
and I think the the Fiesta ST does that
I<00:04:01.799> think<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.250> small<00:04:02.519> size<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:03.180> light<00:04:03.390> weight

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
I think the small size the light weight

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.890 
I think the small size the light weight
the<00:04:05.099> amount<00:04:05.130> of<00:04:05.549> interaction<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:06.150> get<00:04:06.480> with

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
the amount of interaction you get with

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.180 
the amount of interaction you get with
the<00:04:07.019> controls<00:04:07.380> you<00:04:07.530> know<00:04:07.709> it's<00:04:07.890> not<00:04:08.010> an

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
the controls you know it's not an

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.809 
the controls you know it's not an
automatic<00:04:08.370> transmission<00:04:09.000> or<00:04:10.459> paddle<00:04:11.459> gearbox

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
automatic transmission or paddle gearbox

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.539 
automatic transmission or paddle gearbox
no<00:04:12.360> it's<00:04:12.569> it's<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:13.049> traditional<00:04:13.680> manual

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
no it's it's a traditional manual

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.900 
no it's it's a traditional manual
gearbox<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:16.620> steering<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.340> feel<00:04:17.579> very

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
gearbox the steering you feel very

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.800 
gearbox the steering you feel very
connected<00:04:18.410> with<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:20.639> with<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.359> road<00:04:21.540> surface

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
connected with the with the road surface

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.810 
connected with the with the road surface
with<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.350> way<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.830> steering<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.639> on

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
with the way that the steering is on

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.400 
with the way that the steering is on
this<00:04:24.000> yeah<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.360> does<00:04:24.539> have<00:04:24.570> electronic<00:04:25.260> power

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
this yeah it does have electronic power

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.590 
this yeah it does have electronic power
steering<00:04:25.470> and<00:04:25.979> on<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.580> lot<00:04:26.820> of<00:04:26.850> cars<00:04:27.150> that<00:04:27.419> kind

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
steering and on a lot of cars that kind

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.029 
steering and on a lot of cars that kind
of<00:04:27.750> gives<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:27.990> numb<00:04:28.639> feeling<00:04:29.660> that<00:04:31.039> this

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
of gives a numb feeling that this

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.890 
of gives a numb feeling that this
doesn't<00:04:32.490> this<00:04:32.850> doesn't<00:04:33.180> suffer<00:04:33.510> from<00:04:33.630> this

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
doesn't this doesn't suffer from this

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.510 
doesn't this doesn't suffer from this
car<00:04:34.080> doesn't<00:04:34.350> have<00:04:34.380> that<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:34.949> Fiesta<00:04:35.310> really

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
car doesn't have that the Fiesta really
