00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.779 
dressed in a nice to get out my hair
still<00:00:45.750> damp<00:00:45.930> nail<00:00:46.200> um<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.489> see<00:00:47.640> it's

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
still damp nail um as you can see it's

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.869 
still damp nail um as you can see it's
got<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.120> some<00:00:48.329> clumps<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.140> now<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:54.649> um

got like some clumps in it now and um

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.220 
got like some clumps in it now and um
we'll<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.390> think<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.840> biggest<00:00:58.020> challenge

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
we'll see I think the biggest challenge

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.950 
we'll see I think the biggest challenge
for<00:00:58.530> me<00:00:58.590> will<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.280> not<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.850> do<00:01:00.090> anything<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
for me will be not to do anything to it

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.579 
for me will be not to do anything to it
cuz<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.170> used<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> telling<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:03.290> can<00:01:04.290> say

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
cuz I'm used to telling but I can say

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.890 
cuz I'm used to telling but I can say
watch<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.400> goes<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:05.850> make<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.240> hair<00:01:06.390> tangle<00:01:06.780> up

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
watch it goes do make my hair tangle up

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.770 
watch it goes do make my hair tangle up
really<00:01:07.170> bad<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.130> might<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.330> locking<00:01:09.540> up

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
really bad so I might be locking up

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.550 
really bad so I might be locking up
quicker<00:01:10.080> than<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.439> think<00:01:10.850> um<00:01:12.409> previously<00:01:13.409> my

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
quicker than I think um previously my

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.560 
quicker than I think um previously my
hair<00:01:13.770> was<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.280> list<00:01:14.490> out<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.450> has

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
hair was in this list out but it has

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.820 
hair was in this list out but it has
shea<00:01:15.750> butter<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:16.530> why<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.680> just

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
shea butter in it so that's why I just

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.289 
shea butter in it so that's why I just
washed<00:01:17.070> without<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> washed<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.820> twice<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.210> the
