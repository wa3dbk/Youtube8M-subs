today<00:00:04.650> we're<00:00:04.890> talking<00:00:05.040> about<00:00:05.569> spring-loaded

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
today we're talking about spring-loaded

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.790 
today we're talking about spring-loaded
camming<00:00:06.960> devices<00:00:07.589> or<00:00:07.830> cams<00:00:09.500> they're<00:00:10.500> one<00:00:10.710> of

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
camming devices or cams they're one of

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.470 
camming devices or cams they're one of
the<00:00:10.889> most<00:00:11.070> common<00:00:11.460> pieces<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:12.090> climbing

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
the most common pieces of climbing

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.770 
the most common pieces of climbing
equipment<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.139> traditional<00:00:13.740> climbing<00:00:13.980> today

equipment and traditional climbing today
the<00:00:15.780> first<00:00:16.049> cam<00:00:16.260> started<00:00:16.710> showing<00:00:16.859> up<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
the first cam started showing up in the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.689 
the first cam started showing up in the
1970s<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:19.050> pretty<00:00:19.380> much<00:00:19.529> revolutionized<00:00:20.400> how

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
1970s and pretty much revolutionized how

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.460 
1970s and pretty much revolutionized how
we<00:00:20.760> can<00:00:20.970> protect<00:00:21.150> parallel<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.170> flared

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
we can protect parallel and flared

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.580 
we can protect parallel and flared
cracks<00:00:23.840> so<00:00:24.840> we're<00:00:24.930> going<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.140> talk<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> little

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
cracks so we're going to talk a little

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.310 
cracks so we're going to talk a little
bit<00:00:25.769> about<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.220> design<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.640> cams<00:00:27.150> cams<00:00:27.960> either

bit about the design of cams cams either
have<00:00:28.769> four<00:00:29.160> lobes<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:30.269> two<00:00:30.570> three<00:00:31.019> four

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
have four lobes one two three four

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.930 
have four lobes one two three four
like<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.250> Black<00:00:32.520> Diamond<00:00:32.750> c4<00:00:33.750> Camelot<00:00:34.290> or

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
like this Black Diamond c4 Camelot or

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.650 
like this Black Diamond c4 Camelot or
three<00:00:35.940> lobes<00:00:39.110> one<00:00:40.110> two<00:00:40.620> three<00:00:41.420> like<00:00:42.420> this

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
three lobes one two three like this

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.240 
three lobes one two three like this
Black<00:00:42.899> Diamond<00:00:43.110> c3<00:00:43.860> Camelot

so<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> cam<00:00:47.640> lobes<00:00:48.289> are<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> parts<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
so the cam lobes are the parts of the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.170 
so the cam lobes are the parts of the
cam<00:00:50.449> that<00:00:51.449> come<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.780> contact<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.500> rock

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
cam that come in contact with the rock

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.090 
cam that come in contact with the rock
here<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.620> here<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.870> these<00:00:57.870> lobes<00:00:58.230> transfer

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
here and here and these lobes transfer

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.240 
here and here and these lobes transfer
the<00:00:59.219> pressure<00:00:59.600> or<00:01:00.600> transfer<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> force<00:01:01.890> from

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the pressure or transfer the force from

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.320 
the pressure or transfer the force from
a<00:01:02.370> downward<00:01:02.670> fall<00:01:03.300> outward<00:01:04.820> this<00:01:05.820> transfer<00:01:06.299> of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
a downward fall outward this transfer of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.750 
a downward fall outward this transfer of
load<00:01:06.740> multiplies<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.979> force<00:01:08.250> creating

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
load multiplies the force creating

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.120 
load multiplies the force creating
immense<00:01:09.150> outward<00:01:09.600> pressure<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.950> lot<00:01:11.100> of

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
immense outward pressure and a lot of

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.830 
immense outward pressure and a lot of
friction<00:01:11.430> which<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.090> actually<00:01:12.390> how<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> cam

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
friction which is actually how the cam

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.350 
friction which is actually how the cam
works<00:01:14.090> other<00:01:15.090> parts<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> cam<00:01:17.000> include<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
works other parts of the cam include the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.380 
works other parts of the cam include the
trigger<00:01:18.720> right<00:01:19.409> here<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.729> trigger<00:01:21.060> wires

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
trigger right here the trigger wires

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.350 
trigger right here the trigger wires
which<00:01:21.960> are<00:01:22.110> these<00:01:22.909> these<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.150> trigger

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
which are these these are the trigger

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.880 
which are these these are the trigger
wires<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:26.100> axles<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.360> these<00:01:28.200> black<00:01:28.470> diamond

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
wires the axles and these black diamond

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.920 
wires the axles and these black diamond
c4s<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.549> double<00:01:29.880> axle<00:01:30.180> cams<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.689> they<00:01:30.810> have

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
c4s are double axle cams so they have

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.120 
c4s are double axle cams so they have
two<00:01:31.170> axles<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:32.700> c3<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.689> see<00:01:33.960> has<00:01:34.860> only

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
two axles the c3 you can see has only

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.050 
two axles the c3 you can see has only
one<00:01:35.400> axle<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.570> lobes<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.640> then<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.790> cam

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
one axle so the lobes and then the cam

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.420 
one axle so the lobes and then the cam
stem<00:01:42.600> which<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.920> runs<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.310> way

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
stem which is this that runs all the way

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.499 
stem which is this that runs all the way
up<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.759> down<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> cam<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:47.180> then<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.479> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
up and down the cam and then we have a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:58.289 
up and down the cam and then we have a
thumb<00:01:48.869> loop<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.950> sling

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.130 

so<00:01:58.869> like<00:01:59.170> I<00:01:59.320> said<00:01:59.670> cams<00:02:00.670> work<00:02:01.000> by<00:02:01.270> transferring

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
so like I said cams work by transferring

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.889 
so like I said cams work by transferring
a<00:02:02.320> downward<00:02:02.979> pressure<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.780> fall<00:02:05.079> outward

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
a downward pressure of a fall outward

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.389 
a downward pressure of a fall outward
from<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.019> cam<00:02:08.259> lobes<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.979> wall<00:02:09.190> of<00:02:09.310> the

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
from the cam lobes to the wall of the

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.540 
from the cam lobes to the wall of the
crack<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.709> might<00:02:11.860> be<00:02:11.920> hard<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.430> visualize

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
crack so it might be hard to visualize

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.940 
crack so it might be hard to visualize
but<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.420> cam<00:02:13.629> holds<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.349> fall<00:02:14.590> using

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
but the cam holds you in a fall using

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.280 
but the cam holds you in a fall using
friction<00:02:15.190> which<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.090> created<00:02:16.690> between<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
friction which is created between the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.650 
friction which is created between the
crack<00:02:17.530> wall<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.700> cam<00:02:18.940> lobes<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:22.330> when<00:02:22.540> we

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
crack wall and the cam lobes so when we

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.650 
crack wall and the cam lobes so when we
place<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.959> key<00:02:23.230> I'm<00:02:23.349> going<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.530> crack

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
place a key I'm going to crack

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.619 
place a key I'm going to crack
we<00:02:25.660> stick<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:25.989> into<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.319> crack<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.629> the

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
we stick it into the crack and the

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.160 
we stick it into the crack and the
spring<00:02:29.110> expands<00:02:29.680> pushing<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.400> lobes<00:02:30.670> out

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
spring expands pushing the lobes out

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.460 
spring expands pushing the lobes out
onto<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.290> sides<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.799> the<00:02:33.190> crack<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:35.170> a

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
onto the sides of the crack and it's a

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.150 
onto the sides of the crack and it's a
stays<00:02:35.920> there<00:02:36.220> using<00:02:36.819> friction<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.470> same

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
stays there using friction so that same

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.830 
stays there using friction so that same
friction<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:41.860> multiplied<00:02:42.489> when<00:02:43.360> we<00:02:43.540> put

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
friction is just multiplied when we put

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.420 
friction is just multiplied when we put
weight<00:02:44.079> onto<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.440> cam<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:47.769> can<00:02:47.950> see<00:02:48.220> this

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
weight onto the cam so you can see this

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.870 
weight onto the cam so you can see this
when<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:49.090> place<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.450> cam<00:02:49.720> in<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.900> crack<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.880> stays

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
when you place a cam in a crack it stays

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.490 
when you place a cam in a crack it stays
there<00:02:52.180> after<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.630> release<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.049> trigger<00:02:53.290> and

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
there after you release the trigger and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.339 
there after you release the trigger and
then<00:02:54.069> if<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.340> pull<00:02:54.579> on<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.840> cam<00:02:56.079> lobes

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
then if you pull on it the cam lobes

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.380 
then if you pull on it the cam lobes
just<00:02:57.010> push<00:02:57.280> tighter<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:57.819> tighter<00:02:58.000> against

just push tighter and tighter against

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.319 
just push tighter and tighter against
the<00:02:58.569> walls<00:02:59.370> let's<00:03:00.370> talk<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.670> little<00:03:00.790> bit<00:03:01.150> about

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
the walls let's talk a little bit about

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.680 
the walls let's talk a little bit about
placing<00:03:02.019> a<00:03:02.110> cam<00:03:03.030> cam<00:03:04.030> should<00:03:04.269> be<00:03:04.389> placed

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
placing a cam cam should be placed

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.580 
placing a cam cam should be placed
between<00:03:04.930> 50<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:05.739> 90<00:03:06.430> percent<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:07.200> their<00:03:08.200> range

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
between 50 and 90 percent of their range

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.340 
between 50 and 90 percent of their range
so<00:03:09.430> cams<00:03:09.790> range<00:03:10.180> this<00:03:10.600> is<00:03:10.810> fully<00:03:11.109> open<00:03:11.560> or<00:03:13.350> 0%

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
so cams range this is fully open or 0%

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.270 
so cams range this is fully open or 0%
closed

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280

this<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.350> 100%<00:03:17.350> closed<00:03:18.090> when<00:03:19.090> we<00:03:19.209> place<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.480> cam

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
this is 100% closed when we place a cam

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.460 
this is 100% closed when we place a cam
we<00:03:20.049> want<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.350> try<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.560> go<00:03:20.829> from<00:03:21.180> 90<00:03:22.180> percent<00:03:22.660> to

around 50% and no further than that

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.479 
around 50% and no further than that
so<00:03:28.299> beyond<00:03:28.959> 50%<00:03:30.030> allows<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.239> cam<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:32.470> be<00:03:33.190> less

good<00:04:12.239> rock<00:04:12.480> quality<00:04:12.799> because<00:04:13.799> we<00:04:13.950> know<00:04:14.159> that

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
good rock quality because we know that

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.900 
good rock quality because we know that

want<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:53.880> talk<00:04:54.030> about<00:04:54.210> is<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:55.740> strength<00:04:56.160> of

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
want to talk about is the strength of

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.870 
want to talk about is the strength of
cams<00:04:56.699> in<00:04:57.350> general<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.650> larger<00:04:58.889> cams<00:04:59.460> are

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
cams in general the larger cams are

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.550 
cams in general the larger cams are
going<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.180> be<00:05:00.300> stronger<00:05:00.900> than<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.199> smaller

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
going to be stronger than the smaller

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.310 
going to be stronger than the smaller
ones<00:05:01.919> so<00:05:03.380> for<00:05:04.380> these<00:05:04.530> Black<00:05:04.800> Diamond<00:05:05.070> C<00:05:05.520> fours

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
ones so for these Black Diamond C fours

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.170 
ones so for these Black Diamond C fours
these<00:05:07.320> are<00:05:07.440> almost<00:05:07.620> all<00:05:07.979> 14<00:05:08.520> kN

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
these are almost all 14 kN

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.100 
these are almost all 14 kN
so<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:09.690> number<00:05:09.960> four<00:05:10.229> three<00:05:10.919> two<00:05:11.550> one<00:05:12.360> point

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
so the number four three two one point

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.300 
so the number four three two one point
seven<00:05:13.380> five<00:05:13.620> are<00:05:13.979> all<00:05:14.400> fourteen<00:05:15.330> KN<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:16.310> then

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
seven five are all fourteen KN and then

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.960 
seven five are all fourteen KN and then
when<00:05:17.610> we<00:05:17.729> get<00:05:17.880> down<00:05:17.940> to<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:18.630> point<00:05:18.930> five<00:05:19.200> here

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
when we get down to the point five here

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.400 
when we get down to the point five here
it<00:05:20.970> drops<00:05:21.300> to<00:05:21.570> 12<00:05:22.380> KN<00:05:22.950> and<00:05:23.810> then<00:05:24.810> as<00:05:25.050> we<00:05:25.289> get

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
it drops to 12 KN and then as we get

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.730 
it drops to 12 KN and then as we get
even<00:05:25.470> smaller<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.460> point<00:05:26.760> three<00:05:27.000> here<00:05:27.389> is

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
even smaller the point three here is

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.990 
even smaller the point three here is
eight<00:05:28.740> KN<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:30.650> then<00:05:31.650> when<00:05:32.310> we<00:05:32.460> move<00:05:32.639> into<00:05:32.820> the

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
eight KN and then when we move into the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.659 
eight KN and then when we move into the
Black<00:05:33.240> Diamond<00:05:33.479> c3<00:05:34.289> which<00:05:35.099> is<00:05:35.250> actually

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
Black Diamond c3 which is actually

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:40.969 
Black Diamond c3 which is actually
smaller<00:05:36.030> than<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.479> point<00:05:36.720> three<00:05:39.979> the

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
smaller than the point three the

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.370 
smaller than the point three the
strength<00:05:41.639> actually<00:05:41.789> jumps<00:05:42.330> up<00:05:42.479> to<00:05:42.510> ten<00:05:42.900> K<00:05:43.169> n<00:05:43.349> so

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
strength actually jumps up to ten K n so

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.320 
strength actually jumps up to ten K n so
this<00:05:43.860> is<00:05:44.010> a<00:05:44.039> good<00:05:44.280> example<00:05:44.430> of<00:05:45.090> how<00:05:45.150> a

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
this is a good example of how a

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.240 
this is a good example of how a
different<00:05:45.840> design<00:05:46.199> of<00:05:46.470> a<00:05:46.560> cam<00:05:46.770> can<00:05:47.099> be

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
different design of a cam can be

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.800 
different design of a cam can be
stronger<00:05:47.849> than<00:05:48.720> another<00:05:50.419> so<00:05:51.419> check<00:05:52.349> out<00:05:52.560> your

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
stronger than another so check out your

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.620 
stronger than another so check out your
manufacturer's<00:05:54.810> information<00:05:56.060> to<00:05:57.060> see<00:05:57.479> the
