nut will have to be taken out of the
package<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.620> used<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.790> reason<00:02:29.120> for<00:02:29.209> that

package and used and the reason for that

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.089 
package and used and the reason for that
is<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.690> because<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:30.049> stock<00:02:30.290> ford<00:02:30.620> motor<00:02:30.799> mount

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
is is because of stock ford motor mount

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.569 
is is because of stock ford motor mount

Steeda replacement mount does not have

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.759 
Steeda replacement mount does not have
that<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.239> need<00:02:38.569> to<00:02:38.630> use<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.780> nut<00:02:39.079> on<00:02:39.109> to<00:02:39.680> the

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
that so you need to use a nut on to the

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.250 
that so you need to use a nut on to the
bolt<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.310> clamp<00:02:40.579> it<00:02:40.730> tight<00:02:41.079> once<00:02:42.079> you've
