00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
the

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.099 
the
so<00:04:06.370> he's<00:04:06.939> in<00:04:07.120> there<00:04:07.299> for<00:04:07.540> that<00:04:07.689> reason<00:04:08.079> that

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
so he's in there for that reason that

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.709

World<00:04:08.469> Cup<00:04:08.709> performance<00:04:09.329> but<00:04:10.329> um<00:04:10.480> yeah<00:04:10.689> I

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:10.719 
World Cup performance but um yeah I

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:12.660

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
think would you call it the party's just

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.229 
think would you call it the party's just
lagged<00:04:13.239> out<00:04:13.450> so<00:04:13.840> um<00:04:14.189> yeah<00:04:17.160> what<00:04:18.160> else<00:04:18.340> that

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
lagged out so um yeah what else that

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.969 
lagged out so um yeah what else that
that's<00:04:19.449> about<00:04:19.570> as<00:04:19.810> good<00:04:19.870> as<00:04:20.109> that<00:04:20.259> get<00:04:20.530> to<00:04:20.829> be

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979
