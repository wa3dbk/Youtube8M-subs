00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
people tend to think that since there's

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.480

a<00:01:18.750> bend<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> paddle<00:01:19.860> they<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.190> use<00:01:20.340> it

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
a bend in the paddle they can use it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.040 
a bend in the paddle they can use it
like<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> shovel<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.390> they'll<00:01:21.480> get<00:01:21.630> more<00:01:21.810> power

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
like a shovel and they'll get more power

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.230 
like a shovel and they'll get more power
with<00:01:22.380> each<00:01:22.530> stroke<00:01:22.979> well<00:01:23.340> that's<00:01:23.550> just<00:01:23.850> wrong

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
with each stroke well that's just wrong

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.450 
with each stroke well that's just wrong
the<00:01:24.810> proper<00:01:25.320> way<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.500> hold<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:25.920> paddle<00:01:26.310> is
