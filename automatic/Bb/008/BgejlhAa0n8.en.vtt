00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.879
 Servus tube and friends of the well-groomed 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.490
 Welcome back to gamings 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:15.570
 the motto bad for you today 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:21.840
 there is a snack 7 105 meter digger of 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.580
 dsl 500 so by simba great plains the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.510
 personally i do not know company 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.220
 we have here two beautiful logos or dsl 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.560
 500 group is available in two variants 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.559
 once in probably the old one 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.290
 film color in the beautiful orange and 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:43.260
 once in a brighter more beautiful almost 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.550
 German green can be said newcomers 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.989
 is called the color or is called the model 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.030
 that means either that the new ones 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.370
 film colors or it just gives in 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.500
 two colors for both 66 1180 euro is 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.809
 that's perfectly acceptable 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.210
 as I said five meters does not approach 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.340
 however, we need a lot of 250 ps 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.720
 So it properly what brings on 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.369
 power was 15 euro maintenance costs and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.110
 as I said if we still here 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.570
 German credits would have the from the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.790
 really good 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.820
 I'll buy it line again 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.540
 test purposes if you see that the lok 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.729
 she is not faultless because of her 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.009
 no info have any kind of back the lok 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.720
 Really weird why look at us 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.460
 the model in itself 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.259
 I would say what I notice immediately 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.049
 the dirt particles are very very 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.380
 are high on reading and that movies 0 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.850
 great plains oh yes what else to me 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.890
 It has come to nothing 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:49.470
 uncouple mode couple manual 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:52.740
 manually connect the sound of the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.990
 rim does not quite fit the rest 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.240
 Otherwise, the whole color is completely in 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.860
 order the tires are in any case 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.340
 also the right ones and the resolution of the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.840
 Dirt particles is really bomb 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.980
 while behind are such a thing 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.520
 of course, like a mature one 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.110
 there is the quasi or so round rollers 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.850
 which is really nice when dirty 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.110
 the whole model is covered by 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.170
 light exploit 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.880
 we have several functions here though 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.870
 otherwise the model is also the 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.450
 I can always see madness here 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.410
 the part works apart 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.850
 we have not because the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.520
 work and look very very high 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.430
 you should not break that up either 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.640
 forget as well so everything is braked 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.550
 present here said she unfolded 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.770
 the part so the only thing is the village 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.510
 if you disconnect merfeld the reason it 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.130
 There is no holder or anything else here 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.870
 it is in the folded like 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.920
 unfolded state exactly the same 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.200
 and that's what bothers me a bit 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.480
 does not help now i would have been out there though 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.120
 which tries and that's how I group 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.830
 I do not know if that does not work 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.200
 as I said if you lower the part goes 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.230
 the tire works up and you 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.570
 so to speak, you have the full glass of it 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.490
 Of course I'm the zone 14 ps of course 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.900
 This also ripens something like that 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.820
 puts everything on it and you have to 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.400
 also pull and then you can with here 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.000
 16 km h with that over heat that is 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.000
 really total 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:28.350
 I would say that we take the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.940
 15 km h let's look at that 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.130
 is the hottest that we see 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.430
 that it has different soil textures 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.160
 that's one is the first time and it 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.390
 has the sense because I have to 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.330
 I need to get out of here so you can 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.709
 can even understand march 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:49.590
 can notify 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:51.390
 we have a normal divorce here 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.290
 which looks a bit colorful nationwide 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.410
 loosen up a bit 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.810
 but otherwise fall 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.209
 they're down here, that's really 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.900
 already deep sink for the deep group 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.480
 I say 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.209
 this would certainly be 20 cm 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.790
 it may be good yes even if i still 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.909
 more apropos vitamin or page dsl 500 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.400
 Lettering man one is the device 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.859
 horny behind again the same slices 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:25.310
 and finally a mature parka 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:28.340
 packed because that's what material 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.130
 is probably steel metal 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.080
 something will be otherwise otherwise 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.570
 Model 5 stars moderately the way of working 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.310
 five stars moderate what I still have him now 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.780
 wanted to show is that noticed with 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:45.590
 so if you reduce and drives and drive 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:48.710
 one pulls here that the texture the 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.210
 normal texture at front and back 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.370
 decide the service very logically 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.889
 but here at the deep grave is the 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.660
 darker that has the sense that also the 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.789
 the bottom-living indeed the darker 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.370
 the deeper it gets into the l 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.139
 means here comes deeper darker earth 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.789
 out and they visited the 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.960
 would portray different looks cool 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.000
 from that maybe a bit too 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.039
 black but you just see the 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.940
 color contrast and it's really fun 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:16.720
 to watch article system available 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.470
 the rollers here also turn perfectly 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.410
 So we have the perfect one here 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.539
 The mod's interaction needs to be five 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.590
 be rated stars 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.419
 I know when I said to myself 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.910
 that parts shit that I can 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.380
 say it in the face is not the part 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.139
 is not shit if so one 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.580
 motto gods what the only thing 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.259
 annoying me the most is just the 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.460
 transport or the 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.580
 disconnect possibility just a lot 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.139
 partly falling down is where you could be here 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.780
 somehow still a support ran 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.979
 left right or so a fat then 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.139
 I want to keep it pretty good 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.930
 that would not have to say much but it 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.629
 So it just looks stupid and in real 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.460
 that's certainly not the case 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:06:00.689
 otherwise five stars room here I 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.689
 I'm out there, it's good
