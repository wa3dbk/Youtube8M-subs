00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.730
 what is God's purpose for the earth is for man 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.339
 as we saw in the previous version 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.519
 It is important that we understand pon courses and proposed to be a creator 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.519
 when I design and realize the earth and man 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.659
 we can only know it directly from him 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:29.519
 since god made sure we had his written word is 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.050
 It is reasonable to think that we can find the answer to this in the Bible 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.010
 important tomorrow 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.930
 first search to the answer 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.400
 we take into account what many people think and have been taught by 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.380
 much and religion 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.740
 many think that the earth 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.670
 what we see in this illustration this photo escaped from 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.720
 space 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.269
 it's just a passing stay 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:55.460
 for men 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.799
 a sort of test bed 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.600
 to see if the domino 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.440
 to live with god in heaven in what 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.720
 what is called 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.400
 paradise 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.290
 the earth once this transitory function has been exhausted 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.090
 will remain inhabitat 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.840
 even for some it will be destroyed 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.330
 and all men and women and women will be in public heaven 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.539
 let us consider this thought 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:24.909
 and let's compare 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.909
 with what we eat in painting 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.300
 right in the first book of the bible called genesis 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300
 we find the answer to our question 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.410
 now take your copy of the bible 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.220
 just in genesis 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.700
 you have understood 1 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.909
 the verse 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.750
 28 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.070
 can be found on page 21 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.539
 of the old testament in the case of the production we have used so far 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.980
 and that is the word of the Lord 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.280
 however you can watch it in any other translation 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.280
 in the sense that always pure 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.440
 let's read 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.949
 free and said with these words 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.669
 be fruitful 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.799
 become numerous 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.969
 populate the land 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.379
 governed by 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.869
 and dominates the fish of the sea 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:29.689
 on the birds of the sky and on all the animals that move on the earth 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.459
 these words 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.739
 we find them 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.029
 after that 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.480
 the book of genesis 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.480
 described the creative works digg 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.480
 and here in this verse we read what is the creator but I thought 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.480
 rewarded the first for the first human beings 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:54.799
 superhq 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.289
 Adam and Eve 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:00.659
 It is interesting to note 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.969
 that at the time there was a direct dialogue between god 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.539
 and human beings 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.339
 the in this synthetic thought 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:13.620
 we can see that God's purpose for the earth 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.629
 and for men 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.090
 it was a purpose 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.859
 long-term 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.199
 Adam and Eve had to have children 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.119
 and to be able to see that their descendants 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:27.940
 they would have dome tuninter 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.659
 being very numerous 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:31.670
 us today 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.050
 we can understand even better the vastness of this purpose since the 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.209
 earth now contains about 7 billion people 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.729
 person who could hold a lot more 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.309
 in his communication with adamo and eva the creator 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.099
 does not say that their earthly experience had to be transitory 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.609
 and that then they would have to go with him to heaven 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.980
 the purpose of making them is not mentioned 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.139
 grow old 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.489
 and let me die so that their experience on earth is no limit 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.599
 in addition to becoming numerous it is popularly the land what it would have 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.599
 required thousands of years 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.620
 Adam and Eve together had their descendants 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.650
 rule dominate all the other living creatures that were on the 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.289
 land 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.289
 think what this could mean 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.530
 the land of gold to fill with people 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.320
 that they would have had a particular characteristic being sons of adamo ed 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.939
 eva 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:40.729
 they wouldn't get old, they wouldn't be sick, they wouldn't die 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.990
 that they would have enjoyed forever 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.460
 of beautiful letters 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.460
 in our wonderful plants 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:52.240
 this thought might surprise us because now we instead see the earth 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.689
 which is populated by thousands of people but who do not have these characteristics 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.599
 that they had Adam and Eve in the beginning 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:00.500
 what time 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.789
 all human beings get sick 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.129
 grow old 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:05.779
 and finally to moriano 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:10.159
 often because they get death prematurely with one another 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:14.719
 something extremely serious must have happened 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.220
 which negatively affected 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.220
 on the realization of the creator's purpose 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.870
 in the next lesson 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.610
 we'll see what happened 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.909
 and because today we are in this difficult situation 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.719
 the thing 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.059
 however interesting 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:35.949
 that we see in this section 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.180
 and key creator 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.110
 you have not abandoned his purpose 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.879
 forward 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:46.050
 still going to accomplish with the purpose that he had expressed the beginning
