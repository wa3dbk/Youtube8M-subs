00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
g'day folks my name is Bolin and I just

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.360 
g'day folks my name is Bolin and I just
wanted<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.319> announce<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.799> public

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
wanted to announce the public

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.490 
wanted to announce the public
accessibility<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:06.359> aviation<00:00:06.930> method<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.379> is

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
accessibility of aviation method this is

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.690 
accessibility of aviation method this is
it<00:00:07.649> running<00:00:07.799> live<00:00:08.069> where<00:00:08.370> it's<00:00:08.460> in<00:00:08.610> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
it running live where it's in the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.540 
it running live where it's in the
airport<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.240> we've<00:00:09.960> got<00:00:10.139> Etihad<00:00:10.590> flight<00:00:10.920> for

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
airport and we've got Etihad flight for

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.330 
airport and we've got Etihad flight for
five<00:00:11.969> for<00:00:12.210> coming<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.889> there<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.009> is

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
five for coming in there it is

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.960 
five for coming in there it is
let's<00:00:14.849> into<00:00:15.059> virtual<00:00:15.420> cockpit<00:00:15.570> mode

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.880 

so<00:00:19.510> that's<00:00:19.690> what<00:00:19.840> it<00:00:19.900> looks<00:00:20.050> like<00:00:20.200> from<00:00:20.800> the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
so that's what it looks like from the

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:42.410 
so that's what it looks like from the
cockpit<00:00:21.100> of<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.720> plane

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.350 

those<00:00:43.420> are<00:00:43.780> trails<00:00:44.500> that<00:00:44.829> we<00:00:44.920> can<00:00:45.100> see<00:00:45.360> left

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
those are trails that we can see left

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.630 
those are trails that we can see left
behind<00:00:46.780> by<00:00:47.379> previous<00:00:47.860> flights<00:00:48.370> that<00:00:48.579> have

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
behind by previous flights that have

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.430 
behind by previous flights that have
taken<00:00:49.300> off<00:00:49.420> on<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.780> runway<00:00:50.050> the<00:00:50.230> color

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
taken off on the runway the color

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.280 
taken off on the runway the color
color-coded<00:00:51.190> so<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:52.180> change<00:00:52.449> in<00:00:52.600> color<00:00:52.750> is

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
color-coded so the change in color is

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.090 
color-coded so the change in color is
indicative<00:00:53.589> of<00:00:53.949> different<00:00:54.780> altitudes<00:00:56.100> we

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
indicative of different altitudes we

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.729 
indicative of different altitudes we
have<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.640> red<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.290> left<00:00:59.470> hand<00:00:59.620> side

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
have the red to the left hand side

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.040 
have the red to the left hand side
integrate<00:01:00.280> indicating<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.180> trails<00:01:01.870> left

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
integrate indicating the trails left

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.780 
integrate indicating the trails left
behind<00:01:02.379> as<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:02.739> planes<00:01:02.979> takes<00:01:03.280> you<00:01:03.460> back<00:01:03.610> on

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
behind as the planes takes you back on

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.230 
behind as the planes takes you back on
the<00:01:03.879> runway<00:01:05.520> look<00:01:06.520> in<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.729> bottom<00:01:06.939> left<00:01:07.119> hand

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
the runway look in the bottom left hand

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.850 
the runway look in the bottom left hand
corner<00:01:07.330> we<00:01:07.630> can<00:01:07.780> see<00:01:07.930> some<00:01:08.140> statistics<00:01:08.740> about

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
corner we can see some statistics about

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.270 
corner we can see some statistics about
the<00:01:09.009> current<00:01:09.369> plane<00:01:09.580> if<00:01:10.540> we<00:01:10.979> get<00:01:11.979> out<00:01:12.130> at

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
the current plane if we get out at

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.560 
the current plane if we get out at
virtual<00:01:12.640> pocket<00:01:12.970> mode<00:01:14.759> then<00:01:15.759> we<00:01:16.270> can<00:01:16.420> see

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
Sydney Airport let's zoom in on Sydney

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.969 
Sydney Airport let's zoom in on Sydney
Airport<00:01:18.369> a<00:01:18.580> little<00:01:18.790> bit<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:20.140> we<00:01:20.229> can<00:01:20.259> see<00:01:20.409> the

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
Airport a little bit and we can see the

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.230 
Airport a little bit and we can see the
number<00:01:21.250> other<00:01:21.520> planes<00:01:22.290> taxing<00:01:23.290> about<00:01:24.240> ready

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
look at that one that's actually Virgin

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.870 
look at that one that's actually Virgin
Australia<00:02:28.890> three<00:02:29.890> for<00:02:30.099> two<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.550> if<00:02:30.610> we<00:02:30.730> click

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
Australia three for two and if we click

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.600 
Australia three for two and if we click
on<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.120> we<00:02:31.300> can<00:02:32.260> see<00:02:32.500> what<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.370> view<00:02:33.580> looks

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
on it we can see what the view looks

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.780 
on it we can see what the view looks
like<00:02:34.349> from<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.740> cockpit<00:02:35.950> that's<00:02:36.370> currently

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
like from the cockpit that's currently

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.200 
like from the cockpit that's currently
at<00:02:37.440> 37,000<00:02:38.440> 975<00:02:39.160> feet

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
at 37,000 975 feet

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.540 
at 37,000 975 feet
and<00:02:43.020> traveling<00:02:44.020> with<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> speed<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.470> 425<00:02:45.190> knots

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
and traveling with a speed of 425 knots

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.980 
and traveling with a speed of 425 knots
you<00:02:45.850> can<00:02:45.970> see<00:02:46.120> how<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.240> icons<00:02:46.420> measures

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
you can see how the icons measures

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.230 
you can see how the icons measures
beings<00:02:47.590> living<00:02:48.310> by<00:02:48.460> other<00:02:48.580> ones<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.090> we<00:02:49.210> have

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
beings living by other ones and we have

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.960 
beings living by other ones and we have
si<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.950> 2-1<00:02:50.950> something<00:02:51.310> for<00:02:51.460> click<00:02:51.610> on<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.820> one

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
si a 2-1 something for click on that one

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.030 
si a 2-1 something for click on that one
we<00:02:52.090> can<00:02:52.240> transition<00:02:52.900> immediately<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.800> it's

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
we can transition immediately to it's

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
we can transition immediately to it's
quite<00:02:54.280> good<00:02:54.400> view<00:02:58.080> but<00:02:59.080> if<00:02:59.980> we<00:03:00.220> have<00:03:00.820> a<00:03:00.850> look

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
quite good view but if we have a look

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.300 
quite good view but if we have a look
now<00:03:01.560> we<00:03:02.560> have<00:03:02.680> another<00:03:02.860> plane<00:03:03.130> coming<00:03:03.160> in

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:34.570 

let's<00:03:07.970> end<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.510> video<00:03:08.630> on<00:03:08.930> this<00:03:09.050> approach
