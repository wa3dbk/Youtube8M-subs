 bad for you 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:14.969
 and this time here is a deferred video and 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.279
 14 today that problems for me is a 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.859
 thing good is because you want a child i 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.380
 naruto moggi southern guys even before 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.420
 to enter here does not provide the like 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.779
 to speak some things first 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.599
 and / or is the server only original cover by 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.030
 while I do not know if it comes project 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.000
 to bring pirate talk also more fragile 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.090
 But tragically for now it's only for 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.670
 original is and server 30 is very small 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.530
 is with 60 of the others for now 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.350
 by the being of the same has said that goes 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.020
 increase and causally, I will not 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.500
 Everyone joins beauty now I want to show one 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.870
 the center of powers goes 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.559
 add a magna magma clean one 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.570
 chic and a filter is it was a shame I 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.619
 do not take the minecraft after you do 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.450
 a lot of exercise and it 's this business of 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.799
 three are with a sound go seven sets 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.310
 primary and secondary 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.930
 transportation the magma first 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.540
 January will add more together 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.720
 next I think that the combat population 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.549
 fight against the worst injustices 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.770
 I'll send it, I'll show everyone. 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.460
 show of each one then I will show 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.320
 now that the fae is fair nor is it the fire 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.090
 and he's going to send that kind of fireball 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.630
 and I do not know if you've seen 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.909

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.880
 9 seconds here for Mandela is a ball of 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.530
 fire well foch and she gives type 1 she gives a 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.530
 little bit less than ntc &amp; logistic 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.790
 no perin combat 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.590
 Leave me, I'm paying a little good 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.110
 He almost hit the car and also 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.770

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.800

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.110
 We're going to have an end, who's the boy king? 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.330
 all this we will also have the role 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.440
 in a little confuses what is 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.570
 confusion is not 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.880
 We're going to have the speed I 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:27.770
 I will show to the indigent will have paa 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:32.540
 I was lucky, the paranÃ¡ had 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:35.060
 so I find everyone trying to find the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.810
 other tombs here is not in itself is not 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.010
 that 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.930
 just did not have her there ready and take that 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.040
 that is the speed he will leave you 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.890
 well fit and do not let it go 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.200
 to have more or less is four together will 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.900
 to use the sound of the confusion is the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.350
 walk on the water and this one is what 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.410
 will leave very quickly there to have a uti 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.170
 time constraint is highly dependent 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.050
 of the character and more ahead goes 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.390
 there are chipbars on the server 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.450
 the server is kind of an open beta 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.610
 drink things at college bettega 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.020
 He's been there for a while now but what? 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.760
 started happening right 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.850
 and now what are our doing 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.100
 cooking yesterday 2 treat the time k 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.590
 Let me go back and now because I want to 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.950
 show the last one on the pen and I just 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.000
 Can I use it in combat? 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.220
 ending here as you can see 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.180
 exactly landing, sincere I think they will 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.040
 together right? 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.350
 together not my power to him does not come so 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.410
 so the galera is because the fog 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.610
 stay my god look at the abnormal break that 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.900
 is running and this one is the fire 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.830
 look at the normal state who is running 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.459
 it's normal 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.430
 the lÃ©o form italy nor ego is not dude 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.040
 with his own way and for the last 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.470
 people have fitch stopped shooting 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.290
 here looks top and the last one we have to 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.890
 affirm that the penalty that it will work 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.959
 it is powers before business I would say that a 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.360
 question and another opportunity ahead 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.030
 beauty looks like I'm not transiting 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.260
 for given this wood that will stay in the 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.130
 My place and / or you fucked 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.600
 teleported to another place 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.140
 is more or less 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.240
 which is the fair right people also I gather 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.790
 It's a joke to replace Luis. 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.260
 replace john where I'm going to use the 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.480
 lippi lippi 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.730
 he does basically that too he goes 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:39.440
 I'll send you forward as you've seen 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:42.980
 This is it folks dance the photo there and 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:47.320
 show that it is also the listener that he 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:50.600
 come to find him, he turns into a little car 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.970
 that he turns type shuriken much of the time 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.270
 You can send one in three 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:59.330
 seconds the wigan and he gives my damage 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.030
 god every kind of an arrow or command 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.810
 one here looks at the province because it 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.940
 It's going very fast, but it's about the time. 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.180
 very recommended to go to what you young 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.910
 winner of what fights a lot in the fight 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.030
 that makes it very cool rpg 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.740
 I love this sector, it's not just that. 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.090
 You can go forward, too. 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.770
 It's from other powers you're not today, it's just 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.260
 that's how you can see there in 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.090
 other powers is I'm from the dog the chile and 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.750
 anyone wants to know, right? 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:36.830
 there is a very good climate on the server that 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:39.170
 I know it's good, that's it. 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:43.070
 if you liked the server datola 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:45.290
 and that favorite right that is more video is 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.070
 servers also subscribe to the channel 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.940
 beauty 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:52.210
 So that's what it said and that's it 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.210
 went
