00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.420
 Chocolate has already started here 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.610

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.600
 I'm thirsty, we already have 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.759
 spread a little to the people 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.420
 also like to distribute and maybe even 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.950
 to conclude our bathroom that one 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.560
 sometimes turn on the light so you something 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.930

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.460
 here is the camping toilet we have 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.530

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.390
 sascha was okay i have the shorter one 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.829
 pulled we have solved and it was 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.360
 really okay with our container 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.000
 and you just have to overcome yourself 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.930
 but then it works and we can even 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.219

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.259
 we can actually find ourselves over 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.270

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.740

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.690
