everyday ski for skiing on the East

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.899 
everyday ski for skiing on the East
Coast<00:01:10.790> we<00:01:11.790> move<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.630> Watea<00:01:13.439> 94<00:01:14.189> there

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
Coast we move on to the Watea 94 there

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.179 
Coast we move on to the Watea 94 there
we<00:01:15.030> go<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.270> 94<00:01:15.840> millimeters<00:01:16.409> underfoot<00:01:16.530> so

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
we go at 94 millimeters underfoot so

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.520 
we go at 94 millimeters underfoot so
significantly<00:01:18.060> more<00:01:18.330> float<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:19.259> get<00:01:19.409> from

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
significantly more float you get from

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.140 
significantly more float you get from
some<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> other<00:01:19.979> skis<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.490> line<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
some of the other skis in the line and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.390 
some of the other skis in the line and
now<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.540> move<00:01:21.780> up<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.259> what<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.530> call<00:01:22.710> our

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
now we move up and do what we call our

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.060 
now we move up and do what we call our
powder<00:01:23.700> hull<00:01:24.030> skis<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.780> see<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.560> tip<00:01:25.830> right

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
powder hull skis you see that tip right

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.800 
powder hull skis you see that tip right
there<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.460> shaped<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.880> boat<00:01:27.150> hull<00:01:27.390> what

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
there it's shaped like a boat hull what

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.890 
there it's shaped like a boat hull what
that<00:01:28.020> does<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.890> improves<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.119> floatation<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
that does is improves the floatation and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.690 
that does is improves the floatation and
the<00:01:31.110> directional<00:01:31.619> stability<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.460> ski<00:01:32.670> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the directional stability of the ski and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.149 
the directional stability of the ski and
softer<00:01:33.270> snow<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.259> helps<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.950> tip

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
softer snow so it really helps the tip

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.850 
softer snow so it really helps the tip
plane<00:01:35.460> out<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> snow<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.329> then<00:01:37.079> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
plane out of the snow and then to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.980 
plane out of the snow and then to
further<00:01:38.159> help<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.790> tip<00:01:39.060> we've<00:01:39.689> got<00:01:39.869> to

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
further help that tip we've got to

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.679 
further help that tip we've got to
modify<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.439> Swallowtail<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:42.030> Swallowtail

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
modify the Swallowtail that Swallowtail

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.630 
modify the Swallowtail that Swallowtail
helps<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.439> tail<00:01:43.619> sink<00:01:43.979> deeper<00:01:44.369> into<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
helps that tail sink deeper into the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.060 
helps that tail sink deeper into the
snow<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> powder<00:01:45.810> hull<00:01:46.110> gets<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.770> tip<00:01:46.950> out

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
snow so the powder hull gets a tip out

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.429 
snow so the powder hull gets a tip out
of<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.250> snow<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> tail<00:01:48.479> lets<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.170> sink<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
of the snow on the tail lets it sink a

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.830 
of the snow on the tail lets it sink a
little<00:01:49.500> deeper<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.340> great<00:01:50.520> float<00:01:51.000> ski

this<00:03:47.669> ski<00:03:47.940> out<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.269> powder<00:03:48.449> is<00:03:49.290> we've<00:03:49.560> got<00:03:49.680> an

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
this ski out and powder is we've got an

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.159 
this ski out and powder is we've got an
extended<00:03:50.280> tip<00:03:50.579> here<00:03:50.909> so<00:03:51.269> that<00:03:51.419> the<00:03:51.599> side<00:03:51.870> cut

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
extended tip here so that the side cut

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.890 
extended tip here so that the side cut
actually<00:03:52.919> starts<00:03:53.280> right<00:03:53.549> about<00:03:53.669> here<00:03:54.239> so

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
actually starts right about here so

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.839 
actually starts right about here so
we've<00:03:55.049> elongated<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.799> tip<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.400> allows<00:03:56.609> for

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
we've elongated the tip that allows for

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.839 
we've elongated the tip that allows for
more<00:03:57.000> flow<00:03:57.359> and<00:03:57.780> also<00:03:58.199> doesn't<00:03:58.639> doesn't<00:03:59.639> make

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
more flow and also doesn't doesn't make

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.430 
more flow and also doesn't doesn't make
for<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.030> ski<00:04:00.209> that's<00:04:00.329> kind<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.569> hooky<00:04:00.959> in<00:04:01.169> powder

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
for a ski that's kind of hooky in powder

a powder ski that side cut starts right
up<00:04:04.470> at<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.709> contact<00:04:05.159> point<00:04:05.220> gets<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.090> little

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
up at the contact point gets a little

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.960 
up at the contact point gets a little
bit<00:04:06.449> hooky<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.079> by<00:04:07.229> extending<00:04:07.829> that<00:04:08.549> flat<00:04:08.819> spot

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
bit hooky so by extending that flat spot

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.449 
bit hooky so by extending that flat spot
there<00:04:09.359> it<00:04:10.079> steers<00:04:10.409> really<00:04:10.829> well<00:04:10.979> on<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.220> soft

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
there it steers really well on the soft

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.030 
there it steers really well on the soft
snow<00:04:11.699> here<00:04:12.479> we've<00:04:12.629> got<00:04:12.780> a<00:04:12.840> full<00:04:13.079> twin<00:04:13.470> so<00:04:13.889> for

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
snow here we've got a full twin so for

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.170 
snow here we've got a full twin so for
those<00:04:14.099> switch<00:04:14.400> landings<00:04:14.909> out<00:04:15.060> in<00:04:15.120> the

those switch landings out in the

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.770 
those switch landings out in the
backcountry

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
backcountry

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.470 
backcountry
114<00:04:16.769> is<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:16.979> great<00:04:17.579> ticket<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.959> also<00:04:19.200> it's<00:04:19.560> a

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
114 is a great ticket and also it's a

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.680 
114 is a great ticket and also it's a
or<00:04:20.630> profile<00:04:21.080> tale<00:04:21.410> now<00:04:22.220> it's<00:04:22.370> a<00:04:22.480> 146<00:04:23.480> in<00:04:23.630> the

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
or profile tale now it's a 146 in the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.220 
or profile tale now it's a 146 in the
shovel

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
shovel

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.770 
shovel
that's<00:04:24.650> only<00:04:24.800> 128<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:25.910> tail<00:04:26.180> it's<00:04:26.690> a

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
that's only 128 and the tail it's a

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.300 
that's only 128 and the tail it's a
little<00:04:27.140> bit<00:04:27.260> of<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.410> pintail<00:04:27.800> so<00:04:28.040> what<00:04:28.160> that

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
little bit of a pintail so what that

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.830 
little bit of a pintail so what that
does<00:04:28.490> is<00:04:28.640> it<00:04:28.730> allows<00:04:28.760> that<00:04:29.180> tail<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.540> sink<00:04:29.780> a

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
does is it allows that tail the sink a

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.000 
does is it allows that tail the sink a
little<00:04:29.930> bit<00:04:30.050> deeper<00:04:30.140> in<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.530> snow

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
little bit deeper in the snow

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.860 
little bit deeper in the snow
and<00:04:31.430> helps<00:04:31.700> that<00:04:31.820> powder<00:04:32.060> how<00:04:32.330> I<00:04:32.360> really<00:04:32.690> get

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
and helps that powder how I really get

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.080 
and helps that powder how I really get
the<00:04:33.020> front<00:04:33.710> of<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.830> ski<00:04:34.040> out<00:04:34.280> of<00:04:34.400> powder<00:04:34.670> and

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
the front of the ski out of powder and

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.750 
the front of the ski out of powder and
planes<00:04:35.450> off<00:04:35.720> really<00:04:36.200> nicely<00:04:36.410> and<00:04:36.920> believe<00:04:37.640> it

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
planes off really nicely and believe it

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.120 
planes off really nicely and believe it
or<00:04:37.820> not<00:04:37.940> at<00:04:38.210> 114<00:04:39.050> this<00:04:39.290> thinks<00:04:39.620> though<00:04:39.770> rips<00:04:40.040> a

or not at 114 this thinks though rips a

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.920 
or not at 114 this thinks though rips a
pretty<00:04:40.340> sweet<00:04:40.610> turn<00:04:40.850> on<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.120> hard<00:04:41.330> pack<00:04:41.570> and

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
pretty sweet turn on the hard pack and

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.380 
pretty sweet turn on the hard pack and
the<00:04:42.440> secret<00:04:42.830> behind<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.670> edge<00:04:43.790> grip<00:04:44.060> and

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
the secret behind the edge grip and

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.660 
the secret behind the edge grip and
performance<00:04:44.900> on<00:04:45.050> Harts<00:04:45.410> now<00:04:45.650> it's<00:04:46.430> right

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
performance on Harts now it's right

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.940 
performance on Harts now it's right
there<00:04:46.940> it's<00:04:47.570> a<00:04:47.750> double<00:04:48.500> eye<00:04:48.710> beam

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
there it's a double eye beam

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.370 
there it's a double eye beam
construction<00:04:49.580> that's<00:04:50.120> featured<00:04:50.540> in<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.720> 114

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
construction that's featured in the 114

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.200 
construction that's featured in the 114
the<00:04:51.950> 101<00:04:52.570> 94<00:04:53.570> 84<00:04:54.560> that's<00:04:55.190> what<00:04:55.340> that<00:04:55.520> IBM<00:04:55.970> does

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
the 101 94 84 that's what that IBM does

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.320 
the 101 94 84 that's what that IBM does
is<00:04:56.990> it<00:04:57.170> stiffens<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.680> ski<00:04:57.950> up<00:04:58.100> torsionally<00:04:58.910> so

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
is it stiffens the ski up torsionally so

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.450 
is it stiffens the ski up torsionally so
when<00:04:59.480> it's<00:04:59.600> on<00:04:59.690> hard<00:04:59.990> snow<00:05:00.200> holds<00:05:01.040> really<00:05:01.310> well

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
when it's on hard snow holds really well

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.520 
when it's on hard snow holds really well
but<00:05:02.270> actually<00:05:02.420> lightens<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.110> weight<00:05:03.230> of<00:05:03.470> the

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
but actually lightens the weight of the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.670 
but actually lightens the weight of the
ski<00:05:03.800> kind<00:05:04.700> of<00:05:04.790> gives<00:05:05.150> it<00:05:05.300> metal<00:05:05.900> performance

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
ski kind of gives it metal performance

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.010 
ski kind of gives it metal performance
like<00:05:06.830> two<00:05:07.280> sheets<00:05:07.520> of<00:05:07.610> metal<00:05:07.730> but<00:05:08.630> it<00:05:08.720> doesn't

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
like two sheets of metal but it doesn't

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.960 
like two sheets of metal but it doesn't
have<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.140> weight<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.620> it<00:05:09.740> so<00:05:10.250> on<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:10.520> boot<00:05:10.730> pack

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
have a weight to it so on that boot pack

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:11.830 
have a weight to it so on that boot pack
and<00:05:11.180> you're<00:05:11.270> going<00:05:11.390> to<00:05:11.420> throw<00:05:11.600> those<00:05:11.750> things

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
and you're going to throw those things

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.720 
and you're going to throw those things
over<00:05:12.230> your<00:05:12.350> shoulder<00:05:12.710> it's<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.520> pretty

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
over your shoulder it's a pretty

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.420 
over your shoulder it's a pretty
lightweight<00:05:14.090> skis<00:05:14.660> for<00:05:15.110> as<00:05:15.320> well<00:05:15.620> as<00:05:15.920> they<00:05:16.190> ski

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
lightweight skis for as well as they ski

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.330 
lightweight skis for as well as they ski
on<00:05:16.550> hard<00:05:16.820> snow<00:05:17.440> and<00:05:18.440> all<00:05:18.620> that<00:05:18.770> lightweight<00:05:18.980> is

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
on hard snow and all that lightweight is

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.440 
on hard snow and all that lightweight is
what<00:05:19.520> they<00:05:19.610> flew<00:05:19.790> it<00:05:19.910> even<00:05:20.090> better<00:05:20.240> than<00:05:20.330> the

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
what they flew it even better than the

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.740 
what they flew it even better than the
soft<00:05:20.660> stuff<00:05:20.930> so<00:05:21.680> while<00:05:21.860> Te'o<00:05:22.070> 114<00:05:22.750> don't

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
soft stuff so while Te'o 114 don't

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.870 
soft stuff so while Te'o 114 don't
