00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:11.040
 the sc neuheim defeated 1880 frankfurt 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.660
 with 55 to 7 and that worth seeing 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.580
 manier the game on the deep 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.350
 Rainy floor of the museum square 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.330
 a demonstration of can and wants 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.400
 almost a disassembly of the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.140
 frankfurter team wills portillo 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.960
 Try one of the two with three 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.960
 most successful players of sc neuheim 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.570
 the second scm player of the three tries 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.950
 lays sam harris the new zealand of the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:46.110
 here the entire defense of the guests 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:48.300
 looks like schoolboy nine home 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.870
 in the second half in each 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.480
 Relationship game determining here the 50 too 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.239
 seven by bodypaint the secret of 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.370
 Success is based on two components 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.219
 we have a great team and great camaraderie 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.320
 have been first for the first time since many 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.970
 years of proper teamwork and that 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.680
 hold different components 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.330
 this is among other things that 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.619
 trainers team because we are also very good 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.119
 harmonize through the three games 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.560
 inside where we have them close 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.880
 the team's turn, yes we train 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.780
 but also very son has him 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.100
 already three times a week 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.869
 and quite consistently the last one 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.000
 strike the Neuenheimer the weather and 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.290
 space just one more step 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.040
 before sliding into one 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.280
 mud fight 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.229
 his final spurt is frankfurter aus 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.540
 can check into one of the guests to pasta 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.110
 harris and he could play the day 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.000
 the last attempt to sift us to 55 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.729
 are currently table-second that is 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.329
 okay, we feel very well and 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.439
 Now we have to look like it 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.299
 We want to go on anyway 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.189
 keep this table space now 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.689
 at least until winter we have 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.030
 Another very difficult game against 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.759
 gh there acts that is pointing the way 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.189
 show for both teams and there 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.210
 19 would be firm 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.299
 frankfurt, although with some 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.979
 However, the ends finally come after all 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.780
 with bottom gain of the place gentlemen 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.119
 the appearance of the scn sovereign there 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.810
 would have the top team hrk too 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.810
 his crack 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.730
 Who does not want to be clear Who does not want it 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.410
 could someone have a good day for a game 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.740
 good team this is all part of it 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.970
 the circle currently no question it 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.130
 is the team of the season or the 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.420
 Last years and we have also 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.580
 not the financial opportunity again 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.110
 Hardy has and therefore I think so 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.650
 what we get out is then 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.120
 optimally after the game so the old one 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:45.660
 Wisdom is before the game 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:47.460
 march route dominate the does that is 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.900
 ten also on this game day from the beginning 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.460
 to beat this team 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.260
 it needs more than the meantime 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.550
 slimmed down the sc frankfurt 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.800
 can muster 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.080
 the table fourth sees no country neither 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.910
 athletic still playful the hard 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.630
 training work of the scn pays off 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.000
 apparently out 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.040
 after the game against the rgh one becomes 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.270
 For sure, if you know even the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.270
 hrk can beat
