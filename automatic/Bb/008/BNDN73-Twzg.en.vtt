00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and um at close range it's going to take

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.710 
and um at close range it's going to take
you<00:01:07.530> three<00:01:07.979> shots<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> drop<00:01:08.729> your<00:01:08.880> enemy<00:01:09.210> but

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.120 
it's gonna drop all the way off 26 at
long<00:01:12.840> range<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.770> major

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
long range and that is the major

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.380 
long range and that is the major
downfall<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.659> ARX<00:01:16.259> now<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.040> 43<00:01:17.700> damage

at<00:01:18.630> close<00:01:19.350> range<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.860> drops<00:01:20.070> down<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.390> 17

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
at close range and it drops down to 17

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.810 
at close range and it drops down to 17
at<00:01:21.689> long<00:01:21.869> range<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.560> here's<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.340> funny<00:01:23.580> thing

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
at long range and here's the funny thing

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.219 
at long range and here's the funny thing
even<00:01:24.090> though<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.750> know<00:01:24.840> that's

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
assault rifle I think the the top two

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.099 
assault rifle I think the the top two
assault<00:02:25.069> rifles<00:02:25.430> are<00:02:25.579> the<00:02:25.700> obviously<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.689> ARX

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
assault rifles are the obviously the ARX

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.920 
assault rifles are the obviously the ARX
and<00:02:27.379> the<00:02:27.769> F<00:02:27.950> ad<00:02:28.250> for<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.849> fire<00:02:29.090> rate<00:02:29.299> I<00:02:29.480> think

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
and the F ad for the fire rate I think

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.440 
and the F ad for the fire rate I think
this<00:02:30.049> one<00:02:30.260> comes<00:02:30.530> third<00:02:30.829> in<00:02:31.069> line<00:02:31.340> again<00:02:32.120> we

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
this one comes third in line again we

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.420 
this one comes third in line again we
see<00:02:32.599> that<00:02:32.629> standard<00:02:33.200> assault<00:02:33.530> rifle<00:02:33.859> 30<00:02:34.159> round

and<00:02:44.569> it's<00:02:44.780> going<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.930> drop<00:02:45.139> off<00:02:45.379> the<00:02:45.560> only<00:02:45.889> four

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
and it's going to drop off the only four

shots<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.939> kill<00:02:47.090> I<00:02:47.329> think<00:02:48.019> in<00:02:48.169> some<00:02:48.200> cases<00:02:48.889> 5

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
shots to kill I think in some cases 5

i'm<00:02:50.810> not<00:02:51.169> positive<00:02:51.650> though<00:02:52.389> the<00:02:53.389> reason<00:02:53.659> is

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
i'm not positive though the reason is

i'm not positive though the reason is
the<00:02:53.959> damage<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.439> 48<00:02:55.010> close<00:02:55.220> range<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:55.760> it

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
the damage is 48 close range and it

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.899 
the damage is 48 close range and it
drops<00:02:56.060> off<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.359> 25<00:02:56.959> at<00:02:57.290> long<00:02:57.680> range<00:02:58.069> let's<00:02:58.760> go

drops off the 25 at long range let's go

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.750 
drops off the 25 at long range let's go
