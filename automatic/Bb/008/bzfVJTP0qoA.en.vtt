 it's not easy to come play 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.790

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.599
 but we had everything to gain tonight and 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.059

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.760
 stephen brown the jsf nanterre came 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.260
 win at sportica in the match 1 2 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.500
 playoff quarter-finals 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.600
 the bcm falls so to enter at the end of a 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.070
 panting match where it took two 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.470
 extensions to see my ter 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.140
 to win 95 to 100 1 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.690
 the Marines were nevertheless warned 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.519
 he had already bowed to these same 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.119
 maintaining in the league there are some 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.100
 weeks and yet in the heart of the last 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.629
 quarter time everything was rolling for men 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.610
 of christian monchau since these two 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.530
 who were in front of 8 points 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.479
 but once technical later to 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.119
 against ludovic vaty the match 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.510
 was revived nanterre had come back to 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.799
 height 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.509
 both teams will leave more 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.130
 duel between two men during this 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.140
 progression must and bex on one side 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.409
 was responding to chris ware hate each other 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.079
 77 77 at the end of the fourth quarter time 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.479
 then 87 everywhere after the first 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.340
 extension the attention she was 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.619
 still climb a notch and that's 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.200
 unfortunately the bcm who cracked in 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.600
 first private members of his sector 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.130
 interior due to the olive injury in 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.890
 start of the match and the fifth time 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.899
 conjugate passage and palacios arrive 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.899
 still to overthrow the bcm at home 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.220
 the best way to get into these 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.990
 play-offs you have to stay positive 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.820
 optimistic knowing that we won at home 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.990
 in league 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.020
 I hope we will find art except 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.329
 in two days to reiterate to go 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.259
 win over there but mentally I hope 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.539
 that we are not too busy 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.439
 affected the maritime are now at 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.720
 foot of the wall 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.920
 a defeat at nanterre Wednesday night and 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.750
 their season is over 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.209
 a victory would allow them in 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.670
 revenge to find sportica friday 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.670
