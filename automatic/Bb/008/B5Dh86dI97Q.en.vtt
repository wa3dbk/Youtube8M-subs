I just want to tell you guys that DDoS

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
attacks are at a more higher right now

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.979 
attacks are at a more higher right now
because<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.000> fact<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.360> they're<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:33.840> easy

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
because of the fact that they're so easy

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.410 
because of the fact that they're so easy
to<00:00:34.110> get<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.320> hold<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.700> sign<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.390> for

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
to get a hold of you can sign up for

websites to offer the services whereas a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.180 
websites to offer the services whereas a
couple<00:00:40.140> years<00:00:40.260> ago<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.649> wasn't<00:00:40.860> as<00:00:41.040> popular

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
couple years ago it wasn't as popular

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.610 
couple years ago it wasn't as popular
because<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.879> had<00:00:41.969> download<00:00:42.480> all<00:00:43.170> kinds<00:00:43.559> of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
because you had download all kinds of

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.260 
because you had download all kinds of
things<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.090> lot<00:00:45.239> more

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
things to do it so it's a lot more

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.750 
things to do it so it's a lot more
easier<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.989> lot<00:00:46.200> more<00:00:46.379> vulnerable<00:00:46.950> now<00:00:47.100> to

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
easier a lot more vulnerable now to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.880 
easier a lot more vulnerable now to
these<00:00:47.910> DDoS<00:00:48.270> attacks<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.960> mean<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.620> getting

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
these DDoS attacks I mean it's getting

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.770 
these DDoS attacks I mean it's getting
to<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.039> point<00:00:50.129> where<00:00:50.430> people<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.239> grab<00:00:51.629> your

to the point where people can grab your

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020 
to the point where people can grab your
IP<00:00:52.250> just<00:00:53.250> from<00:00:53.370> having<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.789> skype<00:00:54.000> username

and once they have your IP they can kick

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.170 
and once they have your IP they can kick

Cory<00:01:06.060> explain<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.810> guys<00:01:06.990> what<00:01:07.560> VPNs<00:01:08.100> are

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
Cory explain to you guys what VPNs are

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.260 
Cory explain to you guys what VPNs are
ya<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.900> VPN<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.680> kind<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:11.700> when<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> visit

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
ya so VPN is kind of like when you visit

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.570 
ya so VPN is kind of like when you visit
Google<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:13.290> direct<00:01:13.650> IP<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.040> connecting<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
Google your direct IP is connecting to

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.999 
Google your direct IP is connecting to
google<00:01:14.729> what<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> VPN<00:01:15.960> does<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.500> route<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.979> your

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
google what a VPN does is route to your

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.609 
google what a VPN does is route to your
connection<00:01:17.580> through<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> server<00:01:18.780> which<00:01:19.380> then

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
connection through a server which then

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.710 
connection through a server which then
accesses<00:01:20.280> google<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.270> then<00:01:21.390> fetches

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
accesses google for you and then fetches

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.210 
accesses google for you and then fetches
it<00:01:21.840> back<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.320> um<00:01:23.150> this<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.299> very<00:01:24.540> nice<00:01:24.720> for

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
it back to you um this is very nice for

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.789 
it back to you um this is very nice for
things<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.340> hiding<00:01:27.210> your<00:01:27.420> IP<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.960> mainly

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
things like hiding your IP and mainly

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.160 
things like hiding your IP and mainly
DDoS<00:01:29.159> protection<00:01:29.250> because<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.420> server<00:01:30.869> may

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
DDoS protection because a server may

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.429 
DDoS protection because a server may

to throw the switch thing in there is

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.090 
to throw the switch thing in there is

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
them being able to but I mean it's easy

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.300 
them being able to but I mean it's easy
to<00:03:04.220> an<00:03:04.370> disable<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.480> VPN<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.200> live<00:03:06.830> stream<00:03:07.190> as

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
to an disable the VPN to live stream as

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.640 
to an disable the VPN to live stream as
it<00:03:07.430> is<00:03:07.550> to<00:03:07.760> enable<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.360> right<00:03:08.570> correct<00:03:09.260> it's

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
it is to enable it right correct it's

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.520 
it is to enable it right correct it's
actually<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.190> click<00:03:10.400> of<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.610> button<00:03:10.640> um<00:03:11.530> you

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
actually a click of a button um you

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.720 
actually a click of a button um you
should<00:03:12.590> be<00:03:12.830> able<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.040> live<00:03:13.190> stream<00:03:13.459> with<00:03:13.580> my

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
should be able to live stream with my

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.660 
should be able to live stream with my
VPNs<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.450> think<00:03:15.320> they<00:03:15.410> have<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.560> list<00:03:15.920> of<00:03:16.130> VPN<00:03:16.519> so

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
VPNs I think they have a list of VPN so

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.550 
VPNs I think they have a list of VPN so
they<00:03:16.820> block<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.930> I<00:03:17.959> mean<00:03:18.110> as<00:03:18.200> long<00:03:18.290> as<00:03:18.440> you're

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
they block so I mean as long as you're

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.410 
they block so I mean as long as you're
using<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:18.860> private<00:03:19.250> one<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:20.060> should<00:03:20.239> be<00:03:20.269> good

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
using a private one you should be good

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.340 
using a private one you should be good
to<00:03:20.480> go<00:03:20.570> okay<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:23.500> so<00:03:24.500> how<00:03:25.280> was<00:03:25.549> yours

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
to go okay and so how was yours

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.960 
to go okay and so how was yours
protected<00:03:27.350> from<00:03:27.560> DDoS<00:03:27.980> attacks<00:03:28.340> whereas<00:03:28.700> some

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
protected from DDoS attacks whereas some

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.690 
protected from DDoS attacks whereas some
VPNs<00:03:29.930> are<00:03:30.200> well<00:03:30.829> some<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.190> PN's<00:03:31.489> have<00:03:31.640> a

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
VPNs are well some of the PN's have a

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.340 
VPNs are well some of the PN's have a
direct<00:03:32.000> connection<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.780> internet<00:03:33.110> and

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
direct connection to the internet and

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.920 
direct connection to the internet and
then<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.950> idea<00:03:34.070> is<00:03:34.310> is<00:03:34.670> we<00:03:35.329> have<00:03:35.420> a<00:03:35.480> firewall

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
then the idea is is we have a firewall

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.690 
then the idea is is we have a firewall
and<00:03:36.170> this<00:03:36.380> firewall<00:03:36.769> says<00:03:36.980> hey<00:03:37.130> this<00:03:37.160> IP<00:03:37.549> is

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
and this firewall says hey this IP is

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.210 
and this firewall says hey this IP is
attacking<00:03:38.209> I'm<00:03:38.360> gonna<00:03:38.720> block<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.019> and<00:03:39.350> that's

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
attacking I'm gonna block it and that's

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.720 
attacking I'm gonna block it and that's
great<00:03:40.930> shorts<00:03:41.930> go<00:03:42.170> but<00:03:42.829> the<00:03:43.340> other<00:03:43.459> thing<00:03:43.670> is

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
great shorts go but the other thing is

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.150 
great shorts go but the other thing is
is<00:03:44.000> if<00:03:44.150> it's<00:03:44.870> kind<00:03:44.989> of<00:03:45.019> like<00:03:45.110> a<00:03:45.170> pipe<00:03:45.440> if<00:03:45.709> I<00:03:45.890> have

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
is if it's kind of like a pipe if I have

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.680 
is if it's kind of like a pipe if I have
a<00:03:46.459> ball<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:46.970> I'm<00:03:47.060> trying<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.390> stick<00:03:47.600> it

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
a ball and I'm trying to stick it

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.060 
a ball and I'm trying to stick it
through<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.840> pipe<00:03:48.079> that's<00:03:48.320> smaller<00:03:48.620> that<00:03:48.890> ball

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
through a pipe that's smaller that ball

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.740 
through a pipe that's smaller that ball
is<00:03:49.160> not<00:03:49.280> going<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.489> go<00:03:49.549> through<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.060> that's

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
is not going to go through and that's

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.270 
is not going to go through and that's
where<00:03:50.989> D<00:03:51.140> das<00:03:51.290> basically<00:03:51.680> comes<00:03:51.860> from<00:03:52.070> your

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
where D das basically comes from your

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.620 
where D das basically comes from your
filling<00:03:52.670> up<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.880> connection<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.299> the<00:03:53.420> point

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
filling up the connection to the point

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.440 
filling up the connection to the point
where<00:03:53.750> it<00:03:53.840> can't<00:03:54.049> work<00:03:54.340> so<00:03:55.340> how<00:03:56.000> we<00:03:56.060> prevent

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
where it can't work so how we prevent

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.720 
where it can't work so how we prevent
against<00:03:56.630> this<00:03:56.780> is<00:03:56.930> we<00:03:57.079> have<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.200> bigger<00:03:57.730> pipe

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
against this is we have a bigger pipe

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.090 
against this is we have a bigger pipe
you<00:03:59.120> know<00:03:59.239> we<00:03:59.480> we<00:03:59.959> have<00:04:00.079> such<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.560> huge<00:04:00.890> pipe

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
you know we we have such a huge pipe

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.530 
you know we we have such a huge pipe
right<00:04:01.340> now<00:04:01.459> that<00:04:02.090> you'd<00:04:02.180> have<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.360> get

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
right now that you'd have to get

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.420 
right now that you'd have to get
attacked<00:04:02.780> by<00:04:03.019> several<00:04:03.280> different<00:04:04.280> deed

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
attacked by several different deed

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.090 
attacked by several different deed
officers<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:05.030> even<00:04:05.299> be<00:04:05.720> able<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:05.900> hinder<00:04:06.860> the

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
officers to even be able to hinder the

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.940 
officers to even be able to hinder the
connection<00:04:07.489> in<00:04:07.579> any<00:04:07.760> manner<00:04:07.970> so<00:04:08.840> basically<00:04:09.230> we

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
connection in any manner so basically we

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.170 
connection in any manner so basically we
just<00:04:09.980> made<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.310> pipe<00:04:10.519> that's<00:04:10.730> bigger<00:04:10.910> than<00:04:11.000> the

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
just made a pipe that's bigger than the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.120 
just made a pipe that's bigger than the
ball<00:04:11.359> so<00:04:11.989> we<00:04:12.140> can<00:04:12.260> accept<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.739> ball<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:13.100> just

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
ball so we can accept the ball and just

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.530 
ball so we can accept the ball and just
say<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.459> know<00:04:13.730> that's<00:04:14.060> not<00:04:14.150> good<00:04:14.359> traffic

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
say you know that's not good traffic

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.479 
say you know that's not good traffic
we're<00:04:14.840> gonna<00:04:14.930> block<00:04:15.140> it<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:15.530> think<00:04:16.280> at<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.430> end

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
we're gonna block it I think at the end

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.460 
we're gonna block it I think at the end
of<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:16.700> day<00:04:16.820> that's<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.090> only<00:04:17.150> real<00:04:17.630> DDoS

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
of the day that's the only real DDoS

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.140 
of the day that's the only real DDoS
mitigation<00:04:18.530> unless<00:04:19.430> you're<00:04:19.579> talking<00:04:19.760> about

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
mitigation unless you're talking about

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.659 
mitigation unless you're talking about
that<00:04:20.359> of<00:04:20.539> like<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:20.979> jinx<00:04:21.979> which<00:04:22.160> is<00:04:22.340> basically

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
that of like and jinx which is basically

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.940 
that of like and jinx which is basically
taking<00:04:23.060> multiple<00:04:23.510> ip's<00:04:23.840> and<00:04:24.050> then<00:04:24.620> routing

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
taking multiple ip's and then routing

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.629 
taking multiple ip's and then routing
them<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.250> one

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
them to one

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.249 
them to one
which<00:04:26.150> basically<00:04:26.360> doing<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.870> same<00:04:26.960> thing

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 
which basically doing the same thing

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.029 
which basically doing the same thing
that<00:04:27.379> we<00:04:27.499> did<00:04:27.650> only<00:04:28.009> on<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.400> larger<00:04:28.789> scale<00:04:30.039> okay

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
that we did only on a larger scale okay

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.059 
that we did only on a larger scale okay
and<00:04:31.280> what<00:04:32.060> are<00:04:32.180> some<00:04:32.210> of<00:04:32.389> the<00:04:32.479> prices<00:04:32.659> for<00:04:33.169> your

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069 
and what are some of the prices for your

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:37.029 
and what are some of the prices for your
guys's<00:04:34.430> vpm<00:04:35.270> um<00:04:35.599> actually<00:04:36.289> we<00:04:36.529> started<00:04:36.830> out<00:04:36.919> at

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
guys's vpm um actually we started out at

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.610 
guys's vpm um actually we started out at
three<00:04:37.249> dollars<00:04:37.580> a<00:04:37.610> month<00:04:37.729> and<00:04:38.150> then<00:04:39.110> for<00:04:39.469> the

three months that is like seven dollars

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.860 
three months that is like seven dollars
and<00:04:42.219> we<00:04:43.219> have<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.370> lifetime<00:04:43.639> option<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:44.479> remind

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
obviously you have a shared IP and stuff

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.050 
obviously you have a shared IP and stuff
like<00:04:54.169> that<00:04:54.229> but<00:04:54.620> at<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.639> end<00:04:55.669> of<00:04:55.789> the<00:04:55.909> day

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
like that but at the end of the day

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.230 
like that but at the end of the day
having<00:04:56.419> a<00:04:56.479> shared<00:04:56.629> IP<00:04:57.819> doesn't<00:04:58.819> hinder<00:04:59.000> your

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
having a shared IP doesn't hinder your

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.969 
having a shared IP doesn't hinder your
performance<00:04:59.840> in<00:04:59.960> any<00:05:00.080> manner<00:05:00.349> and<00:05:00.680> if<00:05:00.860> the

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
performance in any manner and if the

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.980 
performance in any manner and if the
deed<00:05:01.159> if<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.759> IP<00:05:01.909> keeps<00:05:02.330> lying<00:05:02.449> in<00:05:02.599> the<00:05:02.810> dust

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
deed if the IP keeps lying in the dust

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.749 
deed if the IP keeps lying in the dust
and<00:05:03.259> it<00:05:03.409> we<00:05:03.620> find<00:05:03.800> that<00:05:03.860> slowing<00:05:04.310> down<00:05:04.550> the

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
and it we find that slowing down the

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:05.950 
and it we find that slowing down the
connection<00:05:05.150> not<00:05:05.300> interrupting<00:05:05.900> the

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
connection not interrupting the

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.929 
connection not interrupting the
connection<00:05:06.349> but<00:05:06.500> slowing<00:05:06.770> it<00:05:06.949> down<00:05:06.979> we<00:05:07.759> will

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:07.939 
connection but slowing it down we will

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:13.149 
connection but slowing it down we will
assign<00:05:08.210> you<00:05:08.270> a<00:05:08.419> dedicated<00:05:08.900> IP<00:05:10.870> okay<00:05:12.159> so

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
assign you a dedicated IP okay so

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:16.929 
assign you a dedicated IP okay so
