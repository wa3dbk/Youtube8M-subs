the<00:02:37.550> way<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.239> done<00:02:38.660> whilst<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.739> tank<00:02:40.010> is

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
the way this is done whilst the tank is

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.309 
the way this is done whilst the tank is
being<00:02:40.459> made<00:02:40.760> whilst<00:02:41.300> it's<00:02:41.510> still<00:02:41.600> just<00:02:42.110> a

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
being made whilst it's still just a

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.060 
being made whilst it's still just a
shell<00:02:43.330> flipped<00:02:44.330> over<00:02:44.570> it's<00:02:45.410> filled<00:02:45.800> with

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
shell flipped over it's filled with

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.880 
shell flipped over it's filled with
molten<00:02:46.310> lead<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.660> lead<00:02:47.840> hardened<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:48.680> now<00:02:48.830> you

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
molten lead the lead hardened so now you

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.880 
molten lead the lead hardened so now you
have<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.100> tank<00:02:49.430> full<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.970> solid<00:02:50.959> lead<00:02:51.440> but<00:02:51.709> let

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
have a tank full of solid lead but let

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.970 
have a tank full of solid lead but let
is<00:02:52.040> soft<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:53.150> then<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.810> can<00:02:54.019> chisel<00:02:54.380> into<00:02:54.860> the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
is soft so then you can chisel into the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.390 
is soft so then you can chisel into the
steel<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:56.180> depresses<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.080> lead<00:02:57.319> but<00:02:58.310> it

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
steel and it depresses the lead but it

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.070 
steel and it depresses the lead but it
doesn't<00:02:58.700> allow<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:58.910> tank<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.480> collapse<00:02:59.810> if

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
doesn't allow the tank to collapse if

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.900 
doesn't allow the tank to collapse if
you<00:03:00.170> just<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.709> know<00:03:00.739> hit<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.040> normal<00:03:01.459> gas<00:03:01.610> tank

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
you just you know hit a normal gas tank

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.370 
you just you know hit a normal gas tank
with<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.090> chisel<00:03:02.480> you'd<00:03:02.900> obviously<00:03:03.050> put<00:03:03.350> a

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
with a chisel you'd obviously put a

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.590 
with a chisel you'd obviously put a
great<00:03:03.590> big<00:03:03.620> ding<00:03:03.980> in<00:03:04.100> it<00:03:04.220> but<00:03:04.730> with<00:03:04.880> this<00:03:05.030> the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
great big ding in it but with this the

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.680 
great big ding in it but with this the
lead<00:03:06.170> backing<00:03:06.769> it<00:03:07.010> allows<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.150> hammer<00:03:08.450> in

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
lead backing it allows you to hammer in

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.130 
lead backing it allows you to hammer in
all<00:03:08.900> these<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:10.340> lines<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:11.150> then<00:03:11.630> planishing

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
all these the lines and then planishing

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.979 
all these the lines and then planishing
