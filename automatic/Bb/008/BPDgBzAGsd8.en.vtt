back here I'm probably should've balance
it<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.860> more<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.130> do<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
it here but the more you do it the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.149 
it here but the more you do it the
better<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.210> get<00:01:39.360> at<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.020> Aryans<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.950> I

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
think it's just if certain backs to just

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.460 
think it's just if certain backs to just
know<00:01:44.310> how<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.930> know<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.110> he's

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.510 
step into the system and be perfect from
day<00:07:14.450> one<00:07:14.660> and<00:07:14.990> a<00:07:15.380> hands-on<00:07:15.890> perfect<00:07:16.310> no<00:07:16.370> one's

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 
day one and a hands-on perfect no one's

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.980 
day one and a hands-on perfect no one's
going<00:07:16.640> to<00:07:16.670> be<00:07:16.820> make<00:07:17.150> the<00:07:17.270> perfect<00:07:17.450> cut<00:07:17.780> every

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 
going to be make the perfect cut every

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.870 
going to be make the perfect cut every
time<00:07:18.200> but<00:07:18.470> I<00:07:18.680> think<00:07:19.100> the<00:07:19.190> experience<00:07:19.400> allows

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:19.880 
time but I think the experience allows

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.030 
time but I think the experience allows
him<00:07:20.180> to<00:07:20.210> to<00:07:20.930> have<00:07:21.110> those<00:07:21.290> big<00:07:21.440> runs<00:07:21.710> and<00:07:21.920> see

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.040 
him to to have those big runs and see

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.530 
him to to have those big runs and see
those<00:07:22.160> cutbacks<00:07:22.460> and<00:07:22.820> Ben's<00:07:23.180> going<00:07:23.330> to<00:07:23.420> get

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:23.540 
those cutbacks and Ben's going to get

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.030 
those cutbacks and Ben's going to get
there<00:07:23.690> and<00:07:23.810> that's<00:07:24.080> I<00:07:24.320> don't<00:07:24.560> think<00:07:24.860> there's<00:07:24.980> a

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:25.040 
there and that's I don't think there's a

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.230 
there and that's I don't think there's a
doubt<00:07:25.190> about<00:07:25.310> that<00:07:25.550> but<00:07:25.610> Ben's<00:07:25.880> going<00:07:26.030> to<00:07:26.120> get

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 
doubt about that but Ben's going to get

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.970 
doubt about that but Ben's going to get
there<00:07:26.420> but<00:07:26.900> the<00:07:27.110> air<00:07:27.320> and<00:07:27.440> suspend<00:07:27.560> the<00:07:27.800> player
