00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
get some flyby shots here later this

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.520 
get some flyby shots here later this
week<00:01:59.570> that's<00:02:00.570> just<00:02:00.750> an<00:02:00.840> idea<00:02:00.930> what<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.290> sounds

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
week that's just an idea what it sounds

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.020 
week that's just an idea what it sounds
like<00:02:01.590> does<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.370> sound<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
like does not have the sound the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.830 
like does not have the sound the
restrictor<00:02:03.480> up<00:02:03.720> in<00:02:04.640> there<00:02:05.640> or<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.510> lower

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
restrictor up in there or the to lower

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.480 
restrictor up in there or the to lower
the<00:02:06.990> decibel<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.530> that's<00:02:07.710> at<00:02:07.860> full<00:02:08.340> power

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
the decibel so that's at full power

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.970 
the decibel so that's at full power
right<00:02:08.610> there
