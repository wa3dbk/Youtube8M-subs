00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.320
 hello friends with you fox and today 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.779
 we'll talk about one of the two 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.390
 owners horribly located 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.939
 ammunition among medium tanks 8 levla 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.739
 about soviet t-44 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.110
 its direct competitors 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.550
 explosiveness is english 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.800
 centurion mark 1 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.040
 but it's not time to drink tea today 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.409
 talk about predecessors t-54 which 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.839
 probably every tanker dreams to mow 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.930
 in order to carry the high level 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.449
 randomly if we describe our today's 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.300
 hero in a few words then we have 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.670
 Something like this is fast and very 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.820
 maneuverable tank most comfortable for 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.399
 melee weapons which is different 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.190
 relatively small in size and very 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.520
 an unsuccessfully located ammunition if 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.560
 not the last one, but I would call it boldly 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.720
 so4 with the best medium tank on 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.509
 its level but since fact is fact 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.330
 undermine well or at least knock out bkt 40 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.700
 fours are very simple I know everything 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.460
 equal will be called so4 the best among 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.590
 competitors but not so boldly the whole thing 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.750
 in that most in medium tanks 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.240
 I appreciate the opportunity to go after all and 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.189
 sense of freedom and most of all in these 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.270
 indicators are presented by dynamics and 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.460
 gun comfort 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.740
 and we must not forget about the size 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.990
 cars naturally if you talk about 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.579
 competitors then the centurion possesses 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.310
 monstrous me for a medium tank 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.649
 dimensions of a very weak casing and 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.450
 rather weak mobility second 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.909
 the panther has none 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.610
 size but the dynamics she suffers 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.530
 worse than ever though the maximum speed is good but 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.810
 development is an impossible task for 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.770
 engine with a power density of just 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.439
 13 horses 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.350
 well ok thrash in ordinary claims 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.390
 a lot of patience is not even particularly necessary 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.649
 turn it off check and then in the battles and you 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.929
 and do not often meet 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.510
 and here our hero has a specific 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.220
 power of 20 horses per ton high 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.440
 rate of potential damage per minute 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.170
 almost nineteen enemy sau 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.989
 cents per minute and a height of only 2 meters 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.660
 41 centimeters if anyone is interested in 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.370
 so creative on it and just 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.500
 it is a pleasure to have fun 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.840
 Unfortunately, it is necessary to do this 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.640
 very neat because crazy 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.980
 projectile can knock all the same 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.610
 ill-fated bomber in the front 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.250
 starboard or gas tank which is also 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.799
 sometimes even in the center 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.129
 frontal projection of the case conclusion one 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.829
 never put starboard on 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.849
 t-44 as on all tanks without a turnout 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.040
 frontal armor 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.590
 advantageous to substitute armor a little 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.959
 diamond so always wrap 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.069
 right to let the enemy shoot at 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.170
 port side 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.810
 even though we are a driver but 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.730
 losing him is not so bad though 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.910
 loss of dynamics without first aid kit will transform 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.310
 t-44 in a pumpkin but which still can 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.709
 resist as they say take care 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.489
 young derek's ammo as it was 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.250
 Yushka I remember 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.680
 the second minus is rather weak 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.260
 canopy inclination angle of just 5 degrees 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.540
 so play hunters are pretty 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.450
 difficult task without sticking out 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.299
 vulnerable corps on this with negative 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.549
 probably all sides of the tank 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.190
 there are those who say they say Hoops 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.060
 it would not break through 175 millimeters 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.639
 eighth level 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.919
 to which there is only one answer a 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:45.109
 which tank is the sixth to tenth level 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:47.389
 inclusive so much breakdown not 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.910
 enough for board shots or aft 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.919
 well, except that excluding the mouse in the forehead 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.810
 shoot with heavily armored 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:56.359
 opponents betray him yet 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.519
 slow and slow but good 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.889
 dynamics of our hero allows without 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.560
 problems go flank or carousel 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:06.319
 vrazhin and the remaining indicators of the instrument well 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.459
 just a fairy tale here and good accuracy 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.940
 035 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.069
 connected to soviet alpha damage 280 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.500
 units which allows not only 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.840
 it hurts to bite opponents in the maneuver 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.389
 collisions but also play from 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.690
 shelters waiting out a little big 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.000
 recharge 8 seconds mixing of course 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.789
 very comfortable and makes up like everyone else 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.070
 two to three seconds but the stabilization of the gun from 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.110
 rotation of the hull or tower is not the 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.630
 the best and therefore adepts 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.260
 the orders of the Soviet warder rejoice 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.990
 when it is necessary to shoot 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.020
 no turning distance as for 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.020
 mobility then I repeat it completely 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.690
 does not interfere with giving free rein to your desires 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.460
 regarding the choice of attack direction 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.560
 maximum speed of 51 kilometers per hour and 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.920
 power density of 20 horses per ton 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.460
 make the t-44 the most mobile tanks on 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.920
 level 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.590
 and a great turning all seven 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.630
 degrees per second hull and 48a towers 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.730
 allow not only not to lose speed 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.520
 cornering but twist confidently 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.920
 enemy heavy tanks are not dynamic 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.410
 light tanks of course but they are not there yet 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.330
 level eight in our game and unknown 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.120
 they will appear in the blitz soon 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.350
 or not, well , a couple of words literally 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.690
 about armor 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.060
 the thickness of the armor in the forehead is 90 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.880
 millimeters and given the gorgeous angle 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.330
 of inclination of 60 degrees and cast to 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.610
 equal to 180 for the top and 127 for the bottom. 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.280
 frontal parts can still be noted 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.530
 frontal reservation of the tower on which 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.890
 You can try to dance but of course 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.630
 same not 10 la la la and someone simpler 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.660
 sixes or sevens well steel armor 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.700
 that is, the board and feed cardboard is still a 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.120
 so use the dynamics 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.250
 or try not to stick out at all 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.500
 the whole tank produced a very positive 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.290
 impression not only because he 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.780
 the most fun or creative but also 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.750
 because TSN 4 is no longer 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.210
 modification and the legendary t-34 a 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.900
 so this is a completely new type 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.120
 average tank in this thread test 4 can 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.160
 quite called transition because he 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:19.110
 connects two legendary 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:22.310
 T-34 tank with its modifications and T-54 with 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.570
 its further development see in t-62a 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.180
 advise to pump the Soviet branch 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.830
 medium tanks are absolutely commonplace 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.130
 here and I agree 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.010
 almost all tanks, except maybe t-43 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.810
 have a lot of potential 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:39.630
 which is relatively easy to open 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.850
 and therefore my advice is definitely not 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.670
 forget to like if you 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.150
 liked my review and also share 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.610
 im with my friends 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.500
 well and with you as always was fuse to all 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.190
 see you soon subscribe to my
