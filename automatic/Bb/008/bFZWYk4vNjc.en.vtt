00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
galaxy tab and the docking station with

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.320 
galaxy tab and the docking station with
keyboard<00:00:07.790> just<00:00:08.790> going<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:08.970> give<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.150> quick

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
keyboard just going to give a quick

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.360 
keyboard just going to give a quick
rundown<00:00:09.660> really<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.170> what<00:00:10.469> it's<00:00:10.740> like<00:00:10.920> and

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
rundown really of what it's like and

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.740 
rundown really of what it's like and
what<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.240> comes<00:00:12.480> with<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.750> pretty

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
what it comes with so this is pretty

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.790 
what it comes with so this is pretty
much<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.080> really<00:00:16.170> mean<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.440> don't<00:00:16.590> really<00:00:16.680> get

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
much it really mean you don't really get

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.750 
much it really mean you don't really get
any<00:00:16.980> connectors<00:00:17.369> or<00:00:17.400> anything<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:17.699> don't

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
any connectors or anything so don't

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.300 
any connectors or anything so don't
expect<00:00:17.970> another<00:00:18.300> another<00:00:18.960> cable<00:00:19.289> whether<00:00:20.189> it

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
expect another another cable whether it

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.269 
expect another another cable whether it
essentially<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:22.279> Emmanuel

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
essentially just it's this and Emmanuel

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.750 
essentially just it's this and Emmanuel
so<00:00:24.240> what<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.720> actually<00:00:24.869> get<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.760> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
so what you actually get on this is a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.240 
so what you actually get on this is a
line<00:00:27.420> out<00:00:27.570> for<00:00:27.750> your<00:00:27.840> audio<00:00:28.050> which<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.650> 3.5

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
line out for your audio which is 3.5

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.890 
line out for your audio which is 3.5
millimeter<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.390> can<00:00:30.570> either<00:00:30.630> put<00:00:30.810> your

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
millimeter so you can either put your

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.370 
millimeter so you can either put your
headphones<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.349> or<00:00:31.560> your<00:00:32.279> external<00:00:32.579> speakers

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
headphones in or your external speakers

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.650 
headphones in or your external speakers
in<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.440> side<00:00:34.710> we've<00:00:35.130> got<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.660> docking

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
in the side we've got the docking

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.740 
in the side we've got the docking
connector<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.440> your<00:00:38.399> usual<00:00:38.579> 30<00:00:39.540> pin<00:00:39.719> connector

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
connector so your usual 30 pin connector

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.139 
connector so your usual 30 pin connector
that<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.559> use<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.430> charge<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.910> bottom<00:00:42.090> of

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
that you use to charge the bottom of

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.209 
that you use to charge the bottom of
year<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:43.290> your<00:00:43.410> tablets<00:00:43.770> are<00:00:43.860> seen<00:00:44.010> when<00:00:44.100> you

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
year of your tablets are seen when you

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.130 
year of your tablets are seen when you
use<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:45.149> whack<00:00:45.360> into<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> side<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.930> it

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
use to just whack into the side of it

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.260 
use to just whack into the side of it
and<00:00:46.550> that's<00:00:47.550> when<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.879> know<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.120> something

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
and that's when you know is something

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.700 
and that's when you know is something
that's<00:00:48.420> quite<00:00:48.660> weird<00:00:48.899> while<00:00:49.350> I'm<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.530> there

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
that's quite weird while I'm on there

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.500 
that's quite weird while I'm on there
the<00:00:50.460> charging<00:00:50.789> cable<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.030> get<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> guys<00:00:51.360> that

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the charging cable you get the guys that

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.840 
the charging cable you get the guys that
isn't<00:00:51.989> actually<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.260> long<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.980> really

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
isn't actually that long so really

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.670 
isn't actually that long so really
you're<00:00:53.969> going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.750> look<00:00:54.989> at<00:00:55.170> charging

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
want to put it say like where it is here

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.459

the F function keys and we've now got

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.740 
the F function keys and we've now got
things<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.369> lock<00:01:29.759> your<00:01:29.939> screen<00:01:30.030> digital

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
things like lock your screen digital

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.039 
things like lock your screen digital
frame<00:01:31.670> your<00:01:32.670> menu<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.000> home<00:01:33.210> internet<00:01:33.720> buttons

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
frame your menu in home internet buttons

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.980 
frame your menu in home internet buttons
things<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.970> down<00:01:35.970> here<00:01:36.270> you've

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
things like that and down here you've

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.010 
things like that and down here you've
even<00:01:37.079> got<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> voice<00:01:38.100> action<00:01:38.490> key<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.020> settings

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
even got a voice action key and settings

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.899 
even got a voice action key and settings
so<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.680> makes<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.100> little<00:01:41.310> quicker<00:01:41.490> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
so it just makes it a little quicker and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.889 
so it just makes it a little quicker and
then<00:01:42.630> going<00:01:42.899> into<00:01:43.110> actually<00:01:43.710> touching<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
then going into actually touching the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.120 
then going into actually touching the
these<00:01:45.899> buns<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.680> instead<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.920> going<00:01:47.009> for

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
these buns here so instead of going for

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.310 
these buns here so instead of going for
their<00:01:47.659> makes<00:01:48.659> off<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> little<00:01:48.990> bit<00:01:49.140> easier
