00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:08.740
 hi with you la can and i am a makeup artist 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.990
 Anastasia Pasha on previous video our 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.120
 stylist Ksenia Zhukova told about 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.750
 how to dress up on a romantic 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.940
 date 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.350
 and today I will tell you how to make 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.810
 suitable makeup 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:25.240
 to this occasion in a romantic makeup I 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.960
 I propose to focus on radiant 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.920
 fresh face skin and highlight eyes so 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.340
 like a date 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.790
 eye contact is especially important and so I 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.730
 I'm starting our romantic makeup 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.399
 putting a light shining tone well 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.010
 I spread it across my face with a brush to 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.920
 the skin of the face was smooth you can 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.320
 use sponge or can cause 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.000
 tonal means hands to 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.000
 make a light blush i take advantage 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.489
 cream blush so they will be on 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.329
 cheeks look more natural 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.000
 apply them evenly beating fingers 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.920
 so that there are no boundaries in order 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.650
 to remove the shadows under the eyes i 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.400
 would use cream concealer wanted 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.310
 should be half a tone lighter than yours 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.930
 skin tone i use brush 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.670
 but also concealer is very convenient to apply 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.070
 the pad of the finger to follow the main 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.130
 uniformity of application to never 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.140
 traces and boundaries also remained 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.680
 concealer you can hide redness 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.290
 on the skin 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:37.740
 usually additional coverage is required 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:41.250
 places near the wings of the nose on the nose and 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.830
 lip contour 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.050
 for fresh and glowing skin i love 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.570
 use a highlighter I usually nanoshu 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.240
 him in places closer to the temples also 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.479
 finger patting 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.560
 motions usually highlighter does not give 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.350
 no shade 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.200
 it just reflects the light that adds 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.619
 extra shine on a romantic 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.009
 dating is especially important and eyes 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.200
 so I will pay them special attention in 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.190
 this makeup 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.100
 I draw a gel eyeliner 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.670
 ciliary contour 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.370
 it will make your eyes bigger and your eyelashes 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.530
 thicker than your ciliary contour 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.690
 can end right outside 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.720
 corner of the eye or make a small 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.020
 arrow do not forget to draw 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.970
 a good and inner corner of the eye for 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.180
 eye makeup I chose natural 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.030
 beige shades take the lightest 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.110
 shade and brush it all over 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.160
 moving century 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.739
 take a shade a little darker and 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.120
 add it to the crease of the eye it will do 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:55.430
 your eyes even more also i will add 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.739
 ciliary contour and lower lashes 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.030
 literally small dots it will add 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.340
 density of your eyelashes 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.010
 a bit of light brown shadows on 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.060
 lower eyelid to open even more 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.090
 look for even more expressiveness 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.160
 your eyes must curl eyelashes 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.620
 paint them beautifully 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.450
 eyelashes from root to tip so 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.610
 your eyelashes will score to the top yet 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.329
 stronger also will not be superfluous if you 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.090
 add 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.860
 several beams in the outer corners of the eyes 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.380
 instead of bundles, you can also 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.640
 use false eyelashes just them 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.860
 few undercuts from the outer edge 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.349
 So in the tomb, remember that our 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.140
 makeup should be as much as possible 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.079
 naturally therefore it will be quite 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.790
 quite a bit 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.340
 adjust the form and fill 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.069
 gaps those areas in which not 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.689
 hair grows 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.239
 determine the highest point 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:58.609
 your eyebrows will be the darkest place 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:03.810
 and then work on simplicity 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:07.620
 pencil shade with a brush bro and 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.560
 ready so lips are important here when 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.470
 achieve maximum stability of the color 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.389
 effect is almost not made up for 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.030
 persistence of lip color i will use 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:21.060
 first I fill the pencil 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.750
 lip surface do not be afraid to speak 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.360
 a pencil 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.729
 for lip contour for romantic 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.310
 bye i prefer lipstick 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.139
 neutral shades of course if you 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.820
 brave enough and 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.849
 or sure you can use 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.310
 maroon red lipstick even lipstick 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:41.570
 blueberry shade i prefer 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.430
 use powder only on the t-zone 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.169
 a small amount of 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.500
 Tassel or puff romantic 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.580
 bows easy and make using curling 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.639
 pre-divide hair into two 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.800
 the parts on the middle part and the covenant one 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.620
 part of the head in one direction and the other 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.760
 part of the opposite so you 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.360
 achieve effect 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.080
 light flowing curls romantic 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.940
