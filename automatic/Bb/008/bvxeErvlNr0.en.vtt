00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
last week or so and the thing is I'm

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.419 
last week or so and the thing is I'm
finding<00:00:28.349> interesting<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.160> there's<00:00:29.340> a

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
finding interesting is that there's a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.429 
finding interesting is that there's a
number<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.880> contradicting<00:00:30.689> points<00:00:31.080> out<00:00:31.199> there

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
number of contradicting points out there

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.080 
number of contradicting points out there
and<00:00:31.710> there's<00:00:31.949> been<00:00:32.130> articles<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.880> come

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
and there's been articles that have come

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.080 
and there's been articles that have come
out<00:00:33.210> again<00:00:33.450> recently<00:00:34.430> pushing<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.579> idea

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
out again recently pushing this idea

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.250 
out again recently pushing this idea
that<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:37.020> leaner<00:00:37.860> person<00:00:38.510> someone<00:00:39.510> who<00:00:39.570> say<00:00:39.899> 10%

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
that a leaner person someone who say 10%

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.860 
that a leaner person someone who say 10%
or<00:00:40.649> lower<00:00:40.800> body<00:00:41.100> fat<00:00:41.340> or<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> 10%<00:00:42.210> body<00:00:42.360> fat<00:00:42.510> is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
or lower body fat or a 10% body fat is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.650 
or lower body fat or a 10% body fat is
going<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.320> gain<00:00:43.670> muscle<00:00:44.670> easier<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.360> higher

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
going to gain muscle easier a higher

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.209 
going to gain muscle easier a higher
percentage<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.230> muscle<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.680> fat<00:00:46.710> versus

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
percentage of muscle to fat versus

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.069 
percentage of muscle to fat versus
someone<00:00:47.520> carrying<00:00:47.850> some<00:00:48.090> extra<00:00:48.180> body<00:00:48.660> fat<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
someone carrying some extra body fat and

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.330 
someone carrying some extra body fat and
this<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> type<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> thing<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.010> looks

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
this is the type of thing that looks

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.340 
this is the type of thing that looks
good<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.730> paper<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.570> people<00:00:54.840> will<00:00:54.989> say<00:00:55.199> well

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
good on paper and people will say well

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.479 
good on paper and people will say well
it<00:00:55.440> has<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:55.860> nutrient<00:00:56.370> partitioning

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it has to do with nutrient partitioning

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.840 
it has to do with nutrient partitioning
because<00:00:57.829> insulin<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.129> blood<00:00:59.160> sugar<00:00:59.550> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
because insulin and blood sugar and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.150 
because insulin and blood sugar and
other<00:01:00.180> things<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.539> are<00:01:00.660> used<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.710> store

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
other things that are used to store

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.130 
other things that are used to store
nutrients<00:01:02.879> are<00:01:03.300> going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
nutrients are going to go just to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.960 
nutrients are going to go just to
wherever<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.830> available<00:01:05.640> as<00:01:05.700> far<00:01:05.909> as

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
wherever is available as far as

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.870 
wherever is available as far as
sensitivity<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.049> receptor<00:01:07.470> sites<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
sensitivity and receptor sites and the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.760 
sensitivity and receptor sites and the
more<00:01:09.119> fat<00:01:09.479> versus<00:01:09.900> muscle<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.560> more

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
more fat versus muscle you have the more

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.500 
more fat versus muscle you have the more
fat<00:01:11.159> that's<00:01:11.340> available<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.150> go<00:01:12.299> into

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
fat that's available for it to go into

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.660 
fat that's available for it to go into
well<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> problem<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.070> many<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.580> these

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
well the problem is that many of these

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.660 
well the problem is that many of these
same<00:01:14.909> individuals<00:01:15.119> who<00:01:15.750> are<00:01:15.840> saying<00:01:16.170> this

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
same individuals who are saying this

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.539 
same individuals who are saying this
also<00:01:17.670> agree<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.500> human<00:01:20.040> body<00:01:20.220> doesn't

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
also agree that the human body doesn't

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.320 
also agree that the human body doesn't
store<00:01:22.130> glucose<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:23.369> fat<00:01:23.790> under<00:01:24.119> normal

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
store glucose as fat under normal

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.060 
store glucose as fat under normal
conditions<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.080> your<00:01:25.229> fat<00:01:25.439> cells<00:01:25.740> are<00:01:25.890> not

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
conditions so your fat cells are not

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.539 
conditions so your fat cells are not
getting<00:01:26.520> Lucas<00:01:27.140> being<00:01:28.140> stored<00:01:28.799> through

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
getting Lucas being stored through

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.580 
getting Lucas being stored through
insulin<00:01:30.090> into<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.360> fat<00:01:30.600> cell<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.229> their

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
insulin into the fat cell so their

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.630 
insulin into the fat cell so their
problem<00:01:31.920> with<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> nutrient<00:01:32.520> partitioning

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
problem with the nutrient partitioning

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.910 
problem with the nutrient partitioning
and<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.479> insulin<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.049> glucose<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.560> already

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and the insulin and glucose is already

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.350 
and the insulin and glucose is already
flawed<00:01:35.250> because<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.790> know<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:35.939> doesn't

so<00:02:03.030> we'll<00:02:03.360> put<00:02:03.509> Aries<00:02:03.869> here<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.090> issue<00:02:06.680> is

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
so we'll put Aries here and the issue is

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.979 
so we'll put Aries here and the issue is
that<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.069> doesn't<00:02:08.250> happen<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.959> other

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
that that doesn't happen and the other

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.559 
that that doesn't happen and the other
problem<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.160> if<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:12.300> look

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
problem with it is is that if you look

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.890 
problem with it is is that if you look

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
their fat free mass index came back 27

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.009

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
well over 20% body fat so this idea that

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.009 
well over 20% body fat so this idea that
being<00:03:33.739> fatter<00:03:34.739> will<00:03:35.160> inhibit<00:03:35.780> muscle<00:03:36.780> gains

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
being fatter will inhibit muscle gains

this hypothesis doesn't pan out and I

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.879

gains<00:05:16.919> because<00:05:17.760> of<00:05:17.880> these<00:05:18.000> reasons<00:05:18.180> but<00:05:18.449> the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
gains because of these reasons but the

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.540 
gains because of these reasons but the
reality<00:05:19.080> is<00:05:19.199> people<00:05:19.229> who<00:05:19.620> hold<00:05:19.800> more<00:05:20.130> body<00:05:20.430> fat

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
reality is people who hold more body fat

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.580 
reality is people who hold more body fat
because<00:05:21.120> they<00:05:21.240> don't<00:05:21.449> ever<00:05:21.660> die<00:05:21.960> it<00:05:22.020> down<00:05:22.320> and

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
because they don't ever die it down and

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.830 
because they don't ever die it down and
there<00:05:22.979> is<00:05:23.130> a<00:05:23.160> massive<00:05:23.610> anabolic<00:05:24.360> effect<00:05:24.690> of

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
there is a massive anabolic effect of

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.040 
there is a massive anabolic effect of
food<00:05:25.110> and<00:05:25.380> a<00:05:25.530> clerk<00:05:26.160> surplus<00:05:26.720> that<00:05:27.720> I<00:05:27.750> would

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
food and a clerk surplus that I would

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.930 
food and a clerk surplus that I would
say<00:05:28.260> is<00:05:28.500> comparable<00:05:29.100> to<00:05:29.250> a<00:05:29.400> low<00:05:29.639> dose<00:05:29.820> of

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
say is comparable to a low dose of

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.620 
say is comparable to a low dose of
anabolic<00:05:30.300> drugs<00:05:32.030> at<00:05:33.030> least<00:05:33.330> in<00:05:33.479> my<00:05:33.599> own

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
anabolic drugs at least in my own

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.770 
anabolic drugs at least in my own
experience<00:05:34.289> and<00:05:34.410> observations<00:05:35.419> that<00:05:36.419> I<00:05:36.479> just

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
experience and observations that I just

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.129 
experience and observations that I just
don't<00:05:37.139> see<00:05:37.590> how<00:05:37.889> this<00:05:38.099> theory<00:05:38.729> applies<00:05:39.210> to<00:05:39.240> the

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
don't see how this theory applies to the

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.990 
don't see how this theory applies to the
drug-free<00:05:40.560> lifter<00:05:41.039> now<00:05:41.190> I<00:05:41.220> would<00:05:41.520> agree<00:05:41.820> with

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
drug-free lifter now I would agree with

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.730 
drug-free lifter now I would agree with
the<00:05:42.210> guys<00:05:42.840> you're<00:05:43.050> on<00:05:43.080> drugs<00:05:43.530> there's

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
the guys you're on drugs there's

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.790 
the guys you're on drugs there's
probably<00:05:44.160> more<00:05:44.430> truth<00:05:44.669> to<00:05:44.700> this<00:05:45.530> but<00:05:46.530> for<00:05:46.710> the

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
probably more truth to this but for the

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.800 
probably more truth to this but for the
drug-free<00:05:47.190> diets<00:05:47.639> I<00:05:47.910> just<00:05:48.240> don't<00:05:48.419> see<00:05:48.720> it

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
drug-free diets I just don't see it

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.570 
drug-free diets I just don't see it
because<00:05:48.960> there<00:05:49.349> are<00:05:49.500> too<00:05:49.860> many<00:05:50.039> guys<00:05:50.250> who<00:05:50.520> are

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
because there are too many guys who are

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.370 
because there are too many guys who are
able<00:05:50.849> to<00:05:50.880> exceed<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:51.479> natural<00:05:51.840> limits<00:05:52.169> who

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
able to exceed the natural limits who

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.980 
able to exceed the natural limits who
are<00:05:52.500> holding<00:05:52.740> higher<00:05:53.250> body<00:05:54.030> fat<00:05:54.330> percentages

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
are holding higher body fat percentages

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.589 
are holding higher body fat percentages
it<00:05:55.260> doesn't<00:05:55.650> pan<00:05:55.889> out<00:05:55.919> in<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.310> real<00:05:56.490> world<00:05:56.729> so

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
it doesn't pan out in the real world so

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.360 
it doesn't pan out in the real world so
that's<00:05:57.900> just<00:05:58.139> me<00:05:58.349> kind<00:05:58.470> of<00:05:58.590> rambling<00:05:59.039> on<00:05:59.190> this

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
that's just me kind of rambling on this

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.560 
that's just me kind of rambling on this
and<00:05:59.580> just<00:05:59.699> giving<00:05:59.910> my<00:06:00.030> thoughts<00:06:00.300> on<00:06:00.479> this
