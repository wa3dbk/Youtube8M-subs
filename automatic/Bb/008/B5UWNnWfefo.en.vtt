00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.210

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.480
 mendoza 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.920
 well the movie was made of simple the 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.719
 legend of the sanctuary 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.699
 with the dragon ball movie z the 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.589
 battle of the gods there were some 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.480
 complications to be able to try 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.239
 gather the largest number of voices 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.800
 originals this was the case also for 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.940
 knights destroy with the reading of the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.239
 sanctuary 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.270
 so look at real I really do not know until 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.360
 where there was no problem because we 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.790
 they called all separately to 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.060
 hire one 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.420
 And nowadays 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.700
 there's no such union before that 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.909
 come on let's go let's go none each 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.030
 as it is said as the grandmothers say jala 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.460
 agua pérez molina then I say yes no 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.229
 we tell each other knights we talk to each other 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.990
 we said or they're going to talk to us is that 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.520
 good that father but I do not know if there 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.799
 there was a problem with someone 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.929
 especially because they did not tell us about 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.149
 fact they told us state day is already 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.060
 here and state you want to accept do not want 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.280
 I the truth is that I wait for this 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.310
 movie when I knew it was going to be me 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.440
 for my fans I was waiting for him to mine 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.110
 of film to record it this I say no 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.440
 I know other colleagues maybe they saw it 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.590
 monetarily 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.510
 who will call them no no I wanted 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.600
 put the voice to the dragon because the truth 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.280
 that is my favorite character one of the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.930
 favorites then I was waiting 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.430
 nothing else here call me I knew that I 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.400
 they were going to call because by yourselves 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:15.190
 by two fans was that we are in that 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.280
 police film and also the voice 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.310
 of the dragon served without his voice will not have 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.460
 council as you mentioned already the people 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.130
 who grew up with the knights would be with 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.280
 the caricature of that then because 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.950
 will not understand who that is 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.920
 It is not the same but well they wanted 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.440
 force and I say and I the truth this is not 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.940
 no no no no do not see that character with another 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.520
 voice and in fact now to me this movie 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.920
 I feel that it has done me very well 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.930
 I do not say it, but I am 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.520
 He loved the work rarely of 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.620
 I like my work but now 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.720
 I was very critical and I really liked the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.760
 work done dragon like what 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.710
 manage how mario castañeda helped us 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.069
 way of the character and I loved it 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.859
 how was it 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.719
 that was my next question what would you 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.540
 he seemed to work with mario that taught 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:07.489
 directing the film truth he was the 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.889
 dubbing director is not an excellent 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.099
 director mario castañeda is a person 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:15.040
 very cultured got to see is from I do not know 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.439
 how many movies how many chapters of 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.049
 gentlemen to soak up well what 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.819
 it was the essence of change of the zodiac and 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.790
 the truth I think we did not have any 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.340
 problem with him gave us the indications 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.099
 exact to the actors this suitable 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.019
 then a good product came out 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.480
 of the Syrian dragon character that others 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.519
 projects have future related 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.319
 the Japanese animation the cartoons in 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.650
 general look lately has 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.819
 changed the dubbing a lot and they are gone 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.760
 many series to companies that suddenly 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:52.129
 I have neither stepped on nor know them I am 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.420
 very involved with the question that I 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.790
 I do portland jobs where 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.819
 the union that I belong to today 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.510
 those companies if there is any recording 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.209
 some series out of that company 's 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.310
 work then for that reason is that not 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.260
 I have been able to work in many series or 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.910
 that now I hear less because many 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.830
 series are in companies where it does not pass 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.810
 nothing they have spoken to me but I say you know that 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.470
 if you do not pass me the payments for walking that 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.870
 is my union has not moved me away because of that 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.570
 this movie was sought out in the 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.150
 neutral study where we could go in 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.860
 part and me because I 'm not going to any 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.780
 side that is not doing things are a lot 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.919
 also for them to be if it says clear 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.570
 now so that he behaved so that he 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.700
 could they be that study then I say 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.420
 projects we go right now no no I do not have 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.390
 new projects of encouragement 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.920
 I do not know which ones are coming but good is that 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.390
 to come to a movie and to continue 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.880
 they finished zodiac or with this new 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.110
 animation I would like the new 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.900
 stories is not animation would be 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.650
 very nice if right now there is a 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.320
 manga that is taking place week after 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.750
 week in japan which is this simple 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.730
 next dimension is already a new story 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.740
 of the city horses that all if 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.240
 come to be the case because the 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.630
 story in the manga still continues and 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.430
 it looks very far away that that animation is 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.850
 however you would be at the foot of the 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.640
 canyon there is if it arrives the arrives to arrive 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.100

 I say yes it does come to the studio where it can 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:27.070
 work then I love it if not then 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.900
 now I would be happy 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.730

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.160
