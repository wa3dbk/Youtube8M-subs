00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.529
 may i will be 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.789
 I can tell you where you bought most of my art tools 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:22.789
 Of nails 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.169
 he bought them in an art warehouse 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.560
 in these stores has been found ma 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.009
 Peronist tools for had had one more day than in any 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.899
 another place 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.819
 there are other places where you can get for example can someone 

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:35.450
 believe 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.800
 one can get to quite and this is a fantastic place to also find 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.479
 tools for luck of nails 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.250
 at very low prices 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.630
 basically my favorite store is called frames 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.390
 I live in california and in this store 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.290
 I find 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.930
 pointers meeting that he led in his country all 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.780
 paintbrushes the paintings I basically find everything I need then 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.470
 I'm going to start by teaching you which are the paintings you used to 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.840
 look at you nails 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.030
 let's start talking about what fell to the sea 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.369
 I like them in particular 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.459
 because it comes from a variety of colors and what I like even more than 

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.840
 that is, if one makes a mistake 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.990
 easily the error can be erased with love 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.540
 even if they are dried to paints it can be erased with water then that's why 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.090
 stamp are mark nor do I love this are not found 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.190
 where are the paintings for children 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.700
 Now we are going to give you these water-based acrylic paints 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.760
 but before continuing I want to let you know what when these are used 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.220
 paintings since they are not made for nails you have to make sure that 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.020
 have 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.650
 uu is more this 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.060
 below and these apply only over 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.420
 of its varnish 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.380
 and another thing that I want to tell you also remember that you seal your design 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.530
 with a clear enamel because if not to wash your hands surely everything 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.510
 will erase 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.570
 here I have three brands that I've been using lately here I have a 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.039
 that is called focus hours 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.499
 American and gap opera rock 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:13.960
 These three brands are what you are using and I like them a lot 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.760
 because they have very strong color 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.930
 compared to the horse at the station like more 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.840
 the only difference is 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.080
 that when you make a mistake using these once you say that 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.020
 this painting 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.480
 you can not remove the error with water 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.099
 but it is going to need alcohol that is not so hard to do either but 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.220
 this really has a great variety of colors you can even see that you're 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.459
 to eat 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.890
 now that we have talked about the paintings 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.960
 we are going to move to another topic I am going to talk to you about the pointers and the 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.379
 brushes he used for me before a month 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.530
 in this same store I found the pointers 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.969
 however, as they are for 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:55.559
 before 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:03:00.299
 of relief I do not know do not have the same name do not have or do not advertise as if 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.839
 they were part of the nails but it is the same tool that looks and serves 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:06.049
 but it's called 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.389
 in palace in his 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.200
 i depending on where you live bush who in these stores 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.660
 paz sl moth-eaten for good what equipment tools in mind for luck of 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.510
 a month here I also find the brushes that he used for me before 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.059
 one month 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:22.600
 now let's enter the camera to teach them 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.999
 the pointers cycling stores 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:27.999
 also the rocha are the brushes 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:32.079
 here I have a variety of pointers of different sizes 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.900
 these I have got them haiti from the country will not be found by prices 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.089
 extremely cheap 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:42.989
 others that I bought for a hundred the art warehouse are these are here 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.579
 so basically it's the same thing for it from our 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:54.040
 the measurements are almost the same is there can see exact almost i this one has no 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.450
 double the double on pointer side 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.030
 but the others yes 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.110
 that's where one has up to 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.070
 the other but that these are not going to find them under pointers to get your nails 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.450
 this is how to be the little package 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.640
 i do not say it is a pointer or a relative of yours but says then 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.540
 urged to establish this one buy mosque frames for less than 5 dollars 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.159
 for this package of 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.499
 of three pointers 

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:26.169
 now let's talk about our brushes that are specially made 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.460
 for nails 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.210
 of all these I do not use all of them one of the tools that I love 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.699
 that is also sing this tool because it can be used for many 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:37.599
 things 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.699
 another one that I love 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.990
 another brushes of these that have 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.499
 the 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:48.689
 I also know about narita because you can enter and do very detailed works 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:51.159
 one that I like to be flowers 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.069
 is this one that looks at 15 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:55.449
 that this one with this guerrilla 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.240
 that is a bit digital life 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.139
 at an angle I love this to be flowers and right now I am going to show you 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.220
 how to make one was simple using this pinche between applied half white 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.440
 and half purple in rallies in the angle and what I'm going to do is nothing more 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.830
 I'm going to apply 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.139
 pressure and lift it and I'm going to do this several times 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:24.849
 and there is the little flower now submerged and brush in green and the only thing 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.719
 what I am going to do 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:29.699
 in excess and there is a policy 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.400
 very simple to achieve 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.120
 these three measures that you are seeing here are my favorites and are the ones that 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.170
 used more 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.920
 these 15 love them 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.490
 this one that is up that they say india this is to make lines 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.289
 delgaditas these last two wanted a spark 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.270
 his words are that they are excellent to be dots or to make designs 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.860
 more detailed this is another of my favorite brushes 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.110
 what I love about this one is 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.580
 the tip that it has helps me to make designs that have a lot of detail 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:06.740
 what we have left to talk about are the other tools that can be used 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.169
 to hold together 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.789
 it would be what it is 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:10.800
 Wolves 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.310
 the tenth sisters are also banesto your voice that is not everything 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.099
 this is kind of nail art 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.249
 they will find it online 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:25.569
 and dances make them that whistle is an excellent place to find this guy 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:26.860
 of 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.750
 tools to use 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.370
 in his art of a god 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.600
 I'm also going to tell you that in this one you have particular if you live in states 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.270
 United

 that is a butterfly would find a variety of those in different 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.020
 colors 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.619
 they will also find this 

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:45.659

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:46.540

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.379
 there they will find all that kind of nail art 

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:03.520
 I hope this video has been of some help 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:05.599
 take care in the 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:07.939
