an injured back or politicking one of
the<00:00:36.210> two<00:00:36.530> but<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.860> do<00:00:38.700> believe<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.210> this

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the two but I do believe that this

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.240 
the two but I do believe that this
should<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> WBC<00:00:40.920> super

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
should be the for the WBC super

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.560 
should be the for the WBC super
middleweight<00:00:41.670> championship<00:00:42.090> due<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
middleweight championship due to the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.130 
middleweight championship due to the
fact<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.700> Carl<00:00:44.700> Froch<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.809> former

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
fact that Carl Froch is the former

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
fact that Carl Froch is the former
champion<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.710> our<00:00:46.829> day<00:00:47.039> bruh<00:00:47.309> Ham<00:00:47.489> has<00:00:48.000> not

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
champion in our day bruh Ham has not

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.389 
champion in our day bruh Ham has not
fought<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> championship<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> super

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
fought for a championship for the super

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.240 
fought for a championship for the super
six<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:51.270> tournament<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.559> when<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.949> look<00:00:53.129> at

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
six on tournament so when you look at

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.010 
six on tournament so when you look at
these<00:00:53.370> factors<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.030> think<00:00:54.059> that's<00:00:54.480> pretty<00:00:54.809> much

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
these factors I think that's pretty much

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.569 
these factors I think that's pretty much
just<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.289> fair<00:00:55.500> thing<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.190> not<00:00:56.460> only

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
just a fair thing to do and not only

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.420 
just a fair thing to do and not only
that<00:00:56.699> even<00:00:57.629> though<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> rel<00:00:58.140> was<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.620> WBC

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
that even though the rel was the WBC

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.290 
that even though the rel was the WBC
mandatory<00:01:00.770> Andre<00:01:01.770> Ward<00:01:02.100> held<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> title

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
mandatory Andre Ward held the title

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.230 
mandatory Andre Ward held the title
holds<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.140> title<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.710> another<00:01:05.309> organization

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
holds a title for another organization

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.929 
holds a title for another organization
so<00:01:06.900> that's<00:01:07.290> pretty<00:01:07.770> much<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> fair<00:01:08.670> thing<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
so that's pretty much the fair thing to

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.969 
so that's pretty much the fair thing to
do<00:01:09.180> but<00:01:09.420> when<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.689> comes<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.950> know

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
do but when it comes to you know

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.800 
do but when it comes to you know
companies<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.700> stuff<00:01:11.909> it's<00:01:12.150> not<00:01:12.299> me<00:01:12.630> all

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
companies and stuff it's not me all

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.560 
companies and stuff it's not me all
about<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.500> most<00:01:14.400> fair<00:01:14.729> thing<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.420> all

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
about the most fair thing to do it's all

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.359 
about the most fair thing to do it's all
about<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:16.259> brings<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> most<00:01:17.009> money

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
about what brings in the most money

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
using using angles to give them off

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.340 
using using angles to give them off
balance<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.770> jeff<00:04:36.010> from<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.280> ankles<00:04:37.200> go<00:04:38.200> for

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
balance and jeff from the ankles go for

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.650 
balance and jeff from the ankles go for
the<00:04:38.410> occasional<00:04:39.070> um<00:04:39.280> shot<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.180> body<00:04:40.330> and

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
the occasional um shot to the body and

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.170 
the occasional um shot to the body and
if<00:04:41.290> that<00:04:41.650> opening<00:04:42.250> for<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.460> right<00:04:42.670> uppercut

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
if that opening for the right uppercut

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.750 
if that opening for the right uppercut
is<00:04:43.300> not<00:04:43.540> you<00:04:43.840> know<00:04:43.960> up<00:04:44.200> top<00:04:44.440> try<00:04:45.340> letting<00:04:45.580> that

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
is not you know up top try letting that

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.060 
is not you know up top try letting that
right<00:04:46.120> uppercut<00:04:46.600> to<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.780> body<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.380> land<00:04:47.950> into

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
right uppercut to the body and land into

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.580 
right uppercut to the body and land into
the<00:04:48.220> body<00:04:48.400> on<00:04:48.670> occasion<00:04:49.270> may<00:04:49.750> be<00:04:49.810> cowering<00:04:50.380> and

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
the body on occasion may be cowering and

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.240 
the body on occasion may be cowering and
land<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.190> right<00:04:51.370> uppercut<00:04:51.880> I<00:04:52.090> think<00:04:52.630> that<00:04:52.870> if

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
land the right uppercut I think that if

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.280 
land the right uppercut I think that if
Carl<00:04:54.250> Froch<00:04:54.520> can<00:04:55.090> basically<00:04:55.480> work<00:04:55.990> in<00:04:56.200> the

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
Carl Froch can basically work in the

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.780 
Carl Froch can basically work in the
early<00:04:56.440> goings<00:04:56.860> of<00:04:56.890> the<00:04:57.010> fight<00:04:57.220> say<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.520> first

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
early goings of the fight say the first

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.540 
early goings of the fight say the first
four<00:04:58.060> rounds<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:58.690> take<00:04:59.470> a<00:04:59.500> couple<00:04:59.830> round<00:05:00.130> you

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.070 
time in this fight I wouldn't be
surprised<00:07:29.440> if<00:07:29.590> Ross<00:07:29.830> went<00:07:30.070> down<00:07:30.280> once<00:07:30.690> but<00:07:31.690> and

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 
surprised if Ross went down once but and

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.770 
surprised if Ross went down once but and
and<00:07:32.740> maybe<00:07:33.190> you<00:07:33.610> know<00:07:33.760> off<00:07:33.910> of<00:07:34.090> him<00:07:34.210> being<00:07:34.420> you

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:34.780
