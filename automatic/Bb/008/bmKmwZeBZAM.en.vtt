00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
move the trailer to the north end and

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.340 
move the trailer to the north end and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
the trailer and so it takes about two

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.029 
the trailer and so it takes about two
weeks<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:28.019> they<00:00:28.109> all<00:00:28.230> get<00:00:28.380> used<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.769> it
