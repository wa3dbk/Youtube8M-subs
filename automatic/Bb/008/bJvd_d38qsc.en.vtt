00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.670
 hello hello gorgeous welcome to me 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.780
 channel today I bring you this makeup that 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.120
 it's in chocolate and mint tones that was 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.610
 a request from one of my subscribers 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.970
 from youtube thank you very much for your 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:24.150
 requests and I hope you like this 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.660
 look that is very bright we are going to 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.510
 start applying a base of shadows of 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.430
 skin color on the upper eyelid e 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.059
 lower and I'll spread it with the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.539
 fingers this is going to be useful for us 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.329
 shadows take more intensity and last us 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:45.499
 more later I'm going to apply this shadow of 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.120
 matte beige and I'm going to blur it 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:52.819
 pretty good especially the eyelid 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.819
 superior giving circular movements 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.000
 then I will continue using in the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.969
 same brush and take this shadow of 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.129
 coffee color half matt and I'm going to 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.530
 use as our color of 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.619
 transition and I will apply it throughout the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.180
 eye socket and loading a bit to 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.180
 neutralize the color well 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.100
 then he took this shade of brown 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.550
 darker than the previous one is the brum of 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.660
 mark and I'm going to apply it to taps in 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.580
 the outer edge of the eye which I'm going to 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.890
 Blur with circular movements 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.590
 also this what is very very 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.450
 blurred and I'm going to repeat this step 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.840
 until I take the intensity that I 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.840
 wish 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.170
 later I will continue to apply this 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:52.830
 eyeliner black the pencil and I'm going to 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.689
 delineate the upper lashes creating 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.689
 also a not too long wing in the part 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.689
 Exterior 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.830
 then I will use this black shadow 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.230
 mate 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.290
 and I'm going to take it with a brush 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.060
 moistened to fill all 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.670
 holes that remained of the eyeliner 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.520
 previous that served as a guide and we're going 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.940
 to lengthen that delineated as you can see 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.850
 is not very marked is blurred and remains 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.360
 pretty good with the kind of what 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.360
 we are doing 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.209
 then I continue with this shadow of 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.060
 adhara naked and I'm going to involve 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.640
 touches on the outer edge of the eye 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.060
 to further intensify the depth 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.060
 Of the eye 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.579
 well I take this pencil eyeliner 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:50.510
 bright green and I'm going to use it for 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:54.189
 delineate the lower lashes creating 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.189
 a pretty thick line 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.709
 then take it is beautiful in shadow of 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:05.780
 see the number 63 that has a color 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:08.720
 mint that also has glitters between the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.840
 shadow and it looks beautiful and I'm going to 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.470
 apply several times on the outlined 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.610
 that we create with the pencil 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.430
 then I made my eyelashes apply the 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.700
 Black mask on the eyelashes 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.700
 higher 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.280
 I continue to apply on the water line 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.550
 a brown eyeliner so that 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.760
 intensify eye color 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.820
 and applied a very white shade 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.300
 bright nylon marc in bone 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.300
 the eyebrow 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.300
 I add these false eyelashes 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.550
 very pretty that look pretty good with 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.800
 the look and they add a very 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.950
 moderate 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.550
 then I'm going to take this shadow and white 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.240
 and I'm going to use it to illuminate the 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.240
 lacrimal area 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.239
 then show this adhara pigment 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.940
 which is quite bright is white and 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.590
 it seems the iter but it is not it is pigment 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.310
 and I'm going to use it to give it even more 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.870
 light to the lacrimal and I'm going to spread it 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.120
 towards the central part of the eye by 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.940
 under 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.190
 and as a last step added mask 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.190
 tabs on the bottom 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.060
 and that's all this is the final result 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.099
 I hope you like girls 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.189

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.330
