00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.700
 dear ladies and gentlemen heartily 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.320
 welcome to the next video here from 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.180
 the international precious metal and 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.270
 raw material fair from munich the largest 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.080
 precious metal fair here in europe i am looking forward 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.270
 me very much on my next 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.360
 interview hospitable frank meyer known from 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.670
 n-tv and the metal week franco 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.670
 moderated here it was just jared l and 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.150
 i because it was proppevoll or it is real 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.860
 the hammer 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.510
 the people are not only interested 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.770
 where the gold and silver prices rise 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.390
 but are interested in what 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.219
 geopolitically, she happens to be interested 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.300
 for what happened in america like 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.250
 the elections go out 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.960
 which follow the whole thing like that 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.060
 geopolitics is changing as the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.739
 makes axes change and you have to 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.960
 say that the people I experienced a lot 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.130
 very bright very very curious though 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.430
 the debut already in the last eight 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.840
 How did that change now ? 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.790
 eight years this fair developed 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.050
 that was all in this time in the beginning 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.070
 conspiracy theorists here 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.989
 they have been 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.160
 conspiracy theorists of the past 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.500
 the realists of today 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.540
 I mean the precious metal prices show 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.280
 of course that's difficulties 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.990
 where in the financial system there are 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.759
 Difficulties can be felt in the meantime 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.500
 also in the social out there 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.030
 I have the impression that you ask 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.229
 It also asks the right questions 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.450
 and that you have responsibility for yourself 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.960
 that was already an issue at that time 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 but today 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.159
 much stronger 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.630
 a visitor to the fair came to me 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.490
 and said he is now too 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.289
 You will also override that saying that 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.700
 the topic has become too mainstream 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.140
 gold so who cares so long 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.299
 busy the market with being right 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.090
 It's definitely hot up here 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.670
 This fair must be on the first stage 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.520
 it is overflowing at the lectures because 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.600
 People just ask a lot 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.159
 have a great interest 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.899
 churchill the end of the hall has burst 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.689
 philipp vorndran is the hall 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.850
 burst at uwe bergold today early the 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.159
 first first lecture that all burst 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.930
 So here you can already see overflowing 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.240
 questioners who are looking for answers 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.080
 what the main answer what 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.490
 investors should do 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.570
 you now have the lectures bit 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.570
 Also follow your view of the market 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.430
 should one do as an investor think for you 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.350
 itself takes personal responsibility 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.090
 for you and do not mourn the other 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.320
 people who tell you what to do or 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.630
 let's have over that 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.090
 self-responsibility makes you knowledgeable 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.190
 Might not make the picture too wide 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.959
 because it does not confuse you when you are 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.370
 race the second hand at one o'clock 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.770
 See the news as well 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.750
 not the hour hand not in minutes 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.239
 say but on the hour days 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.680
 focused on the big picture and 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.660
 maybe yourself again and again 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.310
 I league right or could ask 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.290
 I'm wrong but definitely 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.030
 your own homework makes your own 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.410
 take responsibility and not that 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.050
 do everything that others suggest 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.930
 Advice is also beating 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.850
 Now the central banks have expansionary 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.860
 some say ultra-expansive course 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.770
 smashed with the author shops 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.300
 by mario draghi qe3 of the us central bank 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.920
 also britain japan have that 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.270
 company where does that lead to the 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.810
 Investors what does this have for the investor? 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.850
 mean 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.470
 they wait for the money from what remains 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.700
 otherwise leave them if they do not 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.860
 would and if that is even one 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.080
 We would have long had the law 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.790
 the breakdown the try on 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.890
 this rail is waiting to come that is 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.290
 a wire rope currently verbal of 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.870
 central banks later so the basis 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.940
 spread and we have to 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.130
 be especially careful about it 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.570
 this money will come in the real economy 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.200
 the transmission belts work 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.780
 not yet 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.760
 but I know no point where ever 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.310
 gone well is what you did now 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.520
 the theme of 2013 is financial 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.380
 repression the consequence of politics and the 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.640
 Follow the policy of the central banks 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.980
 We should mainly put the investors on 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.900
 Watch event money because it will 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.300
 less of the purchasing power as long as you 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.760
 that still grants him a kind of 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.590
 worth what it does not have anyway we see 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.720
 especially that one is currently verbal 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.940
 trying to keep this story 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.760
 whether the three four five or chloé 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.580
 infinite I suspect it will be infinite 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.070
 we give in america had Bakun a1 a 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.670
 plus of 40 percent at dow jones 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.330
 qe2 of 20 percent at q3 from zero 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.250
 percent 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.590
 and you have to keep that up 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.970
 no other chance that can not 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.330
 just kick down the street 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.610
 let's see how long street is 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.680
 that means inflation inflation what 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.510
 otherwise 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.209
 how can you react to it as saver 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.799
 there are surveys of forsa and quite a few 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.520
 others say the german language 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.600
 May stay with a deposit but 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.539
 nominal interest rates lower than inflation 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.009
 means I lose real money from which 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.880
 point people jump on others 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.020
 plants already over already 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.139
 do not save blood anymore 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.699
 I lose most of my purchasing power 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.530
 of course we do not know that we have 48 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.410
 million assets in germany 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.810
 if the interest rate is negative with one percent 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.940
 so that's nearly 50 billion in 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.910
 Germany lost in purchasing power 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.419
 according to official reading , 3% or 4 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.780
 percent 160 billion a year what you 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.080
 Here you can see Munich 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:03.270
 the buy real estate hamburg / frankfurt 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.090
 Berlin / Leipzig deserve money 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.730
 promise out in real values ​​and ask 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.860
 what is actually such a good value 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.289
 shares 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.810
 we have a very weird scenario in the 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.969
 moment still watches the markets very much 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.469
 very strong 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:20.229
 if they smell that 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:22.929
 economic data only with express 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.430
 the dax would not be there where in the 

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:28.400
 moment is but he stays up there 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.419
 it used to be different from today 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.160
 perhaps the people is also purely 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.419
 in shares and not say what 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.639
 I understand I buy what 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.290
 difficulties or big changes 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.580
 maybe survived but I have 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.449
 then at least what I'm not watching 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.520
 the price does not look after the 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.139
 becomes mountain green 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.550
 the whole promise is promise 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.530
 even the tv 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.220
 how do you say they are broken? 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.220
 that's why without 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.840
 gold price its target price for 2013 when 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.480
 you meet it here again on the 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.330
 Edelmetallmesse 2013 will be the gold price 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.030
 I am now in 1660 always believe 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.630
 yesterday -2% theme in the direction of 1000 or 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.280
 2000 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.420
 I give a whole thematic answer 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.420
 because that 's not the point 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.500
 the unit of measure for an ounce to 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.270
 next year exactly 31.1 grams 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.200
 and that's the value in the next one too 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.700
 year 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.170
 The price is what I am 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.830
 i can orient myself to chance i 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.140
 Can me for my wishes 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.050
 orient or what experts say 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.340
 too many beds with ex that's one 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.600
 still inflation of experts in the 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.370
 moment at the precious metal fair here 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.520
 Anyone who has said earlier will turn up 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.350
 action sure thing is all experts 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.250
 for gold today but that can still be 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.230
 further increase 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.150
 I can not say any goal I 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.920
 presumably the money printing becomes higher 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.000
 previously given courses 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.000
 Thank you for the interview
