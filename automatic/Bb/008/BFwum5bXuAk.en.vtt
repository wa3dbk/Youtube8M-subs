00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.220
 intensely made up is because I made 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.830
 a tutorial do not think that doing in my 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.170
 home and for life this but good the 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.889

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.869
 cream is accompanied by a salad 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.180
 this one of lettuce with a chick to the 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.710
 very good grill and above all is very 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.050
 light for those who have been 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.660
 asking for dessert recipes and two 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.860
 light meals are also me 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.989
 They said they made a salad 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.320
 then I'm going to show you this one that I 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:35.870
 I make you know to suck your fork 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.370
 not those of two girls I'm good for 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.280
 the correct ones first of all we're going to 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.390
 occupy this type of pasta that is in 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.610
 chubby is true, please, the 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.950
 coincidence this and for the cream that 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.960
 let's do we're going to need a 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.810
 cheese bar we think if you know which one 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.700
 It's true and I 'm half paradramatic because 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.070
 I want to make the recipe 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.079
 because if not then when to see giving as 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.999
 very light normally 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.000
 and well we're going to need the bar 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:07.130
 cream cheese so much milk we're going to 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.090
 liquefy and then we will need 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.729
 small squares of ham and squares of 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.259
 pineapple so let's go with the first step 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.240
 what is this put in this half today not 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.320
 I know if you catch sight but this water 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.409
 and salt 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.200
 add what are the codes we are going to 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.939
 let them sew very well and good 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.189
 Now let's go with the next step 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.759
 now let's go to what is the salad and 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.670
 I'm going to occupy this guy this guy in this 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.159
 type of lettuce as it is called roman 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.890
 I think this good I'm going to cut it in 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:47.569
 bits I'm going to occupy for the salad 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.320
 it's strawberry I'm also going to occupy little 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.600
 pineapple 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.570
 we like it now I arranged to me 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.210
 put parmesan cheese and you 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.420
 accompany with the dressing of their 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.080
 preference 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.840
 and good what is also important is 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.390
 that we're going to use chicken chicken breast 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.209
 I'm going to show you this right now 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.700
 breast as we are going as to season 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.709
 and we're going to put the robots to work 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.670
 to be seen but it does not matter if I 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.489
 see this already in that the lettuce was like this 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.380
 well I Removable leaf blade 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.100
 listen as with with placed east tooth 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.530
 but it is not leaf by leaf this and good and 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.910
 with the fabrics and together we're going to 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.489
 disinfect you have the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.180
 droplet disinfectant perfect and if 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.910
 not with water and a trickle of chlorine and 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.190
 Afterwards, girls, the next step is 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.950
 prepare our chicken and we're just going 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.380
 to add salt and pepper to the chicken 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.989
 then in this gadget that you see here 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.090
 I spray this butter 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.940
 It can be with olive oil or oil 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.730
 normal and is very rich we are going to put 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.800
 the whole chicken piece 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.840
 what is the breast and when it is 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.000
 cooked is when we start in bits 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.489
 for the salad and if you do not have 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.379
 this gadget is the same if you do it 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.720
 the iron in a pan never now that 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.599
 we are going to do is start our 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.560
 ingredients and well these two are going to be 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:23.690
 for the salad and these two ham and 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.239
 pineapple for the codes we break it in 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.690
 little squares girls here is the mixture of 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.360
 philadelphia cheese with milk tastes 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.430
 really rich this I know that it 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.590
 does is coditos with cream but I do not 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.970
 I had cream and my mother's savior 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.510
 He told me not to mix cheese 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.030
 philadelphia with milk and good we continue 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.940
 Match the ingredients as you can see 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.980
 will take our blender mix 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.160
 here to the codes the truth is that I 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.030
 it was something liquid, put a quarter of it 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.340
 cup of milk nothing else with a bar 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.890
 cream cheese 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.739
 and good here is the ham and pineapple and 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.860
 Now if we put it in the river, they are dry 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.860
 our leaves and well we put as well as 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.440
 that the revenues remain the same for 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.569
 cut them personally so we do not 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.760
 they like in all 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.280
 this bai 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.170
 and then when cutting the leaves 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.330
 I really do not have we should not 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.540
 have to do more than squares than angle 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.750
 by girls salad list only 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.140
 I stirred all the chopped ingredients 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.570
 There's the chicken pineapple and strawberries 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.240
 lettuce if you like to add tomato 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.750
 The ingredients vary depending on 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.390
 your peach apple taste I do not know anymore is to 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.200
 his preference and good apart from that he 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.660
 go super colorful is super rich and love 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.240
 and now I show you the final dish 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.040
 but I say goodbye, I really want them 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.930
