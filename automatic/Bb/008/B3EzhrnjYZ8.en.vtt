00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.200
 hi everyone there is plenty and 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.310
 for the first video so I received a 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.980
 burst snipe challenge who ask me 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.740
 to have six stars and whose and not 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.099
 to die while we know so much 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.640
 challenges and for this challenge so I'm going to go 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.550
 at the nubra where I easily pinch 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.440
 stars so it's 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.430
 the police station on 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.970
 police station that are there a 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.090
 trade where I find you by that I'm going 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.760
 miramont and for this challenge I had them a 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.320
 only code that will be a code 2 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.970
 of weapons that I will put you in the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.470
 description not that there are 2 weights 2 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.020
 of weapons so I would put you no 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.530
 given the description 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.219
 and that's because we need them 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.450
 touati the son because with bare hands I 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.559
 will not tell you 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.820
 I do not think 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.770
 I will hardly have citizens 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.850
 go like the goals game tough of 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.850
 stay alive 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.020
 here is a 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.470
 a couple on the soup 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.939
 there right there 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.420
 me so I think I will use 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:43.890
 a machine gun I returned nothing 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.890
 otherwise I go directly to the stars 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.520
 so good normal kind interview 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.219
 if the cells are down I believe 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.560
 so I do not take it if one day I 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:03.270
 will never go then it is a vest 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.270
 bulletproof I believe in the piece 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:11.849

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.300
