to show you it works and then you get
the<00:01:28.549> confirm<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.619> now<00:01:30.619> it'll<00:01:31.100> start<00:01:31.130> to

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
the confirm and now it'll start to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:37.090 
the confirm and now it'll start to
download<00:01:34.929> so<00:01:35.929> once<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:36.350> has<00:01:36.439> downloaded<00:01:36.590> what

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
download so once it has downloaded what

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.690 
download so once it has downloaded what
you<00:01:37.219> do<00:01:37.429> is<00:01:37.490> restart<00:01:37.909> your<00:01:38.030> springboard

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.179 

so<00:01:46.299> once<00:01:46.600> it<00:01:46.720> has<00:01:46.810> respring<00:01:47.320> you<00:01:47.830> won't<00:01:48.070> be

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
so once it has respring you won't be

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.520 
so once it has respring you won't be
able<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.460> unlock<00:01:48.549> it<00:01:48.790> straight<00:01:49.060> away<00:01:49.409> now<00:01:50.409> if

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
able to unlock it straight away now if

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.800 
able to unlock it straight away now if
you're<00:01:50.650> wondering<00:01:51.030> will<00:01:52.030> this<00:01:52.210> work<00:01:52.420> with<00:01:52.659> a

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
you're wondering will this work with a

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.690 
you're wondering will this work with a
password<00:01:53.080> yes<00:01:53.560> it<00:01:53.740> will<00:01:53.950> I've<00:01:54.159> just<00:01:54.340> take<00:01:54.520> my

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
password yes it will I've just take my

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.950 
password yes it will I've just take my
password<00:01:55.119> off<00:01:55.299> because<00:01:55.479> I<00:01:55.600> think<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:55.930> looks

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
password off because I think it looks

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.999 
password off because I think it looks
better<00:01:56.350> without<00:01:56.619> it

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
better without it

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.600 
better without it
so<00:01:57.880> once<00:01:58.509> you<00:01:58.780> install<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.590> in<00:01:59.799> it's<00:02:00.009> restarted

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
so once you install it in it's restarted

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.130 
so once you install it in it's restarted
go<00:02:00.790> to<00:02:00.850> your<00:02:01.030> settings<00:02:01.450> then<00:02:01.630> go<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.780> blow<00:02:02.080> to

go to your settings then go to blow to

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.680 
go to your settings then go to blow to
