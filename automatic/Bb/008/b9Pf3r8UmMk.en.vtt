have formats as labels have been around

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.650 
have formats as labels have been around
for<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:45.980> long<00:01:46.160> time<00:01:46.430> this<00:01:46.880> is<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.060> function<00:01:47.630> of

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
for a long time this is a function of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.840 
for a long time this is a function of
this<00:01:47.780> label<00:01:48.200> where<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.950> name<00:01:49.160> is<00:01:49.430> followed<00:01:49.820> by

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
this label where the name is followed by

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.580 
this label where the name is followed by
open<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.390> close<00:01:50.540> paranthesis<00:01:50.810> that<00:01:51.350> is<00:01:51.440> the

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
open and close paranthesis that is the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.380 
open and close paranthesis that is the
indicator<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.160> me<00:01:52.280> that<00:01:52.460> this<00:01:52.580> is<00:01:52.730> a<00:01:52.850> function

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
indicator to me that this is a function

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.180 
indicator to me that this is a function
it<00:01:53.780> will<00:01:53.840> expect<00:01:54.410> a<00:01:54.560> single<00:01:55.010> argument

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
it will expect a single argument

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.890 
it will expect a single argument
function<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.360> function<00:01:56.390> will<00:01:56.870> return

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
function and the function will return

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.770 
function and the function will return
values<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.130> that's<00:01:58.640> what<00:01:58.850> will<00:01:59.000> be<00:01:59.030> displayed

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
values and that's what will be displayed

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.100 
values and that's what will be displayed
so<00:02:00.290> we<00:02:00.770> run<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:01.100> example<00:02:01.490> we've<00:02:02.180> formatted

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
so we run that example we've formatted

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.280 
so we run that example we've formatted
it<00:02:03.520> using<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.730> Q<00:02:05.060> F<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:05.360> G<00:02:05.480> format<00:02:05.900> but<00:02:06.140> it's

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
it using the Q F and G format but it's

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.859 
it using the Q F and G format but it's
actually<00:02:06.440> executing<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.400> Q<00:02:07.580> FMT<00:02:07.940> function<00:02:08.479> to

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
actually executing the Q FMT function to

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.290 
actually executing the Q FMT function to
produce<00:02:09.050> these<00:02:09.350> values<00:02:09.770> Wow<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.729> user<00:02:10.880> can

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
produce these values Wow so the user can

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.660 
produce these values Wow so the user can
edit<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:11.900> change<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.440> function<00:02:12.860> yes<00:02:13.070> rock

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
edit and change that function yes rock

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.790 
edit and change that function yes rock

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
been able to come up with how we can

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.970 
been able to come up with how we can
make<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.130> work<00:02:50.460> I'm<00:02:51.240> still<00:02:51.930> still<00:02:52.470> thinking

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
make that work I'm still still thinking

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.250 
make that work I'm still still thinking
about<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.210> purely<00:02:54.600> something

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
about that so is this purely something

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.050 
about that so is this purely something
only<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.740> 93<00:02:56.250> that's<00:02:56.430> coming<00:02:56.700> out<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.910> not

only in 93 that's coming out is not

that I've been working on for 93 and I'm
showing<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.700> here<00:03:02.760> today<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.270> make<00:03:03.450> sure<00:03:03.660> that

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
showing you here today to make sure that

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.020 
showing you here today to make sure that
I<00:03:04.230> get<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.680> place<00:03:04.710> for<00:03:05.190> 93<00:03:05.580> because<00:03:05.910> I'm

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
I get it in place for 93 because I'm

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.390 
I get it in place for 93 because I'm
talking<00:03:06.540> about<00:03:06.780> now<00:03:07.350> another<00:03:07.650> one<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.220> this

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
talking about now another one that this

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.190 
talking about now another one that this
one<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:08.820> one<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.060> for<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.330> for<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.930> real

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
one this one is for the for the real

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.850 
one this one is for the for the real
nerds<00:03:10.620> in<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.340> audience<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:13.260> Pearl

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
nerds in the audience is the Pearl

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.700 
nerds in the audience is the Pearl
regular<00:03:14.370> expressions<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.240> so<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.590> an

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
regular expressions and so this is an

is mainly a matter of convenience that

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.400 
is mainly a matter of convenience that
people<00:04:40.670> like<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:41.120> idea<00:04:41.420> of<00:04:41.480> using<00:04:41.660> in<00:04:41.990> formats

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
people like the idea of using in formats

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.160 
people like the idea of using in formats
in<00:04:42.650> an<00:04:43.220> input<00:04:43.520> statement<00:04:43.970> for<00:04:44.120> example<00:04:44.570> versus

in an input statement for example versus

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.660 
in an input statement for example versus
having<00:04:45.350> to<00:04:45.470> do<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.740> coding<00:04:45.980> in<00:04:46.220> a<00:04:46.250> data<00:04:46.460> step

having to do the coding in a data step

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.640 
having to do the coding in a data step
so<00:04:47.420> I<00:04:47.450> may<00:04:47.810> be<00:04:47.870> doing<00:04:48.170> a<00:04:48.230> trade-off<00:04:48.500> of

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
so I may be doing a trade-off of

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.730 
so I may be doing a trade-off of
performance<00:04:49.370> versus<00:04:50.620> versus<00:04:51.620> the

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
performance versus versus the

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
convenience but I'm going to be playing

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.300 
convenience but I'm going to be playing
with<00:04:53.750> that<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.020> bit<00:04:54.110> more<00:04:54.410> to<00:04:54.740> get<00:04:55.160> an
