for<00:00:09.410> also<00:00:10.410> attractor<00:00:11.099> DP<00:00:11.880> 20<00:00:13.250> this<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:15.199> already

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
for also attractor DP 20 this is already

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.700 
for also attractor DP 20 this is already
complete<00:00:18.119> slender<00:00:19.020> shell<00:00:19.670> for<00:00:21.710> tractor

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
complete slender shell for tractor

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.800 
complete slender shell for tractor
engine<00:00:23.960> repair<00:00:24.960> kit<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:27.289> also<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.830> should<00:00:29.810> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
engine repair kit and also I should to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.229 
engine repair kit and also I should to
customize<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:32.180> piston<00:00:35.270> this<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.510> sample<00:00:36.870> and

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
customize this piston this is sample and

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:47.650 
customize this piston this is sample and
we<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.989> see<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.469> difference<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:44.750> piston<00:00:45.750> pin

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
we can see a difference the piston pin

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.850 
we can see a difference the piston pin
piston<00:00:48.660> pin<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.050> another<00:00:49.440> size<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:51.860> another

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
piston pin is another size and another

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.639 
piston pin is another size and another
heck<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.180> choose<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:55.219> split<00:00:56.219> off<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
heck I choose to split off right here to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.149 
heck I choose to split off right here to
Toby<00:01:00.050> one<00:01:01.050> long<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:03.470> remove<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> little<00:01:04.979> bit

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
Toby one long and remove a little bit

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
Toby one long and remove a little bit
from<00:01:05.489> here<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.950> piston<00:01:08.729> will<00:01:08.939> be<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.360> this

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
from here so this piston will be in this

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.700 
from here so this piston will be in this
size<00:01:12.020> also<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:14.330> slender<00:01:15.330> shell<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:16.020> make<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.770> by
