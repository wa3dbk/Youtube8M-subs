00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.950 
great thing about neck wear right now is
there's<00:00:29.880> really<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.240> few<00:00:30.480> different

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
there's really a few different

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.110 
there's really a few different
dimensions<00:00:31.919> of<00:00:32.070> ties<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.820> we're<00:00:32.970> going<00:00:33.090> to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
dimensions of ties and we're going to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.700 
dimensions of ties and we're going to
start<00:00:33.360> off<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> seven<00:00:34.079> millimeter<00:00:34.290> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
start off with a seven millimeter and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.590 
start off with a seven millimeter and
the<00:00:34.829> way<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> tie<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.400> is<00:00:35.700> very<00:00:35.970> important

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the way to tie it is very important

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.910 
the way to tie it is very important
because<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:38.130> you<00:00:38.790> don't<00:00:39.300> want<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.079> tied<00:00:40.590> to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
because it's you don't want the tied to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.630 
because it's you don't want the tied to
look<00:00:41.100> odd<00:00:41.370> within<00:00:41.880> the<00:00:42.030> collar<00:00:42.300> space<00:00:42.720> so<00:00:43.640> what

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
look odd within the collar space so what

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.130 
look odd within the collar space so what
I'm<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> show<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.660> correct

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
I'm going to show you it's the correct

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.020 
I'm going to show you it's the correct
way<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.410> tie<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.800> knot<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:47.609> we're<00:00:47.820> also

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
way to tie the knot and then we're also

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.400 
way to tie the knot and then we're also
going<00:00:48.269> to<00:00:48.329> move<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> nine<00:00:49.199> millimeter

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
going to move on to a nine millimeter

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.779 
going to move on to a nine millimeter
tie<00:00:49.890> where<00:00:50.100> we're<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> tie<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> much

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
tie where we're going to tie a much

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.880 
tie where we're going to tie a much
fuller<00:00:51.000> or<00:00:51.210> not<00:00:51.359> one<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> most<00:00:52.410> important

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
fuller or not one of the most important

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.959 
fuller or not one of the most important
things<00:00:53.039> we're<00:00:53.280> tying<00:00:53.489> ties<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.239> fact<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
things we're tying ties the fact that a

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.340 
things we're tying ties the fact that a
guy<00:00:56.969> should<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.510> kind<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:58.019> relax

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
guy should really kind of just relax

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.459 
guy should really kind of just relax
because<00:00:58.679> I<00:00:58.949> think<00:00:59.010> at<00:01:00.000> times<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.809> guy<00:01:01.019> will<00:01:01.050> go

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
because I think at times a guy will go

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.700 
because I think at times a guy will go
to<00:01:01.530> tie<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> tie<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.870> he's<00:01:03.870> already<00:01:04.140> thinking

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
to tie a tie and he's already thinking

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.220 
to tie a tie and he's already thinking
about<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.339> fact<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.300> he's<00:01:06.870> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> be

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
about the fact that he's going to be

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.280 
about the fact that he's going to be
uncomfortable<00:01:07.790> but<00:01:08.790> if<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.600> work<00:01:09.870> around

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
uncomfortable but if you work around

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.649 
uncomfortable but if you work around
with<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> tie<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.730> I'm<00:01:11.850> doing<00:01:12.120> this<00:01:12.240> somewhat

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
with the tie and I'm doing this somewhat

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.100 
with the tie and I'm doing this somewhat
blind<00:01:13.550> because<00:01:14.550> it's<00:01:14.730> it's<00:01:15.240> routine<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.690> me

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
blind because it's it's routine for me

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.630 
blind because it's it's routine for me
and<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.260> more<00:01:16.440> you<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.680> comfortable<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.310> it

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and the more you get comfortable with it

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.580 
and the more you get comfortable with it
you<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.240> kind<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.720> make<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:18.930> work<00:01:19.080> now<00:01:19.440> what

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
you just kind of make it work now what

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.470 
you just kind of make it work now what
I've<00:01:19.740> done<00:01:20.060> is<00:01:21.320> crossed<00:01:22.320> over<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.850> wide<00:01:24.090> over

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
I've done is crossed over the wide over

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.090 
I've done is crossed over the wide over
the<00:01:25.350> skinny<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.990> then<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> wrap<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.530> once<00:01:28.770> more

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the skinny and then I wrap it once more

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.770 
the skinny and then I wrap it once more
now<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.550> you<00:01:29.700> watch<00:01:29.880> me<00:01:30.120> tie<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.360> tie<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
now if you watch me tie the tie the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.680 
now if you watch me tie the tie the
whole<00:01:31.290> attitude<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.190> tie<00:01:32.600> circles<00:01:33.600> around

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
whole attitude of the tie circles around

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.540 
whole attitude of the tie circles around
the<00:01:33.930> fact<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.290> we're<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.650> yanking<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.400> that

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
the fact that we're not yanking on that

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.980 
the fact that we're not yanking on that
we're<00:01:35.700> not<00:01:35.790> tugging<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.420> we're<00:01:36.540> not<00:01:36.630> pulling

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
we're not tugging and we're not pulling

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.450 
we're not tugging and we're not pulling
it<00:01:37.320> we're<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.530> kind<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.920> working<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.430> through

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
it we're just kind of working it through

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.340 
it we're just kind of working it through
so<00:01:39.330> that's<00:01:39.510> wrapped<00:01:39.780> over<00:01:40.070> two<00:01:41.070> whole<00:01:41.370> times

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
so that's wrapped over two whole times

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.230 
so that's wrapped over two whole times
and<00:01:42.440> they<00:01:42.650> bring<00:01:42.920> that<00:01:43.250> wide<00:01:43.580> part<00:01:43.970> back

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
and they bring that wide part back

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.160 
and they bring that wide part back
through<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:45.770> throat<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:46.340> with<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.670> knot

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
through the throat and with the knot

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.510 
through the throat and with the knot
that<00:01:48.170> then<00:01:48.880> comes<00:01:49.880> through<00:01:50.300> a<00:01:51.220> small<00:01:52.220> little

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
that then comes through a small little

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.610 
that then comes through a small little
section<00:01:52.790> that<00:01:53.479> becomes<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.110> front<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.500> the

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
section that becomes the front of the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.520 
section that becomes the front of the
not<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.580> most<00:01:55.729> focal<00:01:56.180> point<00:01:56.420> or<00:01:56.570> not<00:01:56.720> from

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
not the most focal point or not from

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.090 
not the most focal point or not from
here<00:01:57.979> but<00:01:58.220> you'll<00:01:58.970> see<00:01:59.210> me<00:01:59.360> do<00:01:59.600> is<00:02:00.350> work<00:02:00.710> at<00:02:00.950> the
