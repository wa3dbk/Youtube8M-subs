00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.010
 Calhoun nice good day in some this is not a blackberry but quite 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.910
 obviously new from the house of Nokia and that in no time Chianti 6 the 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.949
 concrete name he is 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.730
 Nokia e6 because 00 I do not either 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.779
 In the following will introduce the Nokia e6 is a bit more accurate 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.939
 Smartphone and on the back of the packaging as you can see the Hettich thickest 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.410
 Information and especially the available pharmaceuticals 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.170
 We got the e6 in black from Nokia and I'll show you 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.170
 now everything is included in the delivery 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.890
 So I make the beautiful Beijing now once on us 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.760
 the good way comes that 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.070
 So it's the Nokia 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.049
 in the 6th 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:55.530
 in his full beauty 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.120
 then she has here 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.960
 a trendsetter in which exactly how he can insert the battery 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.240
 Of course I will show you 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.440
 and here he does not come 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.280
 the scope of delivery 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.290
 and there is of course change in the private Camberg to the has no 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.369
 micro SNB but a Nokia own connection 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.950
 then you still have a headset that looks like this 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.640
 this is not the highest quality as far enough for telephony as these look 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.810
 Headphones off 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.930
 and then there is here 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.729
 just another element 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.550
 that they are attached to the clothes 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.909
 could kick around and 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.460
 with whom he can also call then if you then you still have 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.770
 again extra packed 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.770
 around here the the protection for the headphones 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.140
 Of course we do not have a USB charging cable 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.520
 with which more data can be transferred or the e6 can charge us 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520
 say the most important thing today 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.789
 he has here 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:57.729
 the Mercury 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.790
 with a thousand 507 militant hours 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.850
 zol 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.710
 so we see the scope of delivery haussiert we deal but more precisely 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.539
 with the Nokia e6 itself 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.919
 I've packed the contents now again so we fully 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:18.579
 can focus on the Nokia e6 that is really good and compact in 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.069
 The hand also feels good on Jeb 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.480
 and before I forget it is still fast the measure the Nokia e6 is 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.150
 215 millimeters high 59 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.819
 Millimeters wide 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.819
 and 17 coma 5 a millimeter 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:37.259
 narrow 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:38.949
 Sound around 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:41.929
 he already told himself that percent 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:46.269
 in the Nokia box is a description of how he insert the battery 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:46.820
 can 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.770
 that's easy and afterwards below, how do you see 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.649
 his little notches here 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:58.349
 looks rather down and not upstairs once you find yourself had always 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.639
 the reflex somehow 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:00.969
 something like that here 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.139
 pull up some pulls it here 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.150
 down and then there's a little complaint from Dennis the case here 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:10.820
 already lots and then it could either decrease that way 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.560
 or I have it from the front now also has easy 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.059
 upset 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:17.679
 already the battery cover off 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:21.799
 Dan he puts the ARD Nako ranks so I have the SIM card already in it 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.449
 SOB 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.449
 then he sends that everyone is behind us below 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.399
 now is the Nokia e6 so 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.179
 ready for use 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:37.179
 You've seen that with every steel case 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:42.130
 and that of course also causes very noble 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.889
 order is also well processed 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.090
 the Nokia e6 elite kicker 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.100
 m only 133 grams 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.200
 He is very pleasant to handle in terms of percent if you are too 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.549
 a hand 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.370
 or if you hold it in one hand and also choose to operate only with one hand 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:00.840
 so now what more 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.879
 Here we have a Nokia e6 for Forner 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:06.639
 you have here 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.369
 the speaker 

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:12.689
 For the longest you see the designation kg 6 rather small 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:20.680
 right here this is the front of the camera with the resolution VGH that is so 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.970
 that's 400 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.970
 to Jung whose 640 times 480 pixels 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.310
 Danica of course the tape is blank eating wide-screen display and has one 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.890
 Diagonal return from the two point 4 6 inches 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.880
 and that's about the equivalent of sex com has two inches that's one 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.300
 Capacitive touch screen and that is something completely new for Nokia 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:47.310
 yes that has the 6 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.240
 That's why it's always so blackberry curls 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.159
 around 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:55.999
 yes, there is just the procyclical narrate Phone accept 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:58.790
 and on Schleck Koster 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.690
 Seeing that there are other men on time roads 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.330
 here's this branch of a button and many weather ways around are around 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.139
 all 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:10.810
 do the European Championships in Italy 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.330
 under it is the calendars fit 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.639
 Here's the news summed up and below that would have been the contact lists 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.800
 Button and as already said you in the middle of paper a four way Vittek 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.839
 But this is not a taxi sensitive asked as with other nokia models 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:30.059
 that means I can um 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:33.569
 so I do not have to pan and move the sun right now I do not have to 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.499
 really push 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:38.110
 from one point to another 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.870
 get 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.930
 then she has the Preds keyboard here 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.729
 around 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.270
 As already said, of course, there are always the Blackberry 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.710
 the percent I know but later 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.150
 more precisely 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.000
 I just want to say so much so you see maybe the buttons pull 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.770
 you are 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.539
 arched outwards and so much I can say they have definitely 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.879
 a good pressure point and good feedback 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:06.879
 on the left side the Nokia e6 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.169
 You will find here 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.110
 you have here 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.999
 the opening for 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:15.650
 Micro Urs b 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.099
 Coba I'll do it that way 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:22.630
 So you can see that El Negro is taking beer and that 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.699
 the six were either with it or just connect to the PC 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.419
 and here on the Fu side you can see the second possibility 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.200
 To charge here could just plug in the classic charging cable 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.559
 so on the right side 

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:42.609
 The one-time encircled here that is the lock time for that would have to be so once 

00:06:42.609 --> 00:06:44.629
 pull down if I want to like 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:47.629
 subject to normal if it wanted to adjust again 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:49.480
 around 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.569
 EA that they are older allowed 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:56.099
 and soft keys around as well as the voice commands summed up here in the middle 

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:59.919
 r and on the head 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:03.339
 or on the head that phones she once finds her 

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:06.220
 the on-off switch as well as the ever 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.919
 Headphones Buxe 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:10.919
 for the three come five millimeters with jack plug 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.830
 and here's the memory card slot 

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:18.300
 WGs bad bit 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.089
 heavy 

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:23.119
 because he could namely memory card ranks 

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:25.240
 arrangements 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.059
 so and then here on the back 

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:32.809
 he has always done that next to left next to it is loud speaker 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:35.180
 and right next to it 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.800
 is the camera lens and who sees 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.639
 the camera from Nokia e6 has 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:43.309
 Mega pixels 

00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:45.659
 so you look outside 

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:49.110
 There is a lot to discover from the Nokia e6 

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.020
 But I am now in the next video with the inner
