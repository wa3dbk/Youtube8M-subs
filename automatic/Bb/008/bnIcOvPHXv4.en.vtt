hello again YouTube this is not Sid with

hello again YouTube this is not Sid with
another<00:00:04.680> minecraft<00:00:04.830> video<00:00:05.339> about<00:00:05.879> pistons<00:00:09.590> go

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
another minecraft video about pistons go

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.499 
another minecraft video about pistons go
on<00:00:10.740> over<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.160> machine<00:00:11.849> I've<00:00:12.000> just<00:00:12.269> made

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
on over to the machine I've just made

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.400 
on over to the machine I've just made
you<00:00:13.230> keep<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.530> mind<00:00:13.910> this<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:14.969> not<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
you keep in mind this is not a the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.560 
you keep in mind this is not a the
prettiest<00:00:16.920> looking<00:00:17.279> machine<00:00:17.400> yet<00:00:17.910> I've<00:00:18.090> just

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
prettiest looking machine yet I've just

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.099 
prettiest looking machine yet I've just
I've<00:00:18.990> just<00:00:19.740> started<00:00:20.430> fiddling<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.510> I

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
I've just started fiddling with it and I

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.750 
I've just started fiddling with it and I
haven't<00:00:23.100> had<00:00:23.310> time<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.640> flesh<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.240> out<00:00:24.480> yet<00:00:25.760> but

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
haven't had time to flesh it out yet but

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.109 
haven't had time to flesh it out yet but
as<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.420> can<00:00:27.539> see<00:00:28.070> I've<00:00:29.070> got<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.279> spider<00:00:29.760> spawner

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
as you can see I've got a spider spawner

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.889 
as you can see I've got a spider spawner
in<00:00:30.390> there<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.730> already<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.820> bunch<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.180> guinea

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
in there and already a bunch of guinea

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.150 
in there and already a bunch of guinea
pigs<00:00:34.290> or<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.190> case<00:00:35.250> spiders<00:00:37.100> that<00:00:38.100> are

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
pigs or in this case spiders that are

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.110 
pigs or in this case spiders that are
happily<00:00:38.879> waiting<00:00:39.180> my<00:00:39.480> tests<00:00:40.760> now<00:00:41.760> without

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
happily waiting my tests now without

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.520 
happily waiting my tests now without
further<00:00:42.180> further<00:00:42.809> ado<00:00:44.870> that's<00:00:45.870> Gresham's<00:00:46.320> oh

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:57.380 

man<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:50.250> works<00:00:50.610> beautifully<00:00:55.850> now<00:00:56.850> like<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
man this works beautifully now like a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.139 
man this works beautifully now like a
lick<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> spoils<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:01.500> now<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> reset<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.550> just

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
lick the spoils and now to reset I just

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.580 
lick the spoils and now to reset I just
do<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:04.549> and<00:01:05.549> crush<00:01:06.119> again<00:01:09.350> now<00:01:10.350> there's

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
do that and crush again now there's

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.880 
do that and crush again now there's
probably<00:01:11.369> better<00:01:11.670> ways<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.450> but<00:01:12.960> this

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
probably better ways to do this but this

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.270 
probably better ways to do this but this
way<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:15.150> by<00:01:15.840> by<00:01:16.380> no<00:01:16.439> means<00:01:18.170> useless<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.770> very

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
way is by by no means useless it's very

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.670 
way is by by no means useless it's very
useful<00:01:20.750> but<00:01:21.750> not<00:01:22.200> very<00:01:22.380> pretty<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.570> I<00:01:24.680> just

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
useful but not very pretty so I just

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.760 
useful but not very pretty so I just
made<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.159> machine<00:01:26.840> moments<00:01:27.840> ago<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
made this machine moments ago and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.310 
made this machine moments ago and
decided<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:30.119> record<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.810> show<00:01:31.290> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
decided to just record it and show it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.179 
decided to just record it and show it
off<00:01:31.909> so<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:34.040> later<00:01:35.040> i<00:01:35.159> will<00:01:35.340> post<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.909> video

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
off so I later i will post a video

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.670 
off so I later i will post a video
tutorial<00:01:38.390> on<00:01:39.390> how<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.689> make<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.259> machine<00:01:40.650> like

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
tutorial on how to make a machine like

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.499 
tutorial on how to make a machine like
this<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.520> possibly<00:01:41.899> a<00:01:42.899> better<00:01:43.350> looking<00:01:43.799> one

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
this and possibly a better looking one

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.859 
this and possibly a better looking one
because<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:46.229> one's<00:01:46.409> forget<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.860> right<00:01:47.009> now

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.770 

before<00:01:51.869> pistons<00:01:52.470> came<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:52.890> had<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> cactus<00:01:54.600> in

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
before pistons came out had a cactus in

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.530 
before pistons came out had a cactus in
there<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:56.460> was<00:01:56.610> pretty<00:01:57.119> much<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.390> only

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
there and that was pretty much the only

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.960 
there and that was pretty much the only
way<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.439> could<00:01:58.619> farm<00:02:00.110> spiders<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.680> that

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
way you could farm spiders like that

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.940 
way you could farm spiders like that
because<00:02:03.330> you<00:02:04.050> can't<00:02:04.260> really<00:02:04.320> drown<00:02:04.740> them

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
because you can't really drown them

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.880 
because you can't really drown them
because<00:02:05.220> they<00:02:05.370> hope<00:02:05.640> they<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.150> float<00:02:06.890> so

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
because they hope they like to float so

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.490 
because they hope they like to float so
drowning<00:02:08.790> spiders<00:02:09.210> in<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.390> trap<00:02:09.660> was<00:02:09.899> really

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
drowning spiders in a trap was really

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.130 
drowning spiders in a trap was really
hard<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.770> do<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.190> mean<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.090> bet<00:02:12.240> you<00:02:12.360> could<00:02:12.600> but<00:02:12.900> I

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
hard to do I mean I bet you could but I

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.100 
hard to do I mean I bet you could but I
couldn't<00:02:13.950> figure<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.310> out<00:02:14.660> but<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.870> way<00:02:16.050> is

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
couldn't figure it out but this way is

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.510 
couldn't figure it out but this way is
much<00:02:16.380> better<00:02:16.710> because<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:19.140> cactus<00:02:20.100> method

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
much better because the cactus method

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.780 
much better because the cactus method
was<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.510> worked<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.950> killed<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.400> spiders

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
was it it worked it killed the spiders

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.620 
was it it worked it killed the spiders
but<00:02:24.060> most<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.810> time<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.590> string<00:02:25.920> would

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
but most of the time the string would

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.870 
but most of the time the string would
hit<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.810> cactus<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.530> then<00:02:28.710> be<00:02:28.920> destroyed<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.580> I

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
hit a cactus and then be destroyed and I

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.300 
hit a cactus and then be destroyed and I
wouldn't<00:02:30.390> gain<00:02:30.690> loot<00:02:30.990> from<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.350> this<00:02:31.830> way<00:02:32.070> I

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
wouldn't gain loot from it this way I

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.760 
wouldn't gain loot from it this way I
get<00:02:32.910> one<00:02:33.300> hundred<00:02:33.660> percent<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.320> loot<00:02:34.500> all

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
get one hundred percent of the loot all

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.910 
get one hundred percent of the loot all
the<00:02:35.130> time<00:02:35.510> loot<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.720> never<00:02:37.050> destroyed<00:02:37.290> which

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
the time loot is never destroyed which

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.400 
the time loot is never destroyed which
is<00:02:38.100> awesome<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:41.220> makes<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.730> like<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.690> much<00:02:43.170> more

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
is awesome it makes it like so much more

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.720 
is awesome it makes it like so much more
efficient<00:02:45.380> provided<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.470> can<00:02:46.650> get<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
efficient provided you can get the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.050 
efficient provided you can get the
slimeballs<00:02:48.690> needed<00:02:49.440> for<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.280> sticky<00:02:50.580> pistons

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
slimeballs needed for the sticky pistons

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.440 
slimeballs needed for the sticky pistons
but<00:02:53.720> this<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.980> very<00:02:55.980> useful<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.670> simple<00:02:56.760> to

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
but this is a very useful and simple to

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.840 
but this is a very useful and simple to
make<00:02:57.630> traffic<00:02:57.930> dead<00:02:58.709> simple<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.160> mean<00:02:59.310> I've

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
make traffic dead simple I mean I've

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640
