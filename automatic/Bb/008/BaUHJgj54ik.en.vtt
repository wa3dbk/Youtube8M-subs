better<00:01:05.580> than<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.060> Courtnay<00:01:06.630> didn't

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
better than that Courtnay didn't

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.750 
better than that Courtnay didn't
actually<00:01:07.200> initially<00:01:07.590> win<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> tour<00:01:08.369> for

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
I think that's just it's not acceptable

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.410 
I think that's just it's not acceptable
it<00:01:29.159> isn't<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.850> wouldn't<00:01:30.060> catch<00:01:30.210> me

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
it isn't is it just wouldn't catch me

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.800 
it isn't is it just wouldn't catch me

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
well that's as may be down but this is

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.760
