00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.519
 the process prior to the elaboration 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.920
 begins with the milking of the two sheep 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:11.600
 times a day in the morning and cut it 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.730
 this is done completely 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.190
 mechanized in order to ensure that the 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.050
 handling is completely hygienic and that 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.320
 the milk obtained does not contain impurities 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.020
 or strange elements 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.450
 this milk is collected to be moved 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.039
 to the late cheese factories that takes 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.020
 External out between preserving the 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.360
 milk at a constant temperature of 4 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.270
 degrees what maintains its properties and 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.220
 quality will ensure the production of 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.500
 the wedding cake starts with the 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.510
 curdled process in which the 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.309
 whey based on add to 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.559
 This is the last one obtained from the 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.470
 maceration in water of the cristinos de 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.420
 the flower of thistle cynara cardunculus 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.730
 plant popularly known as grass 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.520
 down 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.190
 Once completed this process is 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.559
 proceeds to the work cut during which 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.920
 The curd is broken into grains of the size 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.920
 wanted 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.660
 [Music] 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.490
 then it is passed to the molding that 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.950
 is to enter manually 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.170
 the grain of the curd in the molds that 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.380
 get and the almost definitive form of 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.719
 cheese 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.939
 when the molds are full it 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.280
 will make the pressing where using 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.350
 special presses will be removed the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.650
 all the serum that you can see in the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.500
 wash 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.720
 at the end of this process the case will have 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.250
 and its definitive form so it 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.620
 will pull each piece out of its mold to 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.660
 perform salting that will be done well 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.850
 spreading the salt directly on the 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.820
 cheese or by submerging it in a 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.440
 brine after the completion of these 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.780
 work starts the process of 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.520
 Maturation that takes place in cameras with 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.080
 Low temperature and high humidity 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.970
 relative 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.160
 this last professor extends to what 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.260
 over a minimum of two months period 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.540
 during which every day will be 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.010
 beaten each one of the cheeses for 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.290
 that the maturation process is 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.230
 develop correctly 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.910
 It will also be during this time when 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.250
 the wedding cakes acquire their 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.230
 feature fall shape having to 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.790
 be wrapped in some cases to 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.370
 prevent it from spilling on its contents 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.430
 creamy through that its still soft with 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.900
 land 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.269
 [Music] 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.549
 the end result is a cheese of 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.590
 semi hard shell with natural color / 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.870
 yellow and I think you can submit 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.030
 cracks in its surface 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.980
 its content is soft and its texture 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.319
 creamy gains fluidity with temperature 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.840
 but it does not have to be followed 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.940
 for the liquid of intense smell and flavor 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.430
 developed is slightly bitter 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.639
 due to the use of vegetable rennet 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.639
