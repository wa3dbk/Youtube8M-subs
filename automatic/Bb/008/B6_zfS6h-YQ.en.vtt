mountains you can see the hill is

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.780 
mountains you can see the hill is
practically<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.450> 90<00:01:06.900> degree<00:01:07.110> angle<00:01:07.790> any

practically and a 90 degree angle any
steeper<00:01:09.240> than<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.570> it'd<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> freefall

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
steeper than this it'd be a freefall

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.340 
steeper than this it'd be a freefall
come<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.860> pretty<00:01:13.860> good<00:01:14.040> distance<00:01:14.570> but<00:01:15.570> feeling

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
come a pretty good distance but feeling

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.399 
come a pretty good distance but feeling
mother<00:01:17.280> nature<00:01:17.640> telling<00:01:17.939> me<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.119> stop<00:01:18.409> but

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
mother nature telling me to stop but

that cigar a few minutes ago that

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.059 
that cigar a few minutes ago that
doesn't<00:02:32.060> help<00:02:32.120> at<00:02:32.299> all<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.840> forget<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.380> I'm

past the halfway mark definitely but of

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.090 
past the halfway mark definitely but of
course<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:37.700> hardest<00:02:37.970> part

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
course the hardest part

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.900 
course the hardest part
it's<00:02:39.520> now<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.790> come<00:02:40.000> as<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:41.170> can<00:02:41.290> see<00:02:41.530> right

summit now had a stroke of luck in that

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.610 
summit now had a stroke of luck in that
there's<00:03:13.060> some<00:03:13.300> natural<00:03:13.480> grooves<00:03:13.960> formed<00:03:14.380> in

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
there's some natural grooves formed in

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
the cliff face possibly due to wind or

the cliff face possibly due to wind or
water<00:03:18.250> erosion<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:19.330> allowed<00:03:19.990> me<00:03:20.020> to<00:03:20.200> get<00:03:20.320> a

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
water erosion that allowed me to get a

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.740 
water erosion that allowed me to get a
foothold<00:03:20.770> and<00:03:21.160> each<00:03:21.850> step<00:03:22.060> counts<00:03:22.540> at<00:03:22.630> this

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
foothold and each step counts at this

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.470 
foothold and each step counts at this
point<00:03:23.020> I<00:03:23.230> don't<00:03:23.920> know<00:03:24.010> if<00:03:24.100> you<00:03:24.160> can<00:03:24.280> see<00:03:24.520> behind
