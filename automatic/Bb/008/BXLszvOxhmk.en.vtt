I<00:00:54.160> don't<00:00:54.340> really<00:00:54.460> think<00:00:54.550> that<00:00:54.730> anything<00:00:55.060> else

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
I don't really think that anything else

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.790 
I don't really think that anything else
compares<00:00:55.630> but<00:00:55.960> if<00:00:56.110> you<00:00:56.200> know<00:00:56.320> something<00:00:56.650> that

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
compares but if you know something that

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.490 
compares but if you know something that
you<00:00:57.010> know<00:00:57.220> works<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.870> you<00:00:58.990> and<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.230> know<00:00:59.380> how

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
you know works for you and you know how

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.590 
you know works for you and you know how
to<00:00:59.560> handle<00:00:59.770> it<00:01:00.100> by<00:01:00.670> all<00:01:00.850> means<00:01:00.880> go<00:01:01.330> with<00:01:01.480> that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
to handle it by all means go with that

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.390

if you get clumps of it then certain

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.080 
if you get clumps of it then certain
parts<00:02:09.710> of<00:02:09.830> your<00:02:10.070> baked<00:02:10.250> goods<00:02:10.580> are<00:02:10.790> going<00:02:11.000> to

parts of your baked goods are going to

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.730 
parts of your baked goods are going to
rise<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.360> others<00:02:11.960> are<00:02:12.110> gonna<00:02:12.200> fall<00:02:12.440> flat<00:02:12.680> and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
rise and others are gonna fall flat and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.350 
rise and others are gonna fall flat and
it's<00:02:13.100> just<00:02:13.250> not<00:02:14.260> good<00:02:15.290> okay<00:02:16.100> now<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.180> butter

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
it's just not good okay now the butter

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.650 
it's just not good okay now the butter
the<00:02:17.990> butter<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.290> kind<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.590> big<00:02:18.740> deal<00:02:19.010> um<00:02:19.660> the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
the butter is kind of a big deal um the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.510 
the butter is kind of a big deal um the
way<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:20.810> described<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.440> my<00:02:21.470> book<00:02:21.710> is<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.220> they

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
way I described in my book is that they

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.490 
way I described in my book is that they
should<00:02:22.730> be<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.660> should<00:02:23.840> be<00:02:23.930> a<00:02:23.960> smaller<00:02:24.260> dice

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
should be it should be a smaller dice

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.170 
should be it should be a smaller dice
but<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.100> about<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.310> size<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:25.850> like

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
but this is about the size that I like

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.720 
but this is about the size that I like
to<00:02:26.300> make<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.600> these<00:02:26.780> days

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
to make it these days

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.830 
to make it these days
so<00:02:28.730> I'm<00:02:28.790> gonna<00:02:28.910> put<00:02:29.150> in<00:02:29.240> this<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.540> ten

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
so I'm gonna put in this is ten

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.690 
so I'm gonna put in this is ten
tablespoons<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.890> unsalted<00:02:31.490> so<00:02:32.090> here<00:02:32.240> we<00:02:32.330> go

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
tablespoons of unsalted so here we go

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.740 
tablespoons of unsalted so here we go
I'm<00:02:34.700> just<00:02:34.760> I'm<00:02:35.480> really<00:02:35.660> just<00:02:36.310> pulsing<00:02:37.310> in<00:02:37.750> okay

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
so the flap the butter is linear but

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.699 
so the flap the butter is linear but
they're<00:02:40.850> pretty<00:02:41.120> big<00:02:41.270> pieces<00:02:41.510> see<00:02:42.320> they're

the<00:04:39.499> thickness<00:04:39.709> of<00:04:39.979> a<00:04:40.099> nickel<00:04:40.129> which<00:04:40.729> is<00:04:40.759> about

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:40.969 
the thickness of a nickel which is about

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:42.100 
the thickness of a nickel which is about
an<00:04:41.119> eighth<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.479> an<00:04:41.599> inch

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
an eighth of an inch

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.540 
an eighth of an inch
you<00:04:42.559> really<00:04:42.830> don't<00:04:42.949> want<00:04:43.069> to<00:04:43.129> roll<00:04:43.249> it<00:04:43.369> you

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
you really don't want to roll it you

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.449 
you really don't want to roll it you
thin<00:04:43.789> because<00:04:44.149> it'll<00:04:44.330> burn<00:04:44.419> and<00:04:45.169> I'd<00:04:46.129> rather

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:46.459 
thin because it'll burn and I'd rather

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:47.799 
thin because it'll burn and I'd rather
err<00:04:46.759> on<00:04:46.789> the<00:04:46.909> side<00:04:47.119> of<00:04:47.179> being<00:04:47.539> a<00:04:47.629> little<00:04:47.719> bit

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:47.809 
err on the side of being a little bit

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:49.929 
err on the side of being a little bit
kick<00:04:48.139> gonna<00:04:48.469> be<00:04:48.619> moving<00:04:49.039> now<00:04:49.429> you<00:04:49.489> can<00:04:49.729> see

00:04:49.929 --> 00:04:49.939 
kick gonna be moving now you can see

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:51.759 
kick gonna be moving now you can see
it's<00:04:50.300> started<00:04:50.569> to<00:04:50.599> stick<00:04:51.050> just<00:04:51.259> a<00:04:51.409> little<00:04:51.649> bit

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:51.769 
it's started to stick just a little bit

00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:54.309 
it's started to stick just a little bit
so<00:04:52.489> what<00:04:52.610> I<00:04:52.639> do<00:04:52.759> is<00:04:53.029> I<00:04:53.239> roll<00:04:53.629> this<00:04:53.779> back<00:04:53.989> and<00:04:54.229> I

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 
so what I do is I roll this back and I

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.989 
so what I do is I roll this back and I
sort<00:04:54.529> of<00:04:54.589> make<00:04:54.860> sure<00:04:54.889> I<00:04:55.189> just<00:04:55.219> Pat<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.639> down<00:04:55.759> as

00:04:55.989 --> 00:04:55.999 
sort of make sure I just Pat it down as

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:58.389 
sort of make sure I just Pat it down as
I'm<00:04:56.149> pulling<00:04:56.719> it<00:04:56.839> back<00:04:56.989> round<00:04:57.319> to<00:04:57.739> make<00:04:58.249> sure

00:04:58.389 --> 00:04:58.399 
I'm pulling it back round to make sure

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:01.689 
I'm pulling it back round to make sure
that<00:04:59.389> it<00:04:59.509> doesn't<00:04:59.659> cool<00:05:00.249> so<00:05:01.249> you<00:05:01.309> can<00:05:01.459> see<00:05:01.610> it's

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
that it doesn't cool so you can see it's

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.699 
that it doesn't cool so you can see it's
coming<00:05:01.849> together<00:05:01.999> if<00:05:02.989> something<00:05:03.259> gets<00:05:03.379> too

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:03.709 
coming together if something gets too

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:06.549 
coming together if something gets too
thin<00:05:03.979> I<00:05:04.309> often<00:05:05.089> will<00:05:05.209> feel<00:05:05.569> around<00:05:06.019> to<00:05:06.259> see<00:05:06.439> the

00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:06.559 
thin I often will feel around to see the

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:08.019 
thin I often will feel around to see the
thickness<00:05:06.800> I<00:05:07.129> can<00:05:07.369> feel<00:05:07.550> that<00:05:07.699> it's<00:05:07.849> a<00:05:07.879> little

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:08.029 
thickness I can feel that it's a little

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:19.649 
thickness I can feel that it's a little
bit<00:05:08.149> thick<00:05:08.449> over<00:05:08.719> here<00:05:08.959> it's<00:05:09.169> a<00:05:09.229> little<00:05:09.439> bit

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.749 

just<00:05:20.659> roll<00:05:20.929> it<00:05:21.139> just<00:05:21.409> folds<00:05:21.649> it<00:05:21.830> in<00:05:21.979> all<00:05:22.729> right

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:26.959 
it that's about the thickness that you

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
that there's a uniform thickness and you

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:31.809 
that there's a uniform thickness and you
can<00:05:31.129> always<00:05:31.249> correct

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:31.819
