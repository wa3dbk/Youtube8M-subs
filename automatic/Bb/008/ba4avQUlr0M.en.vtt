00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.820
 you build a gallery with the 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.649
 home 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.840
 information on the architects who 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.129
 have made these projects and 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.840
 this on the internet 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.329
 I think it's of the utmost importance for 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.480
 all of us and this is the way you are 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.000
 entering the project for several items is 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.290
 the typology of the materials is 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.180
 Sensational I think it's an idea 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.230
 brilliant and consult marketing is 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.390
 congratulations 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.280
 now it comes at a good time comes from 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.930
 highly structured way 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.449
 graphic quality 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.539
 huge amount of resources 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.759
 also enormous computation is to disclose 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:10.880
 and you are proposing to 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.369
 and is part of this new vision. 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.070
 We are here at the congress and I should 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.440
 to say is innovating 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.679
 you are also innovating along with the 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.679
 congress 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.670
 calls the initiative very important will 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.270
 foster the productive chain 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.720
 when you somehow manage to 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.149
 illustrate show public projects 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.570
 excellent quality gives you access to 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.940
 everyone and where a construction company and 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.850
 the supplier will be able to 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.369
 view all the offices in a 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.390
 single site looks I found an initiative 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.459
 fantastic nasr is really something that goes 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.550
 contribute a lot because this connection 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.230
 between suppliers and us who are 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.090
 project developers 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.880
 it is fundamental to the success of a 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.340
 project and it does not exist until then it 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.310
 professional manner of placing the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.480
 architecture and exercise and communication 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.400
 between all on the same level of 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.459
 interactivity and dynamism that all 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.650
 digital media today are enabling the 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.110
 the human being to connect in what 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.250
 plays extremely interesting can be 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.380
 very productive 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.269
 that is to say a mandate ahead of 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.730
 offices evolving to make us 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.590
 we are living in a globalized world already 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.880
 long ago and we are the seven were 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.350
 isolated there was no need to come and 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.090
 will certainly come other instruments of 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.709
 Yes and they will make those who 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.190
 office can have this interaction 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.110
 direct and the benesses but berg brazil 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.700
 lord of effectively for all 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.410
 architects who are assembled and who 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.040
 represents the regular architecture in 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.549
 Brazil sure I think of the new unit 600 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.549
 congratulations 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:30.340
 how to hear an architect and a video 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.950
 complemented by explaining the process of 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.439
 I think it's extremely important. 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.030
 it's important to protect colleagues 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.400
 important for example 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.499
 be broadcast at university 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.930
 architecture college the student see 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:45.700
 What do you think? 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.889
 everything to do with what is the reality of 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.359
 Brazilian architecture also leaves 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.430
 to pass on the creativity of the 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.949
 offices is the office environment 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.959
 is being portrayed is the architect stands 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.599
 at ease to explain his work this 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.459
 which I found quite interesting 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.780
 Fantastic wonderful, I think today 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.560
 the Internet 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.090
 She's much closer today to 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.819
 content for videos and I think this 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.299
 gallery will really be a great 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.489
 opportunity for architects to put the 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.039
 their ideas and can create a 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.509
 discussion on the Internet about 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.539
 architecture issue 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:25.050
 for us this initiative of 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:28.770
 you are very welcome and we will 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.770
 collaborate and we will use 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.570
 I have always supported from the beginning from the 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.090
 first presentation and idea later 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.310
 nardelli no doubt this thing of being 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.820
 in this information network 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.680
 even now they say that 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.240
 product this thing to close this cycle 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.950
 if you can enter the gallery 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.500
 locate the project see with serenity 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.870
 alive punishing he put the training 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.870
 interesting that they do not have time to 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.160
 look for the senai sp that material 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.160
 one pass for example 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:35.560
 find interesting gallery i saw one 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.490
 design quality presentation in the 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.960
 Format 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.150
 I think nationally we did not have 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.560
 a platform as well as language 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.560
 beautiful and elegant 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.980
 and now doctors are working is 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.800
 always a very good thing because the 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.840
 architect communicates through men 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.169
 right architecture has a differential 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.350
 interesting that is the following is everything has 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.750
 meaning 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.590
 I see it as a very 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.990
 interesting of us to create a goal 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.449
 qualified to be able to communicate and 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.580
 understand what that architecture 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.750
 is producing 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.210
 representing 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.690
 I found that you are doing with the 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.669
 people 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.360
 A lot of people had already thought to do 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.360
 that did not
