00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
to say that I'm struggling to come to

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.080 
to say that I'm struggling to come to
terms<00:02:13.380> with<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.920> placement<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.910> it's<00:02:15.030> a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
terms with the placement and it's a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.580 
terms with the placement and it's a
fundamental<00:02:15.660> issue<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:16.019> I<00:02:16.079> also<00:02:16.260> have<00:02:16.500> with

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
fundamental issue that I also have with

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.620 
fundamental issue that I also have with
the<00:02:16.709> countryman<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.459> let's<00:02:17.640> be<00:02:17.700> honest<00:02:18.120> this

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
the countryman and let's be honest this

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.500 
the countryman and let's be honest this
is<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.840> countryman<00:02:19.350> with<00:02:19.530> two<00:02:19.709> less<00:02:19.920> dollars

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
is a countryman with two less dollars

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.140 
is a countryman with two less dollars
the<00:02:21.510> bigger<00:02:21.840> taller<00:02:22.350> heavier<00:02:22.829> body<00:02:23.310> just

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
the bigger taller heavier body just

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.270 
the bigger taller heavier body just
undermines<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.810> dynamics<00:02:25.320> that<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.530> enjoy<00:02:25.739> so

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
undermines the dynamics that I enjoy so

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.699 
undermines the dynamics that I enjoy so
much<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.820> other<00:02:27.000> minis<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.470> higher

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
much in other minis and the higher

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.949 
much in other minis and the higher
driving<00:02:29.220> position<00:02:29.489> just<00:02:30.269> undermines<00:02:30.720> my

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
driving position just undermines my

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.039 
driving position just undermines my
perception<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.680> those<00:02:31.859> dynamics<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:33.049> guess

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
perception of those dynamics I guess

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.750 
perception of those dynamics I guess
that's<00:02:34.290> what<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.560> give<00:02:34.739> up<00:02:34.920> for<00:02:35.579> a<00:02:35.640> little

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
that's what you give up for a little

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.599 
that's what you give up for a little
more<00:02:35.940> space<00:02:36.769> look<00:02:37.769> for<00:02:38.010> what<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
more space look for what it is the

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.160 
more space look for what it is the
placement<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.180> competent<00:02:39.690> car<00:02:39.900> with<00:02:40.140> a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
placement is a competent car with a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.840 
placement is a competent car with a
generous<00:02:40.799> dose<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.190> mini<00:02:41.400> cheek<00:02:41.700> and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
generous dose of mini cheek and

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.759 
generous dose of mini cheek and
quirkiness<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.570> like<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.989> about<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.440> what

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
quirkiness and I like that about it what

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.009 
quirkiness and I like that about it what
I<00:02:43.799> don't<00:02:44.130> like<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.640> mini<00:02:45.030> Australia<00:02:45.840> is

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
I don't like is that mini Australia is

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.289 
I don't like is that mini Australia is
going<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.500> charge<00:02:46.859> more<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.819> two-door

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
going to charge more for the two-door

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.539 
going to charge more for the two-door
than<00:02:49.079> for<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.440> four-door<00:02:49.890> countryman<00:02:50.430> and

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
than for the four-door countryman and

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.699 
than for the four-door countryman and
that<00:02:51.209> just<00:02:51.540> doesn't<00:02:51.780> make<00:02:52.079> sense<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.560> doesn't

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
that just doesn't make sense it doesn't

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.860 
that just doesn't make sense it doesn't
sit<00:02:53.069> well<00:02:53.100> with<00:02:53.280> me<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.880> guess<00:02:54.450> we'll<00:02:54.600> get<00:02:54.750> to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
sit well with me I guess we'll get to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.349 
sit well with me I guess we'll get to
see<00:02:55.049> in<00:02:55.230> March<00:02:55.470> 2013<00:02:56.190> when<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.459> arrives<00:02:56.819> how

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
see in March 2013 when it arrives how

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.129 
see in March 2013 when it arrives how
that<00:02:57.420> sits<00:02:57.810> with<00:02:58.019> consumers<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.989> real

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
that sits with consumers so the real

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.809 
that sits with consumers so the real
question<00:03:01.170> with<00:03:01.859> the<00:03:01.889> mini<00:03:02.130> paceman<00:03:02.430> is

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
question with the mini paceman is

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.280 
question with the mini paceman is
whether<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.269> lives<00:03:03.480> up<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.690> consumer

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
whether it lives up to consumer

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.309 
whether it lives up to consumer
expectations<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.760> many<00:03:05.970> brands<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:06.690> yes

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
expectations of the many brands and yes

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.920 
expectations of the many brands and yes
it<00:03:07.620> mostly<00:03:07.980> does<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:09.120> there's<00:03:09.299> no<00:03:09.480> denying

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
it mostly does but there's no denying

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.899 
it mostly does but there's no denying
that<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.650> do<00:03:10.860> lose<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> little<00:03:11.519> bit<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:11.760> that

that you do lose a little bit of that
