punctuated with a lot of bass runs so
it's<00:00:23.869> got<00:00:24.020> a<00:00:24.050> real<00:00:24.700> bouncy<00:00:25.810> lope<00:00:26.810> to<00:00:27.110> it<00:00:27.259> and<00:00:27.470> if

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
it's got a real bouncy lope to it and if

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.159 
it's got a real bouncy lope to it and if
he<00:00:28.520> was<00:00:28.669> playing<00:00:28.849> out<00:00:29.090> of<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:29.390> key<00:00:29.599> of<00:00:29.720> C<00:00:29.930> out

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
he was playing out of the key of C out

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.690 
he was playing out of the key of C out
of<00:00:30.470> a<00:00:30.529> c-shape<00:00:30.980> he<00:00:31.130> might<00:00:31.279> play<00:00:31.460> something

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
of a c-shape he might play something

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:57.479 
of a c-shape he might play something
like<00:00:31.849> this

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.400 

so<00:00:58.489> to<00:00:58.550> get<00:00:59.090> all<00:00:59.150> those<00:00:59.450> strong<00:00:59.840> together<00:01:00.020> you

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
so to get all those strong together you

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.290 
so to get all those strong together you
kind<00:01:00.650> of<00:01:00.710> have<00:01:00.860> to<00:01:00.980> sit<00:01:01.190> down<00:01:01.220> and<00:01:01.430> experiment

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
kind of have to sit down and experiment

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.219 
kind of have to sit down and experiment
with<00:01:02.980> basic<00:01:03.980> chord<00:01:04.220> shapes<00:01:04.550> the<00:01:05.360> scale

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.600 

of<00:01:09.320> that<00:01:10.189> cord<00:01:10.580> connecting<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:13.040> scales<00:01:13.400> to

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
of that cord connecting the scales to

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.550 
of that cord connecting the scales to
the<00:01:13.820> other<00:01:14.119> cords<00:01:14.570> that<00:01:14.750> belong<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.049> that<00:01:15.290> key

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
the other cords that belong in that key

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.859 
the other cords that belong in that key
so<00:01:15.799> we've<00:01:15.950> got<00:01:16.159> an<00:01:16.310> F<00:01:16.640> chord<00:01:16.670> we've<00:01:17.360> got<00:01:17.540> a<00:01:17.570> G

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
so we've got an F chord we've got a G

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.560 
so we've got an F chord we've got a G
chord<00:01:18.850> going<00:01:19.850> from<00:01:20.149> a<00:01:20.240> G<00:01:20.509> back<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:20.930> a<00:01:20.960> C

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.490 

we're<00:01:24.110> just<00:01:24.260> climbing<00:01:24.530> up<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:24.980> scale<00:01:27.160> G<00:01:28.450> ABC

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
we're just climbing up the scale G ABC

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.649 
we're just climbing up the scale G ABC
and<00:01:30.500> then<00:01:30.650> we're<00:01:30.800> gonna<00:01:30.890> go<00:01:31.130> back<00:01:31.160> down

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.109 

and<00:01:35.530> he<00:01:35.770> would<00:01:35.950> swing<00:01:36.280> those<00:01:36.520> lines<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:37.000> little

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
and he would swing those lines a little

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:46.340 
and he would swing those lines a little
bit

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.630 

throwing<00:01:47.350> in<00:01:47.470> little<00:01:47.740> flourishes<00:01:48.250> like<00:01:48.430> that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
throwing in little flourishes like that

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.730 
throwing in little flourishes like that
that<00:01:48.880> might<00:01:49.090> extend<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.690> cord<00:01:49.930> from<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.260> basic

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
that might extend the cord from a basic

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.100 
that might extend the cord from a basic
triad<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.520> seventh<00:01:52.330> chord

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.040 

and<00:01:56.110> so<00:01:56.770> those<00:01:57.280> are<00:01:57.310> some<00:01:57.760> ideas<00:01:58.210> to<00:01:58.870> get<00:01:58.990> you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
and so those are some ideas to get you

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.350 
and so those are some ideas to get you
started<00:01:59.530> on<00:01:59.770> playing<00:02:00.640> guitar<00:02:01.000> like<00:02:01.210> the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
started on playing guitar like the

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.770 
started on playing guitar like the
singing<00:02:01.750> brakeman<00:02:01.960> Jimmy<00:02:02.530> Rogers
