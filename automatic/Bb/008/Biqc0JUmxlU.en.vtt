00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.480
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.110
 secret and we are in a new news 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.439
 that will bring controversy attentive because 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.529
 According to electronic arts nobody plays 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:23.820
 modes stories in attentive games 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.279
 because he has been peter moore ceo himself 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.980
 from the editor which has done this 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.590
 affirmation in an extensive interview 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.899
 about her and her upcoming games 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.700
 to the question of you and the rest of the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.180
 group of executives from it 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.700
 Well, they should not kick 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.750
 for not including a single player campaign 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.760
 in battlefront answered the following 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.090
 you never hit for these things you take a 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.290
 decision years ago and plan how 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.840
 will be the world when the game is 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.610
 distribute within two or three years it 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.670
 it's about the producer's intuition 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.890
 executive and his vision about the game to 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.860
 the claim that triple-a games 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.660
 with singles single player 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.920
 they are traditionally sold as best 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.009
 way that those who have 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.229
 multiplayer very responds the following 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.470
 there are two phenomena with this 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.690
 affirmation the first one is that if you could 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.240
 be right the second is that 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.090
 currently very few people are playing 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.890
 the single player in this type of games 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:33.130
 that's where the data obtained points 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.170
 the reason why the missions mode 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.040
 of battlefront will come to replace the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.980
 traditional campaign the big question what 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.740
 you think about all this you think that 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.960
 it's enough reason why star 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.790
 wars battlefront will not have history mode 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.330
 Would you like us to have history that 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.800
 is the big question and if you think that 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.930
 good nobody plays games stories 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.810
 of the games that where there is a section 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.910
 multiplayer so to speak I do not know 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.470
 comment I want to know your opinion 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.130
 about 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.510
 mine I honestly do to myself 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.170
 they like the stories modes is more 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.090
 I enjoy or could even enjoy more 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.240
 the games that have no mode 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.960
 multiplayer games like for example 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:26.530
 skyrim the saga fallout although you have to 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.330
 add that to this fashion story of these 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.250
 types of games and what would be is that is 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.280
 depends on the type of game because this 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.940
 type of games add a multiplayer 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.130
 cooperative where an open world is 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.260
 you can add serious people 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.790
 the host with onion under my point 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.590
 I want to know your opinion 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.600

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.380
 lx favorite share and see you in the 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.380
