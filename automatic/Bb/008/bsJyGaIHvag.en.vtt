recorded<00:00:33.559> it<00:00:33.649> for<00:00:33.859> me<00:00:34.010> but<00:00:34.699> the<00:00:35.449> sound<00:00:35.960> wasn't

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:36.589 
recorded it for me but the sound wasn't

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:38.559 
recorded it for me but the sound wasn't
there<00:00:36.769> for<00:00:37.069> some<00:00:37.249> reason<00:00:37.640> he<00:00:37.760> didn't<00:00:38.059> know<00:00:38.210> how

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:38.569 
there for some reason he didn't know how

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:43.090 
there for some reason he didn't know how
to<00:00:38.949> get<00:00:39.949> the<00:00:40.129> sound<00:00:40.399> to<00:00:41.469> do<00:00:42.469> whatever<00:00:42.649> it<00:00:42.949> had

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
to get the sound to do whatever it had

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.799 
to get the sound to do whatever it had
to<00:00:43.249> do<00:00:43.399> so<00:00:43.609> it's<00:00:43.819> basically<00:00:44.210> a<00:00:44.329> video<00:00:44.629> with<00:00:44.780> no

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
to do so it's basically a video with no

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.419 
to do so it's basically a video with no
sound<00:00:45.199> so<00:00:45.379> it<00:00:45.469> doesn't<00:00:45.710> make<00:00:45.769> any<00:00:45.920> sense

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429 
sound so it doesn't make any sense

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.950 
sound so it doesn't make any sense
so<00:00:46.879> I<00:00:47.329> do<00:00:47.719> have<00:00:48.109> quite<00:00:48.319> a<00:00:48.379> few<00:00:48.440> pictures<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:49.339> I
