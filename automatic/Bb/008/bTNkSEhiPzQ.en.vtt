00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
this to be a background flavor so the

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.200 
this to be a background flavor so the
garlic<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.809> thyme<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:49.830> sort<00:00:50.040> of<00:00:50.210> come

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
garlic and the thyme can sort of come

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.119 
garlic and the thyme can sort of come
out<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.600> their<00:00:51.750> flavors<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.979> sort

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
out with their flavors and really sort

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.460

of<00:00:53.190> infuse<00:00:53.640> into<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> tomatoes<00:00:54.479> give<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.440> a

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
of infuse into the tomatoes give that a

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.380 
of infuse into the tomatoes give that a
good<00:00:55.680> stir<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.370> everything<00:00:56.400> mixes<00:00:57.059> together

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
good stir so everything mixes together

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.079

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
and we'll just set that aside next we've

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.570 
and we'll just set that aside next we've
got<00:01:00.120> our<00:01:00.269> tomatoes<00:01:00.989> I'm<00:01:01.320> using<00:01:01.589> 8<00:01:01.949> Tomatoes
