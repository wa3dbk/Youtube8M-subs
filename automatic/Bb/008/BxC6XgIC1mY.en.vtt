00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.660 
with biceps I don't know halfway for the
bottom<00:04:45.600> up<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:46.050> other<00:04:46.170> half<00:04:46.230> from<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:47.100> top<00:04:47.340> to

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
bottom up the other half from the top to

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.070 
bottom up the other half from the top to
the<00:04:47.700> path<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.630> then<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.830> last<00:04:50.040> set<00:04:50.340> of<00:04:50.370> seven

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
the path and then the last set of seven

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.310 
the path and then the last set of seven
is<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.140> full<00:04:52.800> range<00:04:53.040> of<00:04:53.190> motion<00:04:53.340> so<00:04:54.330> for<00:04:55.140> all

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
is the full range of motion so for all

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.930 
is the full range of motion so for all
of<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.560> mathematicians<00:04:56.310> out<00:04:56.430> there<00:04:56.670> that's

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
of you mathematicians out there that's

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.430 
of you mathematicians out there that's
where<00:04:57.120> we<00:04:57.150> get<00:04:57.300> 21<00:04:57.630> from<00:04:57.870> because<00:04:58.050> it's<00:04:58.200> seven

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
where we get 21 from because it's seven

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.260 
where we get 21 from because it's seven
seven<00:04:58.950> seven<00:04:59.130> so<00:04:59.520> it's<00:04:59.640> seven<00:04:59.880> times<00:05:00.000> three

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
seven seven so it's seven times three

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.470 
seven seven so it's seven times three
but<00:05:00.450> what<00:05:00.660> there<00:05:01.290> you<00:05:01.320> go<00:05:01.560> do<00:05:02.430> it<00:05:02.610> you<00:05:03.240> guys<00:05:03.360> are

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
but what there you go do it you guys are
