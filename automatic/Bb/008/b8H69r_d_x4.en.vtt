hi<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:02.129> Steve<00:00:02.490> from<00:00:02.520> 21:12<00:00:03.360> design<00:00:03.720> and<00:00:03.959> I

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
hi this is Steve from 21:12 design and I

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.960 
hi this is Steve from 21:12 design and I
want<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.589> show<00:00:04.799> you<00:00:04.859> my<00:00:05.130> homemade<00:00:05.609> flight

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
want to show you my homemade flight

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.140 
want to show you my homemade flight
pedals<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.980> first<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.099> get<00:00:08.250> rid<00:00:08.460> about<00:00:08.730> half<00:00:09.000> a

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
pedals I first to get rid about half a

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.680 
pedals I first to get rid about half a
day<00:00:10.280> really<00:00:11.280> was<00:00:11.460> about<00:00:11.550> day<00:00:11.910> but<00:00:12.210> half<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.540> day

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
day really was about day but half a day

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.780 
day really was about day but half a day
was<00:00:12.870> spent<00:00:13.139> with<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.410> wrong<00:00:13.650> design<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.700> is

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
was spent with a wrong design so this is

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.599 
was spent with a wrong design so this is
a<00:00:14.849> very<00:00:15.059> simple<00:00:15.450> design<00:00:16.190> and<00:00:17.190> I'm<00:00:17.400> going<00:00:17.550> to

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
a very simple design and I'm going to

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.640 
a very simple design and I'm going to
show<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.820> how<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.180> works<00:00:18.359> right<00:00:18.690> now<00:00:19.080> how<00:00:19.590> to

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
show you how it works right now how to

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.300 
show you how it works right now how to
build<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.300> now<00:00:21.830> unlike<00:00:22.830> some<00:00:23.100> more

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
build it now unlike some more

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.370 
build it now unlike some more
complicated<00:00:23.670> mechanical<00:00:24.240> systems<00:00:25.140> you're

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
complicated mechanical systems you're

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.550 
complicated mechanical systems you're
going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.590> see<00:00:25.830> our<00:00:25.980> II<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:27.199> YouTube<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.380> one

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
going to see our II on YouTube this one

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.990 
going to see our II on YouTube this one
is<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> simplicity<00:00:29.189> itself

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
is the simplicity itself

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.229 
is the simplicity itself
it's<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.330> simple<00:00:31.189> one<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:33.469> swivel<00:00:34.469> point<00:00:34.800> here

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
it's a simple one one swivel point here

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.180 
it's a simple one one swivel point here
and<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.300> swivel<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.050> made<00:00:37.320> from<00:00:40.160> like<00:00:41.160> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
and that swivel is made from like a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.610 
and that swivel is made from like a
wheel<00:00:41.730> which<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.510> used<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> sliding<00:00:43.440> gate

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
wheel which is used on the sliding gate

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.889 
wheel which is used on the sliding gate
and<00:00:44.070> has<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> nice<00:00:44.670> bearing<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.329> there<00:00:45.480> so

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
and has a nice bearing in there so

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.330 
and has a nice bearing in there so
anything<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.469> provides<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:47.039> with<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
anything that provides you with a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.420 
anything that provides you with a
horizontal<00:00:48.350> bearing<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.770> what<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.920> did<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.309> I

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
horizontal bearing and what I did is I

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.150 
horizontal bearing and what I did is I
drilled<00:00:50.760> some<00:00:50.969> holes<00:00:51.000> through<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.860> then

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
drilled some holes through here and then

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.619 
drilled some holes through here and then
uh<00:00:53.280> put<00:00:53.489> some<00:00:53.520> screws<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.000> under<00:00:54.420> here

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
uh put some screws and under here

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.470 
uh put some screws and under here
there's<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.649> nice<00:00:55.800> solid<00:00:56.190> steel<00:00:56.370> ball<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
there's a nice solid steel ball so the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.430 
there's a nice solid steel ball so the
important<00:00:57.899> thing<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.350> should<00:00:58.530> be<00:00:59.210> free

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
important thing is this should be free

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.380 
important thing is this should be free
freely<00:01:01.440> able<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.070> rotate<00:01:02.250> without<00:01:02.760> any<00:01:03.120> real

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
freely able to rotate without any real

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.990 
freely able to rotate without any real
friction<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:05.100> also<00:01:05.250> should<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.760> pretty

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
friction and it also should be pretty

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700 
friction and it also should be pretty
solid<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.659> if<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.900> kind<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.170> shake<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.619> around

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
solid so if you kind of shake it around

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.830 
solid so if you kind of shake it around
it<00:01:08.100> feels<00:01:08.490> solid<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.060> doesn't<00:01:09.330> feel<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.630> it's

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
it feels solid it doesn't feel like it's

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.500 
it feels solid it doesn't feel like it's
going<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.080> fall<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.439> pieces<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:12.000> that's<00:01:12.210> pretty

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
going to fall to pieces so that's pretty

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.550 
going to fall to pieces so that's pretty
much<00:01:14.210> rotating<00:01:15.210> part<00:01:15.509> there<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.259> what<00:01:16.530> I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
much rotating part there and then what I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.390 
much rotating part there and then what I
did<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> pedals<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.299> took<00:01:18.540> some<00:01:19.400> their

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
did with the pedals is I took some their

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.510 
did with the pedals is I took some their
old<00:01:21.020> swivel<00:01:22.020> casters<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.650> had<00:01:22.830> lying<00:01:23.040> around

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
old swivel casters I had lying around

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.740 
old swivel casters I had lying around
I<00:01:23.580> cut<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> wheels<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.390> bent

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
I cut the wheels out and and then I bent

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.039 
I cut the wheels out and and then I bent
over<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.799> piece<00:01:29.100> here<00:01:29.579> where<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> wheels<00:01:30.689> go

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
over this piece here where the wheels go

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.630 
over this piece here where the wheels go
in<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.409> could<00:01:31.680> screw<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.189> there<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
in so I could screw it on there and it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.630 
in so I could screw it on there and it
gives<00:01:32.820> me<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> nice<00:01:33.180> angle<00:01:33.920> for<00:01:34.920> my<00:01:35.040> foot<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.520> it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
gives me a nice angle for my foot and it

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.480 
gives me a nice angle for my foot and it
also<00:01:35.759> gives<00:01:36.060> me<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.299> bit<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.720> swivel<00:01:37.200> there

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
also gives me a bit of a swivel there

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.480 
also gives me a bit of a swivel there
and<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.850> top<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> did<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.200> I

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
and then to top it up what I did is I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.340 
and then to top it up what I did is I
connected<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> two<00:01:41.880> foot<00:01:42.630> pedals<00:01:42.990> together

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
connected to two foot pedals together

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.730 
connected to two foot pedals together
this<00:01:43.530> piece<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.920> our<00:01:44.040> mininum<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.740> that

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
this piece of our mininum here and that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.310 
this piece of our mininum here and that
just<00:01:46.770> keeps<00:01:47.130> them<00:01:47.310> parallel<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.790> each<00:01:48.060> other

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
just keeps them parallel to each other

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.830 
just keeps them parallel to each other
probably<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.920> really<00:01:50.250> necessary<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.149> mean<00:01:51.750> you

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
probably not really necessary I mean you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.990 
probably not really necessary I mean you
might<00:01:52.259> not<00:01:52.409> be<00:01:52.590> that's<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
might not be that's it to you if you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.670 
might not be that's it to you if you
don't<00:01:54.180> have<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.509> least<00:01:54.750> incentive<00:01:55.259> swivel

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
don't have that least incentive swivel

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.190 
don't have that least incentive swivel
around<00:01:55.770> kind<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.490> uncontrollably<00:01:57.329> when<00:01:58.079> you

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
around kind of uncontrollably when you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.010 
around kind of uncontrollably when you
feet<00:01:58.439> aren't<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.890> them<00:01:59.540> but<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.689> not<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.869> big

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
feet aren't on them but it's not a big

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.610 
feet aren't on them but it's not a big
deal<00:02:01.229> okay<00:02:01.880> couple<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.939> Springs<00:02:03.270> here

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
deal okay couple of Springs here

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.150 
deal okay couple of Springs here
to<00:02:04.800> keep<00:02:05.430> some<00:02:05.700> tension<00:02:06.000> keepers

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
to keep some tension keepers

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.250 
to keep some tension keepers
automatically<00:02:08.160> self-centering

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
automatically self-centering

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.660 
automatically self-centering
probably<00:02:10.260> could<00:02:10.440> use<00:02:10.619> more<00:02:10.830> spring<00:02:11.220> here<00:02:11.460> but

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
probably could use more spring here but

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
probably could use more spring here but
it's<00:02:11.820> all<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> could<00:02:12.150> find

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
it's all I could find

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.810 
it's all I could find
I'm<00:02:12.870> probably<00:02:13.410> going<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.770> add<00:02:14.190> more<00:02:14.430> Springs

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
I'm probably going to add more Springs

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.090 
I'm probably going to add more Springs
there<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.810> then<00:02:15.990> here's<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.410> important<00:02:16.890> part

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
there and then here's the important part

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.640 
there and then here's the important part
of<00:02:17.250> cost<00:02:17.550> which<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.330> potentiometer<00:02:19.140> and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
of cost which is this potentiometer and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.280 
of cost which is this potentiometer and
this<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:19.980> how<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:21.030> position<00:02:21.240> gets<00:02:21.750> back<00:02:21.990> into

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
this is how the position gets back into

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.520 
this is how the position gets back into
the<00:02:23.060> into<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.120> computer<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.230> I'm<00:02:25.290> going<00:02:25.500> to

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
the into the computer so I'm going to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.340 
the into the computer so I'm going to
talk<00:02:25.710> about<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:27.060> electronics<00:02:27.660> now<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.230> then

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
talk about the electronics now and then

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.320 
talk about the electronics now and then
I'll<00:02:28.470> come<00:02:28.680> back<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.220> potentiometer<00:02:30.210> in

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
I'll come back to that potentiometer in

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.400 
I'll come back to that potentiometer in
a<00:02:30.420> minute<00:02:31.970> okay<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:34.340> over<00:02:35.340> here<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.730> got<00:02:36.030> on<00:02:36.210> X<00:02:36.750> 52

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
a minute okay so over here I got on X 52

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.940 
a minute okay so over here I got on X 52
so<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.680> take<00:02:37.920> X<00:02:38.100> 52<00:02:38.490> joystick<00:02:39.830> now<00:02:40.830> it's

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
so I take X 52 joystick now it's

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.810 
so I take X 52 joystick now it's
potentiometer<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:42.000> side<00:02:42.420> twist<00:02:43.350> grip<00:02:43.950> which

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
potentiometer in side twist grip which

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
potentiometer in side twist grip which
is<00:02:44.850> used<00:02:45.330> for<00:02:46.160> rudder<00:02:47.160> obviously<00:02:47.820> so<00:02:48.660> what<00:02:48.810> I

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
is used for rudder obviously so what I

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.870 
is used for rudder obviously so what I
did<00:02:48.990> is<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> brilliant<00:02:50.490> thing<00:02:50.820> about

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
did is this is a brilliant thing about

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.270 
did is this is a brilliant thing about
this<00:02:51.150> design<00:02:51.510> if<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:51.780> say<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:52.140> myself<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:52.980> just

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
this design if I say so myself is I just

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.460 
this design if I say so myself is I just
simply<00:02:53.760> use<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> potentiometers<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:55.140> there

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
simply use the potentiometers in there

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.710 
simply use the potentiometers in there
well<00:02:55.710> I<00:02:55.740> don't<00:02:56.070> use<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.580> cut<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.240> wires<00:02:57.450> to

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
well I don't use it I cut the wires to

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.860 
well I don't use it I cut the wires to
the<00:02:57.750> potentiometer<00:02:58.650> that's<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.070> here<00:02:59.870> and

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
the potentiometer that's in here and

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.540 
the potentiometer that's in here and
there's<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.260> video<00:03:01.560> on<00:03:01.680> YouTube<00:03:02.010> I'll<00:03:02.190> post<00:03:02.430> a

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
there's a video on YouTube I'll post a

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.980 
there's a video on YouTube I'll post a
link<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.910> that<00:03:02.940> shows<00:03:03.240> you<00:03:03.360> what<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.630> inside

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
link to that shows you what the inside

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.210 
link to that shows you what the inside
of<00:03:04.170> this<00:03:04.260> looks<00:03:04.560> like<00:03:04.740> and<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:06.090> just<00:03:06.180> connected

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
of this looks like and I just connected

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.970 
of this looks like and I just connected
this<00:03:08.220> stereo<00:03:09.090> cable<00:03:09.420> into<00:03:09.900> here<00:03:10.140> so<00:03:10.739> what<00:03:10.860> this

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
this stereo cable into here so what this

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.120 
this stereo cable into here so what this
cable<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.550> is<00:03:11.790> it's<00:03:12.120> an<00:03:12.660> extension<00:03:13.130> 3.5

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
cable is is it's an extension 3.5

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.460 
cable is is it's an extension 3.5
millimeter<00:03:14.580> extension<00:03:17.900> stereo<00:03:18.900> extension

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
millimeter extension stereo extension

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.170 
millimeter extension stereo extension
quartz<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.070> through<00:03:20.400> basically<00:03:21.060> a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
quartz that is through basically a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.729 
quartz that is through basically a
shield<00:03:21.450> in<00:03:21.600> two<00:03:21.810> wires<00:03:22.050> so<00:03:22.620> 3y<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.100> total<00:03:24.739> yeah

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
shield in two wires so 3y is total yeah

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.640 
shield in two wires so 3y is total yeah
and<00:03:26.959> that's<00:03:27.959> connected<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.470> the

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
and that's connected to the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.449 
and that's connected to the
potentiometer<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:31.530> then<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:32.040> potentiometer

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
potentiometer and then a potentiometer

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.390 
potentiometer and then a potentiometer
in<00:03:32.850> there's<00:03:33.030> 50<00:03:33.420> K<00:03:33.630> ohms<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.739> what<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:34.920> did<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.250> I

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
in there's 50 K ohms so what I did is I

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.400 
in there's 50 K ohms so what I did is I
went<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.670> my<00:03:35.940> electronics<00:03:36.660> shop<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.050> I<00:03:37.140> found

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
went to my electronics shop and I found

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.729 
went to my electronics shop and I found
a<00:03:37.530> bit<00:03:37.709> down<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:39.090> slight<00:03:39.600> potentiometer<00:03:40.440> which

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
a bit down a slight potentiometer which

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.160 
a bit down a slight potentiometer which
is<00:03:40.950> this<00:03:41.100> going<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.430> here<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.850> know<00:03:42.750> I've<00:03:42.989> done

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
is this going to here I know I've done

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.250 
is this going to here I know I've done
is<00:03:43.380> replaced<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.100> potentiometer<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.300> here

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
is replaced the potentiometer and here

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.590 
is replaced the potentiometer and here
with<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.280> potentiometer<00:03:47.970> down<00:03:48.180> there<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.510> it

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
with the potentiometer down there and it

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.870 
with the potentiometer down there and it
works<00:03:48.780> exactly<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.500> same<00:03:49.769> so<00:03:50.310> as<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.459> slide

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
works exactly the same so as I slide

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.520 
works exactly the same so as I slide
this<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.980> can<00:03:53.220> see

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
this you can see

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.070 
this you can see
I'm<00:03:55.160> moving<00:03:55.610> this<00:03:55.760> guy<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.660> I<00:03:56.780> got<00:03:56.930> one<00:03:57.050> of

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
I'm moving this guy and I got one of

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.930 
I'm moving this guy and I got one of
these<00:03:57.170> turnbuckle<00:03:57.890> things<00:03:58.130> on<00:03:58.310> here<00:03:58.460> so<00:03:58.700> I<00:03:58.730> got

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
these turnbuckle things on here so I got

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.980 
these turnbuckle things on here so I got
a<00:03:58.970> bit<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.270> fine<00:03:59.480> tuning<00:04:00.190> adjustment<00:04:01.190> here<00:04:01.550> I

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
a bit of fine tuning adjustment here I

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.840 
a bit of fine tuning adjustment here I
put<00:04:02.990> something<00:04:03.530> he<00:04:03.830> can<00:04:03.980> take<00:04:04.190> us<00:04:04.220> now<00:04:04.640> it's

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
put something he can take us now it's

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.630 
put something he can take us now it's
easy<00:04:05.030> enough<00:04:05.240> I<00:04:05.570> thought<00:04:06.560> it<00:04:06.710> old<00:04:06.890> what<00:04:07.250> like<00:04:07.610> a

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
easy enough I thought it old what like a

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.450 
easy enough I thought it old what like a
washing<00:04:08.030> ages<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.660> raise<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:09.080> up<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:10.280> then

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
washing ages to raise it up and then

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.330 
washing ages to raise it up and then
there's<00:04:10.670> some<00:04:10.850> holes<00:04:11.060> in<00:04:11.360> here<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:13.100> you<00:04:13.190> can

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
there's some holes in here and you can

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.740 
there's some holes in here and you can
kind<00:04:13.580> of<00:04:13.640> play<00:04:13.940> around<00:04:14.090> with<00:04:14.420> this<00:04:14.630> this

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
kind of play around with this this

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.479 
kind of play around with this this
obviously<00:04:15.260> needs<00:04:15.470> some<00:04:15.530> amount<00:04:16.130> of<00:04:16.220> clean

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
obviously needs some amount of clean

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.240 
obviously needs some amount of clean
tuning<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.959> get<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.410> full<00:04:18.650> range<00:04:18.950> of<00:04:19.190> motion

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
tuning to get the full range of motion

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.430 
tuning to get the full range of motion
so<00:04:19.850> I<00:04:20.000> got<00:04:20.239> very<00:04:20.269> much<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:20.720> full<00:04:21.049> range<00:04:21.290> of

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
so I got very much a full range of

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.800 
so I got very much a full range of
motion<00:04:21.650> here<00:04:22.130> oh<00:04:22.340> and<00:04:22.670> these<00:04:23.120> are<00:04:23.390> like<00:04:23.540> end

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
motion here oh and these are like end

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.030 
motion here oh and these are like end
stops<00:04:24.200> here<00:04:24.590> as<00:04:24.830> well<00:04:25.720> so<00:04:26.720> you<00:04:26.750> can't<00:04:27.140> you

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
stops here as well so you can't you

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.240 
stops here as well so you can't you
can't<00:04:28.280> go<00:04:28.430> too<00:04:28.490> far<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.000> break<00:04:29.390> anything<00:04:29.750> I

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
can't go too far and break anything I

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.800 
can't go too far and break anything I
see<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.790> probably<00:04:31.940> what<00:04:32.240> I<00:04:32.300> could<00:04:32.450> do<00:04:32.570> is<00:04:32.660> put

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
see and probably what I could do is put

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.010 
see and probably what I could do is put
screw<00:04:33.230> in<00:04:33.380> here<00:04:33.850> so<00:04:34.850> I<00:04:34.880> can<00:04:35.000> fine<00:04:35.450> tune<00:04:35.480> the<00:04:35.870> end

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
screw in here so I can fine tune the end

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.940 
screw in here so I can fine tune the end
stops<00:04:37.600> so<00:04:38.600> that's<00:04:38.810> pretty<00:04:39.230> much<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.710> really

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
stops so that's pretty much it really

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.240 
stops so that's pretty much it really
and<00:04:40.340> it<00:04:41.240> works<00:04:41.480> very<00:04:41.810> well<00:04:42.200> it's<00:04:42.710> very<00:04:42.890> simple

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
and it works very well it's very simple

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.760 
and it works very well it's very simple
design<00:04:43.960> because<00:04:44.960> they're<00:04:45.110> almost<00:04:45.200> not<00:04:45.470> me<00:04:45.620> to

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
design because they're almost not me to

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.840 
design because they're almost not me to
build<00:04:47.050> this<00:04:48.050> is<00:04:48.230> my<00:04:48.440> flight<00:04:49.190> chair<00:04:49.520> while<00:04:49.730> I'm

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
build this is my flight chair while I'm

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.390 
build this is my flight chair while I'm
at<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.290> I'll<00:04:51.290> show<00:04:51.470> you<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.710> whole<00:04:51.890> setup<00:04:52.160> I

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
at it I'll show you the whole setup I

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.950 
at it I'll show you the whole setup I
have<00:04:52.600> and<00:04:53.740> again<00:04:55.360> just<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.480> most<00:04:56.660> scrap

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
have and again just the most scrap

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.920 
have and again just the most scrap
plywood<00:04:57.200> to<00:04:57.620> make<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:58.040> throttle<00:04:59.000> and<00:05:01.900> when<00:05:02.900> I

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
plywood to make the throttle and when I

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.630 
plywood to make the throttle and when I
got<00:05:03.080> my<00:05:03.290> you<00:05:03.620> know<00:05:03.740> somewhat<00:05:04.100> keep<00:05:04.310> my<00:05:04.430> mouse

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
got my you know somewhat keep my mouse

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.580 
got my you know somewhat keep my mouse
over<00:05:04.880> there<00:05:05.270> and<00:05:05.540> then<00:05:05.720> I<00:05:05.810> got<00:05:05.960> my<00:05:06.140> displays

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
over there and then I got my displays

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.420 
over there and then I got my displays
over<00:05:06.950> here<00:05:07.210> so<00:05:08.210> when<00:05:09.110> I'm<00:05:09.200> running<00:05:09.380> flights<00:05:10.010> MX

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
over here so when I'm running flights MX

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.159 
over here so when I'm running flights MX
I<00:05:10.669> usually<00:05:11.090> have<00:05:11.300> my<00:05:12.310> main<00:05:13.310> display<00:05:13.700> over<00:05:13.880> here

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
I usually have my main display over here

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.800 
I usually have my main display over here
my<00:05:15.169> top<00:05:15.410> that<00:05:15.620> view<00:05:15.800> down<00:05:16.010> here<00:05:16.040> and<00:05:16.810> an

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
my top that view down here and an

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.280 
my top that view down here and an
outside<00:05:18.260> view<00:05:18.500> over<00:05:18.770> here<00:05:18.979> and<00:05:20.110> that's<00:05:21.110> my

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
outside view over here and that's my

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.130 
outside view over here and that's my
computer<00:05:21.620> over<00:05:22.010> here<00:05:22.510> so<00:05:23.510> that's<00:05:23.630> it<00:05:23.810> really

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
computer over here so that's it really

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.659 
computer over here so that's it really
I'm<00:05:24.770> not<00:05:24.919> going<00:05:25.070> to<00:05:25.130> bother<00:05:25.220> telling

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
I'm not going to bother telling

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.430 
I'm not going to bother telling
everything<00:05:25.970> I'm<00:05:26.120> showing<00:05:26.419> you<00:05:26.630> I<00:05:26.930> just<00:05:27.080> need

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
everything I'm showing you I just need

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.300 
everything I'm showing you I just need
to<00:05:27.590> give<00:05:27.770> you<00:05:28.270> overview<00:05:29.270> of<00:05:29.600> how<00:05:29.750> this<00:05:30.310> thing

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
to give you overview of how this thing

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:38.970 
to give you overview of how this thing
works<00:05:31.580> just<00:05:32.450> show<00:05:32.630> you<00:05:32.690> again

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.800 

yeah<00:05:39.980> it<00:05:40.160> needs<00:05:40.370> more<00:05:40.610> in<00:05:41.060> these<00:05:41.270> more<00:05:41.420> spring

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
yeah it needs more in these more spring

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.840 
yeah it needs more in these more spring
to<00:05:42.050> self-center<00:05:42.740> it<00:05:42.890> because<00:05:43.310> sometimes<00:05:43.520> you

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
to self-center it because sometimes you

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.020 
to self-center it because sometimes you
can<00:05:44.120> not<00:05:45.010> realize<00:05:46.010> you<00:05:46.040> you<00:05:46.520> kind<00:05:46.790> of<00:05:46.850> like

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
can not realize you you kind of like

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.630 
can not realize you you kind of like
this<00:05:47.270> and<00:05:47.510> then<00:05:48.410> the<00:05:48.620> plane<00:05:48.860> is<00:05:49.040> implying<00:05:49.400> very

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
this and then the plane is implying very

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.250 
this and then the plane is implying very
straight<00:05:50.030> and<00:05:50.180> you<00:05:50.240> don't<00:05:50.420> realize<00:05:50.570> why<00:05:50.960> knits

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
straight and you don't realize why knits

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.080 
straight and you don't realize why knits
because<00:05:51.290> you<00:05:52.160> know<00:05:52.280> centered<00:05:52.820> so<00:05:53.060> I

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
because you know centered so I

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.940 
because you know centered so I
definitely<00:05:53.600> put<00:05:53.810> some<00:05:53.990> more<00:05:54.140> Springs<00:05:54.500> on<00:05:54.710> here

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
definitely put some more Springs on here

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.950 
definitely put some more Springs on here
but<00:05:55.640> fundamentally<00:05:56.300> I'd<00:05:56.420> say<00:05:56.600> the<00:05:56.750> thing

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
but fundamentally I'd say the thing

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.330 
but fundamentally I'd say the thing
works<00:05:57.170> very<00:05:57.440> well<00:05:57.760> ok<00:05:58.790> happen<00:05:59.180> I
