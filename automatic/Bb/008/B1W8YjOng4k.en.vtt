how it to solve this play of video on it
and<00:04:39.750> take<00:04:40.050> a<00:04:40.080> little<00:04:40.440> test<00:04:41.039> on<00:04:41.400> it<00:04:41.990> I'm<00:04:42.990> going

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
and take a little test on it I'm going

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.090 
and take a little test on it I'm going
to<00:04:43.350> play<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.830> Backstreet<00:04:44.460> Boys<00:04:44.660> video<00:04:45.949> in<00:04:46.949> the
