hair in a section as you can see I've
parted<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.900> horizontal<00:00:31.470> section<00:00:31.650> along<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
parted a horizontal section along the

parted a horizontal section along the
hairline<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.880> front<00:00:33.239> that's<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.320> from

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
hairline in front that's going from

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.010 
hairline in front that's going from
right<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.010> left<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:36.120> then<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.840> that

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
right to left and then in that

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.220 
right to left and then in that
subsection<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.950> use<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> smaller<00:00:38.969> section<00:00:39.480> split

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
subsection I use a smaller section split

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.680 
subsection I use a smaller section split
in<00:00:40.379> two<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.070> put<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> afro<00:00:41.879> Marley<00:00:42.239> section

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
in two and I put the afro Marley section

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.950 
in two and I put the afro Marley section
which<00:00:42.960> comes<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.379> three<00:00:43.559> sections<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.100> hair

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
which comes in three sections of hair

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.479 
which comes in three sections of hair
over<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> color<00:00:46.649> 1b<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.399> it

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
over and it's in the color 1b so it

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.180 
over and it's in the color 1b so it
matches<00:00:47.730> my<00:00:48.059> hair<00:00:48.270> color<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.629> bit<00:00:48.960> easier<00:00:49.350> then

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
matches my hair color a bit easier then

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.700 
matches my hair color a bit easier then
what<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.550> tend<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.660> making<00:00:52.289> sure<00:00:52.590> that

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
what I tend to do is making sure that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.380 
what I tend to do is making sure that
I'm<00:00:52.829> not<00:00:52.980> accidentally<00:00:53.789> picking<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.239> any

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.010 
I'm not accidentally picking up any
other<00:00:54.510> sections<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.440> twirl<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:57.270> right-hand

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
other sections I twirl the right-hand

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.880 
other sections I twirl the right-hand
section<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.579> clockwise<00:01:00.890> clockwise

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890

section in a clockwise clockwise
direction<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:03.600> kind<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.899> make<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.890> tighter<00:01:05.280> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
direction to kind of make it tighter to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.429 
direction to kind of make it tighter to
the<00:01:05.580> root<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.119> make<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.570> afro<00:01:06.900> Marley<00:01:07.229> hair

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439

and my hair seem continuous and then the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.130 
and my hair seem continuous and then the
left-hand<00:01:12.630> section<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:14.630> making<00:01:15.630> sure<00:01:15.900> I'm<00:01:15.990> not

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
left-hand section I making sure I'm not

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.870 
left-hand section I making sure I'm not
pinging<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.560> any<00:01:16.740> accidental<00:01:17.250> strands<00:01:17.729> from

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
pinging of any accidental strands from

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.730 
pinging of any accidental strands from
the<00:01:18.060> others<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.600> also<00:01:19.290> turned<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
the others I also turned in a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.740 
the others I also turned in a
anti-clockwise<00:01:22.740> direction<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.240> basically

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
anti-clockwise direction and basically

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.070 
anti-clockwise direction and basically
this<00:01:25.020> allows<00:01:25.580> both<00:01:26.580> strands<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.509> FMR<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
this allows both strands of the FMR the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.190 
this allows both strands of the FMR the
hair<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.560> then<00:01:28.920> be<00:01:29.250> secured<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> root<00:01:30.450> once

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
hair to then be secured to the root once

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.380 
hair to then be secured to the root once
I'm<00:01:31.530> happy<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:31.979> how<00:01:32.340> secure<00:01:32.790> they<00:01:32.820> are<00:01:33.119> I

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
I'm happy with how secure they are I

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.480 
I'm happy with how secure they are I
then<00:01:33.840> start<00:01:34.170> twisting

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
then start twisting

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.760 
then start twisting
/<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.510> downwards<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.500> kind<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:39.530> left<00:01:40.530> going

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770

showing the different ways of doing it
and<00:02:19.620> I'll<00:02:19.739> put<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.130> links<00:02:20.459> below<00:02:21.269> this<00:02:22.080> video

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
and I'll put the links below this video

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.290 
and I'll put the links below this video
and<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.100> also<00:02:23.130> try<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.580> put<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> links<00:02:24.120> within

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
and I also try to put the links within

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.710 
and I also try to put the links within
the<00:02:24.480> video<00:02:25.130> right<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.580> all<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.940> do<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.510> just

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
the video right so all you do is to just

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.550 
the video right so all you do is to just
keep<00:02:27.900> adding<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.410> small<00:02:28.860> section<00:02:29.250> not<00:02:29.580> too<00:02:29.850> big

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
keep adding a small section not too big

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.360 
keep adding a small section not too big
section<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.769> hair<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.810> two<00:02:34.709> strand<00:02:35.040> twists

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
section of hair to the two strand twists

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.070 
section of hair to the two strand twists
that<00:02:35.459> you're<00:02:35.580> carrying<00:02:35.850> on<00:02:36.150> with<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.600> you

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
that you're carrying on with and you

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.800 
that you're carrying on with and you
keep<00:02:37.350> going<00:02:37.709> along<00:02:38.870> there<00:02:39.870> we<00:02:39.959> go<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:42.510> then

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
keep going along there we go and then

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.050 
keep going along there we go and then
once<00:02:43.170> I'm<00:02:43.440> pretty<00:02:43.799> close<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.430> end<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.850> maybe

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
once I'm pretty close to the end I maybe

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.930 
once I'm pretty close to the end I maybe
have<00:02:45.360> two<00:02:45.660> more<00:02:45.930> sections<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:47.130> could<00:02:47.310> add<00:02:47.489> on<00:02:47.670> I

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
have two more sections I could add on I

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.400 
have two more sections I could add on I
add<00:02:48.420> another<00:02:49.610> Marley<00:02:50.610> braid<00:02:50.910> hair<00:02:51.540> section<00:02:52.200> a

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
add another Marley braid hair section a

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.590 
add another Marley braid hair section a
thinner<00:02:52.680> one<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.640> basically<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:54.299> means

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
thinner one and basically this means

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.569 
thinner one and basically this means
that<00:02:54.870> when<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:55.079> finish<00:02:55.530> my<00:02:55.709> two<00:02:55.769> strand<00:02:56.160> twists

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
that when I finish my two strand twists

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.620 
that when I finish my two strand twists
in<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.820> next<00:02:57.120> kind<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.510> two<00:02:57.930> resolutions<00:02:58.709> and

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
in the next kind of two resolutions and

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.729 
in the next kind of two resolutions and
carry<00:03:00.630> on<00:03:00.840> down<00:03:01.140> I'll<00:03:01.440> have<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:02.549> equal<00:03:03.090> length

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
carry on down I'll have the equal length

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.229 
carry on down I'll have the equal length
to<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.190> rest<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.610> hair<00:03:05.790> that's<00:03:05.970> back<00:03:06.120> in

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
to the rest of the hair that's back in

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.050 
to the rest of the hair that's back in
the<00:03:06.360> bun<00:03:06.540> in<00:03:06.840> simple<00:03:07.620> two<00:03:07.799> strand<00:03:08.040> twists<00:03:08.430> so

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
the bun in simple two strand twists so

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.360 
the bun in simple two strand twists so
now<00:03:09.390> just<00:03:09.690> add<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.930> bit<00:03:10.170> more<00:03:10.200> hair<00:03:10.680> all<00:03:11.160> you

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
now just add a bit more hair all you

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.250 
now just add a bit more hair all you
have<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.610> do<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.820> just<00:03:12.000> drape<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.900> new

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
have to do is just drape that new

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.250 
have to do is just drape that new
section<00:03:13.709> over<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.760> two<00:03:15.030> strands<00:03:15.510> add<00:03:15.870> some

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
section over the two strands add some

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.199 
section over the two strands add some
more<00:03:16.410> hair<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.890> twist<00:03:17.250> over<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.850> downwards

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
more hair and twist over and downwards

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.569 
more hair and twist over and downwards
and<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.540> blends<00:03:18.930> itself<00:03:19.049> in<00:03:19.410> beautifully<00:03:20.190> and

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
and it blends itself in beautifully and

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.130 
and it blends itself in beautifully and
I<00:03:21.060> find<00:03:21.329> this<00:03:21.480> works<00:03:21.720> also<00:03:21.989> at<00:03:22.260> cornrowing

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
I find this works also at cornrowing

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.970 
I find this works also at cornrowing
and<00:03:24.890> then<00:03:25.780> once<00:03:26.780> you<00:03:26.960> get<00:03:27.110> to<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.380> end<00:03:27.560> just<00:03:27.830> do

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
and then once you get to the end just do

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.190 
and then once you get to the end just do
simple<00:03:28.250> two<00:03:28.640> strand<00:03:28.910> twist<00:03:29.210> twirling<00:03:29.870> and

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
simple two strand twist twirling and

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.250 
simple two strand twist twirling and
twisting<00:03:30.940> so<00:03:31.940> that<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:32.210> have<00:03:32.360> a<00:03:32.390> nice<00:03:32.600> even

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
twisting so that you have a nice even

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.550 
twisting so that you have a nice even
smooth<00:03:33.650> twist<00:03:34.190> all<00:03:34.460> the<00:03:34.520> way<00:03:34.670> down<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:36.200> takes<00:03:36.380> a

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
smooth twist all the way down it takes a

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.500 
smooth twist all the way down it takes a
bit<00:03:36.680> of<00:03:36.710> practice<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:37.370> get<00:03:37.520> flat<00:03:38.000> twisting

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
bit of practice to get flat twisting

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.210 
bit of practice to get flat twisting
with<00:03:38.690> extensions<00:03:39.290> for<00:03:39.590> drilling<00:03:39.920> of<00:03:40.040> it's

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
with extensions for drilling of it's

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.750 
with extensions for drilling of it's
benches<00:03:40.700> flat<00:03:41.240> twisting<00:03:41.840> alone<00:03:42.370> down<00:03:43.370> but

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
benches flat twisting alone down but

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.790 
benches flat twisting alone down but
when<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.180> practice<00:03:44.810> practice<00:03:45.200> practice<00:03:45.230> it

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
when you practice practice practice it

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.430 
when you practice practice practice it
will<00:03:46.010> get<00:03:46.400> nicer<00:03:47.030> in<00:03:47.150> nature<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:48.290> will

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
will get nicer in nature and it will

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.540 
will get nicer in nature and it will
look<00:03:48.620> more<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:49.010> more<00:03:49.270> even<00:03:50.270> and<00:03:50.540> realistic

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
look more and more even and realistic

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.300 
look more and more even and realistic
there<00:03:52.550> we<00:03:52.640> go<00:03:52.820> and<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:54.230> just<00:03:54.470> continue<00:03:55.040> to

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
there we go and you just continue to

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.300 
there we go and you just continue to
strand<00:03:56.270> twisting<00:03:56.630> until<00:03:56.990> you<00:03:57.140> get<00:03:57.350> maybe<00:03:57.860> two

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
strand twisting until you get maybe two

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.780 
strand twisting until you get maybe two
to<00:03:58.520> three<00:03:58.550> inches<00:03:59.000> from<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.330> end<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.640> is

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
to three inches from the end and this is

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.780 
to three inches from the end and this is
what<00:04:01.940> it<00:04:02.030> looks<00:04:02.209> like<00:04:02.390> at<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.840> end<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:03.890> you

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
what it looks like at the end and you

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.830 
what it looks like at the end and you
don't<00:04:04.970> really<00:04:05.060> have<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.330> do<00:04:05.450> anything<00:04:05.600> with

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
don't really have to do anything with

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.170 
don't really have to do anything with
the<00:04:05.959> end<00:04:06.080> you<00:04:06.230> can<00:04:06.380> dip<00:04:06.530> in<00:04:06.650> how<00:04:06.800> order<00:04:07.220> thanks

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
the end you can dip in how order thanks

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.980 
the end you can dip in how order thanks
for<00:04:08.300> watching<00:04:08.690> see<00:04:09.020> you<00:04:09.110> later<00:04:09.320> bye
