the benefits of strip telling what we

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.620 
the benefits of strip telling what we
see<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.260> perfect<00:00:25.260> seedbed<00:00:25.830> for<00:00:26.240> the<00:00:27.240> roots

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
see is a perfect seedbed for the roots

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.170 
see is a perfect seedbed for the roots
of<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> plant<00:00:29.240> with<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.480> benefits<00:00:31.140> of

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
of the plant with the benefits of

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.299 
of the plant with the benefits of
no-till<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.630> between<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.320> rows<00:00:37.010> we<00:00:38.010> think

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
no-till in between the rows we think

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.819 
no-till in between the rows we think
there<00:00:38.520> also<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.300> very<00:00:39.840> important<00:00:40.590> that

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
there also that it's very important that

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.650

the<00:01:22.660> biggest<00:01:22.840> question<00:01:23.140> probably<00:01:23.650> people<00:01:24.070> ask

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
the biggest question probably people ask

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.260 
the biggest question probably people ask
is<00:01:25.050> how<00:01:26.050> you<00:01:26.110> manage<00:01:26.590> your<00:01:26.619> residue<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:31.090> our

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
is how you manage your residue in our

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.290 
is how you manage your residue in our
case<00:01:31.540> it<00:01:31.899> starts<00:01:32.350> with<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.340> combine<00:01:33.820> and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
case it starts with the combine and

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.690 
case it starts with the combine and
that's<00:01:34.780> with<00:01:35.020> stubble<00:01:35.350> smashers<00:01:36.040> on<00:01:36.369> every

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
that's with stubble smashers on every

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.480 
that's with stubble smashers on every
row<00:01:39.780> yeah<00:01:40.780> with<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.619> stubble<00:01:41.860> smashes<00:01:42.280> on

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
row yeah with the stubble smashes on

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.359 
row yeah with the stubble smashes on
these<00:01:42.670> on<00:01:43.140> all<00:01:44.140> eight<00:01:44.530> goes<00:01:44.740> of<00:01:44.950> are<00:01:45.070> equal

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
these on all eight goes of are equal

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.840 
these on all eight goes of are equal
cornea<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.720> helps<00:01:47.440> protect<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.830> tires<00:01:48.070> but<00:01:48.759> it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
cornea it helps protect the tires but it

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.050 
cornea it helps protect the tires but it
also<00:01:48.970> lays<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.600> cornstalks<00:01:50.200> down<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.160> we

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
also lays the cornstalks down and we

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.790 
also lays the cornstalks down and we
like<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.420> cornstalks<00:01:52.869> kind<00:01:53.440> of<00:01:53.530> in<00:01:53.619> long

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
like the cornstalks kind of in long

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.050 
like the cornstalks kind of in long
pieces<00:01:54.070> so<00:01:54.790> that<00:01:54.820> they<00:01:55.119> attached<00:01:56.820> not<00:01:57.820> only<00:01:57.940> to

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
pieces so that they attached not only to

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.420 
pieces so that they attached not only to
the<00:01:58.180> ground<00:01:58.390> but<00:01:58.509> to<00:01:58.660> themselves<00:01:59.130> this<00:02:00.130> allows

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
the ground but to themselves this allows

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.510 
the ground but to themselves this allows
one<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.729> still<00:02:01.450> bar<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:02.050> go<00:02:02.200> through<00:02:02.649> it<00:02:03.250> kind

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
one to still bar to go through it kind

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.670 
one to still bar to go through it kind
of<00:02:03.580> just<00:02:03.790> nudges<00:02:04.720> them<00:02:04.840> off<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.260> side<00:02:05.470> and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
of just nudges them off to the side and

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.039 
of just nudges them off to the side and
goes<00:02:05.860> in<00:02:06.159> between<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.670> rows<00:02:06.850> so<00:02:07.210> we<00:02:07.810> get<00:02:07.930> the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
goes in between the rows so we get the

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.630 
goes in between the rows so we get the
benefit<00:02:08.470> of<00:02:10.049> not<00:02:11.049> damaging<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.650> tires<00:02:11.890> but<00:02:12.519> it

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
benefit of not damaging the tires but it

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.120 
benefit of not damaging the tires but it
also<00:02:12.790> lays<00:02:13.390> everything<00:02:13.900> down<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.620> strips

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
also lays everything down so it strips

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.750 
also lays everything down so it strips
easier<00:02:16.860> that's<00:02:17.860> what<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.070> can<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:21.310> we<00:02:21.430> have<00:02:21.580> real

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
easier that's what I can so we have real

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.630 
easier that's what I can so we have real
cleaners<00:02:22.209> on<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.690> bar<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.920> our<00:02:24.130> planter

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
cleaners on the bar and on our planter

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.520 
cleaners on the bar and on our planter
which<00:02:25.150> are<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.690> necessity<00:02:26.880> what<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.120> could<00:02:28.540> you

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
which are a necessity what I could you

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.080 
which are a necessity what I could you
know<00:02:29.560> as<00:02:29.799> the<00:02:29.890> time<00:02:30.100> goes<00:02:30.280> on<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.640> think<00:02:30.760> of

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
know as the time goes on you I think of

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.570 
know as the time goes on you I think of
one<00:02:31.269> more<00:02:31.450> thing<00:02:31.510> I'm<00:02:32.500> going<00:02:32.890> back<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.370> the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
one more thing I'm going back to the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.850 
one more thing I'm going back to the
stick<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.299> a<00:02:34.330> corner<00:02:34.660> corn<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.140> in<00:02:35.350> my<00:02:35.680> opinion

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
stick to a corner corn and in my opinion

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.729 
stick to a corner corn and in my opinion
it's<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.930> best<00:02:37.930> way<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:39.360> plant<00:02:40.360> corn<00:02:40.840> on<00:02:41.140> corn

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
it's the best way to plant corn on corn

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.180 
it's the best way to plant corn on corn
is<00:02:42.220> what's<00:02:42.519> to<00:02:42.700> tell<00:02:43.140> no<00:02:44.140> now<00:02:44.410> operation<00:02:45.040> were

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
is what's to tell no now operation were

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.370 
is what's to tell no now operation were
two-thirds<00:02:45.910> corn<00:02:46.329> and<00:02:46.510> one-third<00:02:46.810> beans<00:02:47.079> so

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
two-thirds corn and one-third beans so

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.890 
two-thirds corn and one-third beans so
that<00:02:48.190> means<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:49.799> it's<00:02:50.799> only<00:02:51.450> corn<00:02:52.450> on<00:02:52.630> corn

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
that means that it's only corn on corn

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.510 
that means that it's only corn on corn
with<00:02:53.620> stooping<00:02:53.950> corn<00:02:54.160> in<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.370> corn

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
with stooping corn in the corn

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.490 
with stooping corn in the corn
one<00:02:55.760> year<00:02:56.180> it's<00:02:56.450> not<00:02:56.690> like<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.050> second<00:02:57.410> year

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
one year it's not like the second year

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.140 
one year it's not like the second year
corn<00:02:57.740> through<00:02:58.070> your<00:02:58.220> corn<00:02:58.460> fourth<00:02:58.730> year<00:02:58.880> corn

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
corn through your corn fourth year corn

seed<00:03:12.020> bit<00:03:12.760> which<00:03:13.760> is<00:03:13.940> what<00:03:14.120> we<00:03:14.240> were<00:03:14.390> looking

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
seed bit which is what we were looking

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:24.880 
seed bit which is what we were looking
for<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:15.140> as<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.710> end<00:03:15.860> result<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:24.770> other

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
for and as the end result the other

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.670 
for and as the end result the other
point<00:03:25.220> I<00:03:25.400> think<00:03:25.460> is<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.810> concentration<00:03:27.560> on

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
point I think is the concentration on

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.420 
point I think is the concentration on
the<00:03:27.860> details<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:29.000> that's<00:03:29.750> that<00:03:30.290> when<00:03:31.220> you're

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
the details and that's that when you're

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.320 
the details and that's that when you're
planting<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.890> rows<00:03:34.160> match<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:35.000> strips

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
planting that the rows match the strips

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.600 
planting that the rows match the strips
and<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:35.720> you're<00:03:36.050> on<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.530> strips<00:03:36.860> and

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.650 

auto-steer<00:03:40.610> is<00:03:40.790> helpless<00:03:41.180> oh<00:03:41.450> yes<00:03:41.870> with<00:03:42.140> that

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
auto-steer is helpless oh yes with that

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.310 
auto-steer is helpless oh yes with that
but<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:44.900> I<00:03:45.260> think<00:03:46.480> while<00:03:47.480> strict<00:03:47.780> ales<00:03:47.990> really

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
but I I think while strict ales really

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.550 
but I I think while strict ales really
worked<00:03:48.560> for<00:03:48.860> us<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.900> I<00:03:50.900> think<00:03:51.350> there's<00:03:51.500> a

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
worked for us and I think there's a

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.140 
worked for us and I think there's a
great<00:03:51.770> benefit<00:03:52.570> benefit<00:03:53.570> tip<00:03:53.780> for<00:03:54.020> it
