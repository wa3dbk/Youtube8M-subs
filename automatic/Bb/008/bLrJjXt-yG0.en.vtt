particular<00:01:22.530> settlement<00:01:23.430> now<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.790> isn't

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
particular settlement now this isn't

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.590 
particular settlement now this isn't
complete<00:01:25.020> because<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.890> judge<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.640> still<00:01:27.390> got

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
complete because a judge and still got

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.679 
complete because a judge and still got
to<00:01:27.720> take<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> look<00:01:28.080> at<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.619> if<00:01:29.299> both<00:01:30.299> parties

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
to take a look at it but if both parties

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.810 
to take a look at it but if both parties
agree<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.409> then<00:01:31.619> most<00:01:31.979> likely<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.579> going

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
agree to it then most likely it's going

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.730 
agree to it then most likely it's going
to<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.090> okay<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:35.900> 15<00:01:36.900> million<00:01:37.200> dollars<00:01:37.560> that

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
to be okay so 15 million dollars that

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.410 
to be okay so 15 million dollars that
sounds<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> lot<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.610> money<00:01:38.759> doesn't<00:01:39.360> it

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
sounds like a lot of money doesn't it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.429 
sounds like a lot of money doesn't it
and<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.650> would<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.250> course<00:01:41.570> say<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.930> 15

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
and you would of course say that 15

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.080 
and you would of course say that 15
million<00:01:43.710> dollars<00:01:43.950> towards<00:01:44.340> something<00:01:44.790> else

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
million dollars towards something else

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.020 
million dollars towards something else
like<00:01:45.360> developing<00:01:45.990> new<00:01:46.200> games<00:01:46.500> or<00:01:47.030> anything

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
like developing new games or anything

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.030 
like developing new games or anything
else<00:01:48.240> would<00:01:48.659> probably<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> better

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
else would probably be a better

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.389 
else would probably be a better
investment<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:51.320> honestly<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.860> not<00:01:53.340> that

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
investment but honestly it's not that

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.270 
investment but honestly it's not that
bad<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.380> sony<00:01:55.649> i<00:01:55.770> would<00:01:55.950> probably

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
bad and if I was sony i would probably

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.980 
bad and if I was sony i would probably
pretty<00:01:56.700> thrilled<00:01:57.090> about<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.570> because<00:01:57.719> it's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
pretty thrilled about this because it's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.459 
pretty thrilled about this because it's
digital<00:01:58.409> goods<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:59.579> like<00:02:00.210> does<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.350> really

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
digital goods it's like does it really

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.889

cost<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.920> whole<00:02:02.040> lot<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.399> copy<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.850> paste<00:02:03.060> these

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
cost a whole lot to copy and paste these
