00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:10.050
 Application of nano -disc sealing 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:13.200
 at cars in this video I would like 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.379
 show you how to slice a nano 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.720
 sealing so that one attaches for a long time 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.130
 has fun with the help of a needle 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.660
 You can start sealing from one 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.550
 speed of about 60 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.369
 hourly kilometers completely on the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.400
 Write and renounce vision 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.500
 nevertheless a clear view the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.110
 seal is particularly suitable for 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.090
 the coming rainy months so 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.030
 was should you would not make 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.890
 What she needs is basically 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.870
 kitchen paper normal disc cleaner 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.730
 maybe some silicone remover around the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.149
 to get stubborn residues 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.289
 a vessel with water and of course the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.960
 Slice seal yourself that 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.699
 most important when applying the slices 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.520
 Sealing is a thorough 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.610
 pre-cleaning the disc easy 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.540
 with commercial disc cleaner 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:12.479
 spray and with the kitchen towel 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.330
 appropriately removed here, really 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.790
 Take care of everything 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.340
 that no more small particles on the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.210
 stick and finally as in 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.909
 to see video 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.060
 completely polished so that means 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.079
 really as long as the slice too 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.829
 Clean up the cloth after use always 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.829
 is still clean 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.050
 if you do without the disc 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.670
 to clean the correct 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.380
 Do not seal at some places 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.920
 stick and after a short time again 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.950
 depart 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.620
 You can check the cleanliness with 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.060
 Use water to get the water 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:55.210
 just pour over the glass 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.860
 can be recognized by a thin evenly 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.660
 Expiration in the movie 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.630
 that all mobile free of 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.720
 Contaminants are travels the 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.480
 Water film on can be recognized by it 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.009
 that is not quite clean yet 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.030
 should still according to some 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.680
 possibly also with silicone affair 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.530
 the application of the seal itself 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.810
 By first making the container 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.200
 with the seal opens like mine 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.110
 Small click to hear and then 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.290
 evenly if possible only once over 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.430
 the disc goes if you at some 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.120
 Make a little forget something 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.850
 has one can still go over it again 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.709
 but once it has dried something 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.860
 Do not go over it a second time because you 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.260
 here too much of the liquid 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.810
 and later work a lot with the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.280
 try it out 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.410
 so here is important and focused 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.600
 evenly if possible only once over 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.200
 to go the appropriate areas 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:01.000
 the seal can normally 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.190
 be applied between 45 degrees so 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.620
 the slice should not be warmer or 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.130
 be colder but called yourself 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.190
 temperature range are located 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.600
 after two minutes is the seal 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.370
 Dried and you can remove the residue 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.490
 try this one takes again 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.980
 simply kitchen paper and drives the 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.500
 So we're off to nothing anymore 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.030
 the seal to see it because 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.160
 Of course, it is complete for you 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.410
 otherwise you would be transparent 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.410
 problems with it and want to do well 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.160
 So here really everything 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.980
 excess slimming with kitchen paper 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.010
 and afterwards where I with again 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.680
 normal disk cleaner remove because 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.600
 the seal itself is on 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.640
 chemical basis so here you go 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.560
 No problems and nothing again 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.030
 gets down as soon as it takes two minutes 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.030
 arrived is much success
