00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
this is you don't want to be running on

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.480 
this is you don't want to be running on
slippery<00:00:02.879> floors<00:00:03.980> notice<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.069> second<00:00:05.400> one

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
slippery floors notice the second one

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.039 
slippery floors notice the second one
goes<00:00:05.640> in<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.850> exact<00:00:06.060> same<00:00:06.270> way<00:00:06.480> once<00:00:06.930> again

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
goes in the exact same way once again

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.959 
goes in the exact same way once again
with<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.350> twisting<00:00:07.830> motion<00:00:10.639> it<00:00:11.639> really

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
with that twisting motion it really

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.100 
with that twisting motion it really
shouldn't<00:00:12.179> be<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.450> difficult<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.929> don't<00:00:12.960> know

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
shouldn't be this difficult I don't know

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.390 
shouldn't be this difficult I don't know
why<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.259> was<00:00:13.440> struggling<00:00:13.740> so<00:00:13.799> much<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.250> day

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
why I was struggling so much that day

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.670 
why I was struggling so much that day
but<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.820> should<00:00:15.240> go<00:00:15.389> in<00:00:15.509> pretty<00:00:15.719> smooth<00:00:15.990> notice

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
but it should go in pretty smooth notice

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.810 
but it should go in pretty smooth notice
once<00:00:16.890> again<00:00:17.100> there's<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.340> little<00:00:17.490> bit<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.760> a

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
once again there's a little bit of a

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.490 
once again there's a little bit of a
ridge<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.060> there<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:18.570> not<00:00:18.869> only<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.170> flat

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
ridge in there it's not only is it flat

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.460 
ridge in there it's not only is it flat
inside<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.100> actually<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.640> about<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.930> few

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
inside it's actually in about a few

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.170 
inside it's actually in about a few
centimeters<00:00:22.859> there<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.220> make<00:00:23.760> sure<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:24.060> can

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
centimeters there so make sure you can

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.570 
centimeters there so make sure you can
see<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.539> ledge<00:00:25.400> nothing<00:00:26.400> should<00:00:26.519> be

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
see that ledge nothing should be

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.849 
see that ledge nothing should be
sticking<00:00:26.880> out<00:00:27.119> or<00:00:27.510> flat<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.470> there's<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
sticking out or flat and there's a

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.080 
sticking out or flat and there's a
reason<00:00:29.160> for<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.550> next<00:00:29.640> piece<00:00:29.880> we're

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
reason for that the next piece we're

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.810 
reason for that the next piece we're
putting<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.449> has<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.779> go<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.279> that<00:00:32.279> piece<00:00:32.610> that

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
putting in has to go in that piece that

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.370 
putting in has to go in that piece that
we<00:00:32.910> put<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.180> makes<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.510> completely<00:00:33.930> flat<00:00:34.079> so

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
we put in makes it completely flat so

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.370 
we put in makes it completely flat so
make<00:00:34.590> sure<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:34.980> there<00:00:36.079> maybe<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.200> quarter

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
make sure it's in there maybe a quarter

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.680 
make sure it's in there maybe a quarter
of<00:00:37.500> an<00:00:37.590> inch<00:00:37.649> or<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.120> these<00:00:39.120> pieces<00:00:39.390> also

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
of an inch or so these pieces also

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.440 
of an inch or so these pieces also
require<00:00:40.079> some<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.410> gel<00:00:40.850> so<00:00:41.850> next<00:00:42.180> after

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
require some of that gel so next after

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.150 
require some of that gel so next after
you<00:00:42.510> put<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> two<00:00:42.899> big<00:00:43.110> pieces<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:44.010> want

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
you put the two big pieces in you want

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.770 
you put the two big pieces in you want
to<00:00:44.219> put<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.399> small<00:00:44.789> white<00:00:45.120> ones<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.660> that's

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to put this small white ones so that's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.750 
to put this small white ones so that's
that's<00:00:46.110> really<00:00:46.350> your<00:00:46.500> second<00:00:46.890> step<00:00:47.070> first

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that's really your second step first

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.610 
that's really your second step first
step<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.149> put<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.809> big<00:00:48.960> pieces<00:00:49.140> second

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
step is put in the the big pieces second

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.270 
step is put in the the big pieces second
step<00:00:49.800> put<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> white<00:00:51.000> pieces<00:00:51.920> I'm<00:00:52.920> kind<00:00:53.250> of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
step put in the white pieces I'm kind of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.770 
step put in the white pieces I'm kind of
skipping<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.760> step<00:00:53.969> here<00:00:54.210> I'm<00:00:54.300> putting<00:00:54.539> in

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
skipping a step here I'm putting in

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.350 
skipping a step here I'm putting in
those<00:00:55.070> metal<00:00:56.070> pieces<00:00:56.399> right<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:57.000> them<00:00:57.180> so

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
those metal pieces right in with them so

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.459 
those metal pieces right in with them so
you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.600> go<00:00:57.719> ahead<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.109> that's<00:00:58.289> not

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
you can go ahead and do that that's not

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.790 
you can go ahead and do that that's not
a<00:00:58.530> problem<00:01:00.020> notice<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.260> way<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:01.530> putting

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
a problem notice the way I'm putting

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.700 
a problem notice the way I'm putting
them<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.160> I'm<00:01:02.670> putting<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> two<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:04.470> kind<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
them in I'm putting the two it's kind of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.289 
them in I'm putting the two it's kind of
making<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.040> peace<00:01:05.250> sign<00:01:05.519> I'm<00:01:05.760> putting<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.119> two

making a peace sign I'm putting the two

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.330 
making a peace sign I'm putting the two
pieces<00:01:06.570> facing<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.860> smaller<00:01:08.130> one

pieces facing up and the smaller one

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.370 
pieces facing up and the smaller one
down<00:01:08.580> there's<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.880> reason<00:01:09.240> for<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.450> when<00:01:10.350> we

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
down there's a reason for that when we

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.740 
down there's a reason for that when we
put<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> glass<00:01:10.950> piece<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.520> there's<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.479> little

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
put the glass piece in there's a little

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.570 
put the glass piece in there's a little
metal<00:01:12.869> rod<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.409> has<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> come<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:13.830> notice

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
metal rod that has to come up notice

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.070 
metal rod that has to come up notice
those<00:01:14.880> they're<00:01:15.210> flat<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> was<00:01:15.720> able<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.869> put<00:01:15.990> my

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
those they're flat I was able to put my

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.359 
those they're flat I was able to put my

hand in there it's completely flat
nothing<00:01:18.180> should<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.360> sticking<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.680> should

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
nothing should be sticking out it should

nothing should be sticking out it should
be<00:01:19.950> exactly<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:21.920> all<00:01:22.920> right<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:23.220> we're

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
each one a little bit at a time all

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.390 
each one a little bit at a time all
right<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.140> now<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.319> got<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.680> glass<00:02:40.920> piece<00:02:41.220> on

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
right so now you got that glass piece on

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.830 
right so now you got that glass piece on
our<00:02:41.640> next<00:02:41.880> step<00:02:42.060> would<00:02:42.150> be<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.300> put<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.630> these

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
our next step would be to put in these

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.290 
our next step would be to put in these
three<00:02:43.230> white<00:02:43.890> pieces<00:02:44.130> now<00:02:44.430> notice<00:02:44.880> before<00:02:45.239> we

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
three white pieces now notice before we

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.520 
three white pieces now notice before we
get<00:02:45.390> started<00:02:45.600> well<00:02:45.930> I'm<00:02:46.080> actually<00:02:46.200> putting

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
get started well I'm actually putting

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.710 
get started well I'm actually putting
the<00:02:46.620> grease<00:02:46.800> on<00:02:46.980> each<00:02:47.100> one<00:02:47.330> notice<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.480> one<00:02:48.630> in

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
the grease on each one notice the one in

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.300 
the grease on each one notice the one in
the<00:02:48.780> middle<00:02:49.019> is<00:02:49.080> different<00:02:49.530> it's<00:02:49.950> got<00:02:50.160> an

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
the middle is different it's got an

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.790 
the middle is different it's got an
o-ring<00:02:50.459> on<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.300> side<00:02:51.690> as<00:02:52.050> well<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:52.560> kind<00:02:52.769> of

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
o-ring on the side as well it's kind of

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.680 
o-ring on the side as well it's kind of
hard<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.010> see<00:02:53.130> from<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.400> video<00:02:53.610> here<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.450> see

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
hard to see from the video here but see

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.310 
hard to see from the video here but see
the<00:02:54.810> difference<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:56.690> one<00:02:57.690> has<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.050> go<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
the difference that one has to go in the

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.479 
the difference that one has to go in the
middle<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.650> other<00:02:58.769> two<00:02:58.950> can<00:02:59.190> go<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.370> either

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
middle the other two can go on either

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.360 
middle the other two can go on either
side<00:03:00.050> now<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.110> two<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.950> one<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.250> middle

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
side now the two the one in the middle

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.680 
side now the two the one in the middle
it<00:03:02.640> doesn't<00:03:02.670> really<00:03:03.060> matter<00:03:03.269> which<00:03:03.480> direction

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
it doesn't really matter which direction

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.720 
it doesn't really matter which direction
you<00:03:03.930> put<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.170> in<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.530> really<00:03:05.340> can't<00:03:05.550> see

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
you put it in and you really can't see

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.100 
you put it in and you really can't see
this<00:03:05.880> unless<00:03:06.120> you're<00:03:06.300> doing<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:06.720> light<00:03:06.900> in

what the next handle in and a way to

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.350 
what the next handle in and a way to
tell<00:04:31.190> if<00:04:31.250> it<00:04:31.340> handles<00:04:31.580> it<00:04:31.700> or<00:04:31.790> not<00:04:31.880> is<00:04:32.060> if<00:04:32.210> it's

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
tell if it handles it or not is if it's

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.950 
tell if it handles it or not is if it's
if<00:04:32.780> it's<00:04:32.990> able<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.230> lift<00:04:33.470> up<00:04:37.570> so<00:04:38.570> then<00:04:38.780> you're

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
if it's able to lift up so then you're

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.860
