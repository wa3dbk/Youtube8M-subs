able to do it anyway but I'm kind of

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.330 
able to do it anyway but I'm kind of
afraid<00:01:55.980> that<00:01:56.250> over<00:01:56.820> time<00:01:57.710> you're<00:01:58.710> going<00:01:58.740> to

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
afraid that over time you're going to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.469 
afraid that over time you're going to
bring<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.060> threads<00:02:00.479> here<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.620> the<00:02:01.770> center<00:02:02.479> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
bring the threads here in the center and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.250 
bring the threads here in the center and
although<00:02:03.780> these<00:02:04.140> normally<00:02:04.590> cost<00:02:04.860> about<00:02:05.220> $1

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
although these normally cost about $1

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.720 
although these normally cost about $1

anyway
I<00:02:15.120> usually<00:02:16.110> hold<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.920> with<00:02:17.430> one<00:02:17.700> thumb<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.209> the

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
I usually hold it with one thumb on the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.949 
I usually hold it with one thumb on the
bottom<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.930> two<00:02:19.110> fingers<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.070> top<00:02:20.930> when<00:02:21.930> I

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
bottom and two fingers to the top when I

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.170 
bottom and two fingers to the top when I
pull<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.470> off<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.920> plane<00:02:25.670> it's<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.850> little

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
pull it off of the plane it's a little

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.550 
pull it off of the plane it's a little
bit<00:02:27.330> difficult<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.989> manipulate<00:02:29.900> or<00:02:30.900> remember

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
bit difficult to manipulate or remember

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.220 
bit difficult to manipulate or remember
that<00:02:32.130> you're<00:02:32.310> spinning<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.880> backward

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
that you're spinning it backward

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.150 
that you're spinning it backward
or<00:02:35.470> counterclockwise<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:38.380> remove<00:02:38.500> this<00:02:38.890> thing

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
or counterclockwise to remove this thing

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.410 
or counterclockwise to remove this thing
and<00:02:39.640> this<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.090> how<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.450> do<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:41.940> can<00:02:42.940> do<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.209> you

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
and this is how I do it I can do it you

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.940 
and this is how I do it I can do it you
can<00:02:43.599> do<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:45.209> just<00:02:46.209> go<00:02:46.480> ahead<00:02:46.870> at<00:02:47.319> some<00:02:47.680> point

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
can do it just go ahead at some point

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.520 
can do it just go ahead at some point
probably<00:02:48.280> could<00:02:48.700> just<00:02:48.910> pull<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.300> off<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.750> really

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
probably could just pull it off I really

00:02:50.530 --> 00:03:00.420 
probably could just pull it off I really
don't<00:02:50.739> like<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:55.620> comes<00:02:56.620> off

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.170 

when<00:03:00.549> you're<00:03:00.700> putting<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.269> on<00:03:02.610> again<00:03:03.610> I<00:03:03.909> just

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
when you're putting it on again I just

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.170 
when you're putting it on again I just
moved<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.780> side<00:03:05.260> stack<00:03:05.769> like<00:03:06.129> that<00:03:06.159> home<00:03:06.819> with

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
moved the side stack like that home with

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.400 
moved the side stack like that home with
my<00:03:07.390> two<00:03:07.450> fingers

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.860 

and<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.680> try<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.040> find<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.730> center<00:03:12.150> point

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.710 

pretty<00:03:15.140> much<00:03:15.349> feel<00:03:16.150> when<00:03:17.150> you're<00:03:17.299> putting<00:03:17.599> it

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
pretty much feel when you're putting it

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.880 
pretty much feel when you're putting it
on<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.290> shed<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:20.200> I'm<00:03:21.200> turning<00:03:21.709> it

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
on to the shed and I'm turning it

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.800 
on to the shed and I'm turning it
clockwise<00:03:22.159> down<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:24.790> would<00:03:25.790> go<00:03:26.030> ahead<00:03:26.180> and

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
clockwise down I would go ahead and

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.380 
clockwise down I would go ahead and
thread<00:03:27.080> this<00:03:27.349> in<00:03:27.680> until<00:03:28.610> I<00:03:28.819> meet<00:03:29.150> the

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
thread this in until I meet the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.980 
thread this in until I meet the
resistance

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.260 

I'm<00:03:35.680> gonna<00:03:35.860> pretend<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.490> it's<00:03:36.670> fully

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
I'm gonna pretend that it's fully
