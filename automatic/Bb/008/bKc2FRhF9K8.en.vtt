00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.719
 well I'm doing this video to 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.629
 request of some girls who have 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.599
 been asking about the brushes 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.820
 that I am using and so they 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:24.490
 I want to show which ones I am 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:27.789
 currently using this is 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:33.029
 one of my favorites this organ mails 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.029
 this an 8 acrylic 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.760
 and how can you see 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:48.170
 the cells are quite soft and it's 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:52.300
 It arrived about 8 months ago 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.300
 About a year with this brush 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.260
 and still their cells remain intact 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.680
 quite in tips the only thing that has 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.700
 happened is that is that the splint of the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.570
 Brush 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:11.110
 has cracked a bit has opened not 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.360
 I know why this happened but 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.020
 it still works for me and 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.160
 mostly this brush what am I 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:25.060
 using for what are the 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:27.610
 encapsulated are the application of colors 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.460
 and the truth is that I really like this 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.030
 I recommend brush is a bit 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.740
 expensive is a little more expensive than normal 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.140
 of what you can get for 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:45.750
 there a brush of kalinski centras but 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.120
 the truth is that it is very good and believe me 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.659
 that will work very well and they will 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.130
 to last the quality of the brush is 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.939
 Excellent 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.719
 as long as it's the one because you 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:05.320
 Know how to clean and clean it properly 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.880
 and try to always keep on the site 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.650
 currently using what they are for 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.880
 the acrylic and 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.580
 colors this other 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.069
 it is also an excellent brush this is 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.190
 an alpha kolinski number 10 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.370
 this end cell comes 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.740
 well it is treated as you can see here 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.990
 comes planito that is not full round 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:39.410
 but what I did was that with some 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:43.340
 tweezers or a mechanical tool or 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:48.400
 a plier press a little more on 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:51.819
 this part of here to make it more flat 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.959
 I'm using this brush for what 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.750
 which are the encapsulates to encapsulate 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:02.530
 with transparent acrylic because it is 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.420
 quite big and then with a pearl or 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.750
 two pearls that comes to take then I 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.530
 encapsulate pretty well what are the 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.829
 nails is an excellent brush and apart from 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:19.140
 which is excellent is quite economical and 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.140
 accessible to everyone 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.879
 these two are my favorites and they are the 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.110
 that I am currently using this 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:30.890
 another one that you see here 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:36.390
 It is very beautiful as you can see it is a 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:39.510
 smart brush this is a number 10 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:44.430
 a floor of number 10 I just finished it 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:48.630
 receive and well I have used a two 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.900
 three times and the truth is that yes 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:56.900
 I like it a lot I do not like it as much as 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.420
 these two but it is very good because 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.299
 well, even though it is very economic 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.450
 this I bought it on ebay 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.690
 if I'm not wrong it was on ebay 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.849
 it cost me quite economically but the 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.830
 quality of the brush cells, because no 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:19.180
 they do not compare with or with lorca nor 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:22.060
 nicholas of the alpha that said he was from 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.690
 kolinski experts but the truth is not 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.510
 I do not dare to say it because as 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.360
 you can see there and a 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.060
 little bit what is the brush 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.710
 what are the cells this brush 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:42.860
 practically new but 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:45.349
 yes for applications 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.949
 basic, it will work for them too 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.949
 very good 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.690
 It is very beautiful It is very nice the truth 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.690
 it is very beautiful and it comes in 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:02.580
 different colors depending on the size 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:04.950
 that is the cells as the color this is 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.060
 a number 10 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:12.460
 and also in what I have tried 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:16.560
 I liked it a lot 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:20.199
 and this is already as you see here is quite 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.960
 spent because it is my brush 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.590
 favorite to do what are the 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.010
 third dimensions or the reliefs 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.830
 this brush is really excellent that a 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.290
 I love it, I love it very much 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.230
 times to realize what are my 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.940
 third dimensions the if they realize 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.060
 in all my videos you will see me use it 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.150
 of my favorites and believe me I've 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:49.740
 used different types of brushes 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:51.210
 but without a doubt this one I love about 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.240
 I really love this is a cigar 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.090
 color number 5 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.580
 and I've been a lot longer 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:04.050
 of a year with this brush and how can 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:07.229
 see the cells remain intact really 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.759
 I love it and I recommend it to you 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:11.069
 I highly recommend this brush and I 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.910
 I have at the same time being online for the 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:16.380
 people that the girls that interest them 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.849
 It really is an excellent brush and 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.080
 they will find very good 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:22.840
 recommendations about him 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.240
 and I've seen many girls use it 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.370
 also and really that is one of my 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.300
 favorites especially for the third 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:34.810
 dimension because the cells are pretty 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:38.349
 long and pretty the tip is pretty 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.780
 finite and so much it takes me big pearls 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:43.870
 Take medium pearls and also take me 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:47.490
 pretty little miniature pearls 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:52.040
 and it works very well for all kinds of 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:54.900
 reliefs that I will perform 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.910
 nothing girls this was the only thing I wanted 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.710
 show them to you request my 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.770

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:05.220
 favorite brushes and thousands of what 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.960
 using at this time for a while 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.210

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.729
 this alpha brush brooch also that the 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.979
 I have for sale 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:18.639
 and I also use it a lot I have it 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:20.919
 in number 6 and number 8 the number 6 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:23.710
 it's quite small and the number 8 is already 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:26.889
 a regular size for the application and 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:30.180
 I also use it quite number 6 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:33.400
 to use it mostly to apply 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.659
 decorations that go encapsulate inside 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.180
 of the nail 

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:39.639
 or for nails that are enough are 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.860
 pretty small and I do not need to catch 

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:45.039
 quantities of very large acrylics 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.930
 brush number 6 helps me a lot and 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:49.779
 the number 8 also uses it for 

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:51.339
 what is the application and is already for the 

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:55.599
