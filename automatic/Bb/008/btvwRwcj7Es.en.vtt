about<00:02:05.570> why<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.630> my<00:02:06.840> corals<00:02:07.260> dying<00:02:07.530> why<00:02:08.070> are

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
about why is my corals dying why are

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.830 
about why is my corals dying why are
they<00:02:08.280> bleaching<00:02:08.759> out<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.240> lot<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.539> times

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
they bleaching out and a lot of times

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.290 
they bleaching out and a lot of times
because<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:11.039> corals<00:02:11.430> are<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.790> stressed

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
because the corals are so stressed

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.630 
because the corals are so stressed
they're<00:02:12.930> releasing<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.830> zou<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.160> belly<00:02:14.340> back

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
they're releasing the zou and belly back

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.370 
they're releasing the zou and belly back
into<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:15.090> water<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.690> they're<00:02:15.870> not<00:02:16.020> holding

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
into the water and they're not holding

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.980 
into the water and they're not holding
on<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.430> supplement<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.510> something

of<00:03:24.700> times<00:03:24.940> you<00:03:25.270> know<00:03:25.390> hobbyists<00:03:26.200> they<00:03:26.290> think

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
of times you know hobbyists they think

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.680 
of times you know hobbyists they think
amino<00:03:26.950> acids<00:03:27.370> right<00:03:27.610> away<00:03:27.850> we<00:03:28.390> have<00:03:28.510> to

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
amino acids right away we have to

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.350 
amino acids right away we have to
supplement<00:03:28.900> amino<00:03:29.590> acids<00:03:30.070> but<00:03:31.000> with<00:03:31.210> this

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
supplement amino acids but with this

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.600 
supplement amino acids but with this
product<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:31.990> think<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.530> going<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.160> be<00:03:33.370> way

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
product I think is going to be way

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.730 
product I think is going to be way
better<00:03:33.850> than<00:03:34.180> amino<00:03:34.510> acids<00:03:34.990> because<00:03:35.170> corals

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
better than amino acids because corals

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.950 
better than amino acids because corals
don't<00:03:35.890> solely<00:03:36.400> rely<00:03:36.880> on<00:03:36.910> amino<00:03:37.390> acids<00:03:37.810> any

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
don't solely rely on amino acids any

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.010 
don't solely rely on amino acids any
nutrients<00:03:38.710> to<00:03:39.430> propel<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.240> zone<00:03:40.450> deli<00:03:40.720> and

nutrients to propel the zone deli and

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.170 
nutrients to propel the zone deli and
this<00:03:41.890> product<00:03:42.490> I<00:03:42.520> think<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:42.850> going<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.060> be
