00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.160 

the<00:00:05.520> sake<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:05.790> time<00:00:06.210> I'm<00:00:06.540> just<00:00:06.750> going<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:06.960> show

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
the sake of time I'm just going to show

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.080 
the sake of time I'm just going to show
you<00:00:07.230> what<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.620> three<00:00:08.010> point<00:00:08.280> perspective<00:00:08.580> looks

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
you what a three point perspective looks

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.200 
you what a three point perspective looks
like<00:00:09.330> it<00:00:10.290> has<00:00:11.160> this<00:00:11.370> kind<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.730> feel<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:11.969> it

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
like it has this kind of feel to it

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.990 
like it has this kind of feel to it
notice<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.259> three<00:00:13.559> points<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.309> right<00:00:14.490> to

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
notice the three points to the right to

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.260 
notice the three points to the right to
the<00:00:15.030> left<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.920> the<00:00:16.920> third<00:00:17.460> one<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.910> straight

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
the left and the third one is straight

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.840 
the left and the third one is straight
down<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.410> means<00:00:19.740> none<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.340> edges<00:00:20.699> are

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
down so that means none of the edges are

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.429 
down so that means none of the edges are
truly<00:00:21.380> perpendicular<00:00:22.380> they're<00:00:22.980> all<00:00:23.250> guide<00:00:24.439> to

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
truly perpendicular they're all guide to

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.339 
truly perpendicular they're all guide to
a<00:00:25.890> vanishing<00:00:26.640> point<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.180> sure<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> way<00:00:28.320> I

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
a vanishing point I sure the way I

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.730 
a vanishing point I sure the way I
created<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.630> by<00:00:30.630> drawing<00:00:30.929> one<00:00:31.199> segment<00:00:31.500> I

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
created this is by drawing one segment I

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.500 
created this is by drawing one segment I
did<00:00:31.920> create<00:00:32.219> one<00:00:32.489> edge<00:00:32.730> perpendicular

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
did create one edge perpendicular

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.670 
did create one edge perpendicular
horizon<00:00:34.520> so<00:00:35.520> by<00:00:35.730> creating<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.680> perpendicular

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
horizon so by creating the perpendicular

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.110 
horizon so by creating the perpendicular
through<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> vanishing<00:00:38.520> point<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.000> will

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
through the vanishing point that will

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.690 
through the vanishing point that will
create<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.629> edge<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.350> then<00:00:41.100> from<00:00:41.309> these<00:00:41.460> two

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
create this edge and then from these two

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.459 
create this edge and then from these two
randomly<00:00:42.180> placed<00:00:42.570> points<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.170> there<00:00:43.440> that

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
randomly placed points on there that

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.830 
randomly placed points on there that
segment<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.550> draw<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.090> all<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> vanishing

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
segment we can draw to all the vanishing

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.180 
segment we can draw to all the vanishing
points

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.099 

the<00:00:53.789> last<00:00:54.000> part<00:00:54.269> of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> lesson<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
the last part of the lesson is to

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.680 
the last part of the lesson is to
actually<00:00:55.260> find<00:00:55.769> vanishing<00:00:56.340> points<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.879> famous

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
actually find vanishing points in famous

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.810 
actually find vanishing points in famous
works<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.050> art<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.800> using<00:00:59.129> these<00:00:59.250> buttons<00:00:59.519> down

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
works of art so using these buttons down

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.389 
works of art so using these buttons down
here<00:00:59.879> we<00:01:00.839> can<00:01:01.019> click<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.649> such<00:01:02.039> as<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
here we can click on one such as the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.180 
here we can click on one such as the
Annunciation<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.440> we're<00:01:04.440> trying<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.890> find

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
Annunciation and we're trying to find

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.249 
Annunciation and we're trying to find
where<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.549> picture<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.060> sort<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.450> drawn

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
where this picture is sort of drawn

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.280 
where this picture is sort of drawn
towards<00:01:08.190> that<00:01:08.369> creates<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.759> depth<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.960> any

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
towards that creates the depth so any

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.100 
towards that creates the depth so any
edge<00:01:10.680> any<00:01:11.670> straight<00:01:12.149> edge<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.899> to<00:01:12.960> give

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
edge any straight edge is going to give

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.190 
edge any straight edge is going to give
you<00:01:13.259> a<00:01:13.290> clue<00:01:13.649> like<00:01:14.490> these<00:01:14.700> edges<00:01:15.330> I'll<00:01:15.570> go

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
you a clue like these edges I'll go

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.310 
you a clue like these edges I'll go
towards<00:01:16.710> something<00:01:17.009> these<00:01:17.790> edges<00:01:18.570> are<00:01:19.140> all

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
towards something these edges are all

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.499 
towards something these edges are all
moving<00:01:19.680> excuse<00:01:20.159> me<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.610> second<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.240> edge

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
moving excuse me just a second this edge

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.050 
moving excuse me just a second this edge
is<00:01:21.539> all<00:01:22.170> moving<00:01:22.700> actually<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.759> looks<00:01:23.909> like

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
is all moving actually it looks like

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.270 
is all moving actually it looks like
this<00:01:24.210> edge<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.899> parallel<00:01:25.679> to<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.100> whole

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
this edge is going parallel to the whole

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.969 
this edge is going parallel to the whole
picture<00:01:26.580> or<00:01:26.909> across<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.360> frame<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.710> these

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
picture or across the frame but these

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.380 
picture or across the frame but these
edges<00:01:29.729> create<00:01:30.179> depth<00:01:30.539> and<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.399> these<00:01:32.819> and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
edges create depth and so do these and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.550 
edges create depth and so do these and
so<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.170> these<00:01:34.789> so<00:01:35.789> using<00:01:36.270> sketchpad<00:01:36.990> how<00:01:37.380> can

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
so do these so using sketchpad how can

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.490 
so do these so using sketchpad how can
we<00:01:37.679> find<00:01:38.039> a<00:01:38.250> little<00:01:38.429> more<00:01:38.640> accurately<00:01:39.259> use<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
we find a little more accurately use the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.669 
we find a little more accurately use the
line<00:01:40.770> tool<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:42.420> using<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.869> line<00:01:43.080> tool<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.649> can

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
line tool so using the line tool we can

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.139 
line tool so using the line tool we can
click<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:45.050> drag<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.940> now

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
click and drag and this is just now

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.050 
click and drag and this is just now
approximation<00:01:49.050> but<00:01:49.920> by<00:01:50.130> dragging<00:01:50.789> along

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
approximation but by dragging along

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.690 
approximation but by dragging along
these<00:01:51.299> edges<00:01:51.500> we<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.649> get<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.830> sense<00:01:53.190> of<00:01:53.399> where

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
these edges we can get a sense of where

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.580 
these edges we can get a sense of where
it<00:01:53.909> might<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:56.239> we<00:01:57.239> draw<00:01:57.479> along<00:01:57.750> these<00:01:58.020> edges<00:01:58.200> as

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it might be we draw along these edges as

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.469 
it might be we draw along these edges as
well<00:01:58.830> in<00:02:00.470> any<00:02:01.470> edge<00:02:01.800> that's<00:02:02.459> going<00:02:02.789> into<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
well in any edge that's going into the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.469 
well in any edge that's going into the
picture<00:02:03.840> now<00:02:04.800> notice<00:02:05.009> all<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> mine<00:02:05.640> do<00:02:06.300> not

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
picture now notice all of mine do not

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.139 
picture now notice all of mine do not
meet<00:02:06.959> because<00:02:07.770> I've<00:02:07.950> randomly<00:02:08.640> placed<00:02:08.910> these

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
meet because I've randomly placed these

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.520 
meet because I've randomly placed these
lines<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.840> there's<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.080> little<00:02:10.289> bit<00:02:10.470> of

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
lines so there's a little bit of

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.080 
lines so there's a little bit of
guesswork<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.370> may<00:02:11.489> want<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> go<00:02:11.849> back

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
guesswork and you may want to go back

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.600 
guesswork and you may want to go back
and<00:02:12.120> try<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.480> adjust<00:02:12.660> them<00:02:13.200> use<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> color<00:02:14.370> that

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
and try to adjust them use a color that

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.360 
and try to adjust them use a color that
stands<00:02:15.150> out<00:02:15.270> from<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> drawing<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.560> then

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
stands out from the drawing and then

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.460 
stands out from the drawing and then
you're<00:02:17.520> going<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.730> see<00:02:17.940> approximately

by experimenting with you know

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.080 
by experimenting with you know
approximately<00:02:34.950> where<00:02:35.040> these<00:02:35.190> edges<00:02:35.610> might<00:02:35.819> go

that the vanishing point is somewhere

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.369 
that the vanishing point is somewhere
off<00:02:38.340> into<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.849> horizon<00:02:39.080> towards<00:02:40.080> this

mountainous area a better question might

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.699 
mountainous area a better question might
be<00:02:42.989> why<00:02:44.269> so<00:02:45.269> with<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.510> idea<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:46.140> using<00:02:46.440> the

be why so with this idea of using the
line<00:02:47.010> tool<00:02:47.150> can<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.269> approximate<00:02:48.989> where<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
line tool can you approximate where the

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.000 
line tool can you approximate where the
vanishing<00:02:49.769> point<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.310> on<00:02:50.670> all<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.720> these<00:02:52.010> such
