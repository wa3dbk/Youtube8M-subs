00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
minds there they created halo and they

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.289 
minds there they created halo and they
have<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> ton<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:34.979> great<00:01:35.189> ideas<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.610> their

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
workers there and I think it's really

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:38.929 
workers there and I think it's really
cool<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.310> actually<00:01:38.700> going<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.880> be

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
based in our solar system there's going

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.920 
based in our solar system there's going
to<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.280> other<00:01:41.430> planets<00:01:41.880> I'm<00:01:42.030> assuming<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.869> I

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
to be other planets I'm assuming but I

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.819 
to be other planets I'm assuming but I
think<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.200> really<00:01:43.320> cool<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.590> it's

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
think it's really cool that it's

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.380 
think it's really cool that it's
actually<00:01:43.979> based<00:01:44.280> around<00:01:44.520> our<00:01:44.759> solar<00:01:44.939> system

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
actually based around our solar system

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.990 
actually based around our solar system
