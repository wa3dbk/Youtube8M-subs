00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 it does not seem that the wave is with a 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.179
 big problem at the moment is with the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.870
 turbo engines its back to Formula 1 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.240
 after so much time but at the same time 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.210
 there is a light at the end of the tunnel can be 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.340
 that everything is not lost but before the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.039
 people get on the wave as old as 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.439
 this new turbocharged engine 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.710
 current formula 1 or be there everyone 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.349
 I think that's how it works. 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.420
 It's really all right that people are good at 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.910
 people explain things in a way from the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.739
 start how the turbo basically works 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.050
 you use the force of the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.640
 right exhaust then it's that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.829
 analogy that we have already done but if you 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.110
 connect a weathervane there in the no 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.059
 car exhaust he'll turn right 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.649
 and if you have a linense axis 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.620
 weathervane that turns another treatment 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.079
 together that will push into the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.649
 collector there in the engine then it's a 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.020
 you make a turbine né 11 side 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.559
 is accelerated by marriage gases and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.119
 other side pushes is the air into the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.250
 engine then the more air you get out of a 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.229
 The more you push from the other this is the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.630
 basic principle of any class 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.950
 decided to see himself on the street including 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.740
 and cool in formula 1 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.320
 they did this same principle is not 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.780
 more the big balcony was what the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.270
 Mercedes made her engine count to 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.939
 people a little bit this division of 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.460
 pieces that Mercedes did and that if you 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.310
 Pick up the two street cars. 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.680
 both what is accelerated by the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.700
 wedding gases like what to push to 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.530
 inside the engine 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.840
 these two windlasses they are connected 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.509
 which are the turbines nor the compressor 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.310
 they are coladinhos each other right 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.460
 so if you look at that car 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.820
 desire and of the Brazilians in a jetta ts 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.040
 or that pejô tour etc 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.950
 these cases all have the turbine and the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.340
 compressor in the other is what the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.500
 mercedes did what is important 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.390
 also say that renoldy formula 1 and 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.430
 ferrari are also thus the turbo and 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.680
 compressor sound this side of the other 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.989
 mercedes great move the cat leap 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.330
 that they gave is that they did this 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.510
 axis that joins the turbine or the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.750
 long professor 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.510
 then it is the turbine that runs with the gases 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.060
 marriage is on one side of the engine and there 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.090
 on the other end that such a compressor they 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.360
 rotate together but within that view 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.370
 besides the engine is a v6 runs the shaft that 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.739
 rotates either with the two turbines 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.459
 which is a great move of the 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.989
 Mercedes is because the compressor is far 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.090
 so he does not suffer from this problem of 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.159
 heating it works with more air 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.599
 that a denser air that gives more 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.640
 power to the engine 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.909
 you need less cooling - 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.470
 intercooler then the mercedes move 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:56.829
 separating the two rotors was a 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.959
 of master né and besides that is what 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.019
 calls split turbo nec split and is 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.389
 separated is the separate turbo what 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.790
 the wave tried to make a wave 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:09.069
 obviously entered the year already late in 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.639
 formula 1 but already knew about 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.209
 mercedes what the round to do with the 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:18.730
 your engine with the power units 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.799
 that 's where the wheel thought out 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.750
 out of the box because they could 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.940
 do they could do similar to 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.299
 renoldy a ferrari or do as in a 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.459
 street car the compressor and the turbine 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.099
 there in the other there in the near 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.260
 exhaust or could copy Mercedes 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.769
 that seemed more logical than it was 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.169
 make the spirit do everything apart in a 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.629
 corner of the engine is the turbine of the 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:46.120
 leakage in another corner is our 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.879
 friend there the compressor but the round 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.639
 decided to make an ultra compact design 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.530
 they were able to put the compressor 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.540
 there inside the space of v 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.620
 It is a place there that is more or less 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.239
 middle of the engine 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.940
 they put compressors one thing 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.500
 that you would not have to do because 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.989
 in these compressors are large then 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.000
 they changed the technology of the compressor 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.669
 is theoretically everybody is thinking 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.590
 that they did with axial person or 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:14.049
 be instead of being a weathervane that 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.909
 snail that you come come search for 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.599
 in google there turbo will appear a 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:22.840
 snail is because that kind of turbo 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:24.880
 it is centrifugal, that is, the 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.310
 for it rotates perpendicular to the axis 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.490
 everything is now turning in the case of 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.590
 confessor of the round he is just a pipe with 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.850
 several small weathervants inside is 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.930
 so it works for example a motor 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.750
 by plane 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.990
 is then a tube that fits you in. 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.389
 than see beyond the engine then the turbo 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.180
 and note is the compressor in case it does not 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.880
 is neither on the front nor behind the 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.639
 engine then imagine the gain in terms 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.000
 space you have that john because there 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.440
 to me the design can be ultra compact 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.600
 the back of the car and this has a 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.760
 benefit was dynamic gigantic but in 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.860
 about it that engine and can 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.410
 really with this idea being a 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.840
 revolution as was the motor 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.570
 mercedes or it's going to be a thing of 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.600
 reengineering is a question that only 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.120
 time will tell more staff by 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.220
 example of the British auto sport 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.940
 analyzed this there that is conjecture 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.770
 this part this arrangement and engine 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.160
 they think it can work because 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.110
 after all this axial compressor 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.080
 that the United Nations has chosen what is a 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.030
 This is a revolutionary thing. 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.979
 that you use an airplane engine and why 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.830
 with its use in airplane engines because 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:41.289
 it is much more efficient than in 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.020
 engine than everything centrifugal, not because 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:46.570
 it ends up spinning at speeds 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.110
 even though it did not reach the same 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.479
 pressure then only time will tell but the 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.270
 most of the people who handle this 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.039
 I think it can work in the medium term 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.599
 they are making gains in this region 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.639
 only we do not know if they will 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.830
 reach the same level as others 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.780
 if they can reach a power 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.539
 similar to that of Mercedes 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.300
 being a back size zero goals 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.120
 call the mclaren is sure to be 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.589
 a winning car 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.589
