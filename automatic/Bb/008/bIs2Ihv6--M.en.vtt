00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.610
 vlc and there is a life of the opa mass in the fact that and we owe to photos to a 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.710
 picture the movie and dated 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.509
 dated 1659 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.619
 here are women alone 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.739
 58 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:18.900
 58 58 protv therefore attention 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.130
 5 see the people more careful 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.340
 if now sex to read a picture signed by duck are not 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.739
 particularly bad that 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.390
 it is difficult to make a contribution even if rarely 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.510
 it's ugly but interesting like those women in me here lol 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.250
 resumption of the stops for good conditions always interesting because a lot 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.640
 decorative 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.530
 but the painter was really a thinker because he was a flatter painting 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.810
 because then you do 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.690
 the composition is a square then to the ancient ruins and then the modern Rome 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.120
 all the right point of view of the situation 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.700
 then dial 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.209
 with all these confetti of pers. of bb characters that you put on 

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:03.729
 5 bands all the same 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.890
 this guide is a little bigger than kuna 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.660
 then 2 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.330
 4% or directory what a hero is that women can call colors 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.340
 for me he doesn't know a card three guys will surely know about peter van breda 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.470
 on mathematics I was exactly seeing this that one needs to compose 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.439
 passing thing 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.410
 facebook presents - seized 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.700
 model for which it is as if it were a visual pyramid 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.880
 seen from behind is exactly the perspective point of view for which it starts 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.970
 bigger but basically smaller but a stoned exercise that 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.820
 obviously as when it will cost 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.270
 a tenth of its value did not owe us if we saw habitable rooms to see from 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.700
 learn from us the paintings we see what months we give away 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.619
 back home someday love very interesting and white blog then this 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.110
 someone like it long 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.810
 which then is Signora taste 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.760
 because because horizontal it is instead of vertical it looks good on a sofa 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.330
 and decorative you can buy in Rome because if I have Rome I also pay 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.500
 one so thinks the goose 0 that time we discovered to discover 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.089
 wonderful that it is never impossible villas 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.549
 the house and outside the crazy boob 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.179
 tavazzano was a corner I think 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:19.059
 bought by Bagnasco at the time there were two wonderful scrolls that later 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.269
 attributed muoio attributed scala p 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.859
 dizianario 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.749
 queria a viewer 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:30.139
 lee that represented instead of in venice some country views for that 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.069
 great Tuscan burned joe jury venezia then the canaletto venezia 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.219
 they were made to go to England ad mediaset venezia venezia 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.759
 firms venice the views of interior and them as one that turns its back on 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:47.209
 canal grande and instead I want to come from the milan campagnaro then with 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.259
 this logic this painting if one of rome I buy it because the roma bosom of 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:53.319
 vinovo compose so verona for which 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.239
 there are healed of star buyers of anyone who can inflame the sanction 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.479
 omitted or that I tried to go on a sally trip as well to color the 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:01.050
 home 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.270
 the fact is that they run we see a ridiculous figure that I don't know where they are 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.530
 I'm sure it's ridiculous 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.059
 let's say I would vote for it 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:12.189
 150,000 euros 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.179
 smau bologna masse santa teres 7 56 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:16.799
 and then it means that 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.489
 you consider this painter the most rigorous oriole I sing I have 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.669
 found enough for me you even more. 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:28.169
 so it is a picture and we expect you to see the technique of life at home 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.909
 something involves what it is 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.849
 that it must be said that all numbers of a successful acceptance tell the truth 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.849
 no it is a sheath 8 nokia n8 I am saying that the picture is good affirmed dated 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.039
 rightly ancient well preserved 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:45.429
 so, day and we bought rock this evening 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:48.669
 I do not say a beautiful painting because it is also a beautiful painting to avoid speaking ill 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:52.179
 that it is a clever ford picture of signing them here 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:55.409
 elisa jamon framework for the lady what rightly is 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.769
 we can not say that it is one that has put the coglionazzo in the phone is a 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.109
 painter without balls 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.439
 but I can say that a framework for the market 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.460
 Beauty and the Beast 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.300
 first charge right and peter rabbit market today still local club today

 when I see goats they are so many growing roses are few 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.240
 therefore being square meter is that while crying and there are only two 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.400
 in the world and the other two are not there 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.129

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:44.599
 like his jewels between the good and the bad 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.509
 decided to save on the network so I keep doing the supergae 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.370
 only the molise cs we are shed only for the molise 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.080

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.450
 I'm sure someone was in pescara to say so in passing 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.909
 it is not therefore we are far below our possibilities 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:24.259
 I hope that what you see as the largest Benevento health center will be able to see it 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.340
 not only do I immediately love breda costs 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.189
