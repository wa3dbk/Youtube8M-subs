00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
time the food and water in it and you

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.900 
time the food and water in it and you
are<00:00:28.730> hydrated<00:00:29.450> with<00:00:29.600> the<00:00:29.720> food<00:00:29.960> you're<00:00:30.200> eating

are hydrated with the food you're eating
today<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.390> food<00:00:32.629> is<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:33.050> dehydrated

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
today the food is so dehydrated

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.580 
today the food is so dehydrated
everyone<00:00:34.789> has<00:00:35.360> watered<00:00:35.780> emails<00:00:36.199> you<00:00:36.379> knows

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
everyone has watered emails you knows

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.200 
everyone has watered emails you knows
everything<00:00:37.040> you're<00:00:37.160> eating<00:00:37.430> here<00:00:37.579> is<00:00:37.790> full<00:00:38.090> of

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
everything you're eating here is full of

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.710 
everything you're eating here is full of
water<00:00:38.829> major<00:00:39.829> water<00:00:40.250> content<00:00:40.730> because<00:00:41.420> that's

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
water major water content because that's

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.650 
water major water content because that's
the<00:00:42.050> design<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:42.649> the<00:00:42.950> reason<00:00:43.370> is<00:00:43.489> because

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
the design and the reason is because

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.389 
the design and the reason is because
roots<00:00:44.660> could<00:00:44.960> spread<00:00:45.320> out<00:00:45.530> in<00:00:45.739> soft<00:00:46.070> ground

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
roots could spread out in soft ground

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.750 
roots could spread out in soft ground
and<00:00:46.820> pull<00:00:47.360> up<00:00:48.040> today<00:00:49.040> because<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:49.520> grounds

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
and pull up today because the grounds

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.979 
and pull up today because the grounds
compacted<00:00:50.270> I<00:00:50.329> don't<00:00:50.480> care<00:00:50.570> how<00:00:50.720> much<00:00:50.840> you're

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
compacted I don't care how much you're

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.319 
compacted I don't care how much you're
watering<00:00:51.470> if<00:00:52.010> there's<00:00:52.250> no<00:00:52.399> root<00:00:52.640> system<00:00:53.030> it's

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
watering if there's no root system it's

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.940 
watering if there's no root system it's
not<00:00:53.480> going<00:00:53.720> in<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:53.899> plant<00:00:54.110> that's<00:00:54.800> why

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
not going in the plant that's why

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.560 
not going in the plant that's why
farmers<00:00:55.340> are<00:00:55.640> watering<00:00:55.940> their<00:00:56.000> gardens<00:00:56.390> all

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570

of<00:01:03.350> flip<00:01:03.559> yeah<00:01:03.710> I<00:01:04.009> have<00:01:04.399> a<00:01:04.430> seven<00:01:05.360> year<00:01:05.390> old

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
of flip yeah I have a seven year old

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.569 
of flip yeah I have a seven year old
dwarf<00:01:05.869> tree<00:01:06.200> dwarf<00:01:06.860> plum<00:01:07.130> tree<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:07.460> has

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
dwarf tree dwarf plum tree that has

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.679 
dwarf tree dwarf plum tree that has
roots<00:01:07.759> not<00:01:07.939> 30<00:01:08.210> teeth<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:08.569> the<00:01:08.630> trunk<00:01:10.539> and<00:01:11.539> if

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
roots not 30 teeth in the trunk and if

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.449 
roots not 30 teeth in the trunk and if
you<00:01:11.780> understand<00:01:12.259> warped<00:01:12.590> trees<00:01:12.799> how<00:01:13.100> they<00:01:13.249> are

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:13.459 
you understand warped trees how they are

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.190 
you understand warped trees how they are
they<00:01:13.609> develop<00:01:13.969> roots<00:01:14.119> before<00:01:14.420> Phoenix<00:01:14.990> is

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
they develop roots before Phoenix is

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.469 
they develop roots before Phoenix is
they<00:01:15.350> take<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.649> cultivar<00:01:16.189> you<00:01:16.369> want<00:01:16.609> and<00:01:16.850> graph

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
they take a cultivar you want and graph

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.179 
they take a cultivar you want and graph
into<00:01:17.780> your<00:01:17.899> root<00:01:18.079> stock<00:01:18.350> that<00:01:18.770> doesn't

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
into your root stock that doesn't

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.669 
into your root stock that doesn't
develop<00:01:19.399> roots<00:01:19.779> that's<00:01:20.779> why<00:01:20.959> it<00:01:21.020> stays<00:01:21.289> dwarf

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
develop roots that's why it stays dwarf

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.319 
develop roots that's why it stays dwarf
because<00:01:22.249> it<00:01:22.340> doesn't<00:01:22.520> have<00:01:22.609> a<00:01:22.670> large<00:01:22.850> leucism

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
because it doesn't have a large leucism

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.769 
because it doesn't have a large leucism
it<00:01:23.600> doesn't<00:01:23.810> get<00:01:23.929> big<00:01:24.700> yeah<00:01:25.700> seven<00:01:26.149> a<00:01:26.359> seven

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:26.779 
it doesn't get big yeah seven a seven

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:29.289 
it doesn't get big yeah seven a seven
year<00:01:27.170> old<00:01:27.200> dwarf<00:01:27.979> tree<00:01:28.369> with<00:01:28.579> roots<00:01:28.759> out<00:01:28.999> 30

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
year old dwarf tree with roots out 30

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.940 
year old dwarf tree with roots out 30
feet<00:01:29.509> from<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:29.749> trunk<00:01:30.009> every<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:31.100> same<00:01:32.950> you

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
feet from the trunk every the same you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.499 
feet from the trunk every the same you
see<00:01:34.130> this<00:01:34.219> is<00:01:34.369> why<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.579> never<00:01:34.880> have<00:01:35.179> to<00:01:35.299> water

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
see this is why you never have to water

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:36.849 
see this is why you never have to water
it's<00:01:35.779> not<00:01:35.929> about<00:01:36.109> the<00:01:36.229> amount<00:01:36.319> of<00:01:36.439> water<00:01:36.649> in

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
it's not about the amount of water in

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.949 
it's not about the amount of water in
the<00:01:37.009> ground<00:01:37.219> it's<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.029> past<00:01:38.299> capacity<00:01:38.869> to

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
the ground it's the past capacity to

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.499 
the ground it's the past capacity to
take<00:01:39.139> it<00:01:39.259> up<00:01:39.380> via<00:01:40.009> a<00:01:40.159> root<00:01:40.490> system<00:01:40.819> so<00:01:41.240> if<00:01:41.420> you

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
take it up via a root system so if you

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.019 
take it up via a root system so if you
got<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.689> rooster<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.619> radius<00:01:43.159> not<00:01:43.399> a<00:01:43.429> diameter<00:01:43.819> of

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:44.029 
got a rooster a radius not a diameter of

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:46.300 
got a rooster a radius not a diameter of
30<00:01:44.240> feet<00:01:44.569> a<00:01:44.810> lot<00:01:45.469> of<00:01:45.619> water<00:01:45.770> it's<00:01:45.979> cut<00:01:46.159> like

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
30 feet a lot of water it's cut like

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.370 
30 feet a lot of water it's cut like
that<00:01:46.340> it's<00:01:46.639> taken<00:01:46.969> up<00:01:47.090> I<00:01:47.419> mean<00:01:47.869> it's<00:01:48.020> just<00:01:48.049> it's

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
that it's taken up I mean it's just it's

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.349 
that it's taken up I mean it's just it's
just<00:01:48.469> it's<00:01:48.740> just<00:01:48.919> so<00:01:49.099> huge<00:01:49.520> just<00:01:50.090> walk<00:01:50.209> over

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359
