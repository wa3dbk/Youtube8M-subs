about<00:03:15.150> ever<00:03:15.420> each<00:03:16.109> or<00:03:16.500> half<00:03:16.680> inch<00:03:16.980> apart

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
about ever each or half inch apart

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.300 
about ever each or half inch apart
coming<00:03:18.540> on<00:03:18.660> around<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.609> will<00:03:20.609> be<00:03:21.030> welded<00:03:22.310> solid

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
coming on around it will be welded solid

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.050 
coming on around it will be welded solid
all<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:23.910> way<00:03:24.570> around<00:03:25.790> both<00:03:26.840> sides<00:03:27.840> then<00:03:29.060> I

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
all the way around both sides then I

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.270 
all the way around both sides then I
will<00:03:30.600> grind<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.880> flush<00:03:32.880> with<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.420> plant<00:03:34.280> went

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
will grind it flush with the plant went

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.610 
will grind it flush with the plant went
the<00:03:35.430> side<00:03:35.700> here<00:03:36.180> then<00:03:37.019> I<00:03:37.049> will<00:03:37.530> grind<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.329> flat

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
the side here then I will grind it flat

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.130 
the side here then I will grind it flat
this<00:03:40.620> away<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.340> that<00:03:42.030> will<00:03:42.090> give<00:03:42.480> me<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.660> sharp

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
this away and that will give me a sharp

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.130 
this away and that will give me a sharp
corner<00:03:43.470> right<00:03:43.859> here

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
corner right here

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.860 
corner right here
but<00:03:45.710> it's<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.670> way<00:03:46.850> it's<00:03:47.030> blocked<00:03:47.330> up<00:03:47.600> there

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870
