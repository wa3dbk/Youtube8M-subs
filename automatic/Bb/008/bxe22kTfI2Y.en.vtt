in<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:07.290> previous<00:00:07.620> video<00:00:07.979> we<00:00:08.219> looked<00:00:08.460> at<00:00:08.549> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
in the previous video we looked at the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.720 
in the previous video we looked at the
different<00:00:09.000> neurons<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.690> nervous<00:00:09.840> system

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
different neurons in the nervous system

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.160 
different neurons in the nervous system
now<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:12.209> will<00:00:12.330> look<00:00:12.450> at<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.780> different

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
now we will look at the different

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.289 
now we will look at the different
support<00:00:13.980> cells<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.730> make<00:00:14.940> up<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.900 
peripheral and central nervous system
people<00:00:19.199> often<00:00:19.619> say<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.039> only<00:00:20.310> use<00:00:20.550> 10%

people often say that you only use 10%

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.450 
people often say that you only use 10%
of<00:00:21.330> your<00:00:21.480> brain<00:00:22.160> but<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:23.310> they're<00:00:23.429> actually

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
of your brain but what they're actually

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.029 
of your brain but what they're actually
saying<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.599> neurons<00:00:24.990> make<00:00:25.349> up<00:00:25.470> 10%<00:00:25.650> of

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
saying is that neurons make up 10% of

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.880 
saying is that neurons make up 10% of
your<00:00:26.160> nervous<00:00:26.490> system<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:27.720> other<00:00:27.900> 90%<00:00:28.320> are

your nervous system the other 90% are
support<00:00:29.429> cells<00:00:30.470> we<00:00:31.470> need<00:00:31.499> these<00:00:31.859> cells<00:00:32.130> to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
support cells we need these cells to
