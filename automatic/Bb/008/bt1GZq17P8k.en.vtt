it seems like every week there's a new

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.660 
it seems like every week there's a new
study<00:00:08.320> on<00:00:08.440> the<00:00:08.680> health<00:00:08.889> benefits<00:00:09.100> and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
study on the health benefits and

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.060 
study on the health benefits and
downfalls<00:00:10.270> of<00:00:10.630> drinking<00:00:10.960> coffee<00:00:10.990> but<00:00:11.920> when

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
downfalls of drinking coffee but when

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.770 
downfalls of drinking coffee but when
all<00:00:12.280> the<00:00:12.460> factors<00:00:12.820> are<00:00:12.969> considered<00:00:13.480> is<00:00:13.600> it

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
all the factors are considered is it

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.810 
all the factors are considered is it
good<00:00:14.020> for<00:00:14.049> us<00:00:14.349> or<00:00:14.590> bad<00:00:14.620> for<00:00:15.099> us<00:00:15.130> and<00:00:15.309> how<00:00:15.670> many

good for us or bad for us and how many

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.640 
good for us or bad for us and how many
cups<00:00:16.029> can<00:00:16.180> we<00:00:16.240> actually<00:00:16.420> drink<00:00:16.990> health<00:00:17.470> and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
cups can we actually drink health and

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
research is coming out but it might not

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.420 
research is coming out but it might not
be<00:00:26.170> so<00:00:26.350> bad<00:00:26.380> after<00:00:26.740> all<00:00:26.980> so<00:00:27.160> going<00:00:27.250> to<00:00:27.310> talk

be so bad after all so going to talk
about<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:27.730> pluses<00:00:27.939> and<00:00:28.150> minuses<00:00:28.539> and<00:00:28.720> give

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
about the pluses and minuses and give

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.480 
about the pluses and minuses and give
you<00:00:28.960> my<00:00:29.109> verdict<00:00:29.500> on<00:00:29.619> whether<00:00:29.769> it<00:00:29.920> really<00:00:30.220> is

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
you my verdict on whether it really is

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.670 
you my verdict on whether it really is
good<00:00:30.760> or<00:00:30.880> bad<00:00:30.910> ok<00:00:31.240> finally<00:00:31.810> is<00:00:32.019> the<00:00:32.199> answers

good or bad ok finally is the answers
right<00:00:33.010> has<00:00:33.280> it<00:00:33.309> been<00:00:33.580> going<00:00:33.850> back<00:00:33.970> and<00:00:34.030> forth

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:34.269 
right has it been going back and forth

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:35.580 
right has it been going back and forth
all<00:00:34.629> this<00:00:34.780> time<00:00:35.019> you<00:00:35.230> know<00:00:35.320> it's<00:00:35.500> an

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
all this time you know it's an

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.900 
all this time you know it's an
interesting<00:00:35.680> question<00:00:35.980> earlier<00:00:36.519> studies

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
interesting question earlier studies

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.370 
interesting question earlier studies
didn't<00:00:37.269> take<00:00:37.390> into<00:00:37.629> account<00:00:37.930> some<00:00:38.199> of<00:00:38.320> the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
didn't take into account some of the

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.690 
didn't take into account some of the
more<00:00:38.559> high<00:00:38.800> risk<00:00:39.070> behavior<00:00:39.520> that's

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
more high risk behavior that's

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.760 
more high risk behavior that's
associated<00:00:40.030> with<00:00:40.480> heavy<00:00:41.140> cough<00:00:41.469> coffee

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
associated with heavy cough coffee

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.770 
associated with heavy cough coffee
consumption<00:00:42.430> like<00:00:42.610> smoking<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:43.600> being

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
consumption like smoking and being

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.869 
consumption like smoking and being
sedentary<00:00:44.020> not<00:00:44.469> being<00:00:44.649> as<00:00:44.739> active<00:00:44.950> so<00:00:45.610> newer

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
sedentary not being as active so newer

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.340 
sedentary not being as active so newer
studies<00:00:46.180> are<00:00:46.420> really<00:00:46.719> taking<00:00:47.020> this<00:00:47.079> into

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
studies are really taking this into

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.020 
studies are really taking this into
account<00:00:47.649> controlling<00:00:48.550> for<00:00:48.730> that<00:00:48.850> when

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
account controlling for that when

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.130 
account controlling for that when
they're<00:00:49.149> looking<00:00:49.390> at<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.570> results<00:00:49.960> so<00:00:50.020> it's

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
they're looking at the results so it's

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.779 
they're looking at the results so it's
more<00:00:50.260> valid<00:00:50.739> ok<00:00:51.129> so<00:00:51.190> what<00:00:51.399> are<00:00:51.520> the<00:00:51.610> latest

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
more valid ok so what are the latest

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.240 
more valid ok so what are the latest
results<00:00:52.360> saying<00:00:52.570> so<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:53.050> latest<00:00:53.469> large<00:00:53.860> study

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
results saying so the latest large study

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.799 
results saying so the latest large study
that<00:00:54.430> looked<00:00:54.610> at<00:00:54.700> coffee<00:00:54.910> benefits<00:00:55.450> showed

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
that looked at coffee benefits showed

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.840 
that looked at coffee benefits showed
that<00:00:56.140> it<00:00:56.260> does<00:00:56.559> lower<00:00:56.980> our<00:00:57.219> risk<00:00:57.399> of<00:00:57.640> death

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
that it does lower our risk of death

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.010 
that it does lower our risk of death
whether<00:00:58.180> or<00:00:58.390> not<00:00:58.480> we're<00:00:58.660> drinking

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
whether or not we're drinking

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.470 
whether or not we're drinking
caffeinated<00:00:59.289> or<00:00:59.800> decaf<00:01:00.190> coffee<00:01:00.460> so<00:01:01.120> that's

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
caffeinated or decaf coffee so that's

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.450 
caffeinated or decaf coffee so that's
really<00:01:01.719> positive<00:01:02.289> news<00:01:02.469> it's<00:01:02.860> not<00:01:02.980> strong

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
really positive news it's not strong

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.950 
really positive news it's not strong
enough<00:01:03.520> to<00:01:03.760> suggest<00:01:04.210> that<00:01:04.300> non-drinkers

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
enough to suggest that non-drinkers

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.150 
enough to suggest that non-drinkers
should<00:01:05.170> all<00:01:05.350> of<00:01:05.440> a<00:01:05.500> sudden<00:01:05.710> start<00:01:05.890> drinking

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
should all of a sudden start drinking

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.410 
should all of a sudden start drinking
coffee<00:01:06.190> but<00:01:06.490> there's<00:01:06.759> definitely<00:01:07.090> no<00:01:07.210> risk

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
coffee but there's definitely no risk

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.730 
coffee but there's definitely no risk
and<00:01:07.570> there<00:01:07.690> are<00:01:07.840> some<00:01:08.050> benefits<00:01:08.140> that's<00:01:08.619> some

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
and there are some benefits that's some

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.660 
and there are some benefits that's some
real<00:01:08.920> positive<00:01:10.320> yeah<00:01:11.320> yeah<00:01:11.680> so<00:01:12.310> is<00:01:12.490> it<00:01:12.610> because

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
real positive yeah yeah so is it because

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.250 
real positive yeah yeah so is it because
of<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.030> caffeine<00:01:13.420> or<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.689> actual<00:01:13.990> coffee

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
of the caffeine or the actual coffee

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260 
of the caffeine or the actual coffee
it's<00:01:14.619> because<00:01:15.010> of<00:01:15.189> the<00:01:15.280> actual<00:01:15.640> coffee<00:01:15.850> and

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
it's because of the actual coffee and

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.760 
it's because of the actual coffee and
another<00:01:16.659> study<00:01:16.869> recently<00:01:17.170> came<00:01:17.500> out<00:01:17.619> that

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
another study recently came out that

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.109 
another study recently came out that
showed<00:01:18.010> that<00:01:18.189> it<00:01:18.280> lowers<00:01:18.549> our<00:01:18.760> risk<00:01:18.820> of

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
showed that it lowers our risk of

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.850 
showed that it lowers our risk of
chronic<00:01:19.390> diseases<00:01:19.810> such<00:01:19.990> as<00:01:20.110> Alzheimer's<00:01:20.350> and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's and

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.010 
chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's and
dementia<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.430> can<00:01:21.729> lower<00:01:21.939> aging<00:01:22.509> issues<00:01:22.840> such

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
dementia and can lower aging issues such

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.570 
dementia and can lower aging issues such
as<00:01:23.049> you<00:01:23.350> know<00:01:23.470> motor<00:01:23.770> developmental<00:01:24.490> or

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
as you know motor developmental or

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.609 
as you know motor developmental or
cognitive<00:01:25.060> issues<00:01:25.360> as<00:01:25.540> we<00:01:25.689> age<00:01:25.869> so<00:01:26.439> these

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
cognitive issues as we age so these

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.499 
cognitive issues as we age so these
brain<00:01:26.979> protective<00:01:27.580> effects<00:01:27.909> are<00:01:28.119> due<00:01:28.299> to<00:01:28.420> the

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
brain protective effects are due to the

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.359 
brain protective effects are due to the
high<00:01:28.720> antioxidant<00:01:29.560> levels<00:01:29.770> in<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.189> coffee

and<00:01:34.630> studies<00:01:35.350> have<00:01:35.380> shown<00:01:35.590> that<00:01:35.619> caffeinated

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
and studies have shown that caffeinated

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.530 
and studies have shown that caffeinated
coffee<00:01:36.220> does<00:01:36.700> decrease<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.240> risk<00:01:37.390> of

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
coffee does decrease the risk of

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.440 
coffee does decrease the risk of
diabetes<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.829> also<00:01:39.250> can<00:01:39.490> change<00:01:39.700> our<00:01:39.970> DNA

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
diabetes it also can change our DNA

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.270 
diabetes it also can change our DNA
within<00:01:40.780> our<00:01:40.869> muscles<00:01:41.320> similar<00:01:41.799> to<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.009> effect

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
within our muscles similar to the effect

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.100 
within our muscles similar to the effect
that<00:01:42.340> we<00:01:42.430> get<00:01:42.610> when<00:01:42.729> exercising<00:01:43.060> that<00:01:43.840> doesn't

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
that we get when exercising that doesn't

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.870 
that we get when exercising that doesn't
mean<00:01:44.200> we<00:01:44.290> have<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.470> stop<00:01:44.710> exercising<00:01:45.460> but<00:01:45.759> it

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
mean we have to stop exercising but it

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.520 
mean we have to stop exercising but it
does<00:01:46.030> mean<00:01:46.270> that<00:01:46.299> we<00:01:46.479> can<00:01:46.659> change<00:01:46.930> our<00:01:47.200> muscle

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
does mean that we can change our muscle

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.230 
does mean that we can change our muscle
structure<00:01:47.860> if<00:01:47.950> we<00:01:48.070> drink<00:01:48.369> so<00:01:48.729> if<00:01:48.939> native

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
structure if we drink so if native

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.389 
structure if we drink so if native
coffee<00:01:49.450> drink<00:01:50.110> enough<00:01:50.439> does<00:01:50.680> it<00:01:50.829> cause<00:01:51.070> weight

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
coffee drink enough does it cause weight

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.359 
coffee drink enough does it cause weight
loss<00:01:51.430> well<00:01:52.180> you<00:01:52.600> know<00:01:52.890> caffeinate<00:01:53.890> caffeine

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
loss well you know caffeinate caffeine

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.069 
loss well you know caffeinate caffeine
in<00:01:54.460> about<00:01:54.640> one<00:01:54.820> cup<00:01:55.000> of<00:01:55.119> coffee<00:01:55.329> can<00:01:55.659> speed<00:01:56.049> up

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
in about one cup of coffee can speed up

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.560 
in about one cup of coffee can speed up
your<00:01:56.229> metabolism<00:01:56.619> about<00:01:57.159> 15%<00:01:57.570> temporarily

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
your metabolism about 15% temporarily

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.420 
your metabolism about 15% temporarily
right<00:01:59.110> so<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.380> key<00:01:59.500> word<00:01:59.680> there<00:01:59.829> is<00:01:59.890> temporary

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
right so the key word there is temporary

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.840 
right so the key word there is temporary
and<00:02:00.759> it<00:02:01.420> can<00:02:01.630> suppress<00:02:02.020> our<00:02:02.200> hunger<00:02:02.530> again<00:02:03.520> not

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
and it can suppress our hunger again not

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.190 
and it can suppress our hunger again not
long<00:02:04.030> term<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:04.509> it<00:02:04.570> doesn't<00:02:04.810> lead<00:02:04.930> to<00:02:04.960> weight

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
long term so it doesn't lead to weight

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.109 
long term so it doesn't lead to weight
