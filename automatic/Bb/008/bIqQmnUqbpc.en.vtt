00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.950
 will have many hairs on his face but 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.750
 never in the language marc crosas did not have 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.250
 the expected debut in with blue due to 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.860
 painful setback at home before the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.150
 morelia by a 3-0 win and although it is 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.379
 a result that I did not expect for the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.310
 good preseason they had done 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.609
 fail the result with the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.829
 that we started the tournament is pretty 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.289
 disappointing by by by the 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.500
 forcefulness of the defeat but but yes 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.509
 that analyzing and 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.160
 and already with tranquility after 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.739
 have spent a few days 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.270
 well things were done about everything 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.870
 the first 30 minutes I think that 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.300
 we carry the weight of the game during 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.890
 at all times morelia 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.870
 practically did not cross the midfield 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.969
 we had many opportunities to do 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.820
 because they took advantage of us and they three 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.089
 that they took advantage of them and from there 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.430
 that forcefulness of the result is not 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.790
 something that is unacceptable because because 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.129
 we started losing at home 0-3 but 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.080
 but the performance of the team was not so 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.820
 bad as the result shows 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.500
 what Catalan did not like in his 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.119
 presentation as celestial were the 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.890
 whistles that at times took 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.270
 of his own hobby although he says 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.170
 understand the situation 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.930
 the fan pays his ticket for his 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.050
 fertilizer 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.140
 you have every right to express your 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.530
 feelings in your thinking if 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.330
 you are at that moment that is your thinking 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.500
 Well, what you have to do is 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:38.490
 work and try to change back to 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:43.240
 that mentality and that and that instead of 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.390
 boos and whistles and chants against 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.160
 of the team because everyone applauds and 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.560
 no joys but that is in our 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.830
 hands and that's the only way that 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.960
 we can change is working and taking out 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.280
 good results and playing well and what 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.229
 better than reversing the face of this 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.229
 team already immediately in a match 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.450
 classic before the chivas clear if you win is 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.340
 positive about forgetting 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.690
 fast a defeat like the one we suffer 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.860
 last saturday doing a good 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.100
 match on Sunday taking a good 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.960
 result of omnilife 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.550
 I believe that there is no better 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.490
 scenario there is no better match for 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.740
 lift head and stop and to demonstrate 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.160
 that this blue course is for things 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.160
 big
