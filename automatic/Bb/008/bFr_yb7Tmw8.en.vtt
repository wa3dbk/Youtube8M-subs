00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.160
 hi girls today rom video and this 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.120
 video that I wanted to do for so long you know 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.490
 now for the fact to be spilled video of 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.370
 comparing a versus between the real miss 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.570
 manga mega volume and the chase co white of 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.570
 essence which is always a mascara 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.609
 volumizing and you know how promised one 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.230
 life to find this damn skara 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.029
 finally I found that I did and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.279
 you will find a thousand comparisons 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.019
 the application as a two- pass application 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.269
 what i think about is the pipe cleaners 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.130
 all the photos with one eye 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.980
 touched and promote the eyes 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.240
 together and even now you see that or not 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.570
 I know if they are here anyway 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.030
 all this here and here at the manga and nothing 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.830
 so I leave you with the video without that 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.240
 the face lasts 10 thousand hours 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.560
 let me know which one you prefer 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.570
 have you tried one of the two or what is the 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.280
 your the preferred scale in general myself 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.410
 my passions must be paid to me 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.420
 then I go to open up this eye 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.920
 my left eye and the mis manga of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.590
 the oreal makes you give up the pipe cleaner then 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.910
 the discount bermano item because I think that 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.340
 on youtube was made to say about this 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.370
 mascara but you know he would bet me 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.500
 do the same with the pipe cleaner and cone 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.300
 then part of the base more 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.690
 large is the smallest tip 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.240
 peculiarity is that you see it bends 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.590
 in my opinion a useless thing useful for 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.940
 remove excess product not 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.710
 useful for eye application 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.690
 indeed I think it is one of the phases 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.340
 uncomfortable this mascara for what 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.770
 you have long enough eyelashes 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.420
 tends to pry so it's like the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.780
 mascara bends if it did this 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.460
 shot is not quite so without life of 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.540
 however it can be masked for everything 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.630
 this risk 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.909
 the mascara is beautiful black I don't know if yes 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.680
 still sees beautiful black and the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.180
 composition is not that it is too liquid 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.010
 not too thick I like it wants some 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.970
 more dense then in my opinion among some 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.500
 time 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.540
 it will be even better because it will be beautiful 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.710
 on the built I show you how the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.710
 first pass both above and below 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.200
 ok this is the first pass i find 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.790
 very comfortable the fact that it has a tip 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.650
 so I lower my eyelashes and do 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.030
 peak and I don't give vent because I often 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.230
 and gladly those mascara in the part 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.209
 affect me dirty because I 'm not 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.620
 patient the third to hurry e 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.510
 of course mascara is one of those 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.640
 things like the ather for example that don't 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.069
 they go high when you're in a hurry and 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.129
 this point from the name says to be 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.750
 mega volume has first this one 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.379
 past is allowed as the past likes 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.329
 very very much 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.379
 I think the effect can be seen later 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.690
 naturally at the end of this 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.489
 I will give you a photo interview 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.720
 with mascara and a photo without mascara 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.879
 so then you will also see a moment there 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.209
 difference but still the difference is 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.810
 Note 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.190
 I have better long lashes then 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.290
 for me it was handed over to ask 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.890
 cherry quite long because of it 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.049
 I repeat the fact of this less than 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.970
 that folds is not extremely comfortable 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.540
 let's take a second pass that we see 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.540
 the final effect 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.049
 then I love this final effect 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.120
 so much on mine on my eye goes 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.769
 however a little to thicken the 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.209
 part of the hairline so a little bit 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.489
 of profile effect from but in my opinion from 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.540
 so much the length effect that is not 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.040
 I think I see it's a little bit tends to 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.330
 paste the eyelashes but just like hulk 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.840
 he said for his review is 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.370
 the effect is manga and manga characters 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.660
 have these eyelashes a little attached that 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.790
 give the effect that bigger eye 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.560
 I repeat, I personally like it very much 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.690
 with two passes more often afterwards 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.610
 I'm going to put the stocks of 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.920
 kiko but you know I really use this 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.959
 with everything I would eat it even at breakfast 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.200
 if possible then let's say in this 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.629
 very very nice effect I like it 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.250
 so personally i got dirty but 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.650
 strictly not even me dirty because 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.970
 pretty comfortable sweeper and nothing 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.739
 so I leave you to the photos and move on to 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.489
 while instead the chance with wild of 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.489
 assent 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.419
 here we are precisely in applying the 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.040
 cisco wilde of essences on this other 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.109
 eye because here javier does not care about 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.400
 mis manga then why did I take this 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.230
 mascara because the location neither too 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.540
 pretty and those soft tubetti type 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.310
 of toothpaste and this will always come 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.400
 out of the 23 euros are seven and medium 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.889
 then produced half of this no 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.080
 this I have not said this 8.5 times 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.690
 mld however this comes more so 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.510
 Port 10 on 11 euro ap soap and 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.210
 this point to as 7 ml from a duration of 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.240
 six months and this is always six months e 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.190
 the pipe cleaner this have been for a while longer 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.729
 time therefore a little more dry it 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.440
 score is inherent in and everything is done aa 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.120
 balls practically not all balls 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.500
 no one over another then this 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.030
 effect a little so it is president the thing 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.500
 comfortable of this mascara that you can 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.720
 take where on your said then 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.940
 mascara takes so much product maybe 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.620
 too much and I tell you right away that 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.440
 I had only scanu that drives me crazy it 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.580
 use for the day but rarely anyway 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.120
 let's do the first time we see 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.260
 the effect is the thing that promises a 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.460
 then volumizing mascara both 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.460
 they are of volumizing mascara 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.200
 among these with a pass and I don't know 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.770
 when you see however I will I write 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.910
 then of course you see the photo is 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.710
 practically doing this mascara 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.500
 according to me a bit more mess 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.290
 eyelashes and why it takes so much product 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.210
 too sticky then leave me 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.730
 even more bits of mascara 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.700
 because in my opinion not to a ie with 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.080
 this fact of that soft then that 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.210
 you can push us towards the product 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.470
 mind the product you see you can do it 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.010
 I don't even know if you see instead 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.470
 comes out 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.280
 so there is a risk that they will then fuck him 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.650
 take yourself too much 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.820
 look and he couldn't do that 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.420
 well then I recommend you first 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.280
 to pass it on the little mouth here and to 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.240
 remove excess product because 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.950
 it takes another and will let 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.900
 grumetti I don't find it comfortable to 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.420
 apply the meal under and in my opinion 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.470
 there is not too short of it while you are calling for it 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.940
 me was too long this is too much 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.920
 so I find it difficult to court 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.540
 however, let's move on to do one 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.780
 second pass and we see the effect 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.780
 the final 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.640
 then I don't know if you notice but on 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.260
 upper lashes while all comics 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.910
 of product precisely because yes 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.530
 from the effect much using that is yes 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.840
 sees the difference but from the effect more 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.610
 messy you have to work it well you have to 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.290
 to lay it down well because it dries up 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.190
 so much and after a while so dry precisely the 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:00.390
 product becomes too long I think 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.470
 I personally don't mind this 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.360
 effect is that I like eyelashes 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.860
 very marked though if I have to choose 32 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.970
 fresh this case effect much more 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.570
 ordered this is quite an effect 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:11.640
 weighed down and therefore I intend to make one 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.130
 only one very abundant passed for 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.240
 not being able to go over it again 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.100
 but here he honestly doesn't have a mascara 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.480
 that I will buy them anyway it gives me a 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.220
 nice effect that opened without 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.470
 making it too heavy to put this life 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.980
 just a heavy effect too 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.510
 so between the two I tell you I like it more 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:31.860
 this recommended acate eyelashes 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:33.540
 better to ask this longer 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.220
 short eyelashes maybe even more comfortable 

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.360
 because that will be a little too long 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.069
 it is very strong 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.419
 but here I sincerely don't 

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:41.039
 I will buy again now I will try to 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:43.919
 finish it anyway when almost annoyed 

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:45.870
 I will throw very sad, however, in my opinion 

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:47.909
 I leave too many grumbles I do n't know if it shows 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:50.159
 maybe you can change photos you will see 

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:52.500
 too heavy ie apart from getting dirty in 

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:54.449
 but that is the problem 

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.789
 I don't know how heavy I am 

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:57.900
 are produced brugnettini of product and 

00:07:56.789 --> 00:07:59.849
 so nothing this is my opinion 

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.349
 on these 2 mascara let me know if it 

00:07:59.849 --> 00:08:02.729
