00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:05.560 
I guess if you're going on a boat it's a

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.559 
I guess if you're going on a boat it's a
good<00:00:05.710> idea<00:00:05.859> to<00:00:06.100> have<00:00:06.189> two<00:00:06.550> anchors<00:00:07.000> that<00:00:07.029> way

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:07.569 
good idea to have two anchors that way

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:09.449 
good idea to have two anchors that way
there's<00:00:08.139> no<00:00:08.350> chance<00:00:08.680> your<00:00:08.950> boat<00:00:09.129> will<00:00:09.280> go

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:09.459 
there's no chance your boat will go

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:11.400 
there's no chance your boat will go
drifting<00:00:09.879> off<00:00:10.270> when<00:00:10.690> you<00:00:10.809> where<00:00:11.139> you<00:00:11.290> don't

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
drifting off when you where you don't

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.890 
drifting off when you where you don't
want<00:00:11.559> it<00:00:11.860> when<00:00:12.219> you<00:00:12.370> don't<00:00:12.490> want<00:00:12.730> it<00:00:12.849> to<00:00:13.090> so

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
want it when you don't want it to so

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
this is pretty easy and it just has two

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.170

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159 
it all cut out so what I'm going to do

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.520 
it all cut out so what I'm going to do
is<00:00:42.489> so<00:00:42.760> these<00:00:42.909> three<00:00:43.210> bars<00:00:43.690> together<00:00:44.049> in<00:00:44.409> the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
is so these three bars together in the

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.530 
is so these three bars together in the
center<00:00:44.739> and<00:00:45.100> then<00:00:45.190> we'll<00:00:45.850> just<00:00:46.030> start<00:00:46.239> adding

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
center and then we'll just start adding

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.810 
center and then we'll just start adding
these<00:00:46.809> triangles<00:00:47.379> as<00:00:47.739> if<00:00:48.129> we<00:00:48.309> were<00:00:48.430> doing<00:00:48.699> a

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
these triangles as if we were doing a

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.750 
these triangles as if we were doing a
square<00:00:49.150> in<00:00:49.269> a<00:00:49.390> square<00:00:49.510> quilt<00:00:50.170> block<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.670> I've

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
triangles around the outside and i do

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.780 
triangles around the outside and i do
these<00:01:10.300> across<00:01:10.900> from<00:01:11.140> each<00:01:11.170> other<00:01:11.350> too<00:01:11.680> so<00:01:12.010> i'll

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
these across from each other too so i'll

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.880 
these across from each other too so i'll
let<00:01:12.970> these<00:01:13.210> two<00:01:13.450> sides<00:01:13.720> and<00:01:14.140> then<00:01:14.650> i'll<00:01:14.740> add

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
let these two sides and then i'll add

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.670 
let these two sides and then i'll add
the<00:01:15.040> other<00:01:15.130> two<00:01:15.570> got<00:01:16.570> these<00:01:16.780> two<00:01:16.990> sides<00:01:17.260> sewn

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
the other two got these two sides sewn

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.950 
the other two got these two sides sewn
on<00:01:17.890> so<00:01:18.280> i'll<00:01:18.400> just<00:01:18.460> add<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.270> top<00:01:19.690> and<00:01:19.870> the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
on so i'll just add the top and the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.810 
on so i'll just add the top and the
bottom<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.440> then<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.250> block<00:01:21.520> will<00:01:21.700> be

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
bottom and then the block will be
