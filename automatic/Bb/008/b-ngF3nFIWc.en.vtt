00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
well and I think in a gateway so Jane be

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.680 
well and I think in a gateway so Jane be
confusing<00:00:08.189> me<00:00:08.429> again<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:09.030> might<00:00:09.480> be<00:00:09.599> actually

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690

one rear I'm assuming is waiting for the
second<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:55.800> he's<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.250> river

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
second one he's going to have that river

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.580 
second one he's going to have that river
at<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.579> natural<00:00:56.969> Expo<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.600> those<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
at the natural Expo so those so the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.599 
at the natural Expo so those so the
hydras<00:00:58.859> not<00:00:58.980> gonna<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.190> able<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> do<00:00:59.489> much

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
hydras not gonna be able to do much

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.430 
hydras not gonna be able to do much
damage<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.510> what<00:01:00.780> we're<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.320> good

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
damage and here what we're the good

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.840 
damage and here what we're the good
precision<00:01:01.710> comes<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.280> he's<00:01:02.399> set<00:01:02.609> up<00:01:02.730> this

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
precision comes because he's set up this

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.479 
precision comes because he's set up this
position<00:01:03.329> at<00:01:03.449> his<00:01:03.570> natural<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.530> would<00:01:05.400> have

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
position at his natural and would have

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.250 
position at his natural and would have
been<00:01:05.580> much<00:01:05.670> more<00:01:05.729> harder<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.119> defend<00:01:06.390> now<00:01:06.659> from

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
been much more harder to defend now from

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.679 
been much more harder to defend now from
those<00:01:07.439> hydras<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.280> now<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:09.030> he<00:01:09.270> picks<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.570> his

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
those hydras but now as he picks up his

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.359 
those hydras but now as he picks up his
third<00:01:09.750> if<00:01:10.140> he<00:01:10.200> had<00:01:10.320> picked<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.770> his<00:01:10.860> third<00:01:11.070> here

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
third if he had picked up his third here

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.130 
third if he had picked up his third here
but<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.000> he's<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:12.330> safely<00:01:12.689> pick<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:13.020> his

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
but now he's can safely pick up his

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.390 
but now he's can safely pick up his
third<00:01:13.409> at<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> lower<00:01:13.979> left-hand<00:01:14.340> sem<00:01:14.850> o'clock

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
third at the lower left-hand sem o'clock

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.310 
third at the lower left-hand sem o'clock
so<00:01:17.400> fairly<00:01:17.790> easy<00:01:17.970> wonder<00:01:18.659> couple<00:01:18.990> moving<00:01:19.140> on

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
so fairly easy wonder couple moving on

that<00:03:00.329> was<00:03:00.480> at<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.840> upper<00:03:01.079> right<00:03:01.230> hand<00:03:01.469> so<00:03:01.739> he's

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
that was at the upper right hand so he's

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.170 
that was at the upper right hand so he's
thinking<00:03:01.980> about<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.430> two<00:03:02.549> o'clock<00:03:02.790> position

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
thinking about that two o'clock position

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.640 
thinking about that two o'clock position
take<00:03:03.329> that<00:03:03.510> for<00:03:03.629> himself<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:04.200> course<00:03:04.409> if<00:03:04.530> you

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
take that for himself of course if you

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.890 
take that for himself of course if you
pick<00:03:05.579> apart<00:03:05.700> if<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.359> have<00:03:06.689> your<00:03:06.810> natural

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
pick apart if you have your natural

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.539 
pick apart if you have your natural
expansion<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.500> can<00:03:07.620> pick<00:03:07.829> apart<00:03:07.950> some<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.489> the

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
expansion you can pick apart some of the

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.610 
expansion you can pick apart some of the
eggs<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.090> get<00:03:09.299> access<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.079> one<00:03:10.409> of<00:03:10.530> those

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
eggs and get access to one of those

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.229 
eggs and get access to one of those
clothes<00:03:10.919> and<00:03:11.129> bases<00:03:11.489> but<00:03:11.909> it's<00:03:12.030> still<00:03:12.120> going

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
clothes and bases but it's still going

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.770 
clothes and bases but it's still going
to<00:03:12.299> be<00:03:12.359> close<00:03:12.599> then<00:03:12.810> on<00:03:12.989> another<00:03:13.349> side<00:03:14.780> so

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
to be close then on another side so

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.149 
to be close then on another side so
overall<00:03:16.019> it's<00:03:16.290> it's<00:03:16.620> going<00:03:16.739> to<00:03:16.829> be<00:03:16.919> a<00:03:16.950> fairly

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
overall it's it's going to be a fairly

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.619 
overall it's it's going to be a fairly
easily<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.669> defend<00:03:17.909> base<00:03:18.030> can<00:03:18.180> be<00:03:18.209> fairly<00:03:18.479> easy

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
easily to defend base can be fairly easy

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.250 
easily to defend base can be fairly easy
base<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.989> reinforce<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:20.720> 0<00:03:21.720> starts<00:03:22.019> off<00:03:22.109> by

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
base to reinforce so 0 starts off by

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.140 
base to reinforce so 0 starts off by
taking<00:03:22.409> off<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.769> risky<00:03:23.220> base<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.699> a<00:03:23.760> hard<00:03:23.970> base

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
taking off a risky base and a hard base

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.020 
taking off a risky base and a hard base
to<00:03:24.329> hold<00:03:24.479> that<00:03:24.629> the<00:03:24.810> inside<00:03:25.409> 12<00:03:26.190> but<00:03:26.790> after<00:03:26.879> I

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
to hold that the inside 12 but after I

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.580 
to hold that the inside 12 but after I
gonna<00:03:27.209> follow<00:03:27.479> that<00:03:27.690> up<00:03:27.750> by<00:03:27.840> picking<00:03:28.349> up<00:03:28.440> a

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
gonna follow that up by picking up a

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.530 
gonna follow that up by picking up a
somewhat<00:03:29.370> easier<00:03:29.609> base<00:03:29.790> also<00:03:30.150> has<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.269> lot<00:03:30.510> of

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
somewhat easier base also has a lot of

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.819 
somewhat easier base also has a lot of
over<00:03:30.750> words<00:03:30.930> with<00:03:31.049> drop<00:03:31.260> ready<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.709> might
