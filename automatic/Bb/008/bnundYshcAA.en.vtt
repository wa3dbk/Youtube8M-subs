 three great accessory under the carabiner 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.250
 microusb connectors are located for charging 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.750
 of our device as well as aux for those 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.140
 who has no bluetooth in a personal gadget 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.200
 dinosaur hi in bluetooth mode 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.179
 our baby gives 5 hours of life is not bad 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.520

 microphone available for hands-free calling 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.159
 communication is also near the light 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.200
 indicator 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.210
 dependence on which we see in which 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.130
 mode is our device so 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.470
 if lit blue bluetooth is connected 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.750
 blinking alternately blue red 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.789
 pairing if flashing is just blue 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.979
 pairing with a saved device or 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.630
 same music playing the top of our barrel 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.509
 the speaker is located directly 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:58.200
 its diameter is only 5 4 centimeters but 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:02:00.689
 he cooks what you need power output 3 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.890
 watts and the frequency range ranges from 40 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.890
 Hertz to 20 kilohertz 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.410
 the lower part has a rubber 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.780
 framing to our column firmly 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.030
 stood on any surface also here 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.440
 the power button is located in the middle 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.599
 which performs several functions 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.670
 for example in bluetooth mode 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.250
 she is in charge of reproduction and either 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.900
 pause and answer the incoming call 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.260
 hold the button for a few seconds 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.160
 the device turns on and off 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.260
 use of the column turned 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:38.110
 suitable in different conditions under it 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:41.260
 can sing great in the shower cooks on 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.510
 the kitchen under the favorite TV series slave izaura 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.700

 teens listening to your favorite music in the yard 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.019
 not yet to be 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.250
 gayb for its value of 35 40 dollars 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.230
 it will definitely be available to everyone and 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.550
 agree now on a picnic is not necessary 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.710
 plant and the battery of your car 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.420
 if you have an auto-party at your picnic 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.210
 can easily charge a column with 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.100
 using this thing that it ask you 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.800
 and how can I charge the column using 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.780
 this glamorous lighter no this more 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.880
 useful thing than just a lighter 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.800
 present to your attention a portable 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.870
 charger from the canyon company 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.940
 the beginning of the review, I thought for a long time what is 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.860
 You can tell the battery well plan 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.470
 This is their main function charge that 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.450
 there is still but its design has done its job 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.950
 four out of five people I interviewed 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.050
 that resembles this subject 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.210
 answered anything but not 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.450
 battery it was and lighter and 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.340
 lipstick and perfume and even stunner one i 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.070
 I can highlight all the answers sounded 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.780
 that the thing is stylish compact and catchy 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.000
 attention to color 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.400
 horse company also took care 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.350
 gold silver black green and 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.740
 even blue under all this beauty 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.440
 lies liteon battery capacity of 2600 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.180
 milliampere hour weight only 70 grams 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.550
 the principle of operation is very simple 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.250
 via microusb port our power bank 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.380
 charging from laptop or outlet in 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.500
 two to three hours information about 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.580
 charge you will be 4 LEDs 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.989
 depending on the charge device 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:21.080
 lit 1 2 3 or 4 diode ratio 25 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.810
 50 75 or one hundred percent charge 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.700
 then through the usual yuesby port we can 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.980
 charge any device coming down 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.990
 voltage of 5 volts after connecting 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.300
 let's say the phone push the button 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.340
 switching on the power banks and immediately 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.350
 the charge indicator lights come on 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.540
 dependence began on residual 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.320
 battery charge capacity LEDs 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.510
 starts to fade 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.770
 I really liked this device 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.690
 and even come in handy 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.550
 there is a problem with fast cutting 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.500
 height myths have not yet decided 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.910
 Yes, and at a price of 20 dollars this thing 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.780
 should have every bag 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.800
 well, or in a pocket with such a design well 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.870
 and completes our review 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.900
 another device from the canyon company 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.610
 headphones cns petri network headphones 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.130
 Available in three color variations. 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.270
 blue red and yellow loves company 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.169
 canyon all color 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.389
 By design, I remind headphones 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.279
 all already known beat a doctor cliff 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.499
 here is the headphone connection system 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:15.719
 two-way cable with minijack outlets 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:17.849
 and folding headphones for convenient 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:19.919
 material transport used 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.370
 pleasant to the touch matte rubberized 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.740
 plastic 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.740
 as well as ear and head pads 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.100
 but the sound they give out is average 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.919
 testing was done on iphone 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.270
 iphone and landline yet 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.130
 depending on the change of the collider sound 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.350
 changed however not very noticeable 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.540
 lovers of classic sound and jazz 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.280
 they will not be appreciated by electronic 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.979
 the music sounded quite good 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.810
 connoisseurs of rent and crayfish will be satisfied 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.960
 Well, now the numbers that tell us 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.470
 manufacturer speaker diameter 40 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.840
 millimeters 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.150
 sensitivity then 8 annoyed frequency 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.810
 response ranges from 20 hertz to 20 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.180
 kHz 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.039
 again about the sound guys this is just 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.630
 my subjective opinion I think everyone for 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.090
 decide for themselves they fit him 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.919
 or not but for the price of 25 dollars i 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.020
 I think this option is the place to be in 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.270
 untrained user so 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.400
 or otherwise acquire the power bank column 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.350
 maybe headphones or all at once 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.580
 everyone decides for himself and we only help 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.580
 make you the right choice
