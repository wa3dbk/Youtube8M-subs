00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.700
 as you can expressly observe as well 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.800
 that as far as you can deduce this is a 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.170
 exchanges but it's not an exchange 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.580
 is normal and is capable of exchanging 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.130
 channels we have also exchanged 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.770
 million is to say he has given me his script 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.149
 I give domain what we have interpreted and 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.579
 we have raised it in that you have 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.500
 exchanged maximums so if 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.110
 you want to see alex you only have to then to 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.329
 your channel and watch your video as you know 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.340
 that came up so very case and very pure very of 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.739
 deeply rooted traditions of the opus 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.020
 we are in fact I know him from there like that 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.180
 that I bring you a very simple topic is not 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.280
 short there are many types of laptops 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.530
 but basically we can reduce it to 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.989
 two the first type and organ to the media 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.850
 because they are small and handle them in addition 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.890
 of the posts due to its reduced 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.719
 size since they fit anywhere if 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.880
 you have very big hands and you are little 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:08.990
 skillful or you're a clumsy fucker to the best 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.060
 they may seem 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.860
 but in practice you'll see that you can 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.810
 do real wonders with the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.790
 small size of those laptops do not 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.590
 you have to create an insecurity for a 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.420
 complex but you have to have in 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.549
 mind that what counts is the power 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.560
 of the device and we size the second type 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.960
 laptops are the biggest the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.340
 the most well-known the most gifted ones offer a 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.320
 lots of fun 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.390
 also but you can not be all the 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.460
 stale day dale that I hit you you have to 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.740
 let it rest because I know it 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.620
 unfortunately from experience is that 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:44.650
 I'm fashionable I have some boxes 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:47.800
 this is not this either 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.440
 in this here is 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.640
 big and you'll wonder what happened I'll 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.410
 I'll say you have to treat it with 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.180
 softness to know what you do in each 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.030
 moment because if you can not brown it 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.870
 and if the back really can happen to you 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.970
 exactly this is a league 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.950
 finally you're careful with them and I'm 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.330
 super proud to have this embroidery and 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.520
 the truth is that the minimum I can 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.570
 I took it out and boasted about it in public what 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.070
 that yes it is true is that its great 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.870
 size limits the possibility of 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.670
 find covers that cover it for 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.470
 so look, you'll find the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.540
 adequate because if not our device is 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.400
 can deteriorate and that brings us a 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.050
 great disgust the truth in the end I think 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.760
 that in a broad sense these are the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.170
 two types of laptops that there are yes 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.670
 remember that you have to use protection 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.890
 since there is a lot of virus 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.140
 lately and use them with a lot of affection 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.150
 but do not get hooked on him you do not want 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.460
 an addiction to them although good is 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.260
 just a recommendation in order and until 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.640
 here my video today I hope that I have 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.380
 liked the video as much as me 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.910
 record it if you liked the video give 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.860
 the little hand up and share it with 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.270
 your colleagues and with everyone and 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.010
 How do I know that you are missing 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.000
 Ã¡lex you can go to my channel to watch your video 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.920
 I leave it here 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.250
 Also if you want to take a look at my 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.750
 videos for me 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.730
 and nothing else for me has been a pleasure 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.940
 be here today where there is success 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.940
 good 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.870
 and with me even if out of curiosity
