00:00:33.468 --> 00:00:37.962
 You will call Abraham, for I will make you father of many nations. 

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.574
 Genesis, chapter 17, verse 5. 

00:00:51.044 --> 00:00:56.021
 &lt;i&gt; History loves legend more than people. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:02.279
 &lt;i&gt; More pleasing nobility, than brutality. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.299
 &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;i&gt; 

00:01:09.583 --> 00:01:15.522
 &lt;i&gt; History remembers the battle and forgets the blood. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:15.557 --> 00:01:17.493
 14 APRIL, 1865 

00:01:17.527 --> 00:01:23.026
 &lt;i&gt; What history remember me, if I ever remember ... &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:27.405
 &lt;i&gt; It will be just a fraction of the truth. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.261
 &lt;i&gt; For whatever else I am, husband, lawyer, president ... &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:34.297 --> 00:01:41.083
 &lt;i&gt; I'll always be considered a man who fought against the darkness. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:47.905
 &lt;i&gt; I'm leaving your faithful hands, my dear friend Henry, &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.403
 &lt;i&gt; This record that begins when I was just a boy. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:53.442 --> 00:01:56.819
 Pigeon Creek, Indiana, 1818. 

00:01:56.853 --> 00:02:00.108
 Come on, hurry up! Drop them down, let's go! 

00:02:00.144 --> 00:02:04.638
 Please sir! This is some mistake, I'm not a slave. 

00:02:04.678 --> 00:02:09.293
 Not! Let them go! - Get back inside! 

00:02:10.176 --> 00:02:13.551
 Will! - Quiet! - He's my friend! 

00:02:13.587 --> 00:02:18.683
 Do not look at Abraham, it does not concern us. Do not look. 

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:38.065
 Oh my God! Abraham! 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.110
 Are you OK? 

00:02:53.836 --> 00:02:56.002
 Did you hit my friend? - He beat my son! 

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:59.613
 Did you hit him, Lincoln? - They are not slaves, and you know that. 

00:02:59.654 --> 00:03:03.065
 I suggest you go back to work before you end up in chains. 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.134
 Until every man is free, we are all slaves. 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.076
 Alright. Since you are so busy with freedom, 

00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:14.983
 consider yourself freed from the burden of my employment. 

00:03:15.017 --> 00:03:17.877
 Come on, let's go. - And the debt you have done, 

00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:23.930
 I would like to pay my full attention. Right away, I'll pray. 

00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:32.518
 If you get a coin from me, Mr. Barts, 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:37.575
 will come in a clenched tip. 

00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:43.438
 All right, Mr Lincoln. 

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:48.488
 There are other ways to collect debt. 

00:04:49.404 --> 00:04:52.695
 What's happening to her father ?! Please help her! 

00:04:52.728 --> 00:04:56.787
 You have to do something to your father! 

00:04:56.827 --> 00:05:01.000
 Slow child. - Do not look at Abraham. 

00:05:03.527 --> 00:05:07.541
 I've never seen anything like that. Weird. 

00:05:07.577 --> 00:05:11.554
 Promise me... 

00:05:11.954 --> 00:05:15.367
 Let's get out. 

00:05:23.392 --> 00:05:28.408
 Abraham, come on fire with me. 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.248
 I wrote my mom. 

00:05:43.857 --> 00:05:47.749
 The days are as fast as the Indian arrow. 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.361
 I'm running like a star of the paddle. 

00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:56.256
 Today is here. 

00:05:56.291 --> 00:06:01.076
 Then he rushed in a hurry. 

00:06:01.112 --> 00:06:05.245
 We can never say it's ours. 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.544
 He just passed it. 

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:20.172
 Mother? 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.553
 &lt;i&gt; Mom told me once that I did not cry when I was born. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:06:29.594 --> 00:06:35.196
 &lt;i&gt; I just opened my eyes, looked at her smiling face, &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:06:35.233 --> 00:06:39.808
 &lt;i&gt; and replied with a smile. My light is gone. &lt;/ I&gt; 

00:06:39.844 --> 00:06:46.152
 I do not know how he did it ... - Abraham, you promised me. 

00:06:46.567 --> 00:06:50.551
 You promised me you would not do anything stupid. 

00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:58.228
 Nine years later, her father joined her in death. 

00:06:58.264 --> 00:07:02.291
 &lt;i&gt; Unbalanced with my promise, I tried &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:07:02.328 --> 00:07:06.320
 &lt;i&gt; gather the courage to run my revenge. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:13.665
 Have not you drank enough? 

00:07:14.702 --> 00:07:18.520
 This guy just feels like this when he wants to kiss a girl, 

00:07:18.562 --> 00:07:21.965
 or kill a man. 

00:07:35.783 --> 00:07:39.601
 Adam, let me explain. - Last Bartse. 

00:07:39.637 --> 00:07:43.419
 I will not come here to clean up your nerds. 

00:07:53.295 --> 00:07:55.749
 So where's Henry? 

00:07:55.785 --> 00:07:58.898
 Ah yes, we were looking everywhere sir, both low and high. 

00:07:58.934 --> 00:08:03.338
 It is less likely. Just find him Bartse. 

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:09.978
 And send a fresh berry to the south, we have to eat a lot of mouth. 

00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:12.592
 Yes sir. 

00:08:47.575 --> 00:08:51.185
 For my mother. 

00:08:55.459 --> 00:09:00.024
 Well, we're not lucky. You could have shaken me off. 

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.759
 Where the hell are you going ?! 

00:09:04.672 --> 00:09:07.540
 Nobody likes to hunt chickens. 

00:09:07.577 --> 00:09:13.179
 The little boy grew up, came to revenge his beloved mom. 

00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:16.255
 There are 2 types of people, Mr Lincoln, 

00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:21.686
 those who have the courage to pull the trigger, and those who do not have. 

00:09:22.184 --> 00:09:27.703
 Pockets, canvas, ball, do not mess. 

00:09:27.739 --> 00:09:31.562
 You did not sleep that night, did you? 

00:09:34.965 --> 00:09:38.804
 The ball was shot by Mr. Lincoln. 

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.463
 Your mum's blood was blurry. 

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:46.086
 I hope your taste is better! 

00:12:22.012 --> 00:12:26.679
 Can I suggest we start closing the door? 

00:12:26.714 --> 00:12:30.462
 Yeah, I'm sorry. 

00:12:30.502 --> 00:12:33.600
 I have not seen anything. 

00:12:41.848 --> 00:12:44.544
 Can we go immediately? 

00:12:44.584 --> 00:12:48.165
 Or is Gabriellie too overwhelmed? 

00:12:49.292 --> 00:12:51.268
 I apologize, but who are you? 

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:56.131
 I'm Henry Sturges, you're in my home. 

00:12:56.167 --> 00:12:59.315
 What happened... 

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:04.500
 I saved your life in a more than a miserable attempt to take someone else. 

00:13:04.536 --> 00:13:09.007
 What were you doing there and how did you know I would try to kill Barts? 

00:13:11.502 --> 00:13:17.537
 How? I watched the boy execute his first long-awaited mission, 

00:13:17.572 --> 00:13:23.572
 And that would, I would add, drunk, and I think you've come back to this Henry. 

00:13:23.612 --> 00:13:27.595
 He is not promising recruit, he's alone 

00:13:27.635 --> 00:13:31.619
 a selfish boy whose heart is just a vengeance. 

00:13:31.659 --> 00:13:37.574
 You did not realize this boy was a damn idiot! 

00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:42.322
 I doubt that he even knew his target was a vampire. 

00:13:42.357 --> 00:13:46.591
 Vampire? - Yes, immortal demons shedding blood. 

00:13:46.627 --> 00:13:51.053
 Fortunately for you, Mr. Lincoln, hunting for them is a kind of hobby. 

00:13:51.088 --> 00:13:54.553
 Vampires are just myths. - The myths do not stop you 

00:13:54.593 --> 00:13:58.174
 after you put the bullet in your brain. 

00:13:58.214 --> 00:14:02.922
 Not Mr. Lincoln, the vampires are real, they exist in every town, 

00:14:02.957 --> 00:14:07.348
 in each country of the Union. 

00:14:08.153 --> 00:14:10.647
 If that's what you tell the truth, you could help him kill me, 

00:14:10.688 --> 00:14:14.390
 I could pay you to kill him. - My services are not for sale. 

00:14:14.425 --> 00:14:16.487
 And the word you seek is "destroyed" 

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:21.430
 it's a real challenge to kill what's already dead. 

00:14:24.448 --> 00:14:28.874
 But you do not understand, my mother was killed. 

00:14:29.558 --> 00:14:33.984
 And if I teach you how to kill her killer, 

00:14:34.024 --> 00:14:39.134
 what then? How will it serve her memories? 

00:14:39.456 --> 00:14:42.755
 What will he benefit from having the next boy to be taken away from his mother? 

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:47.101
 If revenge is all you ask for, it's looking elsewhere. 

00:14:47.985 --> 00:14:51.285
 Learn to fight me like you, please, I'll do whatever you are looking for. 

00:14:51.325 --> 00:14:54.222
 Do you promise to dismiss any idea of ​​vengeance? 

00:14:54.257 --> 00:14:56.802
 And commit to the life of a hunter? 

00:14:56.838 --> 00:15:01.264
 You will not have a friend or family. 

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:05.367
 &lt;i&gt; I told him what he wanted to hear, but only what he was interested in. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:15:05.402 --> 00:15:08.707
 &lt;i&gt; is killing the monster that took my mother. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:12.530
 I agree. 

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:14.849
 Scottish Highland gun. 

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:17.224
 And if one piece is not enough ... 

00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:19.126
 seven should be. 

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:21.460
 blunderbuss. 

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:23.530
 If you lose the ball ... 

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:26.432
 You can always use the pocket watch at the end. 

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:28.133
 So, Abe ... 

00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:31.972
 What do you like? 

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:36.045
 Actually, I've never been good at shooting. 

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:38.840
 Ali ... 

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.810
 I was good with an ax. 

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:55.325
 I want you to break this, in one move. 

00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:56.926
 That tree? 

00:15:57.256 --> 00:15:59.395
 That is impossible. 

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.937
 But it's not wood. 

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:02.700
 That's what you hate the most in the world. 

00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:05.332
 So, tell me, Mr. Lincoln ... 

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.008
 What do you hate? 

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:10.374
 I hate Jack Barts. 

00:16:11.203 --> 00:16:12.807
 Then shake it. 

00:16:19.358 --> 00:16:22.758
 You obviously do not hate it so much. 

00:16:22.793 --> 00:16:25.123
 Tell me what you hate. 

00:16:25.158 --> 00:16:28.158
 I hate my mother being taken away. 

00:16:29.158 --> 00:16:32.838
 Inappropriate. - I hate what we were afraid of. 

00:16:33.238 --> 00:16:38.838
 AND? - What are my mother, father, all we knew were living in fear. 

00:16:38.878 --> 00:16:41.638
 Miserably. - I hate being too small. 

00:16:41.678 --> 00:16:43.843
 Too weak. - Yeah. 

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:47.418
 And what did not you protect. - Yes! 

00:16:47.453 --> 00:16:50.958
 And what you let him die. 

00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:02.438
 The power of Lincoln, the real power 

00:17:02.478 --> 00:17:06.438
 It does not come from hate, but from the truth. 

00:17:12.438 --> 00:17:17.558
 Before you can protect others from the darkness, you first have to be able to protect yourself. 

00:17:18.438 --> 00:17:22.278
 Your enemies have the power to become invisible. 

00:17:22.438 --> 00:17:29.078
 You have to have the ability to fight blind, see without looking. 

00:17:43.478 --> 00:17:45.758
 Again. 

00:18:10.158 --> 00:18:13.443
 &lt;i&gt; In the weeks that followed, Henry tried me &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:18:13.478 --> 00:18:16.723
 &lt;i&gt; Build a lifelong experience and secrets of the vampire hunt. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:18:16.758 --> 00:18:21.758
 &lt;i&gt; Their ability to adapt to the sunlight, the power to become invisible. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:18:21.793 --> 00:18:25.643
 But most of all, he taught me how to destroy them. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:18:25.678 --> 00:18:30.838
 When Judas betrayed Jesus, his reward was 30 silver. 

00:18:30.878 --> 00:18:36.158
 At that point, they became a symbol of betraying God, a symbol of evil. 

00:18:36.193 --> 00:18:40.678
 And silver has become a curse over the damned. 

00:18:41.678 --> 00:18:45.758
 You will never see a vampire with silver. 

00:18:46.038 --> 00:18:48.438
 You will not see their reflection in the mirrors. 

00:18:48.478 --> 00:18:52.038
 The only thing God put out of the vampire. 

00:18:52.078 --> 00:18:56.678
 The only thing he can never have, and the only one he is unable to do. 

00:18:56.713 --> 00:18:59.643
 Henry, that's Jack Barts ... 

00:18:59.678 --> 00:19:03.158
 I set goals, that was the deal. 

00:19:03.193 --> 00:19:07.558
 It's not just about Jack Barts. 

00:19:08.158 --> 00:19:11.843
 Vadoma, a cruel violent. 

00:19:11.878 --> 00:19:15.038
 And her brother. - Wait, I've seen him already, 

00:19:15.078 --> 00:19:19.878
 I saw him with Jack Barts. - They call him Adam. 

00:19:20.558 --> 00:19:24.323
 The one that everyone else comes from. 

00:19:24.358 --> 00:19:27.558
 Vampires have been present in the new world for centuries. 

00:19:28.438 --> 00:19:32.598
 Clergy were native tribes, and early settlers. 

00:19:32.633 --> 00:19:36.758
 But when the Europeans arrived with their slavery, 

00:19:36.793 --> 00:19:40.958
 the dead saw the evil opportunity. 

00:19:41.758 --> 00:19:44.438
 They built the empire in the south. 

00:19:44.478 --> 00:19:49.958
 In recent years, they have pushed to the north, leaving death behind them. 

00:19:49.993 --> 00:19:54.523
 Abraham falls on us, hunters, 

00:19:54.558 --> 00:20:00.678
 to maintain balance, to ensure that this remains a nation of people. 

00:20:00.713 --> 00:20:02.723
 Not the monsters. 

00:20:02.758 --> 00:20:08.678
 What we do is not doing for one man, but for the good of all mankind. 

00:20:09.758 --> 00:20:13.038
 Henry sent me to the world with a reminder. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:18.038
 &lt;i&gt; Without getting tied, without being pushed, without friends or family. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:20:18.078 --> 00:20:21.318
 &lt;i&gt; After all, who could I trust? Everyone in this cool &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:24.558
 &lt;i&gt; the city could easily be one of them. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:20:24.593 --> 00:20:27.678
 Son of a bitch! 

00:20:32.038 --> 00:20:36.158
 If I ever see you here again, I'll bring you the balls like a wallet! 

00:20:36.193 --> 00:20:39.558
 I'll fix you! I'll fix you one day! 

00:20:46.838 --> 00:20:49.358
 Good morning sir, Joshua Speed ​​on duty. 

00:20:49.393 --> 00:20:52.923
 Abraham, Lincoln. 

00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:55.843
 I need little help. - Alright. 

00:20:55.878 --> 00:20:59.458
 A Friend in Need Speed ​​(Speed) is a friend. 

00:20:59.493 --> 00:21:03.038
 Do not you know maybe for a rental room, Mr. Speed? 

00:21:03.078 --> 00:21:05.123
 What kind of room are you looking for, Mr. Lincoln? 

00:21:05.158 --> 00:21:08.758
 Inexpensive, since I've spent all my money on legal books and I have no surplus right now. 

00:21:08.793 --> 00:21:13.238
 You say you do not have to figure it out as cheap or free? 

00:21:13.278 --> 00:21:16.558
 To the debt. "Anyway, I doubt you'll find such a room in Springfield, 

00:21:16.593 --> 00:21:20.278
 local people are strangely accustomed to compensation. 

00:21:21.558 --> 00:21:24.158
 Enjoy the day. 

00:21:35.158 --> 00:21:37.723
 There is one room, Mr. Lincoln. 

00:21:37.758 --> 00:21:41.678
 Recently, I had been forced to break up with a thief's bastard, 

00:21:41.713 --> 00:21:43.923
 so I need replacement. 

00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:49.158
 He has a room on the floor, not a goddamn thing, but he could get it in debt. 

00:21:49.193 --> 00:21:53.523
 If you intend or are willing to work here in return. 

00:21:53.558 --> 00:21:58.523
 &lt;i&gt; Dear Henry, life in Springfield is almost undesirable. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:21:58.558 --> 00:22:02.758
 &lt;i&gt; Do not be afraid, my miserable wizards will not allow me to deviate from your rules. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:22:02.793 --> 00:22:05.923
 &lt;i&gt; No friends, no family. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:11.478
 &lt;i&gt; And certainly not a single woman would think me attractive. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:22:17.238 --> 00:22:19.758
 Sorry? 

00:22:20.558 --> 00:22:23.843
 Sorry, I need this. - Just train my lady. 

00:22:23.878 --> 00:22:28.358
 There is no need to call me a lady as if I was a fucking bride. 

00:22:28.393 --> 00:22:31.038
 I'm sorry, ma'am ... 

00:22:31.078 --> 00:22:34.438
 I mean, miss. 

00:22:34.478 --> 00:22:38.358
 I'm Abraham, Lincoln. 

00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:41.958
 Mary Todd. 

00:22:43.478 --> 00:22:47.443
 Dear, there you are. 

00:22:47.478 --> 00:22:50.123
 You should not go from store to store so fast. 

00:22:50.158 --> 00:22:53.358
 Maybe you would not stop at the wail with every gentleman in Springfield ... 

00:22:53.393 --> 00:22:56.643
 I could say the same to you. 

00:22:56.678 --> 00:23:02.558
 Steven Douglas, I'm glad. - Abraham Lincoln. 

00:23:04.038 --> 00:23:08.523
 Are you a vice president, Mr Lincoln? 

00:23:08.558 --> 00:23:12.158
 What do you think about holding out of Illinois's slavery, I'm coming for a legislative body. 

00:23:12.193 --> 00:23:14.123
 I'm sure you'd be happy to hear your speech, 

00:23:14.158 --> 00:23:16.158
 but Mr Lincoln was just about to dedicate himself to my list. 

00:23:16.193 --> 00:23:19.758
 We talked kindly, slavery is a complicated question. 

00:23:19.793 --> 00:23:23.478
 I can not get stronger with you, Mr Douglas. 

00:23:28.438 --> 00:23:31.438
 Mr Douglas, Miss. Todd, you met my new one 

00:23:31.473 --> 00:23:34.438
 Abraham's associate, a letter came for you. 

00:23:43.358 --> 00:23:47.478
 &lt;i&gt; Dear Abe, your prescription is waiting for you at a local pharmacy. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:23:47.513 --> 00:23:50.158
 &lt;i&gt; Search for Aaron Stibble's younger. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:23:50.193 --> 00:23:53.075
 Mr. Lincoln? 

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:55.958
 Excuse me. 

00:23:57.478 --> 00:24:00.838
 You did well today, Abraham. - Thank you. 

00:24:09.558 --> 00:24:12.243
 &lt;i&gt; But do not forget. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:24:12.278 --> 00:24:16.158
 &lt;i&gt; Always have a backup plan. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:24:25.158 --> 00:24:28.958
 SUN AND OCEAN PROTECTION 

00:24:49.358 --> 00:24:54.438
 Aaron Stibble Younger? - Yeah? 

00:26:00.826 --> 00:26:04.231
 Do not worry, it'll only hit a second or two. 

00:26:04.266 --> 00:26:07.636
 Did you eat today? 

00:26:34.275 --> 00:26:39.964
 &lt;i&gt; I killed a monster, and I'll kill again. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:26:40.004 --> 00:26:44.611
 &lt;i&gt; But no death could ever make me forget. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:26:58.791 --> 00:27:01.195
 Merciful Christ, Lincoln, what happened to your face? 

00:27:01.235 --> 00:27:05.521
 I'm fine, I can work. - Work? Damn it with work. 

00:27:05.556 --> 00:27:08.611
 We're invited to the left. 

00:27:08.646 --> 00:27:12.411
 That could be your chance to save Mary Todd from boring life. 

00:27:12.452 --> 00:27:15.596
 Because of this suit I look stupid. - Shakes, 

00:27:15.631 --> 00:27:18.741
 but because of that hat you look stupid, come on. 

00:27:23.748 --> 00:27:27.233
 There he is. Mr. Douglas, Joshua Speed, I'm glad. 

00:27:27.273 --> 00:27:28.921
 Mary, you're as sweet as ever. 

00:27:28.956 --> 00:27:31.299
 It's still gone. - And who is it? 

00:27:31.334 --> 00:27:33.643
 Aaron Stibble. - Younger or older? 

00:27:33.683 --> 00:27:35.651
 Younger. 

00:27:35.686 --> 00:27:38.971
 Who is this man? - I do not know. 

00:27:46.061 --> 00:27:48.550
 Mr. Douglas, of course you know Senator Nolan? 

00:27:48.585 --> 00:27:52.070
 Ah yes, Steven glad to see you. - Did you hear the news? 

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:55.916
 We investigate this. Do not worry, that kind of iniquity 

00:27:55.951 --> 00:27:59.681
 will not survive in the noble Illinois state. 

00:28:09.696 --> 00:28:12.305
 It's called dance. 

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.545
 If we were to sit alone, we would name it differently. 

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:19.711
 Yeah, I guess. 

00:28:20.512 --> 00:28:25.159
 Come to Mr. Lincoln, you will destroy the fabric if you still sit there. 

00:28:28.644 --> 00:28:33.050
 I'm sure you're a nice guy, Mr. Lincoln, but you're ... 

00:28:33.085 --> 00:28:36.135
 A dealer in a suit. 

00:28:36.175 --> 00:28:39.179
 No, it's not really a question of wealth. 

00:28:39.259 --> 00:28:41.343
 Actually, I'm looking for a different, 

00:28:41.383 --> 00:28:47.156
 someone whose life is a bit more, more adventurous, and ... 

00:28:47.191 --> 00:28:50.641
 My apologies, I'm never so ... - Honest? - Rude. 

00:28:50.676 --> 00:28:55.483
 Miss Todd, can I speak honestly? And I came to improve, 

00:28:55.518 --> 00:29:00.307
 That's why I started to be interested in the right and if I can be so excited, 

00:29:00.343 --> 00:29:05.098
 I started to interest you. As for the adventures you are looking for, 

00:29:05.133 --> 00:29:08.823
 I believe that only a few of you could provide it. 

00:29:08.858 --> 00:29:12.108
 And quote your fiance Steven Douglas. 

00:29:12.143 --> 00:29:16.314
 Mr. Lincoln, you're full of surprises. 

00:29:16.715 --> 00:29:20.520
 Miss Todd, do not you think so. 

00:29:23.725 --> 00:29:27.250
 &lt;i&gt; Dear Abraham, I deposited my money at a local bank. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:29:27.285 --> 00:29:31.657
 &lt;i&gt; Be careful, it can quickly disappear. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:30:07.469 --> 00:30:10.559
 Henry, there are more than I thought it was possible. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:30:10.594 --> 00:30:17.404
 &lt;i&gt; Pharmacists, taverns, pastors ... It's more than a man can handle. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:30:40.037 --> 00:30:44.644
 I see that I'm such an interesting company. - I'm sorry. 

00:30:46.166 --> 00:30:49.016
 I work at night. 

00:30:49.051 --> 00:30:53.222
 Really? Is that true? 

00:30:53.257 --> 00:30:57.063
 Do you really want to know the truth, Marry? 

00:31:00.187 --> 00:31:05.876
 Every night, I get out. 

00:31:06.997 --> 00:31:10.683
 Lovim vampire. 

00:31:17.012 --> 00:31:21.383
 Well, how are you shooting those vampires? 

00:31:21.418 --> 00:31:27.507
 An ax, a special silver ax, of course. 

00:31:27.542 --> 00:31:29.991
 Of course 

00:31:30.031 --> 00:31:33.196
 How much would he say you killed? 

00:31:33.236 --> 00:31:37.086
 Five, no, six. 

00:31:37.122 --> 00:31:41.208
 I killed six vampires. 

00:31:41.248 --> 00:31:45.534
 My God. 

00:31:50.021 --> 00:31:52.509
 Abe. 

00:31:52.544 --> 00:31:57.752
 Yours, and I thought you were a honest man, really. 

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:14.857
 I had a wonderful day, Abe. - Like me, Mary. 

00:32:28.197 --> 00:32:32.603
 Ms. Todd, you're a woman fascinatingly snappy. 

00:32:32.638 --> 00:32:37.210
 Mr. Lincoln, do not you think so. 

00:32:39.013 --> 00:32:44.501
 &lt;i&gt; You have no friends, no family. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:32:46.744 --> 00:32:51.631
 I should go, it's late. 

00:32:53.714 --> 00:32:59.443
 &lt;i&gt; How can I bring it into this world? The demon world, the danger? &lt;/ I&gt; 

00:32:59.478 --> 00:33:04.450
 Then good night, Lincoln. - Good night, Mary. 

00:33:04.485 --> 00:33:07.735
 Good shit. 

00:33:09.057 --> 00:33:14.866
 &lt;i&gt; If I really cared for her, the best I could do, &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:33:14.901 --> 00:33:17.870
 &lt;i&gt; go away. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:34:02.135 --> 00:34:04.619
 &lt;i&gt; The six obstinate bodies found near Springfield. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:34:04.659 --> 00:34:07.824
 This, hunter, is another Henry's disciple? 

00:34:07.864 --> 00:34:10.628
 They say it's a madman. 

00:34:11.269 --> 00:34:13.832
 I can not wait to introduce him. 

00:34:22.365 --> 00:34:28.374
 The man from the warehouse reads the legal book. Do you practice lawyer? 

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:31.744
 Actually, I did. 

00:34:31.779 --> 00:34:37.307
 Okay, can a little test? What does the law say about free slaves in the north? 

00:34:37.342 --> 00:34:40.769
 According to the Law on the Missing Robots of 1793, 

00:34:40.804 --> 00:34:44.162
 by implementing Article 4, paragraph 2 of the Constitution of the United States, 

00:34:44.197 --> 00:34:47.567
 all fugitives must return to their owners. 

00:34:47.602 --> 00:34:51.773
 But the Personal Freedom Act states that everyone who is born is free 

00:34:51.808 --> 00:34:55.614
 can not be taken according to this law. "I once heard that a good woman said, 

00:34:55.649 --> 00:34:59.820
 "While all people are not free, we are all slaves." 

00:35:02.144 --> 00:35:06.310
 Will? Will Johnson ?! 

00:35:06.951 --> 00:35:10.201
 How do you ... - I was at home. 

00:35:10.236 --> 00:35:13.726
 I heard you moved here, training for a lawyer. 

00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:17.246
 Good, I need a good lawyer. - Are you in some trouble? 

00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:20.170
 I freed slaves in the south, on the railroad, 

00:35:20.205 --> 00:35:22.138
 I was hoping to find my brother. 

00:35:22.173 --> 00:35:26.339
 Some of the hunters on my mind intended me, they said I was a fugitive. 

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:31.387
 I need confirmation from Abe, who says I was born free. 

00:35:31.422 --> 00:35:34.271
 You know Wille, let's go. 

00:35:35.753 --> 00:35:40.200
 Speede, this is Will Johnson, my oldest friend in the world. 

00:35:42.483 --> 00:35:44.852
 The store will not run alone Abe. 

00:35:44.887 --> 00:35:49.173
 I'll get him back as soon as possible, Mr. Speed, I promise. 

00:35:51.016 --> 00:35:54.661
 Rasteš Abe, you look like you're not eating it yet. 

00:35:54.696 --> 00:35:58.306
 Are you still afraid of the darkness? - Not so much. 

00:35:58.627 --> 00:36:02.878
 That's Abe, that's the man who is pursuing me. 

00:36:02.913 --> 00:36:07.004
 Gentlemen, gentlemen, I'm sure we can solve this. 

00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:12.928
 I suggest you leave your son. - No sir, I suggest you leave. 

00:36:25.627 --> 00:36:29.552
 I sent a message to Senator Nolana, I'll get you out of here soon. 

00:36:29.588 --> 00:36:32.522
 You're mate. Todd. 

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:33.558
 And he is powerful enough to have a wife like you. 

00:36:36.763 --> 00:36:40.168
 I think ordinary people look the best in the world. 

00:36:40.203 --> 00:36:43.253
 That is why the Lord creates them so much. 

00:36:43.854 --> 00:36:46.457
 I thank God for being there. 

00:36:46.497 --> 00:36:50.784
 I will not always be here, Mary. 

00:36:52.386 --> 00:36:56.312
 What if something happened, something terrible ... 

00:36:56.712 --> 00:37:03.002
 And how do you know there is no chance in the world that one man will stop it? 

00:37:03.037 --> 00:37:06.487
 What would you do? 

00:37:09.131 --> 00:37:13.938
 I would not run away from what is right only because it is difficult. 

00:37:13.973 --> 00:37:18.745
 My father was able to say, "Rub your feet, and stand firm." 

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:23.913
 The only question is where will you put your feet. 

00:37:26.411 --> 00:37:31.816
 Maybe we do not succeed in this fight, maybe we just break the vehement oppression, 

00:37:31.856 --> 00:37:35.425
 but we must not turn! 

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:39.429
 For our goal is noble and just, the goal of freedom, 

00:37:39.464 --> 00:37:45.831
 the one that our ancestors built this great nation! 

00:37:50.675 --> 00:37:54.079
 Such a voice is prone to stuck in the store. 

00:37:54.114 --> 00:37:57.447
 Actually, I'm studying for a lawyer. 

00:37:57.482 --> 00:38:02.087
 Mr. Lincoln, maybe it's time to think about politics. 

00:38:03.849 --> 00:38:08.373
 I can connect you with the right people. - Thanks Senator Nolan. 

00:38:10.575 --> 00:38:15.661
 I am pleased with the young man. - Also. - You're on the right track, Mr Lincoln. 

00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:21.787
 I sent you to Springfield for a vampire hunt, not for voices. 

00:38:21.822 --> 00:38:24.870
 First Lesson: Always have a backup plan. 

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:28.794
 If the vampire hunt fails, I will need a career. 

00:38:29.114 --> 00:38:32.477
 I'm serious. - And I, Henry. 

00:38:32.518 --> 00:38:34.685
 I did everything you asked me to do. 

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:38.403
 Every letter, every name, but never the letter I am waiting for, 

00:38:38.438 --> 00:38:42.224
 and never the name I want most. 

00:38:42.259 --> 00:38:46.011
 When will I kill Jack Barts? 

00:38:51.817 --> 00:38:56.622
 Barts knows about Mary, it's time. 

00:38:57.903 --> 00:39:00.506
 Abraham. 

00:39:00.546 --> 00:39:03.549
 Be careful. 

00:39:31.577 --> 00:39:35.461
 Abraham fucking Lincoln ... 

00:39:35.496 --> 00:39:37.628
 Again missed! 

00:39:37.663 --> 00:39:41.347
 I hope you are better with your ax than with a gun! 

00:39:49.875 --> 00:39:52.798
 Come on Lincolne! 

00:39:56.482 --> 00:40:00.286
 Get me before I get to Mary! 

00:41:21.287 --> 00:41:24.651
 Get me if you can a boyfriend! 

00:42:24.551 --> 00:42:28.600
 There are thousands of us here ... 

00:42:28.635 --> 00:42:34.406
 They will not stop until this whole country is ours. 

00:42:34.441 --> 00:42:41.448
 And now they come for you, ask your friend, Henry. 

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.548
 Shut up your stupid mouth, give it to me 

00:42:56.583 --> 00:42:59.786
 By the way I came or I'll break your teeth! 

00:43:22.169 --> 00:43:26.774
 Lieutenant son of a bitch. 

00:43:35.983 --> 00:43:39.186
 Damn! 

00:43:39.226 --> 00:43:42.189
 No Abe! Stop! 

00:43:44.792 --> 00:43:49.857
 You were not ready to find out. - What, you're a vampire ?! 

00:43:49.892 --> 00:43:54.922
 You're not the only one who lost everything because of the vampire. 

00:44:00.448 --> 00:44:04.131
 Just because the chariot stopped, 

00:44:04.166 --> 00:44:07.855
 does not mean we have to. 

00:44:11.939 --> 00:44:15.343
 Get in the carriage. 

00:44:16.824 --> 00:44:22.470
 Take this. Run away, just run away. 

00:37:26.411 --> 00:37:31.816
 Maybe we do not succeed in this fight, maybe we just break the vehement oppression, 

00:37:31.856 --> 00:37:35.425
 but we must not turn! 

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:39.429
 For our goal is noble and just, the goal of freedom, 

00:37:39.464 --> 00:37:45.831
 the one that our ancestors built this great nation! 

00:37:50.675 --> 00:37:54.079
 Such a voice is prone to stuck in the store. 

00:37:54.114 --> 00:37:57.447
 Actually, I'm studying for a lawyer. 

00:37:57.482 --> 00:38:02.087
 Mr. Lincoln, maybe it's time to think about politics. 

00:38:03.849 --> 00:38:08.373
 I can connect you with the right people. - Thanks Senator Nolan. 

00:38:10.575 --> 00:38:15.661
 I am pleased with the young man. - Also. - You're on the right track, Mr Lincoln. 

00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:21.787
 I sent you to Springfield for a vampire hunt, not for voices. 

00:38:21.822 --> 00:38:24.870
 First Lesson: Always have a backup plan. 

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:28.794
 If the vampire hunt fails, I will need a career. 

00:38:29.114 --> 00:38:32.477
 I'm serious. - And I, Henry. 

00:38:32.518 --> 00:38:34.685
 I did everything you asked me to do. 

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:38.403
 Every letter, every name, but never the letter I am waiting for, 

00:38:38.438 --> 00:38:42.224
 and never the name I want most. 

00:38:42.259 --> 00:38:46.011
 When will I kill Jack Barts? 

00:38:51.817 --> 00:38:56.622
 Barts knows about Mary, it's time. 

00:38:57.903 --> 00:39:00.506
 Abraham. 

00:39:00.546 --> 00:39:03.549
 Be careful. 

00:39:31.577 --> 00:39:35.461
 Abraham fucking Lincoln ... 

00:39:35.496 --> 00:39:37.628
 Again missed! 

00:39:37.663 --> 00:39:41.347
 I hope you are better with your ax than with a gun! 

00:39:49.875 --> 00:39:52.798
 Come on Lincolne! 

00:39:56.482 --> 00:40:00.286
 Get me before I get to Mary! 

00:41:21.287 --> 00:41:24.651
 Get me if you can a boyfriend! 

00:42:24.551 --> 00:42:28.600
 There are thousands of us here ... 

00:42:28.635 --> 00:42:34.406
 They will not stop until this whole country is ours. 

00:42:34.441 --> 00:42:41.448
 And now they come for you, ask your friend, Henry. 

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.548
 Shut up your stupid mouth, give it to me 

00:42:56.583 --> 00:42:59.786
 By the way I came or I'll break your teeth! 

00:43:22.169 --> 00:43:26.774
 Lieutenant son of a bitch. 

00:43:35.983 --> 00:43:39.186
 Damn! 

00:43:39.226 --> 00:43:42.189
 No Abe! Stop! 

00:43:44.792 --> 00:43:49.857
 You were not ready to find out. - What, you're a vampire ?! 

00:43:49.892 --> 00:43:54.922
 You're not the only one who lost everything because of the vampire. 

00:44:00.448 --> 00:44:04.131
 Just because the chariot stopped, 

00:44:04.166 --> 00:44:07.855
 does not mean we have to. 

00:44:11.939 --> 00:44:15.343
 Get in the carriage. 

00:44:16.824 --> 00:44:22.470
 Take this. Run away, just run away. 

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:18.691
 Her soul is pure. 

00:46:18.727 --> 00:46:22.552
 But yours, Henry ... 

00:46:37.749 --> 00:46:41.241
 It's one of the little god tricks. 

00:46:41.277 --> 00:46:44.732
 Vampires can not kill their kind. 

00:46:44.769 --> 00:46:49.456
 Only live can kill the dead. 

00:46:49.867 --> 00:46:53.687
 Welcome to the family. 

00:47:07.118 --> 00:47:12.869
 You can not save the world and those you love, Lincoln. You have to choose. 

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:22.439
 I'm sorry. But goodbye. 

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:02.099
 Abe ?! - Mary ?! 

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:05.518
 What are you doing for fun? - Come in. 

00:48:05.553 --> 00:48:09.449
 What are you hiding? - Nothing. - Abe? 

00:48:09.485 --> 00:48:12.731
 Nothing. - Abe, I know when you're lying. 

00:48:12.766 --> 00:48:15.941
 What do you hide from me? - Alright. 

00:48:15.976 --> 00:48:20.224
 I did not mean to tell you this way, I did not plan it this way. 

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:24.270
 But if you really have to know ... 

00:48:33.171 --> 00:48:37.100
 Mary Todd ... 

00:48:37.136 --> 00:48:43.083
 Will you make me the happiest man? 

00:49:09.381 --> 00:49:15.490
 Do you promise, Abraham, that you will love, comfort, be faithful and honest 

00:49:15.525 --> 00:49:21.639
 according to her in all things, in illness and health, while death does not divorce you? 

00:49:23.136 --> 00:49:25.124
 I promise. 

00:49:25.159 --> 00:49:28.598
 Then the power which God gave me and the great state of Illinois, 

00:49:28.634 --> 00:49:32.725
 I promise you husband and wife. 

00:49:32.765 --> 00:49:35.476
 You can kiss a bride. 

00:49:44.377 --> 00:49:46.885
 Your mother would be very proud of you. - Thank you Wille. 

00:49:46.926 --> 00:49:50.931
 I'm glad you could be here, you're the only family I have. 

00:49:50.971 --> 00:49:54.977
 Except for her. - Congratulations. 

00:49:55.017 --> 00:49:58.861
 I'm presenting you, Mr. Henry Sturges, my wife 

00:49:58.896 --> 00:50:02.664
 Mary, and my dear friend Will Johnson. 

00:50:02.704 --> 00:50:05.582
 For the sake of Mr. Sturges, you're as stiff as the winter wind. 

00:50:05.617 --> 00:50:08.854
 Henry, please. I'm afraid it's the risk of carrying your own bottle. 

00:50:08.889 --> 00:50:14.078
 You know how they say, cold hands warm heart. - I honestly doubt it. 

00:50:14.113 --> 00:50:17.755
 Mr. Sturges is a business associate. - And I thought about talking a bit about business. 

00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:21.517
 Of course, sorry. 

00:50:26.251 --> 00:50:29.770
 What the hell are you doing here? - Be careful of Abraham, 

00:50:29.811 --> 00:50:34.464
 it's easy to forget how we simply lose the most precious things. 

00:50:35.273 --> 00:50:38.995
 They do not even know who I am. 

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.209
 Go upstairs and call it, 

00:51:22.244 --> 00:51:26.128
 Mr. Lincoln, to join us on the plantation. 

00:51:27.059 --> 00:51:30.457
 We'll have the ball in his honor. 

00:51:30.498 --> 00:51:33.613
 Why do you think he'll accept it? 

00:51:34.098 --> 00:51:37.740
 I think we can find a way to get him involved. 

00:51:59.021 --> 00:52:03.066
 Abe, we have a problem. 

00:52:05.494 --> 00:52:08.730
 They took Willa. 

00:52:11.967 --> 00:52:16.579
 What are you gonna do? - I'll accept his call. 

00:52:19.128 --> 00:52:22.972
 Speed ​​deserved to know the truth about what we're going to face. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:52:23.007 --> 00:52:26.901
 &lt;i&gt; I told him all, not knowing if he would trust me. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:52:26.936 --> 00:52:30.254
 &lt;i&gt; or I think of a fool, not knowing whether to have courage &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:52:30.289 --> 00:52:33.572
 &lt;i&gt; to face the monsters I met. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:52:33.612 --> 00:52:37.617
 You and I, Abraham, together can achieve everything. 

00:52:45.838 --> 00:52:50.244
 NEW ORLEANS 

00:53:01.179 --> 00:53:04.824
 No slaves, where are they? 

00:53:04.859 --> 00:53:08.469
 And I was asking. 

00:53:40.834 --> 00:53:45.606
 Something's wrong here, Abe. - Yeah. 

00:53:45.641 --> 00:53:50.848
 I do not know how to dance. - Do not worry, I'll teach you. 

00:53:51.529 --> 00:53:54.053
 Wait here. 

00:53:54.613 --> 00:53:59.540
 Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served. 

00:55:53.699 --> 00:55:58.245
 Bravo, Mr. Lincoln. Bravo. 

00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:02.791
 Even better than I heard. 

00:56:02.831 --> 00:56:07.318
 Damage to the victims of so many of my best people, I have to find out if you've done the job. 

00:56:07.353 --> 00:56:11.809
 What do you want from me? - See you free. 

00:56:11.844 --> 00:56:15.048
 See you getting up and destroying your oppressor. 

00:56:15.083 --> 00:56:17.417
 Interesting advice, since it comes from a slave. 

00:56:17.452 --> 00:56:22.338
 People have enslaved each other since they invented gods to forgive them. 

00:56:22.373 --> 00:56:28.146
 I saw how the Jews built Egyptian fame. 

00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:37.239
 He saw the Christians cast their lions with their own eyes. 

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:43.107
 And I saw African people selling their people to Europeans. 

00:56:43.142 --> 00:56:48.455
 Can I share, one revelation in my 5,000 years? 

00:56:48.495 --> 00:56:52.060
 We all get something stuffed. 

00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:56.951
 I eternity, you your convictions, the other is afraid of your skin. 

00:56:56.986 --> 00:57:03.916
 Everything I ever wanted to see was a deserved place for my type. 

00:57:03.951 --> 00:57:08.603
 But there are those among us, as your friend Henry, 

00:57:08.638 --> 00:57:11.572
 who enjoy living in the dark. 

00:57:11.607 --> 00:57:16.894
 As you undoubtedly know, I can not personally destroy him or me. 

00:57:17.295 --> 00:57:22.101
 You, Mr Lincoln, 

00:57:22.141 --> 00:57:25.546
 you could eliminate these last pieces of resistance 

00:57:25.581 --> 00:57:28.911
 beginning with Henry Sturges himself. 

00:57:28.951 --> 00:57:32.516
 All I'm looking for ... 

00:57:32.556 --> 00:57:36.606
 You want to shoot the chains. 

00:57:36.641 --> 00:57:40.246
 Kill the master, be free. 

00:57:40.282 --> 00:57:43.216
 And if I refuse? 

00:57:43.251 --> 00:57:46.255
 Then you can cheer up. 

00:57:46.535 --> 00:57:51.582
 After I do you one of us. 

00:57:51.617 --> 00:57:54.466
 And I nourish your friend. 

00:57:55.668 --> 00:57:59.994
 It just does or will not be enough. 

00:58:00.029 --> 00:58:04.766
 Kill Henry, save a friend. 

00:58:04.801 --> 00:58:08.085
 Feel free to take the time to decide, 5 ... 

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:12.171
 4, 3, 

00:58:12.211 --> 00:58:15.616
 2, 1. 

00:58:27.232 --> 00:58:30.036
 Let's go! 

00:58:45.938 --> 00:58:48.221
 This way! 

00:59:19.064 --> 00:59:23.870
 Miss Tubman, we were waiting for you. 

00:59:24.912 --> 00:59:27.395
 Come quickly. 

00:59:39.732 --> 00:59:43.578
 People kill every day, slaves disappear, 

00:59:43.613 --> 00:59:47.423
 some talk about monsters and demons. 

00:59:51.509 --> 00:59:56.155
 Good morning, how can I help you with this wonderful day? 

00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:58.203
 We're looking for three men. 

00:59:58.238 --> 01:00:00.962
 You know, I saw someone to ride down in that direction. 

01:00:03.645 --> 01:00:08.332
 Feel free to enter if you want, my mass will start soon. 

01:00:21.871 --> 01:00:25.516
 I would say you came from the north? - Yes, ma'am. 

01:00:25.551 --> 01:00:29.161
 I suggest you go back there as soon as you can. 

01:00:29.201 --> 01:00:34.208
 There is war, a war for the soul of the state. 

01:00:34.243 --> 01:00:38.494
 The blood of all colors will burn. 

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:48.107
 Their work, their blood! More blood than you can imagine! 

01:00:48.142 --> 01:00:50.996
 I saw the horror of the south, first hand. 

01:00:51.031 --> 01:00:54.917
 I say that the need for peace overcomes the needs of blacks, 

01:00:54.952 --> 01:00:58.802
 I say that if the people of these great nations want slavery, 

01:00:58.842 --> 01:01:03.028
 let them know. - Demon slavery square our country. 

01:01:03.063 --> 01:01:07.214
 We have to get up, we must stand firm and fight, 

01:01:07.254 --> 01:01:11.505
 fight for the very soul of our nation. 

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:16.266
 Until every man is free, we are all slaves! 

01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:21.519
 You can not fight slavery, Abraham! 

01:01:21.554 --> 01:01:25.239
 You can not fight the whole south! - Why? Because of Adam? 

01:01:25.279 --> 01:01:27.447
 Not. - Are you afraid of him? 

01:01:27.482 --> 01:01:31.768
 Because it only kept them satisfied this year. 

01:01:31.803 --> 01:01:34.529
 If you take that away then no one is sure. 

01:01:34.564 --> 01:01:37.255
 So you decide who lives and who dies. 

01:01:37.295 --> 01:01:39.864
 The big man once said, we do not do what we do 

01:01:39.899 --> 01:01:42.463
 for himself, not for one man, but for the benefit of all mankind! 

01:01:42.503 --> 01:01:47.389
 Not all of mankind, Abraham! - Abe? 

01:01:49.392 --> 01:01:52.296
 May I get my husband back? 

01:01:52.331 --> 01:01:55.200
 It's all yours, ma'am. Lincoln. 

01:01:57.283 --> 01:02:00.573
 &lt;i&gt; Henry saw the fight just in his own way. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:02:00.608 --> 01:02:04.754
 But I finally got to look at each other. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:08.899
 &lt;i&gt; See and feel bigger questions at stake. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:02:08.939 --> 01:02:12.189
 &lt;i&gt; He and I will go in different ways. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:02:12.224 --> 01:02:18.352
 &lt;i&gt; As the Bible says, it's time to throw away what a child is. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:02:18.387 --> 01:02:23.439
 &lt;i&gt; I will not fight my ax, but words and ideals. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:28.647
 &lt;i&gt; For a while, they showed themselves as a more powerful weapon. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:02:43.347 --> 01:02:48.039
 The Bible is old as the government itself. 

01:02:48.074 --> 01:02:52.960
 I find myself in front of you to set a prescribed oath 

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.249
 The United States Constitution, 

01:02:55.284 --> 01:03:01.893
 which must be deposited by the president before commencing his duties. 

01:03:01.928 --> 01:03:06.579
 The question of slavery is better resolved by a feather than with a sword! 

01:03:24.324 --> 01:03:28.209
 &lt;i&gt; Through the frenzy of fate, I found myself 50, &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:03:28.249 --> 01:03:32.175
 &lt;i&gt; as the father of the nation, who is hunting herself. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:36.065
 &lt;i&gt; While I was trying to be the father of a boy, &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:39.265
 &lt;i&gt; not much older than me when I lost my mother. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:03:40.546 --> 01:03:44.232
 Three thousand dead. 

01:03:56.489 --> 01:03:58.972
 When did you last eat a meal? - I'm not hungry, thank you. 

01:03:59.007 --> 01:04:03.979
 You gotta eat Abe, you're just a man. 

01:04:05.381 --> 01:04:07.984
 20,000 POGINLIH VOJNIKA IS THIS VALUE PRICE OF FREEDOM? 

01:04:10.788 --> 01:04:13.712
 Go to Willie. 

01:04:15.194 --> 01:04:17.598
 Willie? 

01:04:23.726 --> 01:04:26.210
 Brother? 

01:04:36.304 --> 01:04:41.231
 If you do that, there's no return, Abe. 

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:44.235
 I know. 

01:04:44.635 --> 01:04:48.741
 I'm trying to protect the nation's freedom. 

01:04:48.776 --> 01:04:52.847
 If this war really is evil resistance, 

01:04:52.882 --> 01:04:56.937
 let him say something. 

01:04:56.972 --> 01:05:02.660
 If there is a war for people's freedom, why not give all people the cause for the fight ?! 

01:05:03.061 --> 01:05:08.168
 All persons are held as slaves, within any state or part of a state, 

01:05:08.203 --> 01:05:13.275
 and whose people will be up against the United States, will be from then on ... 

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:17.801
 Further, free. 

01:05:26.093 --> 01:05:28.777
 Morning. 

01:05:37.509 --> 01:05:40.598
 Gold a little. 

01:05:40.633 --> 01:05:43.197
 What's your name? - Willie. 

01:05:43.237 --> 01:05:48.003
 And your dad? - Abraham. 

01:06:17.244 --> 01:06:20.969
 How does our little soldier keep it? 

01:06:32.986 --> 01:06:38.313
 I've never seen anything like that. I'm sorry. 

01:06:38.348 --> 01:06:41.678
 I do not know what else to do. 

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:12.689
 Abe ... 

01:08:12.724 --> 01:08:16.609
 Mary asks for you. 

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:42.565
 I'm very sorry for Abraham. 

01:08:45.570 --> 01:08:50.657
 Why did not they take me? - Because they know. 

01:08:50.897 --> 01:08:54.182
 That fate is much worse than death. 

01:08:54.217 --> 01:08:57.551
 Mary ... 

01:08:57.586 --> 01:09:01.712
 It is negligent. 

01:09:02.273 --> 01:09:04.561
 He says he does not want to continue to live without him. 

01:09:04.596 --> 01:09:09.403
 There is a way for Abraham, you know I can restore the dead. 

01:09:10.925 --> 01:09:13.889
 Do it. 

01:09:18.135 --> 01:09:20.939
 Do it. - Mary? 

01:09:20.974 --> 01:09:24.389
 Do it. 

01:09:24.424 --> 01:09:30.432
 Your journal, which you always held in your coat pocket ... 

01:09:30.953 --> 01:09:34.437
 I know I should not have Abbe, but I had to know what you hid. 

01:09:34.472 --> 01:09:39.444
 If that's what you say, I beg you ... 

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:42.213
 Give us our boyfriend. 

01:09:42.248 --> 01:09:45.653
 Mary, he would not be our little boy. 

01:09:45.688 --> 01:09:49.023
 It would be something else, something terrible. 

01:09:49.058 --> 01:09:53.544
 Believe me, you do not want that. - You ask me to believe you, 

01:09:53.584 --> 01:09:55.947
 after lying all this year ?! 

01:09:55.987 --> 01:09:58.351
 I did it to protect you, to protect our family. 

01:09:58.391 --> 01:10:02.241
 How did it turn out ?! You did this to Abe! 

01:10:02.276 --> 01:10:08.204
 You did this! You rolled this up! You rolled this on our son! 

01:10:13.572 --> 01:10:16.981
 Allow me to go to them, make a deal with Adam. 

01:10:17.017 --> 01:10:19.780
 We have to stop this war, William's death is just the beginning. 

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:23.786
 You did not dare to pronounce his name. - I warned you. 

01:10:23.826 --> 01:10:30.796
 You did not listen to me. How many more boys must die before you listen to me? 

01:10:39.528 --> 01:10:43.934
 These guys go in vain. We have to pull soldiers. 

01:10:44.254 --> 01:10:49.942
 Abraham, this war has left us countless lives, not to mention millions of dollars. 

01:10:49.977 --> 01:10:54.749
 I thought we were going to make this country big and not break it. 

01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:58.955
 This is the only way we can save Earth, Speede. 

01:11:00.677 --> 01:11:03.641
 Send the soldiers. 

01:11:10.371 --> 01:11:13.775
 Union soldiers flee to the battlefield. 

01:11:14.056 --> 01:11:20.184
 We are now overcrowded, and poorly equipped in comparison to the North. 

01:11:20.585 --> 01:11:26.193
 We will support you, but you will also have to support us. 

01:11:26.473 --> 01:11:29.162
 No Thanks. 

01:11:29.197 --> 01:11:31.880
 Be worried Mr. Davis. 

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:35.525
 You will get members of my kind as much as you need. 

01:11:57.155 --> 01:11:59.238
 Pali! 

01:12:14.459 --> 01:12:17.023
 Preparation! 

01:12:17.058 --> 01:12:19.587
 Aim! 

01:12:21.589 --> 01:12:24.273
 Here they come! 

01:12:24.794 --> 01:12:26.957
 Pali! 

01:12:34.888 --> 01:12:37.892
 Why did they throw rifles ?! 

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.903
 Pali! 

01:13:24.236 --> 01:13:28.042
 The first day of Gettysburg. 

01:13:28.082 --> 01:13:32.768
 He was disastrous. I doubt the army can survive another. 

01:13:33.369 --> 01:13:38.176
 If the rebels break through, they will be here for a few days. 

01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:45.706
 Generals think we should be evacuated from Washington, 

01:13:45.741 --> 01:13:49.792
 north to New York or Boston if needed. 

01:13:49.827 --> 01:13:53.797
 You have to get this war. 

01:13:54.518 --> 01:13:58.369
 If you do not get it then all ... 

01:13:58.404 --> 01:14:02.209
 Then our son's death will be useless. - How can I get a war, 

01:14:02.244 --> 01:14:04.898
 when they can not even protect their own family? 

01:14:04.933 --> 01:14:07.897
 Our people can not defend themselves against this enemy. 

01:14:07.937 --> 01:14:13.104
 When our bullets are useless, our battles are powerless like this jaw! 

01:14:13.144 --> 01:14:15.227
 These ... 

01:14:20.635 --> 01:14:23.118
 Will! Speed! 

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:28.045
 This, this is what we need. 

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.535
 Jaw. - Silver. 

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:35.575
 All right, how much we need it? 

01:14:36.136 --> 01:14:38.740
 All. 

01:14:59.488 --> 01:15:03.093
 Why are you talking to me, Mr Speed? Why are you betraying a friend? 

01:15:03.129 --> 01:15:06.779
 He is my friend, but I still love this country. 

01:15:06.819 --> 01:15:11.906
 And he, more than anyone else, is responsible for breaking this nation. 

01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:15.911
 You did the right thing. 

01:15:17.113 --> 01:15:20.197
 I know. 

01:15:20.237 --> 01:15:24.488
 32, 33, 34, 35 ... 

01:15:24.523 --> 01:15:27.928
 That's a lot of silver Abe. 

01:15:30.732 --> 01:15:33.736
 But how do we switch all this over there? 

01:15:53.483 --> 01:15:57.168
 I'm sorry, Mary. 

01:15:59.251 --> 01:16:04.579
 I'm sorry I kept you in the dark all this year. 

01:16:09.385 --> 01:16:13.191
 I need you Mary. 

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.408
 I've waited a long time for those words from your mouth. 

01:16:38.506 --> 01:16:41.710
 I want you to leave Washington, Mary. 

01:16:41.745 --> 01:16:44.915
 Evelyn, please use the tea. 

01:16:45.235 --> 01:16:49.161
 I truly appreciate what you came to talk to me. 

01:16:50.122 --> 01:16:52.846
 Things were not so bad ... 

01:16:52.881 --> 01:16:56.416
 With the death of my son and war ... 

01:16:56.451 --> 01:17:01.177
 I have to leave Washington, and I need great help. 

01:17:59.418 --> 01:18:04.866
 This war ends tonight. 

01:18:07.429 --> 01:18:13.438
 And with it, our millennial darkness. 

01:18:13.478 --> 01:18:17.563
 We have to do this on our own, nobody should know what's on the train. 

01:18:17.598 --> 01:18:20.567
 If we do not deliver weapons to the guys at Gettysburg, 

01:18:20.603 --> 01:18:24.172
 the war is over. 

01:18:27.056 --> 01:18:31.583
 It's time to get our own nation. 

01:18:32.784 --> 01:18:34.872
 Come. 

01:18:34.907 --> 01:18:37.756
 We have to catch the train. 

01:18:37.791 --> 01:18:40.475
 160 km from here to Gettysburg. 

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:44.681
 160 km will decide whether this nation is alive, 

01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:47.725
 or dead. 

01:19:16.165 --> 01:19:19.850
 Is Speede all right? 

01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:23.054
 I can not believe you are still writing in that book. 

01:19:23.089 --> 01:19:27.260
 Everything is in Speede, good with bad. 

01:19:48.289 --> 01:19:52.155
 What is this? - Escape from the nests, 

01:19:52.190 --> 01:19:56.020
 leave us free Washington. 

01:20:08.918 --> 01:20:12.122
 Look at me. 

01:20:12.323 --> 01:20:19.212
 I said, look at me. - Let her, we do not want to miss this train. 

01:20:49.494 --> 01:20:51.382
 Henry, what the hell are you doing here? 

01:20:51.417 --> 01:20:53.379
 I just wanted to see how far your nonsense would take you. 

01:20:53.415 --> 01:20:56.664
 I do not have time to quarrel. - I did not come to argue with you. 

01:20:56.704 --> 01:21:00.469
 I came to tell you that your dear friend Speed, 

01:21:00.509 --> 01:21:03.479
 traitor. 

01:21:03.514 --> 01:21:09.121
 You betrayed Abe, Speed ​​takes them ... - You have no idea what you're talking about. 

01:21:13.207 --> 01:21:15.931
 So that's all in the way. 

01:22:03.553 --> 01:22:05.328
 You have to leave the train. 

01:22:05.389 --> 01:22:07.369
 No, you have to leave the train. 

01:22:07.424 --> 01:22:09.495
 This is not your war, Henry. 

01:22:10.494 --> 01:22:11.529
 Ah. 

01:22:51.201 --> 01:22:52.373
 They are here, Abe. 

01:22:52.441 --> 01:22:55.334
 Here are Abe, the whole pile. 

01:22:55.369 --> 01:22:58.578
 We can not let it stop the train. - Get out of here and you're dead! 

01:22:58.613 --> 01:23:02.588
 Get out now, that's your last chance. 

01:23:04.473 --> 01:23:07.482
 Did you fill that miracle? 

01:23:07.963 --> 01:23:12.214
 We have to move away from the locomotives. 

01:26:10.692 --> 01:26:15.149
 Why do not you let him Lincoln? Emancipate yourself. 

01:26:15.184 --> 01:26:19.475
 I will never follow you. - You do not have to follow Abe. 

01:26:19.516 --> 01:26:22.504
 I have a train, I have your silver. 

01:26:22.539 --> 01:26:25.492
 Soon I'll have the whole country. 

01:26:25.532 --> 01:26:29.703
 I will destroy myth about Abraham Lincoln, 

01:26:29.744 --> 01:26:34.757
 so that history will remember you forever, not as a man, but as a monster! 

01:27:38.408 --> 01:27:44.143
 Lincoln set us up. We're deceiving Adam. 

01:27:44.178 --> 01:27:48.033
 There is no silver on this train. 

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.966
 Abe! 

01:28:15.989 --> 01:28:17.993
 Abe! 

01:28:18.515 --> 01:28:20.520
 Abe! 

01:28:34.277 --> 01:28:38.047
 Hello Speede. Where is silver? 

01:28:38.087 --> 01:28:41.577
 Silver? It should be here. 

01:28:41.612 --> 01:28:45.071
 Why did you lie to me ?! 

01:28:45.106 --> 01:28:50.000
 Let us all lurk in one place, to finish you. - Speed ​​?! 

01:28:51.123 --> 01:28:54.210
 Not! 

01:29:54.091 --> 01:29:57.345
 Mr. President! 

01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:00.989
 You do not have where to escape Lincoln! 

01:30:01.712 --> 01:30:05.802
 Where is?! Where is silver ?! 

01:30:09.091 --> 01:30:12.942
 Here it is! 

01:31:54.413 --> 01:31:56.664
 Thank you, Henry. 

01:31:56.699 --> 01:32:01.713
 I guess some vampires can trust. 

01:32:02.435 --> 01:32:06.205
 Like some people, Abraham. 

01:32:06.245 --> 01:32:11.659
 If the train was a bait, where was the silver? 

01:32:11.695 --> 01:32:15.916
 This is not the only line. 

01:32:15.951 --> 01:32:19.802
 A wise man once taught me, 

01:32:19.837 --> 01:32:23.692
 always have a backup plan. 

01:32:27.863 --> 01:32:30.390
 Bajunet, Springfield male mummies. 

01:32:30.425 --> 01:32:33.719
 Muškete Springfield! 

01:32:33.416 --> 01:32:36.056
 Five pounders and grenades are in the wagon. 

01:32:36.119 --> 01:32:37.462
 Come on, go there. 

01:33:34.410 --> 01:33:37.175
 Pali! 

01:33:45.629 --> 01:33:49.535
 87 years ago, 

01:33:49.571 --> 01:33:54.448
 our fathers have brought a new nation to this continent, 

01:33:54.483 --> 01:33:59.079
 conceived in freedom, and devoted to the conviction 

01:33:59.114 --> 01:34:03.675
 that all men are created equal. 

01:34:03.715 --> 01:34:07.216
 Now we are in a great civil war, 

01:34:07.251 --> 01:34:12.332
 and we can check whether this nation, any nation, 

01:34:12.367 --> 01:34:17.412
 so conceived and so relentless, long lasting. 

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:29.083
 To us, to the living, to be committed to the unfinished business, 

01:34:29.118 --> 01:34:34.773
 who were the ones who fought here so nobly. 

01:34:34.808 --> 01:34:41.190
 To us who are here to be faithful to the great task ahead of us 

01:34:41.225 --> 01:34:45.538
 to draw from these honorably more devoted to this goal 

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:50.299
 for which they paid the highest price of devotion, 

01:34:50.334 --> 01:34:56.431
 to gather here, decisively asserted that they did not die in vain, 

01:34:56.467 --> 01:35:02.121
 that this nation, under God, will experience a new birth of freedom, 

01:35:02.157 --> 01:35:09.031
 and that the government of the people, of the nations, of the people, 

01:35:09.066 --> 01:35:13.909
 will not disappear from the face of the earth. 

01:35:27.402 --> 01:35:30.247
 &lt;i&gt; Our enemies have performed their exodus. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:35:30.288 --> 01:35:35.211
 &lt;i&gt; Some in South America and the Orient. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:35:35.247 --> 01:35:40.652
 &lt;i&gt; They've seen America forever to be a nation of living people, &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:35:40.687 --> 01:35:44.798
 &lt;i&gt; the nation of free people. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:35:45.286 --> 01:35:47.319
 We do a pretty good team, you and me. 

01:35:47.359 --> 01:35:51.504
 You think about all the good we could do if we had more time. 

01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:58.618
 Unlimited time. - Yes, no one's waiting for time. 

01:35:58.653 --> 01:36:01.787
 We'll be late for the theater. 

01:36:05.039 --> 01:36:08.290
 Keep this for me, Henry. 

01:36:14.469 --> 01:36:19.020
 Mary, darling, did you see my hat? 

01:36:19.062 --> 01:36:21.866
 On your desk, at the office. 

01:36:22.272 --> 01:36:26.662
 Did you see my hat? - Abraham, let me make you immortal. 

01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:29.890
 To fight through the heels of our shoulders at the shoulders. 

01:36:29.926 --> 01:36:33.084
 They are not vampires alone that lives forever. 

01:36:50.317 --> 01:36:54.062
 &lt;i&gt; History loves legend more than people. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:36:54.097 --> 01:36:57.633
 &lt;i&gt; More pleasing nobility, than brutality. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:36:57.673 --> 01:37:01.291
 &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;i&gt; 

01:37:01.331 --> 01:37:06.661
 &lt;i&gt; History remembers the battle and forgets the blood. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:37:06.696 --> 01:37:10.558
 &lt;i&gt; As long as history is remembered, if it's at all ... &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:37:11.290 --> 01:37:17.468
 &lt;i&gt; It will only remember a fraction of the truth. &lt;/ i&gt; 

01:37:41.087 --> 01:37:44.033
 One more. 

01:37:46.051 --> 01:37:51.055
 The guy is so drunk just when he wants to kiss a girl or kill a man. 

01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:54.607
 What is it then? 

01:37:56.954 --> 01:38:01.954
