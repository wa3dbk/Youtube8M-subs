00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
so the next thing we're going to do is

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.610 
so the next thing we're going to do is
take<00:00:02.850> our<00:00:03.060> two<00:00:03.240> pieces<00:00:03.689> that<00:00:03.720> we<00:00:04.140> have<00:00:04.319> trimmed

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
take our two pieces that we have trimmed

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.559 
take our two pieces that we have trimmed
closely<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.460> we're<00:00:05.670> going<00:00:05.970> over<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.420> the

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
closely and we're going over to the

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.709 
closely and we're going over to the
machine<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.799> machine<00:00:07.830> is<00:00:08.490> set<00:00:08.820> up<00:00:09.059> for<00:00:09.450> a

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
machine and the machine is set up for a

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.039 
machine and the machine is set up for a
triple<00:00:10.349> zigzag<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:12.210> what<00:00:12.450> we're<00:00:12.630> going<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.780> do

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
triple zigzag and what we're going to do

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.919 
triple zigzag and what we're going to do
is<00:00:13.290> just<00:00:13.590> but<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.160> edges<00:00:14.580> together<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
is just but the edges together and the

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.349 
is just but the edges together and the
center<00:00:16.289> marking<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.100> foot<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.670> going<00:00:18.119> to

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
center marking on the foot is going to

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.820 
center marking on the foot is going to
be<00:00:18.980> where<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.189> two<00:00:20.369> pieces<00:00:20.640> come<00:00:21.090> together

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
be where the two pieces come together

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.590 
be where the two pieces come together
and<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.949> will<00:00:23.100> notice<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.789> have<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.359> ID

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
and you will notice that I have the ID

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.160 
and you will notice that I have the ID
teeny<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.410> gauge<00:00:25.970> if<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.210> am<00:00:27.269> solving<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.930> my

we're going to satin stitch right over
what<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:36.090> did

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.230 

if<00:02:05.680> you're<00:02:05.860> catching<00:02:06.130> more<00:02:06.580> than<00:02:06.760> one<00:02:06.940> piece
