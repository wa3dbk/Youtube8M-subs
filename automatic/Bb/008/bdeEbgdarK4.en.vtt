00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:10.430
 Log that the TV anime 1 p 144th was taken away 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:14.810
 The salvage monkey story synopsis is in good weather 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.910
 Falling something from the overhead of Luffy who to the public 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:23.750
 It seems not to rain 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:25.520
 A huge galleon ship from the sky if you think it has fallen a lot of pieces like pieces of wood 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.770
 It came down 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:35.460
 It 's like Hajin that has fallen 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:42.570
 In the female b, it has fallen down to a human boned coffin with many fragments 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:44.930
 I do not know where it has fallen without clouds even when I look up at the super sky, but then one more time 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.050
 A lot of strange things happen 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:53.350
 The waves are always on my arms and new 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:56.530
 Indicates whether the log post has broken or not 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.880
 Moreover, the point indicated by the guideline is above 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.750
 In other words , it points to the sky 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.720
 Log Paws only released the ground line of reliance 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.930
 Failure of the log post means that it can not be released 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:16.370
 Robin to match officer Nami 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:21.050
 Roguposu will begin to say that it would be deprived of the log to an empty island rather than broken 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.520
 In other words , not by being broken but by a stronger magnetic island 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:30.240
 It is why the log is rewritten 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:33.159
 Robin says this grand line should be suspicious not in log pose but in my head 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:40.539
 It is that it is a common sense person in 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:44.770
 Archaeologist Robin that person is in the South Blue born to restore the sand remains, which fell immediately 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:48.609
 In particular , the sea surface that it is a person over 100 years ago 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:53.070
 It sailed before fall came ship for more than 200 years 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:59.140
 I will unravel that it is the St. Bliss of South Blue 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:06.610
 I will have been floating around the sky at why some kind of for more than 200 years 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:13.250
 Thanks to Robin becoming a friend, one more person Blaine was made aside from the waves in a straw hat 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:16.370
 Luffy you have picked up a map from the front of the ship is sinking as possible while you are traveling 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.580
 The map is marked as skypia 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.450
 It seems to be a shame department of sky island 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.200
 Robin's story is more than an island in the sky 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:33.650
 There is a sea in the sky and there is an island there 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:37.790
 Robin is not so detailed either, so I can not advance the sky with a ship even if it is as it is 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:43.970
 But even huge ships like lines and grease 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:50.000
 Being able to go to the sky gets more information by saying that the woman b should be able to go 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:52.130
 In order to get some information from the sunken ship, the withdrawal of the sunken ship 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.690
 I will try salvage 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:03.710
 However, I can not afford to pull up that huge ship 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.770
 Let Luffy and Zorosanji wear simple diving suits made by Usopp in barrels and use them on the seabed 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.640
 I will 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:15.690
 But Le fees us without even while toward the bottom of the sea 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.740
 There is a monkey buying group where a man who has a style like a monkey or a gorilla who claims to be a salvage monkey is captain 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.910
 Appear 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.940
 Start salvage of lines and grease 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:29.870
 This area is a monkey's turkish rusk 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:33.610
 All ship that sank to the seabed around this monkey and Luffy us to do so claiming that your stuff is 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:38.830
 I do not want to hit but I can not 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:43.350
 A group of monkeys suddenly dive into the ocean floor as if they were done by the riffies 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:50.790
 Someone aiming at monkey will continue to dive to the ocean floor 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:53.140
 Monkey is 1 laps lightly punch also being attacked by creatures, such as in the middle of a huge sea serpent dive as of 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.970
 I am the owner of the fighting power 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:01.090
 Luffy don't worry if they're all right 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.810
 It is strange that the monkeys who encountered Luffy 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:13.160
 It seems that there was Luffy time and was familiar on the spot 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:17.750
 But then I came up with something huge shadow that appeared under the Mary 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:23.660
 Was a super-giant turtle as large as many times of the ship 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.889
 Moreover, the ship Le fees we had to salvage is in a huge bottle of mouth 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:32.550
 What happens to Luffy and the house 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:37.400
 The log where the TV anime dress No. 144 has been robbed so far 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.400
 Outline of salvage monkey story
