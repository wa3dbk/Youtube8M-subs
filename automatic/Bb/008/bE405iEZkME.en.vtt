00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.250
 the onion plants beautify theirs 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.770
 flowers especially in the spring garden 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.599
 to bloom these plants in time 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.969
 you should get in september 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.700
 at the latest december the onions 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.390
 have planted but what is the case 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.529
 to observe plants 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.550
 already when buying the onions should 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.369
 to consider 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.539
 the bigger the onion the better 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.539
 usually the quality 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.689
 most onion plants like one 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.160
 sunny location 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.860
 The floor should have a loose structure 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.600
 should have this fast for 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.399
 eat a loamy soil for example 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.590
 where there is a handful of sand in that 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.379
 Plant hole can be given to prevent this 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.940
 a forum of onions before planting 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.100
 when the onions on the selected 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.010
 surface designed for an overview of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.050
 to get the later location 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.250
 it is smaller plants forward 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.250
 to big backwards 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.850
 should look natural 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.000
 circle and four ex from families will be na 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.150
 Great, that's what you're telling us now 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.350
 is the gardener 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.120
 also onions should not 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.310
 alone but in groups of ten to 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.640
 Planted 25 pieces per square meter 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.640
 become 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.000
 a flat pit for planting 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.000
 shoveled 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.789
 the plant depth depends on the 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.340
 onion bigger than rough orientation 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.000
 they say about three times as deep as the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.350
 onion is planted 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.310
 then cover the hole with earth 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.310
 and pour on 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.530
 to light up again with onions 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.530
 is a label very helpful
