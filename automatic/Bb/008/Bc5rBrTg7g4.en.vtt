00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.020 

I<00:00:12.679> get<00:00:13.679> all<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:13.889> great<00:00:14.070> action<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.580> my<00:00:14.730> kids

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
I get all this great action of my kids

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.609 
I get all this great action of my kids
and<00:00:15.360> think<00:00:15.539> I'm<00:00:15.629> getting<00:00:15.869> really<00:00:16.080> good<00:00:16.289> shots

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
and think I'm getting really good shots

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.409 
and think I'm getting really good shots
but<00:00:16.980> then<00:00:17.520> when<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.700> go<00:00:17.880> home<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.180> look<00:00:18.240> at<00:00:18.360> the

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:18.419 
but then when I go home and look at the

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:20.089 
but then when I go home and look at the
pictures<00:00:18.779> they<00:00:19.080> just<00:00:19.259> seem<00:00:19.439> lifeless

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
pictures they just seem lifeless

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.429 
pictures they just seem lifeless
there's<00:00:20.490> something<00:00:20.849> missing<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.990> just

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
there's something missing and I just

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.260 
there's something missing and I just
don't<00:00:22.529> know<00:00:22.619> what<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.950> is<00:00:23.099> well<00:00:23.789> most<00:00:24.029> likely

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
don't know what it is well most likely

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.210 
don't know what it is well most likely
what's<00:00:24.750> happening<00:00:25.200> is<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.349> your<00:00:25.619> subject<00:00:26.070> is

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
what's happening is that your subject is

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.370 
what's happening is that your subject is
too<00:00:26.580> far<00:00:26.880> away<00:00:27.000> from<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.480> camera<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.140> too

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
too far away from the camera it's too

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.160 
too far away from the camera it's too
small<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> picture<00:00:29.869> often<00:00:30.869> when<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.140> look

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
small in the picture often when we look

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.080 
small in the picture often when we look
through<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.590> viewfinder<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.519> tricks<00:00:32.790> us<00:00:32.970> into

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
through the viewfinder it tricks us into

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.700 
through the viewfinder it tricks us into
thinking<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.570> we're<00:00:33.780> close<00:00:33.989> enough<00:00:34.019> and<00:00:34.590> we

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
thinking that we're close enough and we

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.770 
thinking that we're close enough and we
just<00:00:34.890> can't<00:00:35.070> believe<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.610> but<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.300> got<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.629> do

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
just can't believe it but you got to do

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.380 
just can't believe it but you got to do
is<00:00:37.110> move<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.070> closer<00:00:38.370> even<00:00:38.940> when<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.150> think

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
is move in closer even when you think

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.840 
is move in closer even when you think
you're<00:00:39.510> close<00:00:39.690> enough<00:00:40.080> the<00:00:40.949> tendency<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.640> to

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
you're close enough the tendency is to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.670 
you're close enough the tendency is to
try<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.089> include<00:00:42.299> everything<00:00:42.839> in<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.409> photo

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
try to include everything in the photo

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.340 
try to include everything in the photo
the<00:00:44.100> whole<00:00:44.339> team<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.909> whole<00:00:45.059> field<00:00:45.420> what<00:00:46.199> you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the whole team the whole field what you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.810 
the whole team the whole field what you
really<00:00:46.530> want<00:00:46.830> to<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.040> is<00:00:47.190> identify<00:00:47.339> your

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
really want to do is identify your

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.750 
really want to do is identify your
specific<00:00:48.570> subject<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.260> then<00:00:49.830> focus<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.549> on

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
specific subject and then focus just on

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.119 
specific subject and then focus just on
that<00:00:51.000> excluding<00:00:51.750> everything<00:00:51.930> else<00:00:52.409> so<00:00:52.680> if

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
that excluding everything else so if

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.100 
that excluding everything else so if
your<00:00:53.369> subject<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.909> just<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.449> kid<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:54.960> they're

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
your subject is just your kid as they're

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.990 
your subject is just your kid as they're
about<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.350> kick<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.860> ball<00:00:56.040> you<00:00:56.280> want<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.850> try

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
about to kick the ball you want to try

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.590 
about to kick the ball you want to try
to<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.330> close<00:00:57.540> to<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:57.960> possible

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.820 

another<00:01:03.600> trick<00:01:03.869> that<00:01:04.049> I'm<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.320> do<00:01:04.470> is

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
another trick that I'm going to do is

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.010 
another trick that I'm going to do is
I'm<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.400> use<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.850> remote<00:01:06.240> control<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
I'm going to use a remote control to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.880 
I'm going to use a remote control to
come<00:01:07.439> out<00:01:07.590> from<00:01:07.770> behind<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.189> camera<00:01:09.650> if<00:01:10.650> I'm

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
come out from behind the camera if I'm

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.280 
come out from behind the camera if I'm
always<00:01:11.189> burying<00:01:11.820> my<00:01:12.000> face<00:01:12.299> behind<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.990> black

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
always burying my face behind this black

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.980 
always burying my face behind this black
box<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:14.070> cut<00:01:15.000> off<00:01:15.149> the<00:01:15.179> interaction<00:01:15.899> that

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
box I cut off the interaction that

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.840 
box I cut off the interaction that
happens<00:01:16.350> between<00:01:16.500> me<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.399> subject<00:01:19.850> by

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
happens between me and the subject by

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.630 
happens between me and the subject by
using<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.329> tripod<00:01:21.539> I<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.590> not<00:01:22.829> worry<00:01:23.100> about<00:01:23.219> my

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
using a tripod I can not worry about my

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
of thirds where I thought the rule of

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.909 
of thirds where I thought the rule of
thirds<00:06:15.849> is<00:06:16.209> a<00:06:16.269> guideline<00:06:16.709> photographers<00:06:17.709> and

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919
