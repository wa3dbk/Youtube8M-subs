00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.499 
okay then you play an open first string
open<00:04:20.049> sixth<00:04:20.349> string<00:04:20.590> then<00:04:21.459> you<00:04:21.489> gonna<00:04:21.789> do<00:04:21.969> this

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.540 

it's<00:04:25.509> a<00:04:25.569> real<00:04:25.810> quick<00:04:26.110> hammer-on<00:04:26.860> pull-off<00:04:26.889> on

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
it's a real quick hammer-on pull-off on

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.790 
it's a real quick hammer-on pull-off on
your<00:04:28.150> third<00:04:29.020> string<00:04:29.349> zero<00:04:29.710> two<00:04:29.830> two<00:04:29.979> zero

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
your third string zero two two zero

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.350 
your third string zero two two zero
then<00:04:32.159> you<00:04:32.250> play<00:04:32.400> your<00:04:32.550> third<00:04:32.789> fret<00:04:33.060> fourth

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
then you play your third fret fourth

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:42.300 
then you play your third fret fourth
string<00:04:35.539> just<00:04:36.539> like<00:04:36.690> that

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:49.500 

that's<00:04:42.790> measure<00:04:43.090> three

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.210

okay<00:05:10.960> so<00:05:11.020> far<00:05:11.470> starting<00:05:11.860> to<00:05:11.949> measure<00:05:12.130> one

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
okay so far starting to measure one

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:21.200 
okay so far starting to measure one
we've<00:05:12.550> got<00:05:12.699> this

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.300 

okay<00:05:21.840> now<00:05:22.020> we're<00:05:22.199> ready<00:05:22.380> for<00:05:22.440> that<00:05:22.620> slant<00:05:23.070> to

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
okay now we're ready for that slant to

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.950 
okay now we're ready for that slant to
give<00:05:23.430> us<00:05:23.550> that<00:05:23.729> C<00:05:23.940> minor<00:05:24.180> sound

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.990 

let<00:05:27.440> me<00:05:27.530> just<00:05:27.680> do<00:05:27.830> that<00:05:27.860> basically<00:05:28.669> I'm<00:05:28.970> doing

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
let me just do that basically I'm doing

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.090 
let me just do that basically I'm doing
a<00:05:29.210> forward<00:05:29.479> slant<00:05:29.870> they're<00:05:30.199> on<00:05:30.590> my<00:05:30.800> fourth

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
a forward slant they're on my fourth

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.070 
a forward slant they're on my fourth
fret<00:05:31.370> and<00:05:31.400> fifth<00:05:31.729> string<00:05:32.000> and<00:05:32.210> fifth<00:05:32.930> fret

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
fret and fifth string and fifth fret

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.909 
fret and fifth string and fifth fret
third<00:05:33.410> string<00:05:33.440> so<00:05:34.370> this<00:05:34.550> is<00:05:34.699> my<00:05:34.820> C<00:05:35.090> major

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
third string so this is my C major

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.290 
third string so this is my C major
because<00:05:36.919> I'm<00:05:37.130> playing<00:05:37.340> an<00:05:37.460> E<00:05:37.610> natural<00:05:37.639> and

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
because I'm playing an E natural and

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.879 
because I'm playing an E natural and
then<00:05:39.229> a<00:05:39.259> C<00:05:40.479> that's<00:05:41.479> the<00:05:41.690> major<00:05:42.259> third<00:05:42.620> of<00:05:42.800> our

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
then a C that's the major third of our

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.490 
then a C that's the major third of our
chord<00:05:43.190> and<00:05:43.400> the<00:05:44.060> root<00:05:44.750> of<00:05:44.840> our<00:05:44.960> chord<00:05:45.169> of<00:05:45.259> a<00:05:45.350> C

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
chord and the root of our chord of a C

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.870 
chord and the root of our chord of a C
chord<00:05:46.660> right<00:05:48.009> but<00:05:49.009> do<00:05:49.100> you<00:05:49.160> get<00:05:49.220> that<00:05:49.400> C<00:05:49.610> minor

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
chord right but do you get that C minor

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.580 
chord right but do you get that C minor
sound<00:05:50.180> I'm<00:05:50.360> going<00:05:50.509> to<00:05:50.570> flat<00:05:50.780> that<00:05:51.020> third<00:05:51.320> and

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
sound I'm going to flat that third and

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.710 
sound I'm going to flat that third and
you<00:05:52.340> can<00:05:52.490> do<00:05:52.639> that<00:05:52.820> and<00:05:52.940> still<00:05:53.120> play<00:05:53.270> that<00:05:53.449> root

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
you can do that and still play that root

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.540 
you can do that and still play that root
if<00:05:53.960> you<00:05:54.169> slant<00:05:54.470> your<00:05:54.560> bar
