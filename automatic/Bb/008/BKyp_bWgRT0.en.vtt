00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:36.000
 his feet were part of iron and part 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.690
 clay you were looking at when you 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.239
 he took a stone from the mountain without it 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.010

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.940
 they broke in an instant iron clay 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.969

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.689
 you are the head of gold 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.570
 after you and another kingdom will arise 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.180
 lower than yours and then a third party 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.200
 bronze kingdom that will dominate over the whole 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.299
 land 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.750
 a fourth kingdom will be as solid as the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.799
 iron because iron breaks destroys 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.100
 everything is like the iron that destroys 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.979

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.130
 you saw the feet and fingers were in 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.979

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.830
 iron that means it will be a kingdom 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.789
 composed in him there will be the solidity of the 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.579
 iron with soft clay if the fingers of 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.700
 his feet were partly of iron and in 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.549
 part of clay means a part 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.110
 of the kingdom will be solid and part will be

 fragile to the days of dressing in god of 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.539
 heaven will give rise to a kingdom that will not be 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.420
 destroyed forever and its power not 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.149
 will be given to another people it 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.670
 will break and destroy all those 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.670
 kingdoms but it will remain forever
