00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 and 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.190
 all right 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.289
 I'm in today's car testing the nissan 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.650
 Pulsar 1.5 dCi 110 horses climb 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.650
 with me 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.580
 in the brand's new compact 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.580
 Japanese given its maximum power at 4000 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:40.170
 revolutions per minute this is a 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.899
 supercharged tetracylinder mechanics 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.670
 and it's him and I can tell you that this 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.670
 car that I do not know if it's very tuned 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.750
 to 268 meters of torque between one thousand 752 thousand 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.940
 five hundred laps accelerates from zero to 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.250
 one hundred in eleven with five seconds and 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.210
 reaches a top speed of 190 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.210
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.660
 and it is announced at a consumption of 4 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.780
 column in city 3 with 3 liters in 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.600
 highway and 3 with 6 on average all at 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.180
 100 equivalents to 94 grams per 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.900
 kilometer of missions so it complies with 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.900
 the euro 5 standard 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.830
 the start and stop start system and 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.830
 Automatic stop helps the figures 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.040
 contained in the expense of these mechanics 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.250
 volunteers does not cost much to launch and 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.680
 allows high cruises with a consumption 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.100
 very content during this test that does not 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.820
 still 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.820
 I've got consumptions of 4 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.490
 7 liters to 100 now on the road 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:03.060
 withdrawal the figure has been triggered 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.060
 the travel computer up to eight and a half 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.420
 the address will say hard is accurate and makes 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.720
 that the pulsar is a car make the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.720
 zone 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:33.019
 and six-speed manual transmission to 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:36.469
 that is associated with this version offers a 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:39.310
 decent touch is not inside to 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:44.689
 sports driving but yes it allows 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:47.599
 more or less exact inserts 2,382 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:50.629
 kilos of the set are not a handicap anymore 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:55.450
 that not everything to this agile Japanese compact 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.450
 and perfect for finished areas 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:04.650
 partly also because of their great battle of 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.650
 2,700 millimeters 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:16.090
 to the limit the pulsar is a car sighs 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:19.560
 d'or it shows a little bit that lazada accompanies 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.560
 in curve but all surprise 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.570
 the suspension that mounts this version is 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.830
 balanced offering a great 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.830
 compromise between 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.920
 and I speak 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.800
 the disc brakes do their job 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.370
 the touch of the criminal is progressive and are 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.370
 powerful 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.019
 the support that the seats give 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.019
 front 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.819
 well this is the nissan press a compact 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.819
 revolutionary agile and with character 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.769
 main rival of the models 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.769
 generalists 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:24.120
 up to here the nissan pulsar test 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.120
 1.5 dci 110 horses 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.300
 also hooks in there
