00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.690
 hello good in this video let's see 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.000
 how friar's ears do a 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.670
 sweet that is very good is very fast and 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.110
 simple to make 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:27.270
 We are going to need two eggs 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.910
 to sugar flour and olive oil 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:35.450
 ok let's start putting the two 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.450
 eggs on the plate and let's beat them 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.740
 let's take a spoonful of flour 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.570
 for each egg that we have thrown in 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.630
 this case we have laid two eggs 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.360
 then we take two tablespoons of 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.000
 flour is worth here in this mass we have 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.760
 gone a little bit with what we got 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.030
 do another because if they do not come out very fat 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.000
 and they really are not that fat we prepare 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.950
 a dish with sugar and now in oil 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.220
 very very hot 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.880
 as you can see here the most liquid mass comes out 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.119
 which is the normal thing that is more liquid and 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.000
 with the warm scoop it has to be 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.700
 of metal because if you do not do not let go 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.340
 because we tried it with wood and did not 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.170
 let go, as you see, here we have 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.450
 help a little bit first but good 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.880
 now you will see that the following ones come out 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.360
 right away when they are a 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.420
 little golden, that's when when there 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.619
 that get them out as you see is very fast 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.740
 to do it simply is to make the dough and 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.200
 that the oil is hot then it 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.710
 goes through the sugar when they are 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.890
 hot so they are well impregnated 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.590
 and we would have what is coming 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.560
 friar ears because they are called ears 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.470
 of friar good here some come out well 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.930
 and others not so much worth is for example 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.200
 in look as you see we have here the lobe 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.060
 from the ear and good looks like an ear 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.250
 then others look like elven ears and 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.030
 for a style because he does not know very much there 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.790
 but good 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.580
 the question is that and nothing because 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.580
 we have our friar ears I hope 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.530
 that you liked it and nothing to give me 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.660

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.610
