00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.499
 well before starting the video if 

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.660
 you want to buy coins pass by wifi 

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:07.400
 za coins dotcom you have the link in the 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.589
 description of the video and nothing you have the 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.619
 Cheaper coins from the market very 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:14.539
 fast cover 5% of it and also 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.670
 with my widget discount code that will 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.230
 you also have the description 5 for 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.660
 percent cheaper still so 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.190
 we swim with today's video hello everyone 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.740
 I am sincere with and good welcome to 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.600
 a new episode of top and cheap the 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.330
 fifth episode I already believe and good today 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.090
 I bring four new players as 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.950
 always and they are players a tad more 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.100
 expensive than those that I have been bringing you 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.810
 other episodes because none none 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.130
 low of a thousand coins but good still 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.950
 so I think they can be included in 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.860
 cheap and good and you'll see them 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.050
 prices as you always have them here 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.060
 where I have the little arrow now and good 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.970
 because the first one is david luiz on 8 the 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.340
 last year that we have him in chelsea 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.010
 or in teams of the barclays because 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.890
 you know that I go to psg and also they are going 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.410
 to put as mcd besides and it's a pity 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.250
 because as central in equipment the 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.560
 barclays 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.260
 and if you put it is still a fifa 14 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.330
 great, really cool, I said it's 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.130
 for me I think that the best central 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.380
 game now I do not keep thinking about it 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.400
 because I have tasted good the tried and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.220
 I have thiago silva tok tok tok tok tok tok 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.500
 tok tok tok 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.550
 and I've tried enough centrals too 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.370
 yes yes everything and good but of all 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.200
 forms I think of the rare ones without a doubt 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.770
 of the top three centers so 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.640
 less yes that is david luiz in everything 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.479
 very fast it takes it very well 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.570
 head is great is is quite high 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.520
 strong and defends great so everything 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.710
 that you have to ask a central 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.560
 he has it and well I say no doubt one of 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.650
 the best game centrals and the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.390
 next test edison cavani one player 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.640
 with a very high average but not 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.670
 I understand why he has not sold us expensive 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.009
 at no time has been expensive cavani 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.470
 I believe that for more than 20 thousand has never 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:12.730
 come to be and I do not know why because 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.170
 I have some great statistics and now 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.690
 I say I do not understand why it never arrives 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.030
 to be expensive and you have him right now 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.660
 less than three thousand coins that yes no 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.300
 does not have much dribble is the only thing that does not 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.550
 has no watermarks or anything like that but 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.380
 the rest is great to notice is the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.400
 few forwards that go from 80 in all 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.620
 and in addition to long with 83 84 84 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.670
 it's quick for me I would even give it 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.700
 more than 83 is really fast enough 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.430
 then the shot is spectacular a 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.110
 impeccable definition it is already 90 here 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.100
 yes that is true a definition 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.020
 very good 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.280
 and then the head shot equal with 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.100
 84 in the centers never fails and the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.410
 corner equal many goals and 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.950
 Well right now I do not have it because 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.959
 I sold to open envelopes of the world but 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.840
 but that cavani is one of the best 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.360
 front of the game I believe without a doubt and 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.459
 I do not know a little undervalued I believe in 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.080
 this fifa because you do not have many 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.110
 times consider the best thing to do 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.670
 team if it's a super forward of the 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.670
 best of the game I already say has a very 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.319
 good positioning is strong is high and 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.290
 so, well, that roman is very good 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.920
 head shot of all kinds in 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.480
 longshot is very good on penalties 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.260
 all everything in the definition about everything 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.790
 tremendous volleys does not come out has throw runs 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.740
 and header is the forward 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.500
 perfect 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.890
 and I say what 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.430
 is very valued in this game and very 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.159
 recommended cavani that is great 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.200
 the following the next speed techniques 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:59.069
 sad that it cost me to learn to 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.620
 pronounce his name I thought it was I do not know 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.799
 as I said but I did not know how to pronounce it and 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.580
 if using it so much is one of the best 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:11.090
 lateral right of the game no doubt 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.070
 very fast with 85 but with 87 in 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.160
 sprint speed which is what I most 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.600
 matter to me is as offensive as it is 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.299
 that is very good offensively and 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.000
 defensively is doing both 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.810
 very well and I think I could not 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 highlight 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.650
 one more than another is defensively and 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.139
 offensively very good 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.080
 very fast the centers that has 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.580
 real good 86 means that the 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.460
 better centers also that can have 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:43.320
 a very strong side also this 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.880
 side with 80 is also high and then 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.750
 goes pretty well head between your 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.970
 force its its height and all this 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.960
 sorry then in the air game also 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.639
 stands out quite a wall is not them 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.610
 it costs a lot to rivals to leave 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:02.220
 he costs me when I play against him 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.080
 and I do not know without a doubt it's one of the best 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.940
 side of the game and I think the 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.490
 best right side of the bundesliga 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.830
 better than the anp without any doubt and 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.990
 Quite cheaper for 1400 coins that 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.150
 it has also lowered enough lukasz 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.660
 Piszczek recommended and maximum and the last 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.080
 today is also lucas lucas moura del 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.080
 psg 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.270
 Well, this player, I love it 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.270
 I tell him trying a lot of time and it's a 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.410
 I felt that always 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.900
 also the whole game has been very 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.699
 cheap when I thought also that 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.180
 It would have to be much more expensive but 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:41.040
 Well better if it's cheaper then better 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.169
 very fast super fast the shot that has 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.990
 the cross shot that has 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.060
 It is one of the best I 've tried too 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.699
 I do when you are running around 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.800
 speed with by the right band and 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.320
 you make a cross shot towards the action to 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.360
 the left 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.300
 it does not fail almost never is it really 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.220
 great lucas lucas moura and then yes 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.020
 you want to change the middle band of 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.930
 match to throw quality shots 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.330
 it's still very well the same then 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.910
 the dribble he has is also what 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.340
 better than you have and above all that your 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.130
 speed his shot crossed his dribble and 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.320
 then the centers and the pass is also 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.210
 pretty good so nothing all very 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.620
 recommended as always and nothing I hope 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.250
 that you liked a greeting and even the 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.250
 next video
