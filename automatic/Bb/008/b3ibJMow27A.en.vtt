using the corner of the sponge I'm going
to<00:00:26.760> start<00:00:26.970> applying<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> nail<00:00:28.130> you

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
to start applying it on the nail you

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.410 
to start applying it on the nail you
always<00:00:29.310> want<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.550> start<00:00:29.849> from<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.119> end<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.330> the

always want to start from the end of the
nail<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.779> then<00:00:30.869> slowly<00:00:31.170> work<00:00:31.439> your<00:00:31.470> way<00:00:31.650> down

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
nail and then slowly work your way down

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.709 
nail and then slowly work your way down
otherwise<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.790> won't<00:00:32.940> get<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.360> gradient

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
otherwise you won't get that gradient

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:41.370

effect

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.570 

also<00:00:42.380> because<00:00:42.560> it's<00:00:42.710> quite<00:00:43.070> a<00:00:43.100> light<00:00:43.310> color

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
also because it's quite a light color

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.190 
also because it's quite a light color
you'll<00:00:43.850> probably<00:00:44.030> need<00:00:44.450> to<00:00:44.570> apply<00:00:44.810> two<00:00:44.870> to

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
you'll probably need to apply two to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.840 
you'll probably need to apply two to

polish which is the sparkle overcoat
this<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:44.869> what<00:01:45.020> will<00:01:45.170> give<00:01:45.290> it<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.409> beautiful
