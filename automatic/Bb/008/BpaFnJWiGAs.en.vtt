00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
pushing it bourbon further back but in a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.289 
pushing it bourbon further back but in a
way<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.590> work<00:01:25.799> at<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.670> it's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
way if you work at it like this it's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
actually a good thing because they're

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.440 
actually a good thing because they're
making<00:01:29.130> sure<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.579> everything<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.150> covered

scription but we can't getting off topic
but<00:02:11.340> my<00:02:11.460> point<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.210> that<00:02:12.270> sometimes<00:02:13.050> people

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
but my point is is that sometimes people

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.690 
but my point is is that sometimes people
really<00:02:13.770> look<00:02:13.920> forward<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.280> getting<00:02:14.610> these
