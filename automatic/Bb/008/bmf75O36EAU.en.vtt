00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
how do you make the design original

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.380 
how do you make the design original
again<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.230> part<00:00:19.529> one<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:20.100> kind<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.550> got<00:00:21.150> cut

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the different ways you can make the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.019 
the different ways you can make the
design<00:00:28.080> original<00:00:28.590> even<00:00:28.890> by<00:00:29.039> accident<00:00:29.580> you

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
design original even by accident you

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.130 
design original even by accident you
know<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.420> saying<00:00:30.660> even<00:00:30.990> by<00:00:31.109> our

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
know what I'm saying even by our

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.049 
know what I'm saying even by our
designers<00:00:31.710> made<00:00:31.859> by<00:00:32.009> accident<00:00:32.489> as<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.730> go<00:00:32.880> back

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
designers made by accident as I go back

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.770 
designers made by accident as I go back
to<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.360> design<00:00:33.750> right<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:35.390> if<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.600> go<00:00:36.750> to

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
to this design right here if you go to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.450 
to this design right here if you go to
this<00:00:36.989> tool<00:00:37.260> right<00:00:37.739> there<00:00:38.010> at<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.160> bottom

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
this tool right there at the bottom

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.180 
this tool right there at the bottom
you'll<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.210> what<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.600> talking<00:00:39.629> about<00:00:40.190> it's

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
you'll see what I'm talking about it's

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.729 
you'll see what I'm talking about it's
just<00:00:41.430> flipping<00:00:41.820> tool<00:00:42.030> right<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.469> this<00:00:43.469> tool

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
just flipping tool right here this tool

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.639 
just flipping tool right here this tool
right<00:00:43.980> here<00:00:44.510> like<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.629> said<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:46.110> very<00:00:46.379> useful

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
right here like I said it's very useful

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.119 
right here like I said it's very useful
you<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.850> make<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> design<00:00:48.620> just<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:49.980> you

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
you can make a design just from you

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.650 
you can make a design just from you
doing<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.910> something<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.329> from<00:00:51.539> playing

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
doing like something just from playing

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.150 
doing like something just from playing
around<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.379> make<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.710> totally

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
around you can make it a totally

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.299 
around you can make it a totally
different<00:00:53.550> design<00:00:53.879> by<00:00:54.780> accident<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.680> play

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
different design by accident you play

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.160 
different design by accident you play
around<00:00:56.550> with<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.910> lot<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.109> said

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
around with this a lot and like I said

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.410 
around with this a lot and like I said
you<00:00:58.410> don't<00:00:58.500> even<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> save<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.420> right

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you don't even have to save it right

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.240 
you don't even have to save it right
here<00:01:00.629> as<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:00.899> see<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.770> changed<00:01:01.980> it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
here as you can see like it changed it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.299 
here as you can see like it changed it
to<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.670> type<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.149> bubble<00:01:03.960> type<00:01:04.170> things<00:01:04.439> you

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
to to type of bubble type things you

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.120 
to to type of bubble type things you
don't<00:01:05.489> necessarily<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.210> use<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.650> an

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
don't necessarily have to use this as an

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.820 
don't necessarily have to use this as an
example<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.880> simple<00:01:09.510> design<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.350> said<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
example a simple design like I said a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.580 
example a simple design like I said a
simple<00:01:11.760> design<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.330> become<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:13.110> very

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
simple design can become a very

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.100 
simple design can become a very
intricate<00:01:14.040> design<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.729> by<00:01:14.909> accident<00:01:15.150> by

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
intricate design just by accident by

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.609 
intricate design just by accident by
using<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.650> flipping<00:01:17.130> tool<00:01:18.320> i'm<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
using this flipping tool i'm going to

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.800 
using this flipping tool i'm going to
show<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.770> later<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.000> film<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.570> go

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
show you later on in the film you go

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.499 
show you later on in the film you go
back<00:01:21.960> out<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.619> know<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.610> know<00:01:23.759> disregard

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
back out you know you know disregard

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.880 
back out you know you know disregard
that<00:01:24.689> if<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.900> don't<00:01:25.049> want<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.409> i<00:01:25.560> said<00:01:25.799> if

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
that if you don't want it like i said if

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.890 
that if you don't want it like i said if
you<00:01:25.950> don't<00:01:26.130> want<00:01:26.280> any<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.580> these<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:27.750> know

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
you don't want any of these you know

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.140 
you don't want any of these you know
just<00:01:28.140> go<00:01:28.350> back<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.770> start<00:01:29.250> all<00:01:29.369> over<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:30.060> if

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
just go back out start all over see if

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.340 
just go back out start all over see if
it<00:01:30.270> will<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.600> what<00:01:30.720> happens<00:01:30.990> again<00:01:31.140> if<00:01:31.259> you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it will see what happens again if you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.149 
it will see what happens again if you
try<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> flip<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.100> another<00:01:32.400> way<00:01:32.549> first<00:01:34.159> because

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
try to flip it another way first because

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.310 
try to flip it another way first because
in<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.400> lot<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.909> lot<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.329> instances<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:36.990> you

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
in a lot of a lot of instances if you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.069 
in a lot of a lot of instances if you
flip<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.329> differently<00:01:39.329> first<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
flip it differently first like if you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.080 
flip it differently first like if you
flip<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.320> around<00:01:40.470> first<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.490> change<00:01:41.880> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
flip it around first in a change to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.210 
flip it around first in a change to
something<00:01:42.270> different<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.049> then<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.950> you

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
something different and then if you you

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.490 
something different and then if you you
know<00:01:44.250> flip<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.700> upside<00:01:45.000> down<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:46.079> change<00:01:46.320> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
know flip it upside down and a change to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.219 
know flip it upside down and a change to
a<00:01:46.530> hold<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.070> different<00:01:47.399> design<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:49.020> that's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
a hold of a different design so that's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.510 
a hold of a different design so that's

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
this video is how the designs can be

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.130 
this video is how the designs can be
used<00:02:01.670> by<00:02:02.670> at<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.909> designs<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.600> make<00:02:03.780> my<00:02:03.930> ex

used by at the designs you make my ex

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.059 
used by at the designs you make my ex
and<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.619> used<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.040> actual<00:02:05.520> restless<00:02:06.149> um
