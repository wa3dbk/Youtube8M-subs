00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370

but<00:03:28.470> beyond<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.490> you<00:03:29.760> know<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:29.880> think<00:03:30.270> it<00:03:30.510> was

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
but beyond that you know I think it was

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.240

pretty hard for the course what we've

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.440 
pretty hard for the course what we've
seen<00:03:32.400> from<00:03:32.460> the<00:03:32.610> past<00:03:32.820> few<00:03:32.940> weeks<00:03:33.210> out<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.360> the
