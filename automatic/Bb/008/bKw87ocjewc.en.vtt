00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello how about youtube friends 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.400
 welcome to the channel and a new video 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.350
 this time I bring you the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.630
 presentation of the champion echo the new 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.780
 league of legends champion and that is already 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.700
 I told them that this was taken 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.490
 from the official page of league of 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.170
 legends so good let's see the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.140
 champion skills let's start 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.420
 with the passive I followed resonance press 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.820
 set to attacks and offensive spell of 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.920
 deco bar accumulating resonance on their 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.990
 enemies every three attacks against 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.910
 the same unit activates its passive that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.540
 inflicts additional damage and slows down 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.149
 enemy 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.730
 also if he shoots his passive on a 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.190
 Enemy eco champion wins a powerful 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.969
 improvement of movement speed this 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.969
 we will see it below 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.160
 let's see your cv rewind rewind 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.809
 of time that ccoo launched a device 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.420
 which damages all the enemies located 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.820
 in its trajectory when reaching its maximum 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.040
 distance or flip a rival champion the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.750
 device expands and creates a field 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.600
 that slows down all the units 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.630
 enemies and neutrals after a while 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.210
 the device contracts again and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.690
 quickly returns to echo all the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.619
 enemy units located in your way 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.619
 they receive additional damage 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.460
 we go with their double parallel convergence 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.200
 this has a passive and an active the 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.299
 passive to the basic attacks of echo 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.509
 inflict additional damage to the objective to 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.179
 the targets with little life and its active 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.189
 echo opens a crack in time that 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.670
 creates a copy of itself in a 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.039
 alternative reality that by launching a 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.490
 ball that throws a device towards a 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.979
 marked point after a slight delay the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.500
 device expands and creates a wide 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.009
 slowdown and echo zone enters the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.260
 sphere this exploits explodes and 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.720
 provides a shield at the same time 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.530
 stun all the enemies located in 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.530
 its interior 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.750
 let's see your phase jump eco moves 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.420
 at a fixed distance to a place 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.130
 marked as soon as the first one 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.610
 dry displacement receives a large 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.770
 increase in scope in your next 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.340
 basic attack and run towards your goal 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.150
 who harms and applies impact effects 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.150
 and spell 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.870
 let's go with his ere his definite time 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.300
 rupture and runs today in time what 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.160
 means that for a few moments there 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.460
 it can be attacked and it will come back 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.500
 invulnerable before reappearing in the 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.500
 same place where I was a few seconds 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.180
 back when it reappears it recovers a part 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.390
 of the life I had lost in those 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.890
 seconds and inflicts a lot of damage to 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.890
 all nearby enemies 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.390
 good guys this was the new echo 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.210
 league flame champion I hope that you 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.600
 have liked this video and nothing the truth 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.880
 that I see it quite viable clean very 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.400
 very good I think it's going to be broken at 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.530
 first until they see surely 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.270
 but I hope you have served 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.550
 this information I remind you that it was 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.480
 all taken from the official pages of 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.730
 lyco fleischer so nothing if any 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.560
 you want to see it in detail you can see it 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.390
 on the official riot page so 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.190
 I hope you liked this 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.260
 remember to like the video if you 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.120
 I like to share it with your friends many 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.540
 thank you all we see each other until the 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.540
 next
