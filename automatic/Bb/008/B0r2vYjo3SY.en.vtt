00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
it's a little harder well just because

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.550 
it's a little harder well just because
it's<00:01:33.790> a<00:01:33.909> bit<00:01:34.060> odd<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.750> be<00:01:34.780> moving<00:01:35.290> sideways<00:01:37.560> you

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
it's a bit odd to be moving sideways you

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.830 
it's a bit odd to be moving sideways you
want<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.829> give<00:01:38.950> it<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.130> try<00:01:39.340> oh<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:43.030> lot
