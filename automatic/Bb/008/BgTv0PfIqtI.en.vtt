because<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.540> laugh<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.930> minute<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.439> think<00:01:31.759> so

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
because to laugh a minute I think so

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.960 
because to laugh a minute I think so
it's<00:01:32.909> backwards<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:35.189> hard<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.640> them<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
it's backwards so it's hard for them to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.350 
it's backwards so it's hard for them to
play<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> guitar<00:01:38.780> this<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.960> justin<00:01:40.470> bieber<00:01:41.360> at
