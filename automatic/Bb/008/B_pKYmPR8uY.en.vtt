00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.750
 try all that it is in this 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:03.109

 get we need arrows we need 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:19.389
 arrows because arrows would have nowhere 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.889
 So 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.530
 look around look around so important 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:28.419
 so that no one saw us once again 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.419
 once again just so no one saw 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:46.740
 here's the little chest there is how to get there 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:54.510
 just not get someone already got 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:54.510
 Okay, someone got to watch 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.889
 look look 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.200
 So 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:25.059
 image how much is here 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:30.089
 labyrinths even have a chara free outflow 

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:30.089
 fascinated if I really have nothing 

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:44.069
 horror will give me to go out or not 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.069
 where's the exit here 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:55.349
 I was a little lost and so some 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:06:00.759
 there is a way out i hope it is extremely 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:06.839
 so we look further that we can get the wrong one 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:06.839
 the side went the opposite way so 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.350
 so little food 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.500
 ate it well 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:31.550

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:46.190

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:51.140
 what Uhtyshka of fun, this is the same 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:55.370
 same line on the rails for the train in this 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:57.130
 well here we look around and generally for 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.440
 myself 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:05.210
 for yourself we will understand that here yes how 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:14.780
 some such horror lags may still be 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:33.340

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.560
 how to play and generally here 

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:50.270
 I need to study, of course, I think more 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:52.910
 of the whole map know where what lies here 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:57.080
 for example here on the roof there is this too 

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:59.240

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:03.620
 cards inspect her to play them and 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:06.410
