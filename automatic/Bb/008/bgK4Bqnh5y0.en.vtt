this<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.709> supposed<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.040> be<00:02:53.130> steampunk<00:02:53.820> which

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
this is supposed to be steampunk which

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.680 
this is supposed to be steampunk which
back<00:02:55.410> when<00:02:55.740> they<00:02:56.070> had<00:02:56.430> primitive<00:02:56.760> radios<00:02:57.330> no
