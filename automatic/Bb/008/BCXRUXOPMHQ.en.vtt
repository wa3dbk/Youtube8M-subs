as a deuced driver what does that mean
to<00:02:26.070> you<00:02:26.250> well<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:27.000> means<00:02:27.630> there's<00:02:27.840> a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
to you well that means there's a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.490 
to you well that means there's a
hierarchy<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.769> fuels<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:30.660> best<00:02:30.900> out<00:02:31.079> there<00:02:31.110> is

hierarchy of fuels the best out there is

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.009 
hierarchy of fuels the best out there is
going<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.709> be<00:02:31.799> a<00:02:31.829> straight<00:02:32.190> normal<00:02:32.700> diesel<00:02:33.150> now

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
going to be a straight normal diesel now

going to be a straight normal diesel now
I<00:02:34.079> do<00:02:34.290> recommend<00:02:34.799> not<00:02:35.130> only<00:02:35.190> producing<00:02:35.820> ass

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
I do recommend not only producing ass

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.509 
I do recommend not only producing ass

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
there and that will keep everything

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.199 
there and that will keep everything
lubricated<00:02:46.890> because<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.370> number<00:02:47.610> two<00:02:47.790> diesel

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
lubricated because the number two diesel

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.319 
lubricated because the number two diesel
is<00:02:48.360> not<00:02:48.720> as<00:02:49.190> friendly<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.400> engines<00:02:50.820> as<00:02:51.000> the

as<00:02:57.239> long<00:02:57.450> as<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:57.660> filter<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.980> mix<00:02:59.220> it

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
as long as you filter it and you mix it

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.160 
as long as you filter it and you mix it
with<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.489> little<00:02:59.519> bit<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.820> diesel<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.420> thin<00:03:01.079> it

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
with a little bit of diesel to thin it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.349 
with a little bit of diesel to thin it
out<00:03:01.260> some<00:03:01.590> because<00:03:01.950> straight<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.670> will<00:03:02.790> run<00:03:03.060> on

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
out some because straight it will run on

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.479 
out some because straight it will run on
straight<00:03:03.840> motor<00:03:04.140> oil<00:03:04.380> but<00:03:04.980> it's<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.250> little

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
straight motor oil but it's a little

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.680 
straight motor oil but it's a little
hard<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.880> pumps<00:03:06.239> especially<00:03:06.630> the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
hard on the pumps especially the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.839 
hard on the pumps especially the
injection<00:03:07.170> pump<00:03:07.379> because<00:03:07.650> that's<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.069> super

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
injection pump because that's a super

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.210 
injection pump because that's a super
high<00:03:08.970> pressure

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
high pressure

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.060 
high pressure
so<00:03:10.700> mix<00:03:11.060> it<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.450> wouldn't<00:03:11.990> go<00:03:12.110> about<00:03:12.350> 50/50

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
so mix it I wouldn't go about 50/50

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.360 
so mix it I wouldn't go about 50/50
diesel<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:13.790> use<00:03:14.540> motor<00:03:14.840> oil<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:15.530> normally<00:03:16.220> am

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
way more diesel to motor oil than that

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.330 
way more diesel to motor oil than that
ratio<00:03:19.370> but<00:03:19.820> 50/50<00:03:20.450> probably<00:03:21.080> is<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.560> very<00:03:21.890> safe

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340

it<00:03:56.870> will<00:03:57.050> run<00:03:57.320> just<00:03:57.620> not<00:03:58.100> very<00:03:58.310> well<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.790> not

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
it will run just not very well and not

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.120 
it will run just not very well and not
very<00:03:59.090> long<00:03:59.360> also<00:03:59.720> biodiesel<00:04:00.470> this<00:04:00.920> thing

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
very long also biodiesel this thing

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.830 
very long also biodiesel this thing

loves biodiesel it seems to have more
pep<00:04:03.080> to<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:03.440> it<00:04:03.800> seems<00:04:03.950> to<00:04:04.070> run<00:04:04.280> smoother

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
pep to it it seems to run smoother

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.270 
pep to it it seems to run smoother
stronger<00:04:05.270> and<00:04:05.420> cooler<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:05.930> don't<00:04:06.770> know<00:04:06.830> why<00:04:07.040> but

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
stronger and cooler I don't know why but

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.100 
stronger and cooler I don't know why but
it<00:04:07.340> just<00:04:07.400> loves<00:04:07.940> that<00:04:08.180> stuff<00:04:08.360> also<00:04:08.660> any<00:04:08.990> of<00:04:09.050> the

it just loves that stuff also any of the

it just loves that stuff also any of the
cooking<00:04:09.350> oils<00:04:09.650> are<00:04:09.740> good<00:04:09.860> too<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.820> canola<00:04:11.570> oil

cooking oil then you're going to need to

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.960 
cooking oil then you're going to need to
filter<00:04:30.020> it<00:04:30.230> and<00:04:30.410> you're<00:04:30.980> going<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.310> need<00:04:31.640> to

filter it and you're going to need to

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.570

diesel if it's a thicker then you need

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900

to thin it down with some extra diesel
or<00:04:39.050> some<00:04:39.380> gasoline<00:04:39.890> now<00:04:40.250> you've<00:04:40.400> probably

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
or some gasoline now you've probably

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.860 
or some gasoline now you've probably
noticed<00:04:40.850> I've<00:04:41.150> mentioned<00:04:41.510> a<00:04:41.540> couple<00:04:41.690> times

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
noticed I've mentioned a couple times

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.890 
noticed I've mentioned a couple times
that<00:04:42.350> if<00:04:42.590> you're<00:04:42.740> using<00:04:42.890> any<00:04:43.100> kind<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.340> used

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
that if you're using any kind of used

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.260 
that if you're using any kind of used

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
motor oil or cooking oil you need to

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.140 
motor oil or cooking oil you need to
filter<00:04:47.630> it<00:04:47.930> now<00:04:48.890> there's<00:04:49.550> a<00:04:49.610> lot<00:04:49.760> of<00:04:49.850> ways<00:04:49.970> you

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
filter it now there's a lot of ways you

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.570 
filter it now there's a lot of ways you
can<00:04:50.270> do<00:04:50.419> that<00:04:50.660> I<00:04:50.930> have<00:04:51.230> a<00:04:51.800> crummy<00:04:52.220> way<00:04:52.400> that

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
can do that I have a crummy way that

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.920 
can do that I have a crummy way that
I've<00:04:52.640> been<00:04:52.760> doing<00:04:52.970> it<00:04:53.090> that's<00:04:53.240> not<00:04:53.450> that<00:04:53.660> good

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
I've been doing it that's not that good

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.590 
I've been doing it that's not that good
but<00:04:54.230> as<00:04:54.350> I've<00:04:54.530> gotten<00:04:54.890> by<00:04:55.100> with<00:04:55.310> it<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:55.669> you've

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
when I find the time I do plan on

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.160 
when I find the time I do plan on
improving<00:05:50.550> my<00:05:50.610> filtration<00:05:51.480> system

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
improving my filtration system

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.290 
improving my filtration system
it'd<00:05:52.830> be<00:05:52.950> hard<00:05:53.130> not<00:05:53.340> to<00:05:53.520> improve<00:05:53.760> that<00:05:53.910> system

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
it'd be hard not to improve that system

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.270 
it'd be hard not to improve that system
I've<00:05:54.390> got<00:05:54.540> now<00:05:54.750> so<00:05:55.440> I'm<00:05:55.560> going<00:05:55.710> to<00:05:55.740> do<00:05:55.890> is<00:05:56.100> I've

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
I've got now so I'm going to do is I've

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.100 
I've got now so I'm going to do is I've
already<00:05:56.370> got<00:05:56.580> some<00:05:56.730> of<00:05:56.760> the<00:05:56.850> parts<00:05:57.180> here<00:05:57.240> I've

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
already got some of the parts here I've

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.520 
already got some of the parts here I've
got<00:05:58.530> my<00:05:58.800> five<00:05:59.220> gallon<00:05:59.550> bucket<00:05:59.910> I<00:06:00.500> have<00:06:01.500> a

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
got my five gallon bucket I have a

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.330 
got my five gallon bucket I have a
filter<00:06:01.950> bag<00:06:02.300> and<00:06:03.300> I<00:06:03.690> have<00:06:03.960> a<00:06:04.230> filter<00:06:04.980> for<00:06:05.280> the

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
filter bag and I have a filter for the

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.850 
filter bag and I have a filter for the
bucket<00:06:05.820> the<00:06:06.210> filter<00:06:06.570> on<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:06.780> bucket<00:06:07.110> is<00:06:07.290> 75

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
bucket the filter on the bucket is 75

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.260 
bucket the filter on the bucket is 75
micron<00:06:08.460> and<00:06:09.680> then<00:06:10.680> the<00:06:10.860> back<00:06:11.070> filter<00:06:11.550> is<00:06:11.700> 5

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
micron and then the back filter is 5

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
micron and then the back filter is 5
micron<00:06:12.870> so<00:06:13.830> my<00:06:13.950> plan<00:06:14.250> is<00:06:14.520> to<00:06:14.960> filter<00:06:15.960> the<00:06:16.080> used

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
micron so my plan is to filter the used

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.740 
micron so my plan is to filter the used
motor<00:06:16.470> oil<00:06:16.590> through<00:06:17.190> my<00:06:17.220> system<00:06:18.000> through<00:06:18.600> the

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
motor oil through my system through the
