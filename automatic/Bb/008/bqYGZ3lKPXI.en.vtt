I like to play so right now I'm on a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.180 
I like to play so right now I'm on a
mission<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:32.110> for<00:02:32.290> example<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:32.890> can<00:02:33.070> see

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
mission to for example so you can see

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.890 
mission to for example so you can see
here<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.490> CPU<00:02:33.820> is<00:02:33.880> back<00:02:34.120> for<00:02:34.360> a<00:02:34.420> rematch<00:02:34.600> on

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
here the CPU is back for a rematch on

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.210 
here the CPU is back for a rematch on
the<00:02:34.990> island<00:02:35.350> but<00:02:35.410> they<00:02:35.620> brought<00:02:35.920> an<00:02:36.040> extra

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
the island but they brought an extra

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.190 
the island but they brought an extra
player<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:37.210> I'm<00:02:37.270> guessing<00:02:37.450> in<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:37.690> case<00:02:37.960> yeah

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
player so I'm guessing in this case yeah

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.600 
player so I'm guessing in this case yeah
I<00:02:38.230> only<00:02:38.470> have<00:02:38.620> three<00:02:38.800> players<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.340> get<00:02:39.520> the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
I only have three players so you get the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.240 
I only have three players so you get the
name<00:02:39.640> routine<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.780> can<00:02:40.930> be<00:02:41.020> like<00:02:41.140> team<00:02:41.470> X<00:02:41.950> for

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
name routine so I can be like team X for

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.760 
name routine so I can be like team X for
example<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:42.790> can<00:02:42.940> have<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:44.200> know<00:02:44.230> name

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
example and I can have you know name

here and he's a tmaxx versus the cpu in
this<00:02:53.890> case<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:55.210> can<00:02:55.390> skip<00:02:55.630> this<00:02:55.720> little

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
this case and I can skip this little

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.720 
this case and I can skip this little
intro<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.590> user<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.950> basic<00:02:57.280> menu<00:02:57.460> so

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
intro the user the basic menu so

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.670 
intro the user the basic menu so
basically<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.330> goes<00:02:58.540> turn-by-turn<00:02:58.990> basis<00:02:59.530> i

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
basically it goes turn-by-turn basis i

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.490 
basically it goes turn-by-turn basis i
go<00:02:59.980> i<00:03:00.010> move<00:03:00.400> my<00:03:00.430> guy<00:03:00.850> I<00:03:01.150> can<00:03:01.690> tell<00:03:01.840> him<00:03:01.930> stay<00:03:02.140> I

go i move my guy I can tell him stay I

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500 
go i move my guy I can tell him stay I
can<00:03:02.680> move<00:03:02.980> him<00:03:03.190> then<00:03:03.820> once<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.060> move<00:03:04.240> them<00:03:04.390> into

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
can move him then once I move them into

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.030 
can move him then once I move them into
position<00:03:04.660> I<00:03:04.960> can<00:03:05.110> allow<00:03:05.680> them<00:03:05.800> to<00:03:05.890> throw

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
position I can allow them to throw

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.190 
position I can allow them to throw
grenades<00:03:06.430> shoot<00:03:07.120> or<00:03:07.330> kick<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.750> enemy<00:03:08.050> fees

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
and merely distance I can view the map

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.700 
and merely distance I can view the map
hitting<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.420> V<00:03:10.570> key<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.110> can<00:03:11.260> use<00:03:11.440> the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
hitting the V key and I can use the

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.250 
hitting the V key and I can use the
arrows<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.130> kind<00:03:12.460> of<00:03:12.490> navigate<00:03:12.990> where<00:03:13.990> am<00:03:14.110> at<00:03:14.200> I

arrows to kind of navigate where am at I

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.280 
arrows to kind of navigate where am at I
can<00:03:14.530> see<00:03:14.650> in<00:03:14.980> this<00:03:15.070> case<00:03:15.280> now<00:03:15.430> they<00:03:15.610> have<00:03:15.700> for

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
can see in this case now they have for

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.660 
can see in this case now they have for
admission<00:03:17.290> one<00:03:17.470> they<00:03:17.590> had<00:03:17.710> three<00:03:18.010> enemies<00:03:18.490> I

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
admission one they had three enemies I

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.310 
admission one they had three enemies I
can<00:03:19.150> turn<00:03:19.270> the<00:03:19.390> music<00:03:19.480> on<00:03:19.750> or<00:03:19.900> off<00:03:20.020> so<00:03:20.170> in<00:03:20.230> this

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
can turn the music on or off so in this

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.750 
can turn the music on or off so in this
case<00:03:20.470> I'll<00:03:20.620> just<00:03:20.740> turn<00:03:20.890> it<00:03:21.010> off<00:03:21.070> for<00:03:21.700> this

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
case I'll just turn it off for this

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.150 
case I'll just turn it off for this
purpose<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:23.080> i<00:03:23.110> can<00:03:23.260> scroll<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.590> stage<00:03:23.800> and<00:03:24.100> i

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
purpose and i can scroll the stage and i

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.380 
purpose and i can scroll the stage and i
can<00:03:24.310> go<00:03:24.430> back<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.850> game<00:03:25.000> here<00:03:25.120> so<00:03:25.270> i<00:03:25.300> can

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
can go back to the game here so i can

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.449 
can go back to the game here so i can
tell<00:03:25.600> you<00:03:25.690> can<00:03:26.080> use<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.350> err<00:03:26.590> i<00:03:26.620> can<00:03:27.130> use<00:03:27.250> these

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
tell you can use it err i can use these

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.949 
tell you can use it err i can use these
keys<00:03:27.790> right<00:03:27.940> here<00:03:28.000> these<00:03:28.300> buttons<00:03:28.600> or<00:03:28.810> i<00:03:28.840> can

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
keys right here these buttons or i can

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.449 
keys right here these buttons or i can
just<00:03:29.050> use<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.380> one<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.650> two<00:03:29.800> keys<00:03:30.040> so<00:03:30.250> i'll<00:03:30.340> hit

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
just use a one and two keys so i'll hit

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.880 
just use a one and two keys so i'll hit
that<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.180> i<00:03:31.270> can<00:03:31.420> travel<00:03:31.990> only<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.440> certain

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
that and i can travel only a certain

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.699 
that and i can travel only a certain
distance<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.430> this<00:03:33.550> case<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.750> i<00:03:34.780> can<00:03:34.959> see<00:03:35.530> there

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
distance in this case so i can see there

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.530 
distance in this case so i can see there
if<00:03:35.950> i<00:03:36.130> move<00:03:36.310> back<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.790> distance<00:03:37.120> travel<00:03:37.420> goes

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
if i move back the distance travel goes

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.510 
if i move back the distance travel goes
back<00:03:37.780> but<00:03:37.990> anyway<00:03:38.410> moving<00:03:38.650> forward<00:03:39.160> anyway

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
back but anyway moving forward anyway

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.710 
back but anyway moving forward anyway
you<00:03:39.580> move<00:03:39.850> forward<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.240> have<00:03:40.330> a<00:03:40.390> distance

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
you move forward you have a distance

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.930 
you move forward you have a distance
traveled<00:03:41.200> meter<00:03:41.350> you<00:03:41.500> can<00:03:41.560> only<00:03:41.860> travel<00:03:42.220> so

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
traveled meter you can only travel so

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.360 
traveled meter you can only travel so
much<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.330> jumping<00:03:43.870> causes<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:45.010> move<00:03:45.190> a

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
much and jumping causes that to move a

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.650 
much and jumping causes that to move a
little<00:03:45.520> bit<00:03:45.670> more<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.150> in<00:03:46.240> this<00:03:46.300> case<00:03:46.450> i<00:03:46.570> want

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
little bit more so in this case i want

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.720 
little bit more so in this case i want
to<00:03:46.780> move<00:03:46.870> about<00:03:46.990> this<00:03:47.320> far<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:48.190> i<00:03:48.400> can<00:03:48.550> say

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
to move about this far and i can say

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.760 
to move about this far and i can say
stop<00:03:49.150> right<00:03:49.420> here<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:50.230> then<00:03:50.350> i<00:03:50.380> get<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.560> choose

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
stop right here and then i get to choose

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.650 
stop right here and then i get to choose
my<00:03:50.830> weapon<00:03:51.220> of<00:03:51.280> choice<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:51.640> grenade<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.000> gun<00:03:52.420> or

my weapon of choice and grenade a gun or

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.880 
my weapon of choice and grenade a gun or
a<00:03:52.690> boot<00:03:52.930> where<00:03:53.110> i<00:03:53.140> can<00:03:53.260> just<00:03:53.350> choose<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.680> stay

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
a boot where i can just choose to stay

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.949 
a boot where i can just choose to stay
in<00:03:54.340> this<00:03:54.490> case<00:03:54.700> i'm<00:03:55.180> not<00:03:55.330> really<00:03:55.480> in<00:03:55.600> range<00:03:55.780> to

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
in this case i'm not really in range to

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.980 
in this case i'm not really in range to
shoot<00:03:56.260> anybody<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.740> might<00:03:56.860> be<00:03:57.310> able<00:03:57.490> to<00:03:57.670> hit<00:03:57.990> the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
shoot anybody I might be able to hit the

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.180 
shoot anybody I might be able to hit the
Joe<00:03:59.200> character<00:03:59.590> here<00:03:59.709> so<00:03:59.830> that's<00:03:59.950> why<00:04:00.070> not

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
Joe character here so that's why not

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.770 
Joe character here so that's why not
let's<00:04:00.340> try<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.580> go<00:04:00.670> for<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.880> gunshot<00:04:01.209> so<00:04:01.660> I'm

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
let's try and go for a gunshot so I'm

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.910 
let's try and go for a gunshot so I'm
gonna<00:04:01.870> trying<00:04:02.080> to<00:04:02.140> angle<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:02.560> you<00:04:02.709> want<00:04:02.860> to

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
gonna trying to angle it you want to

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.280 
gonna trying to angle it you want to
angle<00:04:03.220> it<00:04:03.340> is<00:04:03.820> it<00:04:04.150> really<00:04:04.480> is<00:04:04.630> that<00:04:04.810> strategic

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
angle it is it really is that strategic

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.260 
angle it is it really is that strategic
game<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.830> then<00:04:06.010> once<00:04:06.160> you<00:04:06.280> have<00:04:06.850> it<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.060> can

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
game and then once you have it you can

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.199 
game and then once you have it you can
take<00:04:07.420> the<00:04:07.540> shot<00:04:07.810> in<00:04:08.080> that<00:04:08.440> case<00:04:08.680> no<00:04:09.550> shot<00:04:09.850> so<00:04:10.060> it

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
take the shot in that case no shot so it

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.730 
take the shot in that case no shot so it
looks<00:04:10.420> like<00:04:10.570> it's<00:04:10.720> their<00:04:10.870> turn<00:04:11.110> so<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.380> CPU

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
looks like it's their turn so the CPU

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.770 
looks like it's their turn so the CPU
gets<00:04:11.920> to<00:04:12.040> go<00:04:12.160> he<00:04:12.370> gets<00:04:12.520> the<00:04:12.670> move<00:04:12.850> and<00:04:13.420> he<00:04:13.600> gets

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
gets to go he gets the move and he gets

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.660 
gets to go he gets the move and he gets
to<00:04:13.870> take<00:04:14.050> his<00:04:14.620> chance<00:04:15.070> and<00:04:15.340> he<00:04:15.400> throws<00:04:15.640> a

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
to take his chance and he throws a

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.580 
to take his chance and he throws a
grenade<00:04:15.850> there<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.359> he<00:04:16.840> misses<00:04:17.080> and<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.440> can

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
grenade there and he misses and you can

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.710 
grenade there and he misses and you can
also<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:18.250> crazy<00:04:18.970> thing<00:04:19.180> about<00:04:19.239> this<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.630> one

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
also the crazy thing about this and one

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.030 
also the crazy thing about this and one
of<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.870> tips<00:04:20.049> is<00:04:20.169> there's<00:04:20.320> friendly<00:04:20.650> fire<00:04:20.830> so

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
of the tips is there's friendly fire so

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.710 
of the tips is there's friendly fire so
you<00:04:21.100> really<00:04:21.430> want<00:04:21.580> to<00:04:21.609> be<00:04:21.700> careful<00:04:22.060> in<00:04:22.270> terms

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
you really want to be careful in terms

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.120 
you really want to be careful in terms
of<00:04:22.870> throwing<00:04:23.140> grenades<00:04:23.290> and<00:04:23.710> using<00:04:23.980> any

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
of throwing grenades and using any

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.219 
of throwing grenades and using any
projectiles<00:04:24.610> that<00:04:24.700> may<00:04:25.030> hit<00:04:25.600> your<00:04:25.630> own<00:04:25.900> player

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
projectiles that may hit your own player

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.840 
projectiles that may hit your own player
you<00:04:26.410> can<00:04:26.560> even<00:04:26.680> if<00:04:27.070> they're<00:04:27.400> in<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.550> line<00:04:27.700> of

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
you can even if they're in the line of

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.970 
you can even if they're in the line of
fire<00:04:27.880> when<00:04:28.390> you're<00:04:28.510> shooting

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
fire when you're shooting

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.890 
fire when you're shooting
that<00:04:29.340> can<00:04:29.490> also<00:04:29.700> damage<00:04:30.090> them<00:04:30.420> so<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.630> also

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
that can also damage them so you also

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.530 
that can also damage them so you also
want<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.080> be<00:04:31.140> careful<00:04:31.200> in<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.620> aspect<00:04:32.480> so<00:04:33.480> you

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
want to be careful in that aspect so you

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.060 
want to be careful in that aspect so you
do<00:04:33.690> want<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:33.870> be<00:04:33.990> weary<00:04:34.230> of<00:04:34.290> that<00:04:34.500> so<00:04:34.710> in<00:04:34.920> this

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
do want to be weary of that so in this

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.170 
do want to be weary of that so in this
case<00:04:35.220> going<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.460> use<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.580> grenade<00:04:35.910> which<00:04:36.060> is

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
case going to use a grenade which is

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.270 
case going to use a grenade which is
more<00:04:36.390> of<00:04:36.450> an<00:04:36.540> area<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:36.840> effect<00:04:37.050> damage<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.800> you

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
more of an area of effect damage and you

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.530 
more of an area of effect damage and you
want<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.520> use<00:04:38.670> that<00:04:38.700> you<00:04:39.060> want<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.270> throw<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.420> to

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
want to use that you want to throw it to

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.300 
want to use that you want to throw it to
a<00:04:39.570> certain<00:04:39.810> degree<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.260> use<00:04:40.590> certain<00:04:41.160> power

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
a certain degree and use certain power

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.650 
a certain degree and use certain power
so<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.550> can<00:04:41.610> see<00:04:41.820> there<00:04:41.940> I<00:04:42.060> was<00:04:42.150> able<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.480> knock

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
so you can see there I was able to knock

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.390 
so you can see there I was able to knock
off<00:04:42.900> one<00:04:43.410> of<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.590> CPU<00:04:43.920> straight<00:04:44.160> into<00:04:44.310> the

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
off one of the CPU straight into the

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.300 
off one of the CPU straight into the
water<00:04:44.580> which<00:04:44.760> means<00:04:44.970> I<00:04:45.060> instantly<00:04:46.160> damage<00:04:47.160> him

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
water which means I instantly damage him

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.890 
water which means I instantly damage him
you<00:04:47.430> can<00:04:47.550> see<00:04:47.580> that<00:04:47.790> they<00:04:47.910> both<00:04:48.060> they<00:04:48.570> got<00:04:48.750> both

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
you can see that they both they got both

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.990 
you can see that they both they got both
my<00:04:49.080> players<00:04:49.350> there<00:04:49.620> in<00:04:49.740> that<00:04:49.860> case<00:04:50.070> so<00:04:50.760> then<00:04:50.940> I

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
my players there in that case so then I

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.240 
my players there in that case so then I
get<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.150> move<00:04:51.330> my<00:04:51.540> third<00:04:51.840> player<00:04:52.110> in<00:04:52.380> this<00:04:53.040> case

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
get to move my third player in this case

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.500 
get to move my third player in this case
I<00:04:53.340> kind<00:04:53.550> of<00:04:53.640> want<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:53.820> keep<00:04:53.970> them<00:04:54.090> far<00:04:54.300> back

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
I kind of want to keep them far back

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.670 
I kind of want to keep them far back
with<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.780> rest<00:04:54.900> I<00:04:55.080> don't<00:04:55.230> want<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.440> move<00:04:55.500> them

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
with the rest I don't want to move them

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.620 
with the rest I don't want to move them
too<00:04:55.830> much<00:04:56.430> forward<00:04:56.700> and<00:04:56.880> get<00:04:56.970> lob<00:04:57.450> a<00:04:57.600> grenade

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
too much forward and get lob a grenade

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.930 
too much forward and get lob a grenade
and<00:04:58.170> it's<00:04:58.320> not<00:04:58.530> that<00:04:58.560> far<00:04:58.980> so<00:04:59.550> again<00:04:59.730> you<00:04:59.820> can

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
and it's not that far so again you can

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.610 
and it's not that far so again you can
see<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.060> projectiles<00:05:00.750> really<00:05:01.140> do<00:05:01.320> have<00:05:01.500> that

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
see that projectiles really do have that

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.100 
see that projectiles really do have that
physics<00:05:01.980> to<00:05:02.100> it<00:05:02.220> and<00:05:02.400> it<00:05:03.390> bounces<00:05:03.750> off<00:05:03.930> items

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
physics to it and it bounces off items

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.660 
physics to it and it bounces off items
and<00:05:04.410> stuff<00:05:04.560> like<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:04.740> so<00:05:04.890> in<00:05:05.070> this<00:05:05.160> case<00:05:05.370> oh

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
and stuff like that so in this case oh

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.670 
and stuff like that so in this case oh
you<00:05:05.760> can<00:05:06.030> see<00:05:06.150> that<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.690> CPU<00:05:06.900> use<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.470> gun

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
you can see that the CPU use the gun

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.320 
you can see that the CPU use the gun
there<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.130> we're<00:05:08.670> not<00:05:08.760> going<00:05:08.910> to<00:05:08.970> move<00:05:09.090> down

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
there and we're not going to move down

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.940 
there and we're not going to move down
now<00:05:09.570> to<00:05:09.630> level<00:05:10.050> it<00:05:10.110> out<00:05:10.230> the<00:05:10.440> playing<00:05:10.680> field

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
now to level it out the playing field

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.140 
now to level it out the playing field
there<00:05:11.190> and<00:05:11.460> I'm<00:05:11.580> going<00:05:11.700> to<00:05:11.730> try<00:05:11.910> and<00:05:11.940> get<00:05:12.120> a

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
there and I'm going to try and get a

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.270 
there and I'm going to try and get a
head<00:05:12.360> shot<00:05:12.390> on<00:05:12.810> Steve<00:05:13.200> since<00:05:13.740> he's<00:05:13.860> close<00:05:14.070> up

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
head shot on Steve since he's close up

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.970 
head shot on Steve since he's close up
and<00:05:15.060> I<00:05:15.840> could<00:05:15.960> try<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:16.140> angle<00:05:16.350> it<00:05:16.410> and<00:05:16.710> shoot

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
and I could try to angle it and shoot

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.110 
and I could try to angle it and shoot
the<00:05:17.160> gun<00:05:17.280> there<00:05:17.400> you<00:05:17.490> can<00:05:17.610> see<00:05:17.640> a<00:05:17.730> head<00:05:17.910> shot

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
the gun there you can see a head shot

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.780 
the gun there you can see a head shot
does<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.660> big<00:05:19.320> amount<00:05:19.860> of<00:05:20.070> damage<00:05:20.400> but<00:05:20.520> then<00:05:20.670> I

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
does a big amount of damage but then I

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.100 
does a big amount of damage but then I
just<00:05:20.970> left<00:05:21.090> myself<00:05:21.240> vulnerable<00:05:21.570> but<00:05:21.960> in<00:05:22.050> this

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
just left myself vulnerable but in this

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.020 
just left myself vulnerable but in this
case<00:05:22.290> he<00:05:22.530> can't<00:05:22.740> shoot<00:05:22.950> past<00:05:23.160> his<00:05:23.400> own<00:05:23.520> guy<00:05:23.760> so

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
case he can't shoot past his own guy so

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.970 
case he can't shoot past his own guy so
the<00:05:24.540> CPU<00:05:24.900> ends<00:05:25.110> up<00:05:25.170> hitting<00:05:25.320> his<00:05:25.530> own<00:05:25.650> guy<00:05:25.800> that

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
the CPU ends up hitting his own guy that

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.640 
the CPU ends up hitting his own guy that
oh<00:05:26.130> now<00:05:26.250> I<00:05:26.280> can<00:05:26.490> move<00:05:26.610> my<00:05:26.670> guy<00:05:27.060> down<00:05:27.330> and<00:05:27.660> level

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
oh now I can move my guy down and level

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.500 
oh now I can move my guy down and level
out<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.830> playing<00:05:29.070> field<00:05:29.580> and<00:05:29.850> probably

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510
