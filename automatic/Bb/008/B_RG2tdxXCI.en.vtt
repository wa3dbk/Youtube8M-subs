00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi and welcome to another review!

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Today we'll be having a look at NECA "The Terminator" Kyle Reese, which is part of series 3!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.500
This figure has been released in 2012 and it's 7" scaled, it's about 7 inches tall!

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:30.500
Let's take a quick look at the packaging! We've seen it many times. It's the classic NECA wide clamshell, featuring the movie poster on this side and the name of the character at the bottom.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
On this side, we have an artwork, a picture of the figure.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500
As well as on the back.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Then we have the read-up which I'll focus for you.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And some of the other figures available in this line.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Let's take a closer look!

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:13.000
The likeness to the actor Michael Biehn is pretty good. I must admit that I was not crazy about this sculpt at first, but it is slowly growing on me.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.500
Very good the painting on the eyes, very precise.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Very nice the little detail of the beard: this light brown which contrasts with the pink of the skin.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.000
As always, nice paintwork on the hair.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The figure has this long coat, rubbery, water green.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Very peculiar the pants! It seems he just finished to paint his house. Actually, it's just the '80s fashion. :)

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.500
Really weird pants!

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Very nice the sneakers!

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.500
They're supposed to be Nike shoes, but, for obvious reasons, NECA could not reproduce the Nike swoosh faithfully.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Anyway, the shoes are really really well done!

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.000
As you can glimpse, on the left side of the coat there's a shotgun attached, just like in the movie.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And the really cool thing is that you can actually hide the shotgun under the coat!

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.000
However, I want to point out that the side is wrong. In the movie, Kyle Reese hides the shotgun under the RIGHT side of the coat.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.500
And it seems very strange to me that NECA did such a mistake, specially because the hand molded to hold the shotgun is the right hand!

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So, I wonder how they could make such a mistake! 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.500
Anyway, you can always detach it and glue it on the right side.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Articulation wise, hand is on a ball joint. It's the standard articulation of the Terminator figures.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Arms can fully rotate and move in and out. Elbows can bend at one point (very stiff) and fully rotate. Hands are ball-jointed.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Full rotation at the waist and full rotation at the feet. Nothing on the legs.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
As for the accessories, we have the shotgun. Let me give you a closer look!

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Very detailed, as always! Really nice!

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.000
With this sawn handle...

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.500
...and obviously the rope.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And then we have another accessory which is the Sarah Connor picture.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Very tiny! Printed on this little cardboard piece. I thought it was plastic, instead it's cardboard.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Anyway, the printing is very nice and clean.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Before I conclude my review, I'd like to show you a thing I realized only now: as you can see, the shirt is a separate piece and it's soft plastic. Underneath you can glimpse the Kyle Reese torso and the joint.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:49.000
By the way, it is not a swivel, like I said before, but a ball-joint. So, in addition to full rotation, there's also forward-back movement (and side to side too, obviously)!

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
If you're a Terminator fan and you're collecting the NECA figures, Kyle Reese can't be missing in your collection!

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
However, I must say that I was expecting something more from NECA.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Maybe this was the good occasion to improve the articulation, since it was a new character and not the n-th version of Arnold.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:24.000
As for the price , it's the standard price for a NECA figure. About 20 EURO in Italy and about 17-18 USD in USA. And you can easily find it either online or in the comic shops.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
That being said, I'll see you on the next video! BYE!
