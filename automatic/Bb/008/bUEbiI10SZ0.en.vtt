00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.870
 the torpedo of Soviet super cavitation 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.910
 who was known by the name of zac 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.940
 bullet was able to reach a speed 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.469
 of 370 kilometers per hour much more 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.130
 faster than any other torpedo 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:21.020
 conventional but China has taken a step 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.810
 more in creating a submarine 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.150
 supersonic that could travel from 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.160
 shanghai to san francisco in less than two 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.860
 hours the new technology developed 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.460
 by a scientific garden team 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.260
 institute of complex flow makes it easier 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.839
 for a submarine travel at speeds 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.949
 extreme underwater and even reach 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.949
 the speeds of sound 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.020
 the water produces more friction or drag 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.790
 in an object that the air is there that 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.670
 conventional submarines can not 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.410
 travel as fast as planes without 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.390
 However, during the Cold War , 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.270
 Soviet army developed a 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.800
 super cavitation call technology 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.650
 according to the South Chinese newspaper 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.330
 morning post 'this technique involves a 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.250
 submerged vessel inside a 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.170
 air bubble to overcome the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.229
 problems caused by the carryover of 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.229
 Water 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.869
 the Chinese team of scientists seems 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.689
 that has found an innovative means of 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.210
 address both problems our method 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.490
 it's different from any other approach 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.189
 by combining membrane technology 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.560
 liquid like super cavitation like this 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.259
 We can significantly reduce 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.430
 launch challenges and control the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.810
 Fate highlights Professor Jim Henson 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.250
 of industrial engineering and fluids 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.399
 He stressed that he is developing 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.740
 a big bubble to navigate very fast 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.530
 underwater we are very excited 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.450
 with its potential said but added that 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.330
 however, there are still to be overcome 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.700
 some more problems before being 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.700
 feasible a supersonic submarine voyage
