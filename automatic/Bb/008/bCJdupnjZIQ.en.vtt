00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.089
 you once this time a live 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.220
 comedy series and today I'll be 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.240
 starting here with you a new series 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.949
 on the channel 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.039
 I'm kind of crazy today, I want to 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.830
 this series is already a while after I 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.269
 I started to like this game mode is the 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.310
 right or not at all sung in 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.349
 Portuguese, so I intend to have 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.809
 I intend to bring you Portuguese 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.489
 Well saying some glowing reviews 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.969
 here a series of light with the inter 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.710
 playing is the maximum at most then it is 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.350
 How do I go out here playing with this 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.530
 admits that I do not know the name of rain to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.899
 rx holy 60 and is silenced 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.670
 slow then come on there's a club where the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.860
 team is another thing too that I started 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.930
 to do with my new comments 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.430
 play on blankets and motor control 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.120
 that many people have complained about since 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.519
 then three thousand only complains about 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.400
 my sensitivity then ramped because the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.770
 sound is of the control speech taking the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.600
 Microphone was very good staying up to klec 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:21.600
 can be seen by a squirrel then 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:26.909
 I decided to do this is the first video 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.810
 here the nobel in our old man touched the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.229
 right 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.689
 in the first aquino video goals I used 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.810
 this technique and it seems that it 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.479
 let run because this guy tatiane 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.470
 die 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:46.200
 sorry for the mistakes in portuguese 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:51.439
 I'm really not taken by citing 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.439
 much attention to it but focus on law 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.010
 You talk about your friend and ex-partner. 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.280
 Another thing is that I made a 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:05.040
 made huge was not to have played some 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:09.340
 ports before recording this here then 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.750
 if many fans roll me sorry it 's 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.990
 because I practically studied 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:21.250
 in the afternoon the inter today I then took her 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.940
 so here it is very good I'm going to put 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.520
 here I will not put here will not be that 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.080
 I can put in the new pocket watch 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.060
 I do not think I can not think I'm going 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.740
 have to move a little more but 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:39.330
 I think I 'm going to die, I do not think so. 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:40.750
 die is and 18 seconds die do not die 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.000
 there 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:51.510
 good woman who 12 brother can tiago 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.380
 talk a little bit more forward what 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:03.730
 it's happening I 'm not understanding 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:06.760
 everything was lost here in the north matter 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.590
 The enemy does not kill is not a new one. 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.140
 own account delegate the bill is to give 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.739
 right there and with my religion preach 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.989
 He, she, it, it, he, she, 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.989
 he thinking of putting a name 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:40.570
 the comments a dog name is this 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:43.239
 Because life is good because it does not 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.200
 I got it and I remember a poem that 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.670
 I made 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.150
 If I'm not mistaken, it was in the 8th grade. 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.800
 a lot of time about life 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.520
 very cool accompaniment to the song there 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:05.680
 kick in the middle of the goal 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:09.250
 the game also killed the dogma 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.459
 That's where it gets easy on the face and it's easy. 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.269
 nor old for a new a3 an interesting 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.209
 video here 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.560
 I think I went back to recording one more party 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.229
 do not know 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.050
 Let's see, let's see, let's see if 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.449
 Are you watching this video here? 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.560
 but the gameplay because I recorded it is not 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.830
 basically for you to have 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.690
 liked and only part of the battery was much 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.350
 thing was not very good was not because 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.350
