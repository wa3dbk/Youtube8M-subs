like<00:00:11.940> that

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
like that

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.240 
like that
this<00:00:12.900> application<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.500> no<00:00:13.799> longer<00:00:14.040> available

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
this application is no longer available

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.720 
this application is no longer available
on<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.240> App<00:00:15.509> Store<00:00:15.710> because<00:00:16.710> Apple<00:00:17.460> took<00:00:17.580> it

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
on the App Store because Apple took it

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.330 
on the App Store because Apple took it
down<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.560> partly<00:00:19.560> because<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.160> actually

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
down and partly because this is actually

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.620 
down and partly because this is actually
a<00:00:21.050> proper<00:00:22.050> MS<00:00:22.619> DOS<00:00:22.830> emulator<00:00:23.390> so<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> whole

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
a proper MS DOS emulator so the whole

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.580 
a proper MS DOS emulator so the whole
idea<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.260> could<00:00:25.350> actually

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
idea was that you could actually

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.890 
idea was that you could actually
purchase<00:00:25.890> MS<00:00:26.550> DOS<00:00:26.699> games<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.779> future

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
purchase MS DOS games in the future

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.769 
purchase MS DOS games in the future
which<00:00:28.470> never<00:00:28.800> happened<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.250> course<00:00:29.599> from<00:00:30.599> this

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
which never happened of course from this

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.870 
which never happened of course from this
this<00:00:31.140> store<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.160> get<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.460> run<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.850> you

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880

but one of the cool things about it is

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.279 
but one of the cool things about it is
that<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.100> gives<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> full<00:00:47.960> mSL's<00:00:48.960> prompt

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
what's inside my iPad now and you can

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.709

see all these folders right here so some

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.210 
see all these folders right here so some
guys<00:01:03.899> figured<00:01:04.260> out<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.530> since<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.010> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
guys figured out that since this is a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.820 
guys figured out that since this is a
proper<00:01:05.670> ms-dos<00:01:06.270> command<00:01:06.869> prompt<00:01:07.229> apart<00:01:07.740> from

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
proper ms-dos command prompt apart from

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.020 
proper ms-dos command prompt apart from
the<00:01:07.979> fact<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.430> could<00:01:08.610> pretty<00:01:08.970> much

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the fact that you could pretty much

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.929 
the fact that you could pretty much
install<00:01:09.689> any<00:01:10.020> ms-dos<00:01:10.500> game<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.820> would

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
install any ms-dos game that you would

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.899 
install any ms-dos game that you would
run<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.360> DOS<00:01:12.689> box<00:01:12.900> which<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.680> other<00:01:14.280> you

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
run on DOS box which is this other you

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.450 
run on DOS box which is this other you
know<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> full<00:01:15.439> admin<00:01:16.439> sauce<00:01:16.619> from<00:01:16.890> emulator

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
know the full admin sauce from emulator

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.030 
know the full admin sauce from emulator
thingamabob<00:01:18.210> which<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.380> application<00:01:19.920> would

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
thingamabob which this application would

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.280 
thingamabob which this application would
play<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.400> based<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.869> could

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
play was based on and I could

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.370 
play was based on and I could
essentially<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.850> know<00:01:23.970> hit<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.869> this

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
essentially you know hit like this

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.460 
essentially you know hit like this
and<00:01:25.580> people<00:01:26.580> run<00:01:26.790> Windows<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:28.110> I've<00:01:28.259> got

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and people run Windows so I've got

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.160 
and people run Windows so I've got
Windows<00:01:28.799> 3.1<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.610> windows<00:01:30.210> 95<00:01:30.720> I'm<00:01:30.960> just

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
Windows 3.1 and windows 95 I'm just

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.310 
Windows 3.1 and windows 95 I'm just
gonna<00:01:31.259> go<00:01:31.439> straight<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> or<00:01:32.340> Windows<00:01:32.549> 95

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
gonna go straight to or Windows 95

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.950 
gonna go straight to or Windows 95
so<00:01:34.320> say<00:01:34.500> starting<00:01:34.890> Windows<00:01:35.130> 95<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.030> look<00:01:36.750> at

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
so say starting Windows 95 and look at

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.030 
so say starting Windows 95 and look at
that<00:01:38.180> with<00:01:39.180> Microsoft<00:01:39.900> Internet<00:01:40.350> Explorer

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
that with Microsoft Internet Explorer

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.730 
that with Microsoft Internet Explorer
that's<00:01:41.790> really<00:01:42.150> epic<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:43.229> really<00:01:43.530> cool

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that's really epic and it's really cool

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.080 
that's really epic and it's really cool
that<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.189> actually<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:45.030> course

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
that you can actually do this of course

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.950 
that you can actually do this of course

and<00:03:59.870> so<00:04:00.350> it's<00:04:00.500> not<00:04:00.650> actually<00:04:00.950> going<00:04:01.520> to<00:04:01.730> work

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
and so it's not actually going to work

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.080 
and so it's not actually going to work
besides<00:04:03.830> even<00:04:04.160> if<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.430> does<00:04:04.610> it's<00:04:04.850> probably

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
besides even if it does it's probably

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.630 
besides even if it does it's probably
like<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:05.600> know<00:04:05.660> Internet<00:04:05.990> Explorer<00:04:06.290> 3<00:04:06.860> or<00:04:07.100> 4<00:04:07.370> 5

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
like you know Internet Explorer 3 or 4 5

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.610 
like you know Internet Explorer 3 or 4 5
or<00:04:07.820> something<00:04:08.060> like<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.300> so<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:09.110> it's<00:04:09.380> Sigma

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
or something like that so and it's Sigma

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.250 
or something like that so and it's Sigma
for<00:04:09.800> ever<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:10.040> start<00:04:10.220> up<00:04:10.960> and<00:04:11.960> wonder<00:04:12.140> if<00:04:12.200> I

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
for ever to start up and wonder if I

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.000 
for ever to start up and wonder if I
crashed<00:04:12.530> Windows<00:04:12.860> not<00:04:12.980> ready<00:04:14.740> and<00:04:15.740> if<00:04:15.830> the

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
crashed Windows not ready and if the

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.550 
crashed Windows not ready and if the
clock<00:04:16.220> is<00:04:16.400> working<00:04:16.610> and<00:04:17.390> it's<00:04:17.840> really<00:04:18.140> cool<00:04:18.350> so

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
clock is working and it's really cool so

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.440 
clock is working and it's really cool so
