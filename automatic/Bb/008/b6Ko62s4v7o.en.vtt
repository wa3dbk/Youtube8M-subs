00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.010
 in this video we will demonstrate how 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.950
 collect hardware software information 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.590
 of windows computers that are outside 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.389
 are not in the domain 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.310
 then first closed if victor 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.789
 have no information 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.890
 Let's go in the folder where the deep was installed 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:29.580
 venture of two files that important 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.859
 collecting replaced the acronym of wind pigs 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.739
 Bad then these two here files 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.680
 Let's save them and a thumb drive or HD 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.399
 external copy of save it not to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.010
 pendrive or save here in my pen 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.239
 drive 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:50.719
 I 'm making it out here for you. 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.890
 connect a thumb drive here at the moment 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.820
 saving these two files in the pen 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.039
 drive 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.940
 We'll be able to straight into the machine. 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.870
 run by the pen drive itself or we'll 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.619
 there in the machine 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.720
 My case here I'll create a folder one 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.540
 any name here since it does not have 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.810
 space to call a very simple month 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:18.240
 collection and I'm going to play those 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.860
 two files there they can be in a 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.930
 pen drive also because they will save 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.740
 He already saved it inside the pen drive. 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.350
 see then we have two only two 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.689
 files and we will perform the collection 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.280
 replenished and we will give start 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.990
 he speaks to see store is that it is 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.509
 collecting the information will wait this 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.649
 screen close ready closed kiss we can 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.710
 give an ok he created this file 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:56.060
 now let's take this file to the 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.060
 copy server 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.280
 For me the pen drive can do the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.479
 even in the xp machine but we demonstrated 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.179
 on video 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.069
 let's go to xp let's create the folder 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.569
 collect 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.340
 remembering that it can be direct run 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.000
 on the pen drive that killed a hundred pen drive 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.010
 Is doing 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:27.050
 already the folder I will play in both files 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.050
 aac from the pen drive and i will collect start 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:36.950
 see that he complained that he has room 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.950
 So I'll create direct in the 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:56.380
 so I put it in the temporary file 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:03:01.720
 here to close this one from here so you can not 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:04.390
 have space in the folder in the folder name 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:12.550
 so let's start 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:15.490
 Let's wait and end. Finished. 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.280
 I see he created the bin point file 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.730
 this reparable bin point file that 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:26.790
 It's all black, let's write. 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.790
 to the server copy to pen drive 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:34.650
 now let's go to the server with these 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.680
 two point bin files 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.110
 now here on the server 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.510
 let's go to our collection folder on 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.460
 that has been configured to receive 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.570
 collections 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.310
 see for now it has none 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.780
 computer let's put both 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.120
 files of the pendrive 2 0 15 point bin 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.830
 here at ours on our coast pickups 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.980
 collection that was set up on the other 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.980
 video 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:08.680
 Let's wait, it's already detected. 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.470
 collected ready finished 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.840
 so we were able to collect information from 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.239
 computers that are off the network 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.480
 since we have our ndash sp and here 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.900
 we have our level 7 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.900
 and that's it
