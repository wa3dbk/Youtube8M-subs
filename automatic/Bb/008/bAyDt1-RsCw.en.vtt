00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.440 
inch the brand is oralist see ya so here
and<00:01:53.569> take<00:01:53.750> little<00:01:54.050> sections<00:01:54.259> from<00:01:54.979> this

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
and take little sections from this

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.619 
and take little sections from this
solder<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.899> start<00:01:57.140> curling<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:57.890> I<00:02:01.569> kind<00:02:02.569> of

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:02.629 
solder to start curling it I kind of

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:04.510 
solder to start curling it I kind of
start<00:02:03.080> like<00:02:03.319> a<00:02:03.349> little<00:02:03.709> bit<00:02:03.920> closer<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.459> a

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
start like a little bit closer to a

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.300 
start like a little bit closer to a
diamond<00:02:04.910> before<00:02:05.709> so<00:02:06.709> that<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.099> not

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
diamond before so that it's not

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.279 
diamond before so that it's not
concentrated<00:02:08.270> that<00:02:08.450> he<00:02:08.629> doesn't<00:02:08.959> concentrate

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
concentrated that he doesn't concentrate

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.000 
concentrated that he doesn't concentrate
it<00:02:09.619> on<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:10.039> ends<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:11.440> we<00:02:12.440> are<00:02:12.950> going<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.840> come

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
it on the ends so we are going to come

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.339 
it on the ends so we are going to come
away

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.140 

and<00:02:22.349> would<00:02:22.950> be<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.069> really<00:02:23.370> thick<00:02:23.640> hair<00:02:23.849> if<00:02:24.030> you

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
and would be a really thick hair if you

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.759 
and would be a really thick hair if you
like<00:02:24.299> this<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.659> easier<00:02:25.049> way<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.260> curl<00:02:25.560> it

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
like this is a easier way to curl it

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.369 
like this is a easier way to curl it
just<00:02:26.040> because<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.610> all<00:02:26.819> kind<00:02:27.209> of<00:02:27.810> together

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
just because it's all kind of together

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.390 
just because it's all kind of together
and<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:29.010> don't<00:02:29.159> have<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.430> worry<00:02:29.670> about<00:02:31.400> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
and you don't have to worry about the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.509 
and you don't have to worry about the
hassle<00:02:32.879> of<00:02:32.909> like<00:02:33.150> dividing<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.560> all<00:02:35.040> that

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
hassle of like dividing and all that

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:56.230 
hassle of like dividing and all that
crazy<00:02:35.849> stuff

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.910 

this<00:02:56.810> curling<00:02:57.110> thing<00:02:57.320> is<00:02:57.470> pretty<00:02:57.680> cool

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
this curling thing is pretty cool

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.500 
this curling thing is pretty cool
because<00:02:58.070> I<00:02:58.220> can<00:02:58.400> just<00:02:58.490> twist<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.030> Barrow<00:02:59.240> and

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
because I can just twist the Barrow and

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.830 
because I can just twist the Barrow and
