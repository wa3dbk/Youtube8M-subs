00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.379
 is 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.390
 And then welcome to our arena that 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.730
 who speaks is the way of today bringing a 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.170
 video for you about who knows 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.960
 possible sports sports channel 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.730
 electronics, not in Portuguese for you 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.010
 a very important channel 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.250
 Good, I've been talking to this guy. 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.879
 for you do not know he manages the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.149
 raccoon channel versus neco is a channel 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.190
 competitive and not being competitive. 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.350
 book they are focusing a lot on level 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.570
 average now but has koduri in several 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.670
 other games also oled you at the moment 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.070
 it's the biggest game for them 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.010
 it manages is also a little bit of 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.750
 china life so I went there to do a good 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.640
 Working in China is growing. 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.140
 quickly and with that it comes 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.440
 talking to me a lot about how 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.570
 there is the competitive scenario in Brazil 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.030
 I 've been talking to him about 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.770
 This has been a while since we are 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.740
 talking about this possible 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.380
 channel and is a channel that would not be 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.750
 called versus Brazil some of this decision 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.099
 this style machina versus brazil something 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.229
 so it would be a mash in Brazil but the 

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:31.369
 versus in china would be verses in 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.410
 Portuguese 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.560
 I've talked to him, obviously. 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.270
 Brazilian scenario does not reach the feet 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.830
 yet the American scenario in terms of 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.200
 numbers and numbers that I told you 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.770
 number of championships per month 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.440
 number of team players 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.050
 of all prize games 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.270
 unfortunately, Brazil has not yet reached 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.849
 the United States and I do not know if it will 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.500
 achieve but a Chinese verses by 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:02.239
 Until not doing it, let's see. 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.039
 if they did not reach their goal 

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:06.530
 still they want to reach a number 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.759
 x subscribers x number of views 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.009
 a month 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.200
 and this is very important for 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.360
 them and he said the following O means am 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.370
 focusing a lot on china versus now 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.140
 competing for me is very important and 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.349
 so we got something promised 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.190
 versus some kind of larger sponsorship or 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.050
 something like 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.390
 We're going to invest in Brazil, so you? 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.200
 Can you think what you want to do? 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.989
 here I need 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.800
 help to open this channel if you go there 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.000
 same etc etc is so I wanted to move to 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.129
 information for you guys to stay 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.519
 aware of what is happening because the 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:43.400
 the following anp how much more how much 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.140
 more Brazilian viewers in this 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.269
 channel machina verse of an american 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.160
 The more comments for 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.810
 wanting a china to see if the 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.790
 Brazil find what will make a 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.510
 weak league Brazil does this 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.750
 what is the best fluid and the personnel the 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.310
 lester bangs the staff of machina versus 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.840
 they will look at this guy talks 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.640
 Brazilians really do have a 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.530
 large community they are in order to 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.610
 participate in championships and have a 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.280
 their channel 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.430
 This is good only for me as a presenter. 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.410
 because obviously I would love to do a 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.940
 brazil's open page album program 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.340
 would be great for me 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.709
 but this is good for you too 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.019
 competitive game and what they like to do 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.030
 videos because it gives you the 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.910
 opportunity to become a director of mnaa 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.769
 China versus the director does in the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.440
 The truth is that the director makes 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.130
 channel to desired in this case china 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.040
 versus Brazil and this channel will give you 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.290
 a certain visibility is obviously a 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.269
 China has a very large power in 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.260
 terms of picking up subscribers and 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.359
 views 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.440
 then the channel as we say 100 thousand 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.359
 enrolled 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.639
 It will give you a good visibility going 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.739
 make your channel grow and you 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.209
 improve your feedback and you will 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.150
 have a more professional video maybe a 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.930
 year in this versus brazil etc etc 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.870
 so this is very good for increasing 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.690
 these numbers in our community that I 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.690
 well trying to do since 2006 there when 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.639
 not so much in 2011 that it opened a 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.989
 channel in April 2011 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.750
 I opened it looks nobody seems not to me 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.060
 I cheat something like this so long ago. 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.349
 I've been trying to do this well I 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.650
 I'm going to be very sincere a little. 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.020
 tired out 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.830
 Let's put it this way from the duriense takeoff. 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.750
 competitive and I'm trying to play 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.360
 Link blogs but I got so much the last 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.670
 I 've practically quit playing. 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.560
 As soon as I have more time, I'll come in. 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.840
 We have friends who call me all weekends. 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.190
 week I went by one is entitled 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.080
 the video is doing it doing here 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.650
 I'm always worried but I'm going to 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.640
 play at an average level and good back 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.670
 here is the subject, right? 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.840
 the subject is I really want this channel 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.650
 would be very important for our 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.870
 community 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.390
 even though it is not completely focused 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.400
 on a hard court and I would very much like 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.980
 have the opportunity to help 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.430
 Brazilian community games him 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:10.760
 electronic sports games né a 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.170
 grow and I hope you have the 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.900
 less the same idea that I have 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.510
 also the same idea of ​​having a 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.370
 huge community strong community that 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.290
 can travel to Europe that can 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.320
 travel to the united states and compete 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:27.710
 against strong teams in those regions nor 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.110
 earn high awards and trophies and be 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.360
 Whatever it is, this cry is all there. 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.560
 some professionals already have 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.120
 united states and europe 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.250
 it would be very interesting for me to be able 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.670
 see this finally happening in the 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.850
 brazil championships in wool and tetra a 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.050
 shaman versus could cover and make a 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.450
 contract with the legal subway with a 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.950
 tin and strong with many viewers 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.530
 huh 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.540
 this will attracted sponsorships this goes 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.880
 attracting investments will attract 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.550
 good thing many opportunities for you 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.770
 who really want to throw money 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.360
 who really want to live on that 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.950
 they want at least maybe not live it 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.780
 but to make a buck more serious 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.130
 very interesting for you as I already 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.710
 said you can become director and director 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.050
 environment will give you visibility and maybe 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.250
 even a buck and not a video 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.870
 some graninha 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.880
 the video you send to china 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.860
 verses that come out on the channel 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.480
 so this is very important if 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.550
 Did you like the idea? I'll leave it to you. 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.230
 china channel versus here in description 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.180
 You can check the channel to see if you 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.460
 liked the channel if you did not like it well 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.920
 I just wanted to pass on my opinions and then 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.660
 It's a suggestion I went through here. 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.490
 what he liked and who knows 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.720
 in front of us we can already leave 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.740
 of course it's not something that will 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.260
 happen tomorrow 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.090
 most likely probably not 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.060
 It's going to happen in 2013 and I'm leaving 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.590
 quite clear one simply because they 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.300
 are focusing on China versus American 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.330
 first to expand to 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.540
 other countries, certainly not to mention also 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.640
 that China over the Brazil 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.170
 opening has no year there is still the 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.150
 channel machine gun think the china 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.190
 Brazil then they are seeing there as it is 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.750
 common that will be this all if a china 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.970
 Brazil is going to continue like this 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.970
 a lot of things rolling though they do not know 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.590
 You're welcome, it's very difficult, it's not easy. 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.270
 it is not a carnival to open a channel in the 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.980
 youtube that you are ready 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.660
 china invests invests a lot of money 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.580
 in this kind of thing 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.260
 understood then it will be something well 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.360
 If you liked the video you 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.820
 I liked and like most still want to disclose 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.770
 this additional favorite and clear idea 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.300
 Do not forget to check it out. 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.400
 verses that are here in the 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.160
 description below the video you can 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.750
 check their channel there and personal 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.490
 Thank you so much for everything. 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.920
 on this channel here or on the other channel 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:38.720
 Also x environment in Brazil staying here 

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.720
 A hug until the next I went
