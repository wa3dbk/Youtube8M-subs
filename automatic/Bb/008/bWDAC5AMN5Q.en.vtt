00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.459
 then we will make one leg and thigh 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:12.090
 we have our leg full thigh 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:14.910
 we turn around and we 're always going to start 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.000
 the joint that normally we 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.730
 we must have already out of our flesh 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.520
 we have our articulation and we are going to 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.920
 to follow the bone here the bone of 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.410
 Thigh of the leg bears a straight line 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.809
 later in this part will give 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.339
 turn and it will follow another straight line 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.859
 that's where we have to do 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:41.929
 our cut then let's do you go 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.929
 to make our cut 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.790
 together with the bone 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.030
 there we see there we have the bone and we are going to 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.250
 make cut 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.640
 on one side and on the other side of the bone 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.160
 and we can already see that our bone is 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.650
 completely separate is not just a 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.360
 little bit of meat but the bone should 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.970
 be as clean as possible then 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.830
 here we already have the bone of this part 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.479
 clean and we reached the intersection in 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.729
 where we will have to turn for the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.210
 cut we 're going to cut in this 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.090
 intersection we keep feeling it 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:29.150
 and that's where we do the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:33.460
 cut where is the joint 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.460
 and on the other side it is very high 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:41.580
 we make a straight line down 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:46.020
 and this straight line in what helps us 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.450
 is to have a line for threads of 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.420
 one side and remove all the meat from a 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.450
 side of the bone and then leave 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.479
 of the other 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.240
 then here we can see already 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.390
 intersection of these joints already 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.579
 is free of meat and this whole part 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.799
 we also released her from meat and 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.330
 we have only the bone we are going to 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.330
 do the same thing from the other side 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.599
 then we are only following the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.580
 bone bone bone to remove 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.580
 all the possible meat 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.769
 is already free on this side is already 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.290
 completely free we have the meat and 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.950
 so now we are going to cut here the 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.890
 end to make a cut 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.440
 throughout the back and that 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.890
 completely free our flesh from 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.430
 bone 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.209
 then we finished here making the cut 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.250
 make cut the other end and then 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.250
 now like this 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.250
 we raise 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.400
 really only what I have to 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.269
 to do is to withdraw 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.269
 bone 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.420
 that really is separated from the 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.250
 meat we have a bone almost 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.560
 completely clean and on the other hand 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.590
 we have nothing else in the end we make it a 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.680
 cut at the bottom and we have 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.980
 a thigh meat and legs 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:35.220
 if we have for some reason a bit of 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:38.700
 articulation we are going to withdraw 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.550
 and we have now if our meat very 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.710
 ready to be able to flatten to be able 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.150
 fill to be able to cook and 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.060
 precisely if we fill 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.370
 we will be able to have even a small 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.340
 little file of our thigh and legs 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.140
 we can remove skin or not if we want 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.080
 withdraw that to only what we are going to 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.110
 to do is that we're going to start cutting already 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.830
 pull only pull we talk 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:08.000
 we take the skin and with this we remove the 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.000
 skin and we have our thigh and leg 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 ready
