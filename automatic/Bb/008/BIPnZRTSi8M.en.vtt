so I filled this up with water first
like<00:01:13.880> maybe<00:01:14.890> three-quarters<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.250> way

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
like maybe three-quarters of the way

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.090

full<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:17.030> water<00:01:17.329> and<00:01:17.630> then<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.799> rest

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
full of water and then the rest

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.160 
full of water and then the rest
conditioner<00:01:19.969> and<00:01:20.180> it<00:01:20.329> took<00:01:20.509> a<00:01:20.540> little<00:01:20.750> bit<00:01:20.899> of

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
conditioner and it took a little bit of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.660 
conditioner and it took a little bit of
time<00:01:21.409> for<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.070> to<00:01:22.100> mix<00:01:22.549> in<00:01:23.920> to<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.039> water<00:01:25.310> I

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
time for it to mix in to the water I

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.990 
time for it to mix in to the water I
shook<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.299> a<00:01:26.659> lot<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:27.469> I<00:01:28.189> put<00:01:28.460> it<00:01:28.579> in<00:01:28.729> water

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
shook it a lot and I put it in water

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.600 
shook it a lot and I put it in water
first<00:01:29.479> because<00:01:30.049> I<00:01:30.530> noticed<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:31.310> that

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
first because I noticed that that

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.029 
first because I noticed that that
minimizes<00:01:32.420> all<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.810> foaming<00:01:33.110> that<00:01:33.560> happens

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
minimizes all the foaming that happens

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.279 
minimizes all the foaming that happens
if<00:01:34.219> you<00:01:34.369> put<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.850> conditioner<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.659> first<00:01:36.049> and

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
if you put the conditioner in first and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.099 
if you put the conditioner in first and
