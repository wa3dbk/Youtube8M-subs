our way down so this here is what we

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.710 
our way down so this here is what we
call<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.920> cap<00:01:35.190> plate<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.910> a<00:01:36.090> thicker<00:01:36.390> piece

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
call the cap plate it's a thicker piece

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.220 
call the cap plate it's a thicker piece
of<00:01:36.960> copper<00:01:37.700> looks<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.880> an<00:01:39.030> oversized<00:01:39.540> washer

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
of copper looks like an oversized washer

here<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.850> cap<00:01:42.510> skirt<00:01:43.050> this<00:01:43.260> gets<00:01:43.530> bent

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
here is the cap skirt this gets bent

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.840 
here is the cap skirt this gets bent
around<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.720> forms<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.870> base<00:01:46.080> of<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.860> column

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
around and forms the base of the column

which<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.330> will<00:02:09.450> talk<00:02:09.569> about<00:02:09.869> next

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
which we will talk about next

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.449 
which we will talk about next
this<00:02:11.549> here<00:02:11.909> is<00:02:12.120> long<00:02:12.659> thin<00:02:13.530> piece<00:02:13.769> of<00:02:14.129> copper

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
this here is long thin piece of copper

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.069 
this here is long thin piece of copper
here<00:02:14.489> rectangular<00:02:15.180> piece<00:02:15.359> of<00:02:15.510> copper<00:02:15.719> it's

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
here rectangular piece of copper it's

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.530 
here rectangular piece of copper it's
what<00:02:16.230> we<00:02:16.349> call<00:02:16.499> the<00:02:16.560> collar<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.540> is

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
what we call the collar that is

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.140 
what we call the collar that is
assembled<00:02:19.290> on<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.409> inside<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:20.849> part

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
assembled on the inside of this part

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.059 
assembled on the inside of this part
here<00:02:21.359> which<00:02:21.629> will<00:02:21.870> be<00:02:22.019> at<00:02:22.170> one<00:02:22.409> point<00:02:22.620> once<00:02:22.920> it

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
here which will be at one point once it

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.059 
here which will be at one point once it
is<00:02:23.159> assembled<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:24.030> vapor<00:02:24.329> comes<00:02:24.799> here<00:02:25.799> next

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
is assembled the vapor comes here next

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.619 
is assembled the vapor comes here next
we'll<00:02:26.400> go<00:02:26.519> all<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.819> way<00:02:26.849> down<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.359> bottom

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
we'll go all the way down to the bottom

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.110 
we'll go all the way down to the bottom
of<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.900> still<00:02:28.139> this<00:02:28.769> is<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.370> base<00:02:29.549> of<00:02:29.849> the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
of the still this is the base of the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.809 
of the still this is the base of the
still<00:02:30.359> forms<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.349> bottom<00:02:31.709> it's<00:02:32.219> just<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.609> flat

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
still forms the bottom it's just a flat

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.300 
still forms the bottom it's just a flat
circle<00:02:34.639> here<00:02:35.639> we<00:02:36.150> have<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:37.049> boiler<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
circle here we have the boiler the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.449 
circle here we have the boiler the
boiler<00:02:38.730> wall<00:02:38.969> so<00:02:39.329> you'll<00:02:39.810> notice<00:02:40.049> that<00:02:40.590> on

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
boiler wall so you'll notice that on

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.910 
boiler wall so you'll notice that on
this<00:02:42.120> piece<00:02:42.329> of<00:02:42.480> copper<00:02:42.840> here<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.349> maybe<00:02:43.739> on

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
this piece of copper here and maybe on

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.220 
this piece of copper here and maybe on
the<00:02:44.040> piece<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.909> copper<00:02:45.359> in<00:02:45.689> the<00:02:45.810> kit<00:02:46.049> that<00:02:46.079> you

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
the piece of copper in the kit that you

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.399 
the piece of copper in the kit that you
get<00:02:46.529> you<00:02:47.489> may<00:02:47.639> notice<00:02:47.969> some<00:02:48.409> discoloration

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
get you may notice some discoloration

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.479 
get you may notice some discoloration
and<00:02:49.920> some<00:02:50.599> some<00:02:51.599> staining<00:02:52.170> that's<00:02:52.889> from<00:02:53.219> the

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
and some some staining that's from the

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.410 
and some some staining that's from the
cutting<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.450> then<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.049> drying<00:02:55.349> process

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
cutting and then the the drying process

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.030 
cutting and then the the drying process
essentially<00:02:57.420> just<00:02:57.689> the<00:02:57.810> manufacturing

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
essentially just the manufacturing

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.860 
essentially just the manufacturing
process<00:02:59.040> by<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.969> time<00:03:00.180> you're<00:03:00.420> actually<00:03:00.510> done

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
process by the time you're actually done

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.979 
process by the time you're actually done
building<00:03:01.260> your<00:03:01.650> still<00:03:02.219> kit<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:03.450> entire<00:03:03.749> thing

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
building your still kit the entire thing

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.839 
building your still kit the entire thing
will<00:03:04.109> look<00:03:04.169> really<00:03:04.379> dirty<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:06.169> nasty<00:03:07.169> the

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
will look really dirty and nasty the

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.099 
will look really dirty and nasty the
fortunately<00:03:08.849> copper<00:03:09.120> cleans<00:03:09.450> up<00:03:09.629> very<00:03:09.870> very

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
fortunately copper cleans up very very

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.709 
fortunately copper cleans up very very
nicely<00:03:10.319> so<00:03:10.969> once<00:03:11.969> you're<00:03:12.120> done<00:03:12.150> with<00:03:12.359> it<00:03:12.480> she's

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:12.719 
nicely so once you're done with it she's

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.899 
nicely so once you're done with it she's
like<00:03:12.870> very<00:03:12.900> nice<00:03:13.430> so<00:03:14.430> any<00:03:14.579> kind<00:03:14.790> of

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
like very nice so any kind of

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.309 
like very nice so any kind of
discoloration<00:03:15.269> or<00:03:15.810> staining
