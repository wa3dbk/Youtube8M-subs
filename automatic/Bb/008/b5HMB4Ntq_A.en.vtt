00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.690
 that you certain as it is so good because 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.790
 welcome a new video today 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.030
 I 'm going to show you how to get the 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.030
 achievement or extra trophy for 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.100
 station this is just like the extra 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.589
 I explained we found in the last map 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.390
 what we have to do that destroy 4 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.640
 let's say you shoot 4 eggs that 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.349
 are hidden in multiplayer ok let's go 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.390
 to shoot these 4 eggs and then 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.550
 we have to go build a hive 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.950
 in extinction so that we complete this 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.990
 is this achievement not then I'm going to do 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.059
 now the four locations of the 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.800
 different maps and well let's go to 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.660
 start and well the first of them will 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.879
 located on the map is the map of erwin 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.559
 of the predator and we are going to come 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.420
 just this location is 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.680
 find just here in this part 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.370
 of simple people on the map where is going to 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.370
 be located 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.609
 right here in this part and what 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.809
 we have to do is shoot him here 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.100
 from here you can not reach the area 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.260
 I just had to shoot him from 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.059
 far is just below that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.010
 building you shoot and you have to 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.320
 follow the marker then well let's go 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.610
 with the next location good the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.799
 next location is in 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.750
 the map of lowers is the one that is like 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.100
 with the giant bulldozer the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.170
 location is the following check 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.570
 biden of the map, notice where it is 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.610
 it's quite simple the easiest thing is that 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.140
 is to put on this side and if it touches you 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.789
 he puts them here because it 's much simpler 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.740
 because otherwise otherwise after 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.170
 start because the enemy team then 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.060
 close in order what to do is come 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.319
 like this part of the railing and week in 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.399
 the one who add here once already 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:31.289
 they know where it is very simple 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.090
 shoot him but I say that already when in 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.770
 this part they just shoot they 're going to 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.049
 count and let's go with the next 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.909
 location good gentlemen the next 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.009
 egg that we have to shoot you is in 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.750
 the collision map this is the ship's 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.009
 from the destroyed bridge and the shit and 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.720
 well it was you can shoot it from 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.130
 many locations I tell them 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.750
 I'm going to show the place so I say yes 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.220
 you find an easier place 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.899
 they can do it, I'm going to do it here 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.149
 because it's right now where I'm already in Spanish 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.130
 and it's a lot easier at the location 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.930
 of the art I am is this 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.500
 and underpin it if you want to just look 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.640
 the pillars of this as a bridge and it's 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.320
 it's really easy to shoot him 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.180
 then when what we're going to do is going 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.130
 to be here like pegaditos like 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.649
 the map bar at the edge of the map and 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.660
 peeking until we can see the egg 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.950
 it's very easy to see look there 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.780
 here we can see it right there 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.910
 is the egg we just shot 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.380
 I tell them there are many locations 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.610
 can be from the other is pont 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.280
 there is just a place where 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.930
 exactly every right the egg I say 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.940
 I chose this because it is what I have left 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.130
 closer but in the location is 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.900
 the least, do not just look for some 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.090
 place where you can see any of 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.880
 the pillars of the map and right there in 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.680
 the leg of the let's say the pillar 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.750
 not from the base of this one of this bridge 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.160
 Well, you can shoot the egg 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.349
 it's very simple now let's go with the 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.790
 last location and good gentlemen then 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.260
 the last location for these eggs 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.329
 that we have to get is the map of 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.040
 a yesterday this one is just in 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.230
 this part where it's like the meteor 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.930
 nailed to the ground what we have to 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.849
 do here is to surround let's say turn up 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.160
 that we find an ojito a slot here 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.569
 in this as well that is here then 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.310
 well just keep looking until 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.770
 that you find like this little groove 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.060
 small and they will shoot the egg a 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.800
 Once you are shot, you are going to tell them and 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.840
 will give them is a reward of 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.730
 experience for multiplayer but this 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.220
 it's not all yet we do not have the achievement what 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.290
 what we have to do is go to 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.459
 extinction and destroy a hive is very 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.860
 important that when they are shooting 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.750
 your eggs have to be fired 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.610
 they have to be achieved in a 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.650
 public party can not be in a 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.440
 private party so I would be 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.120
 and perhaps the troll thing, let's not say 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.030
 this for example especially this area 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.470
 in the multiplayer is a pretty area 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.660
 complicated is not a pretty area of 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.980
 much conflict right now, because we 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.110
 we are exposing on this side then 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.660
 a little simpler but it's an area 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.239
 a little difficult not to control the 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.099
 better attempts you know where is 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.019
 you can quickly come to this well to 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.519
 get this little egg not then 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.650
 just keep that in mind you have to 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.269
 being a public party can not be a 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.950
 private party so that when the 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.269
 I have following then if they want to do it 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.849
 with friends because maybe we can 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.680
 cover in what you dry and shoot 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.989
 in these eggs not but good once 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.960
 have the four eggs completed 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.490
 we are going to explain 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.750
 good gentlemen then I once here in 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.430
 extinction what we have to do is 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.620
 put us on the mayday map in the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.510
 new map of extinction and what we have 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.610
 what to do is grab our drill and 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.750
 take it to any hive of any 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.490
 those in the first zone there is no 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.110
 no problem so I also 

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.900
 can make a group opportunity a 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.670
 little this individual does not happen anything let's go 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.200
 to destroy a hive we hope that 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.470
 be destroyed and once it is destroyed 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.720
 we will loose the achievement of extra expide 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.270
 It goes station that is very similar to 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.580
 what we did on the night fall map is 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.170
 a then quite a simple achievement and 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.330
 will give 10,000 experience points 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.530
 besides that obviously their achievement does not 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.240
 I say it's simple if they know where to look 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.610
 the eggs I think of the most things 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.870
 complicated is probably that they 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.520
 leave the maps that they have to 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.200
 continue because many times people 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.900
 he wants to repeat the rubens map a lot 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.450
 by the predator and this then to 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.370
 sometimes it may complicate a bit 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.320
 play all the maps or that simply 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.060
 the game is too close and then 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.320
 do not give them as much opportunity to 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.080
 go to places but in itself it's pretty 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.490
 simple you already know that if you liked it let 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.290
 its like and if they are new I invite you to 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.540
 subscribe for more tricks and more 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.540
 secrets here of extinction 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.540
 green coast we see you take care a lot and 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.540
 goodbye
