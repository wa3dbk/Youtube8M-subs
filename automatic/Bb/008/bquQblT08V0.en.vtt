00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.370 
and and seek out the kind of fertilizer
that's<00:05:30.190> best<00:05:30.460> for<00:05:30.520> roses<00:05:31.000> but<00:05:31.480> in<00:05:31.720> my<00:05:32.080> view<00:05:32.320> you

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
that's best for roses but in my view you

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.810 
that's best for roses but in my view you
really<00:05:32.500> that's<00:05:33.040> not<00:05:33.280> something<00:05:33.550> you<00:05:33.640> have<00:05:33.760> to

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
really that's not something you have to

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.940 
really that's not something you have to
do<00:05:34.120> that<00:05:34.780> can<00:05:34.930> be<00:05:35.020> an<00:05:35.110> added<00:05:35.350> benefit<00:05:35.740> if<00:05:35.920> you

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
do that can be an added benefit if you

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.570 
do that can be an added benefit if you
really<00:05:36.280> want<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.990> perhaps<00:05:38.010> you<00:05:39.010> know<00:05:39.100> make

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
really want to perhaps you know make

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.480 
really want to perhaps you know make
sure<00:05:39.730> your<00:05:39.880> ruse<00:05:40.090> stays<00:05:40.360> and<00:05:40.750> good<00:05:41.490> vigorous

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
active growth that's really all there is

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.740 
active growth that's really all there is
to<00:05:45.550> it<00:05:45.670> we've<00:05:45.850> planted<00:05:46.060> our<00:05:46.270> drift<00:05:46.480> rose<00:05:46.720> a
