00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.360
 and internet beauty 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.050
 Do you know who could see the title of the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.640
 video still made a joke but it's the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.170
 more serious play because here in the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.840
 Rio is a lot of this 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:31.679
 Here 's how to make the system 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.290
 fisheries are society a line of 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.290
 low quality of those same baratinha 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:45.840
 a lead can be a candle 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:50.100
 by car a nut of those big ones there 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:55.850
 anything that weighs a can of 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:01:10.439
 old preference mixed with this 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:19.880
 following osol and will need to make the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:19.880
 following 1st second thing itself 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.840
 playing with the poor but it works in a 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.909
 emergency until now it works 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.140
 Okay, I'll rap because I'm old. 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.140
 next is a tie here 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.630
 I have a loop is very big but everything 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.630
 good 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.220
 passes here in the can is not going to roll everything 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.290
 Not only will I show you that it was 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.290
 it works 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.570
 if I spend the whole line business here 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.020
 okay but basically here you go 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.020
 to roll 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.410
 So it means it's going to roll until it 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.430
 line ok 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:09.170
 finished the line that if the business with 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:14.060
 quota for coming back then finished the line 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.800
 It's just cut it out and we'll do it. 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.489
 that the spool 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:27.410
 It's full, it's beautiful, it 's pretty full 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.750
 You'll do the following from the staff. 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.560
 that makes everything wrong 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.560
 she does everything wrong 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:41.360
 the new make right here the staff here 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.640
 us is bad right staff gets the can 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.620
 It's not everyone's hand, it's not, but it has 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.620
 many people are with the can in his hand there 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.530
 It's playing anyway, there it is. 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:57.049
 on the material of others giving 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:59.870
 right and also the confusion to show 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:03.640
 how is the fishing that we call 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:19.329
 fagot of those guys that just makes 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:23.799
 bullshit here take it out, there it goes 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:28.280
 a video showing the already it is to use 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:30.370
 the opponent 's serve is not a reel 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.100
 then to everyone who is made of can 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.790
 to do one as it should be done 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.610
 truth 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:46.389
 ok but for now I will show how 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:46.389
 staff do there weekend 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.019
 or call caught this guy'm not 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.610
 fisherman understood now you see the thing 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.239
 will be so wrong that even I to 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:16.299
 embracing here at the beginning where 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:22.019
 You come back here, the boot here is basically 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.019
 This is the can with this mess here. 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:35.820
 It's a joke to show that 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.960
 the people who fishing the wrong thing do 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.690
 but it's a little serious because 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:46.800
 ends up disturbing everyone understood 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:49.479
 so this is it, oh the rain line 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.780
 below which is also in place 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:05:05.530
 wrong the whip is the whip effect in 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:14.650
 Then I'll show you 're at stake, it 's only in the 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:17.160
 hand of this size of today so of 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.710
 joking but showing with a personal 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.740
 that does not have material that in the 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.720
 want to buy because a lot you see that 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:32.830
 There's money to buy so just 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:35.050
 He does not even have money. 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.410
 we even try to help at the time we 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:41.970
 We can give a candle by car to 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.830
 people come already with fire lair one 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.080
 paying attention serious thing we were going to 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:53.979
 help now with this guy, are you kidding? 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:58.080
 we put aside even as it helps 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:06:02.900
 did not disturb the fishery enough 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.600
 I want the video of how to do it right. 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.280
 Correct is this comment below if 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.300
 you have comment is enough but that 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.199
 he did not learn to make the system 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.509
 right 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.729
 we do here is the whole system wrong 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:15.410
 with the staff so much you deserve a 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.509
 video to show you how not to 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.860
 should make the attacker is should not 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:25.310
 everything is wrong here ok you can even use it 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.100
 No it's okay, but it's all wrong. 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.990
 the wrong line is not very thick 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:34.610
 Whip it wrong that this one the whip is 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:38.330
 right then went to show more is 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:40.970
 how not to do this kind of system if 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.770
 They want to know how to do it in comments 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.419
 and is depending on the amount of 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.979
 comments we make a video about the 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:51.710
 A good subject shows how to do it 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:53.240
 tonet right here and also disclose the 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.500

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.460
 who already enrolled in the brigado channel 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.590
 remembering that the draw is coming 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:04.520

 is good about serious non-video fishing 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.720
 It's a joke, the kid here. 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.400

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:22.520
