00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
well so now on for the obvious problem

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.520 
well so now on for the obvious problem
looking<00:00:47.129> at<00:00:47.370> pillows<00:00:47.789> CAD<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.780> standout

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
looking at pillows CAD is the standout

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.549 
looking at pillows CAD is the standout
44<00:00:50.250> pace<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.910> there<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> does<00:00:52.230> get<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.469> bit

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
44 pace that there and it does get a bit

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.250 
44 pace that there and it does get a bit
worse<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.190> does<00:00:53.370> only<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.789> 33<00:00:54.539> sprint<00:00:54.960> speed

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
worse it does only have 33 sprint speed

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.069 
worse it does only have 33 sprint speed
so<00:00:55.980> he's<00:00:56.219> really<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.820> slow<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.539> he's<00:00:57.809> not

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
so he's really really slow so he's not

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.740 
so he's really really slow so he's not
one<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.620> pace<00:00:58.859> lovers<00:00:59.280> out<00:00:59.430> there<00:00:59.510> but<00:01:00.510> on

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
one for the pace lovers out there but on

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.599 
one for the pace lovers out there but on
the<00:01:00.899> plus<00:01:01.020> side<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.649> does<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:02.010> decent

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the plus side it does have decent

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.850 
the plus side it does have decent
dribbling<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.270> balance<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:03.930> well<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.500> can

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
dribbling and balance as well so I can

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.219 
dribbling and balance as well so I can
dribble<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.790> only<00:01:05.939> really<00:01:06.510> useful<00:01:07.049> for

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
dribble but it's only really useful for

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.770 
dribble but it's only really useful for
creating<00:01:07.409> space<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.549> passes<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.540> he

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
creating space for a passes as he

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.630 
creating space for a passes as he
obviously<00:01:10.080> does<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.010> speed<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.280> get

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
obviously does not have the speed to get

playmaker<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.799> he<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.340> real<00:01:44.490> life<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.420> we

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
playmaker like he is in real life but we

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.690 
playmaker like he is in real life but we
decided<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> change<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.860> he<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.430> sitting

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
decided to change it up he was sitting

decided to change it up he was sitting
back<00:01:47.939> too<00:01:48.240> much<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.810> thought<00:01:49.049> we'd<00:01:49.229> give<00:01:49.439> him<00:01:49.470> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
back too much we thought we'd give him a

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.219 
back too much we thought we'd give him a
goal<00:01:49.799> at<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.040> camp<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.909> swap<00:01:51.240> formations<00:01:51.659> pushed

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
goal at a camp so swap formations pushed

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.840 
goal at a camp so swap formations pushed
him<00:01:52.409> up<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> cam<00:01:52.860> see<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.280> could<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.579> some

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
him up the cam see we could get some

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.120 
him up the cam see we could get some
goals<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.390> his<00:01:54.960> long<00:01:55.170> reign<00:01:55.200> finishing<00:01:55.920> is

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
goals and his long reign finishing is

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.340 
goals and his long reign finishing is
actually<00:01:56.490> pretty<00:01:56.850> old<00:01:57.149> did<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.689> some<00:01:57.899> decent

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
actually pretty old did have some decent

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.499 
actually pretty old did have some decent
efforts<00:01:58.680> from<00:01:58.799> Pirlo<00:01:59.280> at<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.729> nice<00:01:59.969> finish<00:02:00.360> from

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
efforts from Pirlo at a nice finish from

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.060 
efforts from Pirlo at a nice finish from
outside<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> box<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.740> was<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:01.950> his

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
outside of the box and it was on his

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.709 
outside of the box and it was on his
weaker<00:02:02.460> foot<00:02:02.640> as<00:02:02.820> well<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.240> know<00:02:03.299> he's<00:02:03.540> got<00:02:03.659> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
weaker foot as well you know he's got a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.870 
weaker foot as well you know he's got a
great<00:02:04.079> force<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> weak<00:02:04.950> foot<00:02:05.159> on<00:02:05.280> him<00:02:05.460> but

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
great force now a weak foot on him but

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.819 
great force now a weak foot on him but
when<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:06.509> shooting<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.170> box<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.560> think

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
when you are shooting in the box I think

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.619 
when you are shooting in the box I think
you've<00:02:07.950> got<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> really<00:02:08.489> relied<00:02:08.970> more<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.360> his

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
you've got a really relied more on his

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.890 
you've got a really relied more on his
power<00:02:09.899> shooting<00:02:10.500> than<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> finesse<00:02:12.209> really

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
power shooting than is a finesse really

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.940 
power shooting than is a finesse really
it<00:02:13.080> does<00:02:13.260> only<00:02:13.440> have

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it does only have

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.250 
it does only have
62<00:02:14.489> finishing<00:02:15.030> which<00:02:15.209> is<00:02:15.420> really<00:02:15.660> par<00:02:15.959> so<00:02:16.140> if

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
62 finishing which is really par so if

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.780 
62 finishing which is really par so if
you<00:02:16.349> just<00:02:16.500> tap<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.800> shoot<00:02:17.129> button<00:02:17.340> you're

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
you just tap the shoot button you're

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.970 
you just tap the shoot button you're
more<00:02:17.970> than<00:02:18.090> likely<00:02:18.150> gonna<00:02:18.690> get<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.050> saved<00:02:19.349> make

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
more than likely gonna get it saved make

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.619 
more than likely gonna get it saved make
sure<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.310> apply<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.640> bit<00:02:20.879> more<00:02:21.090> power<00:02:21.330> with

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
sure you apply a bit more power with

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.540 
sure you apply a bit more power with
pearl<00:02:21.840> or<00:02:22.050> any<00:02:22.200> shots<00:02:22.530> they'd<00:02:22.980> also<00:02:23.160> get<00:02:23.519> a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
pearl or any shots they'd also get a

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.309 
pearl or any shots they'd also get a
goal<00:02:23.819> from<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.150> free<00:02:24.239> kick<00:02:24.450> as<00:02:24.780> well<00:02:24.810> really

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
goal from a free kick as well really

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.839 
goal from a free kick as well really
wanted<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.709> get<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.890> free<00:02:26.099> kick<00:02:26.280> only<00:02:26.610> managed

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
wanted to get a free kick only managed

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.119 
wanted to get a free kick only managed
one<00:02:26.879> wasn't<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.810> best<00:02:27.989> goal<00:02:28.290> but<00:02:28.620> still<00:02:28.950> nice

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
one wasn't the best goal but still nice

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.130 
one wasn't the best goal but still nice
to<00:02:29.190> get<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.580> in<00:02:29.730> as<00:02:29.940> he<00:02:30.060> does<00:02:30.239> have<00:02:30.360> great<00:02:30.630> free

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
to get it in as he does have great free

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.190 
to get it in as he does have great free
kicks<00:02:31.440> that's<00:02:31.739> think<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:32.599> 195<00:02:33.599> free<00:02:33.959> kick

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
kicks that's think it's 195 free kick

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.400 
kicks that's think it's 195 free kick
accuracy<00:02:34.550> so<00:02:35.550> really<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.390> should<00:02:36.569> not<00:02:36.840> expect

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
accuracy so really you should not expect

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.800 
accuracy so really you should not expect
too<00:02:37.709> many<00:02:37.920> goals<00:02:38.250> from<00:02:38.580> Pirlo<00:02:39.150> from<00:02:39.420> open<00:02:39.780> play

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
too many goals from Pirlo from open play

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.589 
too many goals from Pirlo from open play
anyway<00:02:40.680> as<00:02:41.130> he<00:02:41.340> doesn't<00:02:41.580> get<00:02:41.849> forward<00:02:42.390> with

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
anyway as he doesn't get forward with

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.690 
anyway as he doesn't get forward with
those<00:02:42.720> low<00:02:42.989> medium<00:02:43.230> we<00:02:43.590> rate<00:02:43.830> it'll<00:02:44.129> sit<00:02:44.459> back

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
those low medium we rate it'll sit back

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.759 
those low medium we rate it'll sit back
they'd<00:02:45.209> really<00:02:45.540> have<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.959> work<00:02:46.110> out<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.650> get

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
they'd really have to work out to get

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.949 
they'd really have to work out to get
him<00:02:46.860> into<00:02:47.040> those<00:02:47.280> advanced<00:02:47.700> positions<00:02:48.330> so

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
him into those advanced positions so

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.750 
him into those advanced positions so
let's<00:02:49.170> look<00:02:49.290> at<00:02:49.470> Palos<00:02:49.830> performance<00:02:50.400> stats<00:02:50.610> so
