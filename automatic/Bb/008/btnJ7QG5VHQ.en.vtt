00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
just a theory but the most important

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.039

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
it's fire rate the YouTuber it fires at

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.679 
it's fire rate the YouTuber it fires at
a<00:01:24.000> rate<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.290> 1,200<00:01:25.290> rounds<00:01:25.470> per<00:01:25.830> minute<00:01:26.689> nice

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
a rate of 1,200 rounds per minute nice

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.929 
a rate of 1,200 rounds per minute nice
but<00:01:28.560> because<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> monstrous<00:01:29.490> fire<00:01:29.670> rate

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
but because of the monstrous fire rate

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.609 
but because of the monstrous fire rate
the<00:01:30.210> weapon<00:01:30.479> kicks<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.840> mule<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.350> there's
