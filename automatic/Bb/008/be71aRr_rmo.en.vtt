00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.310
 to draw a colorful fish 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:18.910
 so doing towards a tip 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.480
 A) Yes 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:26.620
 nothing should be so long because no 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.940
 It may be that you do not pass the letter 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.940
 if they have to erase 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.100
 A) Yes 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.789
 and to you I left over to you I do not know 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.739
 19 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:51.510
 this is going to be so little is the body the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.829
 shirt and now let's make him the tail 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.829
 point is like this 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.680
 as a half circle 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.680
 and now let's do it like that 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.870
 so they look like waves 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.870
 and here you should not be so fat 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.260
 let's say I was wrong because 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.210
 and I are the videos is drawing so 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:30.040
 me like this and now let's do it 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:32.530
 well from here of these struts like that and they 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:40.140
 we have spent to where the point is 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:41.940
 what and how and so and so 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.860
 it's going to be a bit funny but 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.180
 then we are going to put details and 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.710
 all 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.670
 now very from the eyes 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:58.049
 we can make you some 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:02:00.930
 so let's color in black to 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.490
 that you see what the eye itself is because 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.259
 We are going to put a little something like that for him 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.280
 color will be the color that you 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.619
 wish 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.310

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.970

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.859
 so is 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.439
 then if you want to put it like this you can 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:30.630
 be this way they can be on the other side can 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:34.650

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.920
