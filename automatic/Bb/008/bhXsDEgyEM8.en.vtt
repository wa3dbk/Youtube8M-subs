00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.890
 and maybe no other whippet has more 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.340
 resistance that the dog borrowed from 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.340
 Rhodesia 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.900
 is one of the most dynamic of the group of 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.550
 the greyhounds most are surprised 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.310
 when he discovers that the dog believes 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.630
 of Rhodesia belongs to the hounds 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.890
 they were born to run and hunt and that's 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.960
 exactly what they have to do 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.880
 this dog can not only run at par 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.359
 of a horse for 50 kilometers 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.849
 can also reach a lion is a 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.220
 incredibly brave animal is capable 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.340
 to face death and continue 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.340
 ahead 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.660
 also known as the hunter of 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.239
 african lions the borrowed dog from 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.559
 Rhodesia is a big and muscular dog 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.570
 created in southern africa to hunt 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.120
 lions the race was created by the jÃ³ 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.890
 so many a native people of south africa and 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.680
 by the first German colonizers 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.829
 and Dutch combined the mastiff the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.140
 Great Dane the Greyhound the Bloodhound the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.299
 terrier and other breeds with the dog of 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.549
 the hot on tops a guardian and hunter 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.580
 semisalvaje of the tribe and they gave 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.140
 birth to the borrowed dog of Rhodesia 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.539
 imagine the kind of personality that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.640
 you need to run after a lion of 300 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.740
 kilos and chase it to the cup of the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.140
 trees so is the crested dog of 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.979
 Rhodesia the most distinctive feature 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.840
 of the Rhodesian dog is his crest are 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.780
 tufts of hair that grow in direction 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.970
 contrary to the rest of the fur its legs 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.890
 wide and padded are fundamental 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.420
 to protect it when it runs kilometers 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.610
 and kilometers in the most 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.020
 African wild adapted to 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.830
 arid landscapes of the plains 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.720
 African 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.540
 the crested dog can resist 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.820
 extreme temperatures 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.170
 in addition to its resistance what gives it the 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.530
 ability to travel long distances 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.230
 it's his splendid build 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.480
 extraordinarily strong has a 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.970
 powerful column with 31 vertebrae 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.070
 solid in the neck and spine in each 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.720
 one of them muscles are inserted 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.840
 powerful that hold some legs 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.400
 long strong front legs 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.530
 They are straight and have very strong bones 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.149
 resistant designed to withstand 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.490
 requirements to which the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.320
 body while it is moving not 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.910
 for nothing the borrowed dog of Rhodesia is 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.770
 the mascot chosen by many athletes 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.580
 as the Olympic medalist Carl Lewis 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.590

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.220

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.270
 friendly 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.319

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.310
 borrowed dogs from Rhodesia we have 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:43.040
 about 'kind' and here are our children 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.739
 we do not have human children we have three 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.689
 brown and furry children they were looking for 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.340
 an athletic and intelligent dog that 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.200
 will share his passion for careers and 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.329
 they found the perfect mascot 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.519
 the borrowed dog from Rhodesia Sisal and I 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.859
 we are very active we both like 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.689
 running and walking liked a fellow 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.340
 marathon someone who will accompany me to the 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:03.139
 mountain because sometimes when I get to 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.810
 places very far I get a little 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.579
 nervous as if someone had 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.849
 designed a dog exactly for 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.349
 we left jim assure that his dog 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.150
 be that it helps you to train 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.590
 I waited until I was two and a half years old 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.290
 before training with him for 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.120
 marathons we start with about 10 km and 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.239
 we were increasing all the ends of 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.129
 week sally dreams of competing at least 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.010
 in a marathon per year while I can 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.680
 Rhodesian dogs are your allies in 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.930
 that dream 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.659
 I am to be youtube to train for three 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.079
 marathons in a training we got to 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:42.359
 run more than 35 km at that point I decided 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.670
 I ended up telling him to stop but 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.599
 He showed no signs of tiredness no 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.489
 I was exhausted 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.290
 they are excellent coaches get so 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.480
 eager to go out and exercise 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.109
 it's hard to say and that keeps me 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.109
 motivated 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.550
 salt and jean know that the secret to be 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.370
 happy a borrowed dog from Rhodesia is 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.230
 exercise and more exercise and it's 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.140
 important that they do at least one or two 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.970
 hours of strenuous exercise per day 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.520
 I recommend taking them out to run daily or 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.989
 at least to walk briskly 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.940
 they need intense activity and that 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.280
 activity can also benefit your 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.350
 owners the borrowed can have 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.870
 tendency to do mischief because 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.940
 they need mental stimulation can 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.800
 stay alone in an apartment but in 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.810
 this case leave them one of those toys 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.120
 of rubber in which you can put food 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.860
 to encourage them another option is to give them 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.080
 a walk a race that agrees to leave 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.910
 alone inside but if they make sure that 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.030
 exercise and receive encouragement 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.250
 can live in an apartment and 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.280
 one last warning these athletes 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.590
 they can jump very high that they love 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.840
 jump so if you leave them in a yard 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.540
 they will need a fence of at least 2 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.360
 meters the borrowed dog of Rhodesia is 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.460
 a very insistent animal intelligent and 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.560
 independent is better related to 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.480
 methodical owners who apply techniques 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.790
 positive training 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.860
 and walmex and it is essential that they be firm 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.470
 with these dogs from the beginning 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.660
 because they will only have that opportunity if 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.330
 they are raised correctly they will be able 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.070
 to make their own decisions if they are not 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.320
 call them attention all the time 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.620
 about everything they can do and what 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.750
 they can not do and they will still do what 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.820
 they want so you have to teach them to 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.880
 obey from very young so that 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.070
 Do the right thing when you reach adulthood 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:35.610
 they are very independent beautiful animals 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.560
 and majestic really wonderful 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.509
 the borrowed dogs of Rhodesia 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.430
 they need active and athletic families 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:44.039
 if they like to do outdoor activities 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.500
 free with his family the Rhodesian dog 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.599
 it's an excellent choice you have to 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.550
 like the outdoors should make sure 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:54.370
 that your dog can run and do it 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.740
 freely only so will be happy 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.720
 the borrowed Rhodesian dog needs to 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.050
 less one hour of strenuous exercise per 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.330
 day and how he knows how to jump the fences 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.639
 measure at least two meters 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.490
 it is a generally healthy race and without 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.319
 diseases is very smart and 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.940
 you need constant training from 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:15.280
 very small 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.190
 It is excellent for athletic families and 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.010
 very active 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:24.060
 a race is really wonderful 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:26.360
 only that changed my life are amazing 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.360
