00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.519 
instant reconnect here you see I'm
connected<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.059> work<00:00:30.390> router<00:00:30.689> that's<00:00:31.110> the<00:00:31.349> name

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
connected to work router that's the name

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.840 
connected to work router that's the name
of<00:00:31.739> the<00:00:31.829> wireless<00:00:32.009> network<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.960> I'm<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
of the wireless network and I'm going to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.770 
of the wireless network and I'm going to
go<00:00:35.850> into<00:00:36.030> desktop<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.910> run<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> very<00:00:39.359> simple

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
go into desktop and run a very simple

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.410 
go into desktop and run a very simple
script<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:41.190> simply<00:00:41.699> put<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
script that we have that simply put the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.900 
script that we have that simply put the
machine<00:00:42.750> into<00:00:43.050> standby<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.519> then<00:00:44.760> I'll

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
machine into standby and then I'll

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.020 
machine into standby and then I'll
resume<00:00:45.269> it<00:00:46.190> great<00:00:47.190> now<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.429> machines<00:00:47.910> in

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
resume it great now the machines in

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.970 
resume it great now the machines in
standby<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.079> we're<00:00:49.260> simulating<00:00:49.499> going

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
standby so we're simulating going

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.380 
standby so we're simulating going
between<00:00:50.100> two<00:00:50.429> different<00:00:50.760> networks<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.300> so

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
between two different networks and so

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.000 
between two different networks and so
we've<00:00:51.539> taken<00:00:51.570> down<00:00:52.019> the<00:00:52.199> work<00:00:52.379> router<00:00:52.679> network

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
we've taken down the work router network

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.009 
we've taken down the work router network
and<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.670> brought<00:00:53.850> up<00:00:53.999> the<00:00:54.149> home<00:00:54.329> network<00:00:54.510> this

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
and we brought up the home network this

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.869 
and we brought up the home network this
simply<00:00:55.469> simulates<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.280> between<00:00:56.429> two

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
simply simulates going between two

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.299 
simply simulates going between two
different<00:00:57.149> networks<00:00:58.010> next<00:00:59.010> I'm<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.249> to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
different networks next I'm going to

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.680 
different networks next I'm going to
resume<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> machine<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:05.240> great<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.479> see

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
resume the machine and great you see

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.899 
resume the machine and great you see

interface is coming up now you can see

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.990 
interface is coming up now you can see
that<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.290> sim<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.709> understood<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.160> be<00:02:37.340> AT&amp;T

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
that the sim is understood to be AT&amp;T

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.449 
that the sim is understood to be AT&amp;T
sim<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.750> we<00:02:39.320> are<00:02:39.470> connecting<00:02:39.950> for<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.280> first

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
sim and we are connecting for the first

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.699 
sim and we are connecting for the first
time<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:40.970> soon<00:02:41.840> you'll<00:02:42.020> see<00:02:42.200> we're<00:02:42.380> connected

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
so great so now you see that the sim was

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.510 
so great so now you see that the sim was
recognized<00:02:47.780> as<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:48.050> tee<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.650> we<00:02:48.860> automatically

internally<00:03:17.690> developed<00:03:17.930> application<00:03:18.710> we<00:03:18.830> have

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
internally developed application we have

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.490 
internally developed application we have
that<00:03:19.760> uses<00:03:20.060> our<00:03:20.150> costs<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.630> wear<00:03:20.780> ap<00:03:21.050> is<00:03:21.170> in

that uses our costs to wear ap is in
this<00:03:22.010> application<00:03:22.700> is<00:03:23.020> simply<00:03:24.020> pulling<00:03:24.230> down

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
this application is simply pulling down

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.470 
this application is simply pulling down
images<00:03:26.060> from<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.050> Flickr<00:03:27.500> site<00:03:27.800> but<00:03:28.760> notice

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
images from the Flickr site but notice

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.380 
images from the Flickr site but notice
that<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:30.020> images<00:03:30.620> are<00:03:30.800> low<00:03:31.100> quality<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.820> the

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
that the images are low quality and the

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.940 
that the images are low quality and the
reason<00:03:32.690> these<00:03:32.780> images<00:03:33.200> are<00:03:33.260> low<00:03:33.410> quality<00:03:33.710> is

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
reason these images are low quality is

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.740 
reason these images are low quality is
because<00:03:34.190> this<00:03:34.370> application<00:03:35.120> is<00:03:35.210> aware<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.570> the

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
because this application is aware of the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.300 
because this application is aware of the
fact<00:03:35.960> that<00:03:36.080> it's<00:03:36.260> on<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.470> mobile<00:03:36.770> broadband

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
fact that it's on a mobile broadband

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.280 
fact that it's on a mobile broadband
network<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:37.850> these<00:03:38.240> networks<00:03:38.690> generally

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
network and these networks generally

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.920 
network and these networks generally
have<00:03:39.590> cost<00:03:40.220> associated<00:03:40.640> so<00:03:41.420> they're<00:03:41.570> pulling

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
have cost associated so they're pulling

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.200 
have cost associated so they're pulling
down<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.380> lower<00:03:42.740> resolution<00:03:43.400> photos<00:03:43.760> which

down the lower resolution photos which
are<00:03:44.360> saving<00:03:44.690> data<00:03:45.610> so<00:03:46.610> now<00:03:46.790> I'm<00:03:47.000> going<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.300> go

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
are saving data so now I'm going to go
