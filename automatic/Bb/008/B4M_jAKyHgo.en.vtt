00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
right where the battery compartment is

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.170 
right where the battery compartment is
because<00:01:37.190> really<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.670> only<00:01:37.760> thing<00:01:38.030> that's

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
because really the only thing that's

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.430 
because really the only thing that's
holding<00:01:38.270> this<00:01:38.540> in<00:01:38.720> is<00:01:39.370> the<00:01:40.930> tripod<00:01:41.930> socket

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
holding this in is the tripod socket

thingamajigger<00:01:44.830> so<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:46.340> only<00:01:46.460> place<00:01:46.700> where

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
guess is the eeee tripod turning wheel

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.910 
guess is the eeee tripod turning wheel
the<00:01:56.720> locking<00:01:57.050> wheel<00:01:57.229> tightening<00:01:57.770> wheel

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
the locking wheel tightening wheel

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
goes back and forth a little bit but

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.690 
goes back and forth a little bit but
it's<00:02:03.380> not<00:02:03.619> like<00:02:03.770> it's<00:02:03.920> loosening<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.490> just

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
it's not like it's loosening it just

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.030 
it's not like it's loosening it just
plays<00:02:05.509> a<00:02:05.540> little<00:02:05.930> bit<00:02:06.080> which<00:02:06.649> could<00:02:06.890> get

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
plays a little bit which could get

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.760 
plays a little bit which could get
annoying<00:02:07.220> but<00:02:07.929> just<00:02:08.929> warning<00:02:09.229> really<00:02:09.619> pay

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
annoying but just warning really pay

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.860 
annoying but just warning really pay
attention<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:12.760> yeah<00:02:13.760> some<00:02:14.450> people<00:02:14.480> said

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
attention to it yeah some people said

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.150 
attention to it yeah some people said
you<00:02:15.020> couldn't<00:02:15.260> really<00:02:15.380> get<00:02:15.530> six<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.040> half

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
you couldn't really get six and half

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.949 
you couldn't really get six and half
range<00:02:16.400> second<00:02:16.910> with<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.709> can<00:02:19.570> easily<00:02:20.570> get

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
range second with it I can easily get

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.740 
range second with it I can easily get
that<00:02:21.430> my<00:02:22.430> shutter<00:02:22.760> speeds<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.150> little<00:02:23.180> bit<00:02:23.450> slow

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
that my shutter speeds a little bit slow

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.020 
that my shutter speeds a little bit slow
so<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.170> won't<00:02:24.290> be<00:02:24.440> getting<00:02:24.920> quite<00:02:25.220> 69<00:02:25.820> for<00:02:26.000> a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
so I won't be getting quite 69 for a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.270 
so I won't be getting quite 69 for a
second<00:02:26.830> but<00:02:28.900> here's<00:02:29.900> my<00:02:30.260> taking<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:30.950> pictures

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
second but here's my taking the pictures

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:44.530 
second but here's my taking the pictures
with<00:02:31.459> it

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.350 

so<00:02:45.110> as<00:02:45.769> you<00:02:45.920> can<00:02:46.010> see<00:02:46.189> it<00:02:46.370> obviously<00:02:46.879> takes<00:02:46.939> the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
so as you can see it obviously takes the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.259 
so as you can see it obviously takes the
pictures<00:02:50.890> it's<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:52.640> little<00:02:52.879> bit<00:02:53.000> like<00:02:53.239> a

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
pictures it's a little bit like a

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.740 
pictures it's a little bit like a
different<00:02:54.049> grip<00:02:54.290> surface<00:02:54.799> that<00:02:55.069> my<00:02:55.189> cannons

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
different grip surface that my cannons

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.360 
different grip surface that my cannons
want<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:56.870> say<00:02:57.049> it<00:02:57.379> feels<00:02:57.709> more<00:02:58.280> grippy<00:02:59.109> yes<00:03:00.370> and

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
want to say it feels more grippy yes and

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.069 
want to say it feels more grippy yes and
I<00:03:01.549> guess<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:01.909> would<00:03:02.000> depend<00:03:02.030> on<00:03:02.450> how<00:03:02.659> you<00:03:02.720> like

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
I guess it would depend on how you like

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.349 
I guess it would depend on how you like
to<00:03:03.260> look<00:03:03.319> at<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.790> but<00:03:04.790> it's<00:03:05.120> definitely

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
to look at it but it's definitely

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.050 
to look at it but it's definitely
different<00:03:05.780> material<00:03:06.409> the<00:03:07.220> color<00:03:07.459> is<00:03:07.549> slightly

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
different material the color is slightly

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.929 
different material the color is slightly
different<00:03:08.329> than<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.810> canon<00:03:09.310> like<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.340> body

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:10.939 
different than the canon like the body

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.629 
different than the canon like the body
of<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.299> camera<00:03:11.480> but<00:03:12.010> anybody<00:03:13.010> that's<00:03:13.280> like

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
of the camera but anybody that's like

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.759 
of the camera but anybody that's like
doesn't<00:03:14.150> know<00:03:14.209> anything<00:03:14.389> about<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.469> stuff

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
doesn't know anything about the stuff

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.619 
doesn't know anything about the stuff
won't<00:03:16.040> really<00:03:16.250> notice<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.849> it's<00:03:17.000> not<00:03:17.450> the

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
events haven't had to worry that worried

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.219 
events haven't had to worry that worried
about<00:04:10.090> really<00:04:11.090> losing<00:04:11.479> any<00:04:11.599> battery<00:04:12.019> power

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:12.229 
about really losing any battery power

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.229 
about really losing any battery power
because<00:04:12.769> I've<00:04:13.159> got<00:04:13.340> two<00:04:13.519> batteries<00:04:13.909> in<00:04:14.030> here

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
because I've got two batteries in here

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.110 
because I've got two batteries in here
and<00:04:14.359> I<00:04:14.389> have<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.569> spare<00:04:14.959> in<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.079> camera<00:04:15.409> bag<00:04:15.590> now

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.450 

the<00:04:20.120> battery<00:04:20.810> door<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:23.919> guess<00:04:24.919> it<00:04:25.099> kind<00:04:25.280> of<00:04:25.310> does

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
the battery door I guess it kind of does

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.309 
the battery door I guess it kind of does
feel<00:04:25.699> a<00:04:25.760> little<00:04:25.820> bit

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:28.319 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.499 

not<00:04:29.319> under<00:04:29.680> percent<00:04:29.949> secure<00:04:30.400> i<00:04:30.430> guess<00:04:30.729> but<00:04:31.449> i

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
not under percent secure i guess but i

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:32.760 
not under percent secure i guess but i
really<00:04:31.810> wouldn't<00:04:31.900> worry<00:04:32.110> about<00:04:32.259> it<00:04:32.410> you<00:04:32.740> know

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
i'd still trust it yeah i guess i'll

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.719 
i'd still trust it yeah i guess i'll

borrowing<00:05:05.440> from<00:05:05.590> our<00:05:05.710> friends<00:05:06.099> so<00:05:06.310> it's<00:05:06.460> not

borrowing from our friends so it's not

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.790 
borrowing from our friends so it's not
mine<00:05:06.880> sadly<00:05:09.090> but<00:05:10.090> yeah<00:05:11.080> i<00:05:11.139> think<00:05:11.289> it's<00:05:11.560> pretty

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
mine sadly but yeah i think it's pretty

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.800 
mine sadly but yeah i think it's pretty
comfortable<00:05:15.090> yeah<00:05:16.090> i<00:05:16.120> guess<00:05:16.300> that<00:05:16.659> pretty

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
comfortable yeah i guess that pretty

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.059 
comfortable yeah i guess that pretty
much<00:05:16.960> concludes<00:05:17.139> my<00:05:18.060> pathetic<00:05:19.060> raw<00:05:19.720> review<00:05:20.289> if
