00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.430
 today I propose a challenge to make this cake 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.340
 as you see it in three minutes 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.560
 preparations ready and we're going to do it in 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.090
 machine but for the one that does not have 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.100
 machine can be done in a 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.110
 traditional just changing two things 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.070
 to love want let's put all the 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.950
 ingredients we cut the orange the 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.150
 crush 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.130
 the lemon when peeled and crushed 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:45.050
 we miss 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:45.050
 half butter bar 3 eggs 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.309
 and a cup and a half of sugar 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.420
 let's throw it out of the machine for those who 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.719
 you do not have the same machine if you put in 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.180
 blender the three eggs to beat with 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.640
 the cup and a half of sugar 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.920
 from your orange 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.850
 you make the juice and take advantage of it with a 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.080
 grater detracts 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:20.150
 you throw the peel and the lemon too 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.650
 you tell it and juice and you throw it 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.740
 lemon zest 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.900
 the same process so you do not have 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.960
 apologies for not doing so much about 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.640
 like others 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.640
 Then let's start 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.700
 we remove the seeds their care not 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:43.149
 you go to throw pips in the machine 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.149
 but bitter 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.350
 we end this whole 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.939
 we start in pieces 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.979
 ah 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.770
 today we are going to crush our first 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.770
 citrus 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.680
 our citrus fruits and we're going to incorporate 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.680
 the sugar 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.110
 and talk about our butter 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.160
 once 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.490
 look at our butter we throw the 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.490
 games 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.940
 ah 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.870
 ah 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.360
 ah 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.310
 while it is mixing our 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:06.020
 our eggs with all the rest of the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.200
 ingredients we take out a mass of 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.200
 puff pastry 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:23.140
 let's go to the surface of the mold or 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.140
 a little bit of o strike or butter 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.150
 and now 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.190
 and we put it 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.720
 our 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.340
 as you see 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.340
 very easy and simple 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.430
 you can use more to laugh what you most 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.680
 like 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.040
 but you know how to use the mass of breeze 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.990
 you have to cornearla previously for 10 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.310
 minutes and then throw him 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.310
 the ingredients 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.150
 placed 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.150
 you have the rest of the dough 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.319
 and now we take a fork 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.199
 and now we incorporate the eggs that 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.050
 we have done 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:37.490
 our typical to put 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:41.680
 at 180 degrees for 20 minutes 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.139
 watch her as long as they will watch and be late 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.419
 half long to monitor the 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.610
 cake is not going to be the oven that 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.699
 have more power with which he has gone 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.080
 heat and you're going to burn the can 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.080
 click and when dry 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.330
 ah 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.570
 do not 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:11.840
 Well we have here our high of 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:14.550
 citrus we're going to unmold 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.820
 that we have said it but 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.730
 the removable mold you already know is 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.560
 super comfortable unmolding our living 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.690
 cool 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.690
 with detachable molds 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.730
 uncomfortable to serve and very easy 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.510
 To present 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:45.559
 and now we are going to achieve it we need 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:49.639
 provider an orange cut in 

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:53.979
 little slices and we're putting it 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.979
 we put our oranges around 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.350
 and as you can see in three minutes we have a 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.260
 good cake well the kind of ordered that 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.190
 It's been 20 minutes 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:09.970
 and if you want in the middle that I think 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.970
 A little big 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.760
 Y 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.720
 ah 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.810
 all right
