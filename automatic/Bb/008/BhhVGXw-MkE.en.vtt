first<00:00:26.400> liner<00:00:26.730> brush<00:00:27.119> was<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.990> Mac<00:00:28.199> 209<00:00:29.449> now

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
first liner brush was the Mac 209 now

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.780 
first liner brush was the Mac 209 now
there<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.579> no<00:00:32.759> wonder<00:00:33.140> why<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.640> couldn't<00:00:35.640> get

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
there is no wonder why I couldn't get

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.020 
there is no wonder why I couldn't get
lining<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.480> eyes<00:00:36.510> right<00:00:37.020> because<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.610> liner

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
lining my eyes right because this liner

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.299 
lining my eyes right because this liner
brush<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.160> big<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.489> dumb<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:43.190> don't<00:00:44.190> know

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
brush is so big and dumb I don't know

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.170 
brush is so big and dumb I don't know
why<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.520> bought<00:00:44.789> it

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
why I bought it

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.389 
why I bought it
well<00:00:46.110> yes<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.920> didn't<00:00:47.160> know<00:00:47.219> any

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
well yes I do is I didn't know any

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.130 
well yes I do is I didn't know any
better<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.750> guess<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:50.930> don't<00:00:51.930> know<00:00:51.989> I

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
better and I guess the I don't know I

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.510 
better and I guess the I don't know I
didn't<00:00:52.379> know<00:00:52.440> any<00:00:52.590> better<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.949> basically

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
didn't know any better so basically

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.389 
didn't know any better so basically
that's<00:00:53.879> what<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.500> 209<00:00:55.500> brush<00:00:58.070> 208<00:00:59.070> brush

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that's what that was 209 brush 208 brush

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.630 
that's what that was 209 brush 208 brush
I<00:00:59.609> got<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.600> loved<00:01:01.260> it

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
I got this and I loved it

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.789 
I got this and I loved it
in<00:01:02.640> comparison<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.140> 209<00:01:05.450> it<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.990> godsend

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
in comparison to the 209 it is a godsend

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.320 
in comparison to the 209 it is a godsend
so<00:01:08.580> 208<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.390> better<00:01:09.720> than<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> 209<00:01:10.250> okay<00:01:11.330> then

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
so 208 is better than the 209 okay then

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.130 
so 208 is better than the 209 okay then
I<00:01:12.659> said<00:01:12.960> well<00:01:13.200> let<00:01:13.500> me<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.340> 210<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.960> see

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
I said well let me get the 210 to see

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.539 
I said well let me get the 210 to see
how<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.060> here's<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.240> 210<00:01:18.799> way<00:01:19.799> way

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
how that one is here's the 210 way way

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.139 
how that one is here's the 210 way way
better<00:01:20.880> than<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> 209

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.630 

look<00:01:24.689> at<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.899> comparison<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:27.390> 210<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.229> way

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
look at the comparison the 210 is way

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.200 
look at the comparison the 210 is way
skinnier<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.909> better<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> thin<00:01:32.210> precision

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
skinnier and better for a thin precision

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.309 
skinnier and better for a thin precision
line<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:35.060> 209<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.359> waste<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.840> money

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
line so 209 is a waste of money

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.350 
line so 209 is a waste of money
now<00:01:38.329> when<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.420> comes<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.380> 208<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:42.149> two

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
now when it comes to the 208 and the two

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.830 
now when it comes to the 208 and the two
times<00:01:42.689> they<00:01:43.500> are<00:01:43.530> both<00:01:43.979> good<00:01:44.520> liner<00:01:45.329> brushes<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
times they are both good liner brushes I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.990 
times they are both good liner brushes I

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
is great for a nice thin line

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.050 
is great for a nice thin line
they<00:02:02.130> both<00:02:02.340> are<00:02:02.369> actually<00:02:02.959> this<00:02:03.959> is<00:02:04.200> also<00:02:04.409> good

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
they both are actually this is also good

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.150 
they both are actually this is also good
well<00:02:06.060> actually<00:02:06.239> they<00:02:06.569> both<00:02:06.780> are<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.289> this<00:02:07.920> is

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
well actually they both are but this is

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.869 
well actually they both are but this is
also<00:02:08.369> good<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:09.709> actually<00:02:10.709> drawing<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:12.709> wing

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
also good for actually drawing the wing

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.050 
also good for actually drawing the wing
so<00:02:14.879> what<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.329> can<00:02:15.510> do<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:16.069> come<00:02:17.069> out<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.549> then

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
so what you can do is come out and then

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.190 
so what you can do is come out and then
actually<00:02:18.629> go<00:02:18.840> like<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.780> then<00:02:21.780> like<00:02:21.959> that

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
actually go like that and then like that

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.990 
actually go like that and then like that
and<00:02:22.260> draw<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.829> so<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:23.489> basically<00:02:23.879> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
and draw it in so it's basically a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.380 
and draw it in so it's basically a
toss-up<00:02:24.569> because<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.459> also<00:02:26.700> good<00:02:27.120> for

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
toss-up because this is also good for

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.250 
toss-up because this is also good for
the<00:02:27.510> outer<00:02:27.690> V<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.440> mean<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.280> wing<00:02:29.840> because<00:02:30.840> what

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
the outer V I mean the wing because what

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.789 
the outer V I mean the wing because what
you<00:02:31.410> do<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.190> just<00:02:32.519> flip<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.230> then<00:02:34.230> flick

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
you do is you just flip and then flick

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.240 
you do is you just flip and then flick
like<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.030> then<00:02:36.600> fill<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.049> now<00:02:37.319> what

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
like that and then fill it and now what

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.920 
like that and then fill it and now what
I<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.700> say<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:40.280> if<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.849> have<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:42.150> hard<00:02:42.540> time

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
I can say is if you have a hard time

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.670 
I can say is if you have a hard time
with<00:02:43.920> doing<00:02:44.700> one<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.000> your<00:02:45.120> eyes<00:02:45.450> like<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.440> have

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
with doing one of your eyes like I have

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.640 
with doing one of your eyes like I have
a<00:02:46.709> hard<00:02:47.099> time<00:02:47.870> lining<00:02:48.870> my<00:02:49.410> left<00:02:50.400> eye<00:02:51.650> because

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
a hard time lining my left eye because

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.580 
a hard time lining my left eye because
either<00:02:53.639> brush<00:02:54.060> I'm<00:02:54.359> like<00:02:54.660> shook<00:02:54.989> on<00:02:55.290> my<00:02:55.410> right

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
either brush I'm like shook on my right

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.650 
either brush I'm like shook on my right
eye<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.980> it's<00:02:56.190> all<00:02:56.370> cool<00:02:56.639> but<00:02:57.269> for<00:02:59.510> lining<00:03:00.510> and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
eye and it's all cool but for lining and

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.559 
eye and it's all cool but for lining and
I<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.230> have<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.579> hard<00:03:02.579> time<00:03:02.669> lining<00:03:03.359> I

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
I that you have a hard time lining I

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.530 
I that you have a hard time lining I
would<00:03:04.200> say<00:03:04.440> go<00:03:04.950> with<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.160> one<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:06.209> 208

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
would say go with the one the 208

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.540 
would say go with the one the 208
because

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.670 

that's<00:03:10.240> most<00:03:10.630> of<00:03:10.810> your<00:03:10.990> line<00:03:11.170> right<00:03:11.470> there

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
that's most of your line right there

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.360 
that's most of your line right there
basically<00:03:12.370> what<00:03:12.640> you're<00:03:12.850> doing<00:03:12.880> is<00:03:14.010> let's<00:03:15.010> say

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
basically what you're doing is let's say

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.660 
basically what you're doing is let's say
fluidline<00:03:16.240> for<00:03:16.930> example<00:03:17.460> basically<00:03:18.460> what

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
fluidline for example basically what

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.640 
fluidline for example basically what
you're<00:03:18.850> doing<00:03:18.880> is<00:03:19.270> you're<00:03:19.450> taking<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:20.020> dipping

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
you're doing is you're taking it dipping

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.020 
you're doing is you're taking it dipping
it<00:03:20.740> in<00:03:20.890> there<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.280> you're<00:03:21.430> basically<00:03:21.940> just

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
it in there and you're basically just

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.460 
it in there and you're basically just
placing<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:22.960> right<00:03:23.200> there<00:03:23.920> like<00:03:24.490> that<00:03:25.440> okay<00:03:26.440> so

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
placing it right there like that okay so

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.140 
placing it right there like that okay so
it's<00:03:26.800> kind<00:03:27.010> of<00:03:27.040> like<00:03:27.190> you're<00:03:27.400> connecting<00:03:28.000> the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
it's kind of like you're connecting the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.850 
it's kind of like you're connecting the
lines<00:03:28.470> just<00:03:29.470> going<00:03:29.830> and<00:03:30.160> like<00:03:30.520> that<00:03:31.410> okay<00:03:32.440> now

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
lines just going and like that okay now

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:41.820 
lines just going and like that okay now
with<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:35.760> chute<00:03:36.760> ten<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:38.380> have<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:40.830> trace

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
with the chute ten you have to trace

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.480 
with the chute ten you have to trace
like<00:03:42.520> you<00:03:42.700> have<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:43.030> go<00:03:43.770> and<00:03:44.770> it'll<00:03:45.010> take<00:03:45.310> you

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
like you have to go and it'll take you

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.790 
like you have to go and it'll take you
longer<00:03:45.820> to<00:03:46.030> do<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.570> it's<00:03:46.900> still<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.260> good<00:03:47.500> brush

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
longer to do it it's still a good brush

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.000 
longer to do it it's still a good brush
you<00:03:48.220> can<00:03:48.490> do<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:48.940> but<00:03:49.630> it's<00:03:49.930> just<00:03:50.020> easier<00:03:50.680> if

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
you can do it but it's just easier if

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.030 
you can do it but it's just easier if
you<00:03:51.600> use<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.780> 208<00:03:53.230> in<00:03:53.410> my<00:03:53.680> opinion<00:03:56.040> yeah

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
you use the 208 in my opinion yeah

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.140 
you use the 208 in my opinion yeah
because<00:03:57.340> you're<00:03:57.760> like<00:03:59.220> drawing<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:00.850> think

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
because you're like drawing and I think

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.500 
because you're like drawing and I think
with<00:04:01.390> this<00:04:01.630> one<00:04:01.930> on<00:04:03.210> an<00:04:04.210> eye<00:04:04.480> with<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.910> 208<00:04:06.910> or

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
with this one on an eye with the 208 or

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.040 
with this one on an eye with the 208 or
an<00:04:07.630> eye<00:04:07.840> that<00:04:08.170> you<00:04:08.280> um<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:10.090> know<00:04:10.240> aren't<00:04:10.960> a

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
an eye that you um you know aren't a

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.730 
an eye that you um you know aren't a
good<00:04:11.260> liner

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
good liner

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.900 
good liner
you<00:04:12.010> can't<00:04:12.670> line<00:04:13.540> I've<00:04:13.930> really<00:04:14.260> well<00:04:14.470> I<00:04:14.910> think

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
you can't line I've really well I think

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.760 
you can't line I've really well I think
the<00:04:16.180> 208<00:04:16.600> is<00:04:16.750> better<00:04:16.989> because<00:04:17.230> you're<00:04:17.560> just

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
the 208 is better because you're just

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.220 
the 208 is better because you're just
placing<00:04:18.070> it<00:04:18.400> there<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:19.600> you're<00:04:19.780> basically

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
placing it there and you're basically

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.390 
placing it there and you're basically
connecting<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.130> dots<00:04:22.680> because<00:04:23.680> you're<00:04:23.980> you

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
connecting the dots because you're you

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.250 
connecting the dots because you're you
know<00:04:24.580> because<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.360> already<00:04:25.540> have<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:25.930> line

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
know because you already have a line

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.790 
know because you already have a line
there<00:04:27.330> as<00:04:28.330> soon<00:04:28.480> as<00:04:28.540> you<00:04:28.660> sit<00:04:28.930> it<00:04:29.050> down<00:04:29.080> on<00:04:29.590> your

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
there as soon as you sit it down on your

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.220 
there as soon as you sit it down on your
lash<00:04:30.610> line<00:04:30.640> there's<00:04:31.540> a<00:04:31.660> part<00:04:31.930> of<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.050> line

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
lash line there's a part of the line

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.800 
lash line there's a part of the line
because<00:04:33.040> you<00:04:33.310> have<00:04:33.520> it<00:04:33.670> in<00:04:33.760> there<00:04:33.970> as<00:04:34.360> opposed

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
because you have it in there as opposed

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.860 
because you have it in there as opposed
to<00:04:34.990> having<00:04:35.500> this<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:36.310> then<00:04:37.030> having<00:04:37.330> to<00:04:37.450> draw
