hey<00:00:01.020> guys<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:01.860> video<00:00:02.070> is<00:00:02.399> going<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.669> cover

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hey guys this video is going to cover

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.579 
hey guys this video is going to cover
two<00:00:03.179> different<00:00:03.210> techniques<00:00:03.870> you<00:00:04.049> can<00:00:04.170> use<00:00:04.230> to

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
two different techniques you can use to

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.829 
two different techniques you can use to
greatly<00:00:05.250> improve<00:00:05.490> your<00:00:05.520> aim<00:00:05.790> in<00:00:06.029> any<00:00:06.359> real<00:00:06.600> any

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
greatly improve your aim in any real any

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.560 
greatly improve your aim in any real any
games<00:00:07.170> especially<00:00:07.560> shooters<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:09.120> first<00:00:09.360> one

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
games especially shooters the first one

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.780 
games especially shooters the first one
involves<00:00:09.840> actually<00:00:10.769> filling<00:00:11.190> with<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.550> game

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
involves actually filling with the game

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.629 
involves actually filling with the game
settings<00:00:12.300> but<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.230> second<00:00:13.559> one<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:14.309> something

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
settings but the second one is something

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.070 
settings but the second one is something
you<00:00:14.700> can<00:00:14.849> try<00:00:15.000> when<00:00:15.420> you're<00:00:15.540> actually<00:00:15.839> holding

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
you can try when you're actually holding

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.620 
you can try when you're actually holding
the<00:00:16.890> physical<00:00:17.340> controller<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.970> will<00:00:18.330> get<00:00:18.420> into

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
the physical controller I will get into

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.960 
the physical controller I will get into
it<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.840> second<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:20.130> your<00:00:20.250> aim<00:00:20.400> can<00:00:20.609> be<00:00:20.699> greatly

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
it and second so your aim can be greatly

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.210 
it and second so your aim can be greatly
improved<00:00:21.119> by<00:00:21.630> modifying<00:00:22.140> sensitivity<00:00:23.010> within

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
improved by modifying sensitivity within

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.859 
improved by modifying sensitivity within
the<00:00:23.400> game<00:00:23.550> settings<00:00:24.000> every<00:00:24.689> well-known

the game settings every well-known

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.150 
the game settings every well-known
shooter<00:00:25.439> will<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> feature<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.070> allows

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
sensitivity when I tell people this all

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.540 
sensitivity when I tell people this all
I<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:37.020> me<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.770> often<00:00:37.920> ask<00:00:38.129> me<00:00:38.309> how<00:00:38.370> do

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
I see me do it they often ask me how do

I see me do it they often ask me how do
I<00:00:38.790> actually<00:00:38.969> play<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.930> high<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
I actually play on that high of a

I actually play on that high of a
sensitivity<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.730> ever<00:00:41.820> played<00:00:42.030> on

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
sensitivity have you ever played on

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.420 
sensitivity have you ever played on
maximum<00:00:42.540> sensitivity<00:00:42.920> it's<00:00:43.920> not<00:00:44.070> very<00:00:44.280> hard

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
maximum sensitivity it's not very hard

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.160 
maximum sensitivity it's not very hard
to<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.910> all<00:00:45.030> maybe<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.780> because<00:00:45.899> I've

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
to do it all maybe just because I've

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.380 
to do it all maybe just because I've
done<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.469> technique<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:47.789> me<00:00:48.090> beam

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
done this technique but for me beam

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.080 
done this technique but for me beam
being<00:00:48.960> able<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.559> turn<00:00:49.770> quicker<00:00:50.129> makes<00:00:50.760> me<00:00:50.879> play

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
being able to turn quicker makes me play

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.610 
being able to turn quicker makes me play
better<00:00:51.329> because<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.780> can<00:00:51.960> spin<00:00:52.260> around<00:00:52.350> really

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
better because I can spin around really

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.110 
better because I can spin around really
quick<00:00:52.920> if<00:00:53.039> I'm<00:00:53.160> getting<00:00:53.309> hit<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.670> back<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
quick if I'm getting hit in the back and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.930 
quick if I'm getting hit in the back and
kill<00:00:54.600> someone<00:00:54.899> before<00:00:55.550> even<00:00:56.550> if<00:00:56.640> they've<00:00:56.760> shot

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
kill someone before even if they've shot

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.150 
kill someone before even if they've shot
at<00:00:57.090> me<00:00:57.180> first<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.320> able<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.649> play<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.980> high

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
at me first to be able to play on high

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.279 
at me first to be able to play on high
since<00:00:59.399> two<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.850> went<00:01:00.120> about<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.690> specific

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
since two is I went about it a specific

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.590 
since two is I went about it a specific
way<00:01:01.590> instead<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.579> jumping<00:01:03.000> straight<00:01:03.270> from<00:01:03.510> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
way instead of jumping straight from a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.929 
way instead of jumping straight from a
low<00:01:03.780> setting<00:01:04.140> right<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> max<00:01:05.670> or

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
low setting right up to a max or

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.940 
low setting right up to a max or
whatever<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.479> want<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:07.260> best<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.619> move<00:01:07.770> up

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
whatever you want it's best to move up

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.120 
whatever you want it's best to move up
in<00:01:08.100> small<00:01:08.430> amounts<00:01:08.850> what<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.720> mean<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.170> say<00:01:11.070> you

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
in small amounts what I mean is say you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.399 
in small amounts what I mean is say you
start<00:01:11.460> at<00:01:11.580> four<00:01:11.820> sensitivity<00:01:12.420> that's<00:01:12.960> that's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
start at four sensitivity that's that's

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.710 
start at four sensitivity that's that's
your<00:01:13.590> normal<00:01:14.240> that's<00:01:15.240> what<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.450> play<00:01:15.600> at

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
your normal that's what you play at

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.109 
your normal that's what you play at
normally<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:17.070> max<00:01:17.280> setting<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.729> 20

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
normally and the max setting is 20

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.859 
normally and the max setting is 20
putting<00:01:19.020> up<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.350> six<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.920> play<00:01:20.640> say<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> few

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
putting up to six and play say for a few

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.200 
putting up to six and play say for a few
hours<00:01:21.930> or<00:01:22.470> maybe<00:01:22.650> even<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.189> day<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.970> keep

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
hours or maybe even a day just keep

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.120 
hours or maybe even a day just keep
playing<00:01:24.420> into<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.170> setting<00:01:25.439> until

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
playing into you on that setting until

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.920 
playing into you on that setting until
you're<00:01:26.250> completely<00:01:26.400> comfortable<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.479> it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
you're completely comfortable and it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.660 
you're completely comfortable and it
feels<00:01:28.049> normal<00:01:28.380> you'll<00:01:29.130> find<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.579> have

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
feels normal you'll find that you have

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.760 
feels normal you'll find that you have
taught<00:01:29.939> your<00:01:30.090> hands<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.990> make<00:01:31.110> more<00:01:31.350> precise

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
taught your hands to make more precise

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.219 
taught your hands to make more precise
movements<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.570> easier<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.960> play

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
movements and it's just easier to play

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.100 
movements and it's just easier to play
like<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.439> now<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:34.920> actually<00:01:35.130> pretty<00:01:35.400> cool

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
like that now it's actually pretty cool

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.350 
like that now it's actually pretty cool
from<00:01:37.110> there<00:01:37.290> pull<00:01:37.920> up<00:01:38.040> another<00:01:38.220> small<00:01:38.759> amount

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
from there pull up another small amount

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.870 
from there pull up another small amount
from<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.229> example<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.070> had<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.340> six<00:01:41.670> now

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.840 
feels normal do that for a few days or
hours<00:01:49.020> depending<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:49.890> how<00:01:49.950> much<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.399> play<00:01:50.610> and

hours depending on how much you play and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.910 
hours depending on how much you play and
before<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.570> know<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.320> won't<00:01:52.500> be<00:01:52.680> able<00:01:52.770> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
move the setting up any higher because

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.929 
move the setting up any higher because
you'll<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.170> maximum<00:01:55.520> some<00:01:56.520> people<00:01:56.790> say

that they play better on low
sensitivities<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.310> might<00:01:59.490> too<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.570> by

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
sensitivities and you might too so by

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.940 
sensitivities and you might too so by

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
playing with a heap of them you'll be

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.429 
playing with a heap of them you'll be
you<00:02:02.399> will<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.759> able<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.570> properly<00:02:03.840> find<00:02:04.229> out

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
you will be able to properly find out

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.980 
you will be able to properly find out
but<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.219> me<00:02:05.369> though<00:02:05.549> high<00:02:06.270> sensitivities<00:02:06.869> are

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.169 
but for me though high sensitivities are
better<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:07.979> -<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.250> second<00:02:08.610> thing<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.849> can<00:02:08.879> do

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
better now - the second thing you can do

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.059 
better now - the second thing you can do
once<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.989> are<00:02:10.080> happy<00:02:10.259> with<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.709> movement

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069

that the top two buttons r1 and l1 used

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
to be aim and shoot because it was hard

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.190 
to be aim and shoot because it was hard
to<00:02:26.190> reach<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.880> bottom<00:02:27.000> ones<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.810> ps3

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
controls are a little bit different and

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
controls are a little bit different and
reaching<00:02:30.360> these<00:02:30.480> was<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.780> bit<00:02:30.930> harder<00:02:32.360> but<00:02:33.360> with

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
reaching these was a bit harder but with

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.460 
reaching these was a bit harder but with
the<00:02:33.660> PlayStation<00:02:34.200> 4<00:02:34.520> at<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.820> release<00:02:36.470> just

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
the PlayStation 4 at the release just

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.070 
the PlayStation 4 at the release just
like<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.800> Xbox<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.460> back<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.510> buttons<00:02:39.840> will

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
my ps4 I tried out Cod and notice that

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.610 
my ps4 I tried out Cod and notice that
sometimes<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:45.510> didn't<00:02:45.810> actually<00:02:45.960> fire<00:02:46.410> my

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
sometimes but didn't actually fire my

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.760 
sometimes but didn't actually fire my
weapon<00:02:46.700> or<00:02:47.700> if<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.090> did<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.600> was<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.780> delay<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:49.320> I

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
weapon or if I did it was a delay so I

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.880 
weapon or if I did it was a delay so I
was<00:02:50.010> just<00:02:50.610> really<00:02:50.820> bad<00:02:51.260> now<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.590> nothing

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
was just really bad now this is nothing

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.470 
was just really bad now this is nothing
to<00:02:52.980> do<00:02:53.100> with<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.310> system<00:02:53.490> or<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:53.940> controller

to do with the system or the controller

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.470 
to do with the system or the controller
just<00:02:55.170> that<00:02:55.350> as<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.620> can<00:02:55.800> see<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:57.330> back

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
just that as you can see the back

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.600 
just that as you can see the back
buttons<00:02:57.870> are<00:02:58.020> proper<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.440> trigger<00:02:58.710> they're

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
buttons are proper to trigger they're

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.950 
buttons are proper to trigger they're
not<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.880> don't<00:02:59.970> just<00:03:00.120> press<00:03:00.270> them<00:03:00.450> in<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.720> out

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
not you don't just press them in and out

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.720 
not you don't just press them in and out
they<00:03:01.050> actually<00:03:01.200> bend<00:03:01.680> all<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.920> way<00:03:02.040> down<00:03:02.310> and

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
they actually bend all the way down and

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.210 
they actually bend all the way down and
it<00:03:03.120> actually<00:03:03.240> gives<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.630> for<00:03:04.590> like<00:03:04.710> racing

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
it actually gives you for like racing

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.590 
it actually gives you for like racing
games<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.910> can<00:03:06.000> be<00:03:06.120> your<00:03:06.240> throttle

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
games that can be your throttle

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.740 
games that can be your throttle
depending<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:07.320> how<00:03:07.440> much<00:03:07.590> throttle<00:03:08.100> your<00:03:08.340> own

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
depending on how much throttle your own

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.770 
depending on how much throttle your own
so<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:10.770> problem<00:03:11.070> for<00:03:11.100> me<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.510> didn't

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
so the problem for me is that it didn't

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.010 
so the problem for me is that it didn't
register<00:03:13.020> until<00:03:13.590> about<00:03:14.490> halfway<00:03:14.840> if<00:03:15.840> you

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
register until about halfway if you

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.140 
register until about halfway if you
notice<00:03:16.320> play<00:03:16.560> play<00:03:17.010> call<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.250> duty<00:03:17.340> or<00:03:17.670> order

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
notice play play call of duty or order

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.449 
notice play play call of duty or order
the<00:03:18.239> game<00:03:18.390> go<00:03:18.959> into<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> pro<00:03:19.380> match<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.890> sit

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
the game go into a pro match and sit

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.120 
the game go into a pro match and sit
there<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:20.880> pull<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.600> in<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.010> you'll<00:03:23.010> notice

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
there and pull it in and you'll notice

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.740 
there and pull it in and you'll notice
it<00:03:23.250> doesn't<00:03:23.400> shoot<00:03:23.790> until<00:03:24.239> about<00:03:24.450> around

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
it doesn't shoot until about around

fix this problem of not being able to
shoot<00:03:43.890> because<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.340> wasn't<00:03:44.520> used<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.880> I've

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
shoot because I wasn't used to I've

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.850 
shoot because I wasn't used to I've
never<00:03:45.270> I've<00:03:45.450> never<00:03:45.780> paid<00:03:45.989> off<00:03:46.140> xbox<00:03:46.530> before

never I've never paid off xbox before

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.190 
never I've never paid off xbox before
came<00:03:47.160> straight<00:03:47.370> from<00:03:47.520> PlayStation<00:03:48.120> 3<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.570> went

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
came straight from PlayStation 3 I went

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.280 
came straight from PlayStation 3 I went
into<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.620> cool<00:03:49.920> of<00:03:50.040> Duty<00:03:50.340> settings<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:52.200> do

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
into the cool of Duty settings you do

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.500 
into the cool of Duty settings you do
have<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.470> go<00:03:52.590> settings<00:03:52.890> actually<00:03:53.010> first<00:03:53.450> go<00:03:54.450> to

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
have to go settings actually first go to

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.470 
have to go settings actually first go to
options<00:03:55.190> controller<00:03:56.190> layout<00:03:56.520> or<00:03:56.910> some<00:03:57.270> one<00:03:57.390> of

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
options controller layout or some one of

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.699 
options controller layout or some one of
them<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:58.130> change<00:03:59.130> it<00:03:59.370> until<00:03:59.870> these<00:04:00.870> two<00:04:00.930> swap

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
them and change it until these two swap

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.949 
them and change it until these two swap
so<00:04:02.610> just<00:04:02.820> like<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.090> PlayStation<00:04:03.330> 3

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
so just like the PlayStation 3

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.850 
so just like the PlayStation 3
controller<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:05.160> want<00:04:05.310> shoot<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.910> be<00:04:05.940> ar-15<00:04:06.860> to

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
controller you want shoot to be ar-15 to

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.150 
controller you want shoot to be ar-15 to
be<00:04:07.950> old<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.489> can<00:04:08.850> scope<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.420> l1<00:04:09.890> and<00:04:10.890> shoot

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
be old I can scope to the l1 and shoot

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.259 
be old I can scope to the l1 and shoot
to<00:04:11.310> be<00:04:11.430> r1<00:04:12.110> now<00:04:13.580> some<00:04:14.580> people<00:04:14.700> may<00:04:14.940> not<00:04:15.000> like<00:04:15.239> it

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
to be r1 now some people may not like it

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.330 
to be r1 now some people may not like it
but<00:04:15.450> for<00:04:15.630> me<00:04:15.900> as<00:04:16.260> soon<00:04:16.590> as<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.859> change<00:04:16.890> it<00:04:17.250> back

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
but for me as soon as I change it back

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.159 
but for me as soon as I change it back
to<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:17.940> felt<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:18.720> much<00:04:18.750> more<00:04:18.959> comfortable

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
to that I felt so much more comfortable

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.710 
to that I felt so much more comfortable
I<00:04:19.799> think<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.640> reason<00:04:20.940> why<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.120> helps<00:04:21.359> is

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
I think the reason why it helps is

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.310 
I think the reason why it helps is
because<00:04:22.289> when<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.190> bottom<00:04:23.490> 2<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:23.880> shoot<00:04:24.320> your

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
because when the bottom 2 is shoot your

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.180 
because when the bottom 2 is shoot your
hand<00:04:25.590> is<00:04:25.890> kind<00:04:26.160> of

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
hand is kind of

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.430 
hand is kind of
I<00:04:27.220> guess<00:04:27.880> that<00:04:28.060> kind<00:04:28.300> of<00:04:28.360> leans<00:04:28.660> forward<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:29.290> bit

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
I guess that kind of leans forward a bit

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.730 
I guess that kind of leans forward a bit
but<00:04:30.280> if<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.550> top<00:04:30.730> ones<00:04:30.940> are<00:04:31.030> shoot<00:04:31.620> for<00:04:32.620> me

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
but if the top ones are shoot for me

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.430 
but if the top ones are shoot for me
personally<00:04:33.010> I<00:04:33.630> bring<00:04:34.630> my<00:04:34.750> hands<00:04:35.050> up<00:04:35.140> a<00:04:35.230> little

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
personally I bring my hands up a little

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.410 
personally I bring my hands up a little
bit<00:04:35.560> this<00:04:36.490> is<00:04:36.640> just<00:04:36.790> a<00:04:36.880> little<00:04:37.150> bit<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.360> the

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
bit this is just a little bit and the

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.260 
bit this is just a little bit and the
risk<00:04:37.630> with<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:38.200> little<00:04:38.530> bit<00:04:38.620> more<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:38.950> it<00:04:39.880> makes

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
risk with a little bit more and it makes

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.300 
risk with a little bit more and it makes
it<00:04:40.420> easy<00:04:40.540> for<00:04:40.780> me<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:40.930> aim<00:04:41.170> as<00:04:41.410> well<00:04:41.590> that's

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
it easy for me to aim as well that's

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.650 
it easy for me to aim as well that's
what<00:04:42.490> I<00:04:42.520> mean<00:04:42.670> by<00:04:42.730> physically<00:04:43.270> holding<00:04:43.540> the

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
what I mean by physically holding the

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.870 
what I mean by physically holding the
controller<00:04:43.990> all<00:04:44.500> you<00:04:44.620> really<00:04:44.800> do<00:04:45.070> is<00:04:45.310> change

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
controller all you really do is change

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.340 
controller all you really do is change
the<00:04:46.000> settings<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.480> these<00:04:46.840> ones<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.260> your

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
the settings to these ones and your

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.980 
the settings to these ones and your
handle<00:04:47.740> adjust<00:04:48.130> to<00:04:48.940> make<00:04:49.120> because<00:04:49.810> you're

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
handle adjust to make because you're

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.990 
handle adjust to make because you're
wise<00:04:50.080> using<00:04:50.380> the<00:04:50.470> top<00:04:50.620> buttons<00:04:50.920> most<00:04:51.220> make<00:04:51.880> it

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
wise using the top buttons most make it

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.090 
wise using the top buttons most make it
easy<00:04:52.180> for<00:04:52.300> yourself<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:53.200> click<00:04:53.410> them<00:04:53.560> your

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
easy for yourself to click them your

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.770 
easy for yourself to click them your
wrist<00:04:54.310> will<00:04:54.490> just<00:04:54.610> automatically<00:04:55.150> curve<00:04:55.450> up<00:04:55.660> a

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
wrist will just automatically curve up a

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.020 
wrist will just automatically curve up a
bit<00:04:55.930> may<00:04:56.530> feel<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.800> little<00:04:57.160> bit<00:04:57.280> odd<00:04:57.460> at<00:04:57.670> start

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
bit may feel a little bit odd at start

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.460 
bit may feel a little bit odd at start
because<00:04:58.630> you're<00:04:58.750> not<00:04:58.840> used<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.020> holding<00:04:59.230> it

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
because you're not used to holding it

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.010 
because you're not used to holding it
exactly<00:05:00.070> like<00:05:00.280> that<00:05:00.310> but<00:05:01.270> try<00:05:01.480> it<00:05:01.540> out<00:05:01.690> anyway

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
exactly like that but try it out anyway

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.830 
exactly like that but try it out anyway
so<00:05:02.620> test<00:05:03.310> these<00:05:03.460> out<00:05:03.610> for<00:05:03.790> bet<00:05:03.970> now<00:05:04.150> so<00:05:04.510> you<00:05:04.600> get

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
so test these out for bet now so you get

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.570 
so test these out for bet now so you get
comfortable<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.500> then<00:05:05.680> see<00:05:05.890> how<00:05:06.070> you<00:05:06.100> go

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
comfortable and then see how you go

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.360 
comfortable and then see how you go
try<00:05:07.090> not<00:05:07.300> to<00:05:07.330> be<00:05:07.860> trying<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:08.980> hold<00:05:09.190> the

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
try not to be trying to hold the

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.820 
try not to be trying to hold the
controller<00:05:09.760> differently<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.360> shoot<00:05:10.570> up<00:05:11.560> here

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
controller differently and shoot up here

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.130 
controller differently and shoot up here
and<00:05:12.270> changing<00:05:13.270> the<00:05:13.390> in-game<00:05:13.690> things<00:05:13.960> because

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
and changing the in-game things because

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.840 
and changing the in-game things because
that<00:05:14.200> would<00:05:14.320> make<00:05:14.440> it<00:05:14.590> super<00:05:15.040> difficult<00:05:15.220> and
