00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.219
 this morning 

00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:02.830
 a new one has been presented 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:03.870
 oenology 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.530
 for cars it's about the teams 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.670
 glp 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.670
 the translation literally are cáceres 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.650
 of oil or canal + to the first Spanish concessionaire that has 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.679
 Incorporated 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.339
 this equipment this new technology 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.839
 in his cars he has done it to start 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.479
 in the opel flagship this technology so that you get an idea without a little 

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:31.820
 Generally speaking in the factory the manufacturer expolan de esparta 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:34.100
 manufacturers 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.510
 and then they distribute it exclusively in our country through 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.610
 who is responsible for distributing this new technology as we say in 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.340
 our country bonet does not work only with apple works also with other 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.090
 brands 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.900
 of cars but in this case 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.750
 and more specifically copel high so the first dealer to incorporate the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.860
 GLP equipment of which today we are talking about the great benefits as well 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.990
 A boat soon we have to tell you that it is a technology or fuel 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.020
 cheap and above all more ecological something that also becomes quite important 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.970
 In these times I am going to present alis mounts, which is the 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.870
 responsible for after sales of opel al tuzsa good afternoon luis and did not know distant 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.970
 personally and I did not know who was who 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.840
 and alvaro bernal who is the general manager of bonnet that spain I have 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.800
 said and emotional the ending had a little bit of fear and with the theme this one the 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.720
 manufacturer of the island company that distributes it n the automobile brand that 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.679
 critically to the incorporates but good 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.509
 we are going home and we have 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.479
 three day keys since it is the manufacturer we made direct dutch bonet which is 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.069
 the company that distributes it in spain and opel this case phelan tusa that if the 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.299
 first dealer to incorporate such good technology let's talk about a whole 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.050
 we're going to start 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.690
 first for him by the beginning not how much time does this 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.440
 Dutch manufacturer and yesterday 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.770
 has developed this fuel tglt this new technology this manufacturer 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.740
 since you started you are a consecutive tightening and 10 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.550
 the year 1900 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.319
 2 yes of 67 70 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.890
 cilic than at a European level and it is a technology that is quite 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.029
 consolidated 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.029
 what happens is that Spain for a series of fiscal reasons and so on 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.089
 it does not start does not change legilación this year 2004 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.089
 and now that's when you start to incorporate the vehicles 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:27.879
 muneta is instructing exclusively that our country is going is correct is the 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.709
 first time the glp arrives 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.790
 until Spain the fdp is already counting but we go with another type of 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.719
 technology 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:39.449
 The fundamental difference is that already read from the leading company at 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:40.979
 technological in the world 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:45.859
 and what he does to what the difference is that the gas then indicates in liquid form 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:46.719
 in the engine 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:51.250
 one which does not lose any power but quite the opposite to the kun and 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.369
 geo mentor in vehicle benefits 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:57.399
 apart from lugo to advantages that implies the use of gas 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:01.419
 because it is much cheaper or is the price of a liter of gas because it is 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:02.469
 order of half 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:04.469
 of the liter of gasoline 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.699
 and the consumption because it is said superiorly efe that supposes a saving 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:12.149
 on the order of 40% with respect to 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:17.429
 adapt it to the cost they have that the endemic has with the gasoline min apple has 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:19.629
 been a pioneer brand in incorporating 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.009
 this type of system asus automobiles asked low gutter 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.819
 now also with other automotive brands 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.519
 came in if we should know that after signing this agreement with 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:31.139
 viale 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.539
 We put your weight in your sixth in Spain 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:37.339
 in the great advantage we have is that we can cleverly work with all 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:38.079
 brands 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.889
 normal is to say that 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.959
 and here I puncture the marker because there is none we can cultivate before the 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.049
 all of the engines that there is now the only thing unclogging 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.299
 because there was a vehicle user who does not say he has a vehicle that 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:52.959
 wants 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.989
 incorporates glp and then we select the appropriate configuration 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.549
 and I'm going to because this gentlemen are responsible for hosting and doing this 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.759
 nation because the subject possesses are relatively simple for a man 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:05.439
 who knows 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.440
 let's see therefore alves as it is full in the first place 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.050
 is a glp team how could we define it speak the team glp if the ces 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.220
 some components 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.220
 that we add let's say to the vehicle that the vehicle is a gasoline engine 

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.709
 which is a team of glp because previous price that is a deposit of 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.499
 gas 

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:24.939
 quilmes de chagas the completely independent gasoline 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:28.789
 It is carried by a pressure regulator that keeps five pressure bars 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.430
 some injectors and a control unit 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.870
 nothing else came out 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.469
 then what does 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:39.059
 the gas itself stoves for example in the vehicle are on gasoline 

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:42.339
 no I do not know a switch box switch automatically the car 

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:45.599
 it starts to work in cash had to stop the vehicle or do anything 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.370
 after just pressing a button is a button 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.300
 and something insane past a question in the poll and for example in the 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.370
 presentation be opel badge 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.120
 percent the car through which this new equipment has been presented 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.509
 do not 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:01.529
 he asked is a car is that they come from dni factory 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.139
 in the past and it has cost us to get gasoline food 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.900
 at the moment the jeep that could be incorporated to cars what 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.490
 e that works with gasoline or those that defend cain with waste from 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.900
 alleged model of gasoline granado that we have had to 90 and without it 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.000
 but we are riding tamin opel corsa novels cantor models 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.580
 that are gasoline you can plant your lineage male tables moment 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.879
 well more little things that is what components this engine has 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:30.030
 exactly like the mountains the very simple mounting to the drift 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.919
 where the spare wheel hole goes 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.120
 sinde where we put what is the deposit is not a round demerit 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.960
 maybe the key because you get the deposed 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.979
 made out of fuel 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.139
 that carry two pipes to the engine 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.740
 carries what is an engine unit that is the one that regulates a little the injection 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.210
 what are the injectors patiño hector exponent in the cylinders and then the 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.020
 engine unit and the pressure regulator nothing else then but as you 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.729
 I say by car whenever you start 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.479
 without gas canyon 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.439
 you start the engine starts in gasoline automatically live 5 6 seconds 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:04.800
 that changed there are less discuss mequetrefes vomiting we will do where has 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.270
 then placed the entire varela deposit 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.479
 Efe filling mouth 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.749
 the mouth that carries a safety valve 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:11.830
 anti-return 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.019
 that there is no danger that Garmin escape we won a return assessment 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.349
 this takes what is the deposit that goes in the trunk 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:21.610
 what barbarian that the spare wheel constantly what has to be the 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.229
 same 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:25.800
 filling mouth session 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.339
 by the front of the engine 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:31.329
 what is good inside the cabin carries what was attempted 

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:33.620
 nothing more to change gas gas 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.410
 because they are at home that remains without a gas breaker and the car without 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.800
 gasoil walking perfectly the same and to refuel the process is absolute 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.219
 baltazar minority if they have changed 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:45.680
 We carry normal gasoline chain have in the vehicle 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.930
 and then the mouth full of gas that sun a normal subsidy and not refuel 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.419
 gas and even know my name not 'good and in the presentation to see a part 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:57.220
 theoretical and also a practical part we had the opportunity to get up 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.040
 to one of these cars and check how was the driving driving in 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.160
 gasoline and driving the glp mode let's see it
