because if you want to you can do it

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.460 
because if you want to you can do it
this<00:02:44.740> way<00:02:45.390> because<00:02:46.390> i<00:02:46.750> hear<00:02:47.050> either<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:47.380> the

this way because i hear either in the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.550 
this way because i hear either in the
guitar<00:02:47.970> negatory<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.840> fluid<00:02:50.230> which<00:02:50.380> would

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
guitar negatory and a fluid which would

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.130

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
make it a gene my major 7 chord so

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.350 
make it a gene my major 7 chord so
there's<00:02:53.320> kind<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.590> an<00:02:53.710> F<00:02:53.980> mixed<00:02:54.490> in<00:02:54.640> there<00:02:54.670> but

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
there's kind of an F mixed in there but

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.090 
there's kind of an F mixed in there but
you<00:02:55.480> may<00:02:55.660> want<00:02:56.050> with<00:02:56.260> your<00:02:56.380> ear<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.770> hear<00:02:56.920> that

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
if you want to do with the F then we've

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.860 
if you want to do with the F then we've
ever<00:03:08.160> try<00:03:09.160> this<00:03:09.190> beam<00:03:09.730> black<00:03:10.060> beans<00:03:10.360> wipe<00:03:10.570> in

ever try this beam black beans wipe in

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.410 
ever try this beam black beans wipe in
one<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.500> then<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.740> app<00:03:11.950> on<00:03:12.190> top<00:03:12.520> so<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.120> you

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
one and then the app on top so that you

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.120 
one and then the app on top so that you
would<00:03:13.600> substitute<00:03:14.230> what<00:03:14.590> I'm<00:03:14.680> playing<00:03:14.950> right

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
would substitute what I'm playing right

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.479 
would substitute what I'm playing right
here<00:03:15.400> for<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.239> we<00:03:17.200> like<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.590> major<00:03:17.890> 7th

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
here for that we like that major 7th

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:25.530 
here for that we like that major 7th
chord<00:03:18.520> in<00:03:18.820> there<00:03:21.480> ok<00:03:22.480> or

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.720 

leave<00:03:26.140> that<00:03:26.170> up<00:03:26.439> to<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:27.010> then<00:03:27.310> we<00:03:27.489> have

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
leave that up to you and then we have

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.420 
leave that up to you and then we have
been<00:03:28.540> flattened<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.829> reason<00:03:30.189> there's<00:03:30.370> a

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
been flattened and the reason there's a

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.640 
been flattened and the reason there's a
a<00:03:30.909> choice<00:03:31.780> there's<00:03:32.079> because<00:03:32.379> you<00:03:32.469> have<00:03:32.560> the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
a choice there's because you have the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.319 
a choice there's because you have the
guitar<00:03:32.769> in<00:03:33.189> there<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:34.049> doing<00:03:35.049> that<00:03:35.170> major<00:03:35.409> 7<00:03:35.920> so

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
guitar in there to doing that major 7 so

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.539 
guitar in there to doing that major 7 so
there<00:03:37.329> is<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.569> personal<00:03:38.409> choice<00:03:38.500> here<00:03:38.920> if<00:03:39.400> i

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
there is a personal choice here if i

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.750 
there is a personal choice here if i
define<00:03:40.000> G<00:03:40.239> flat<00:03:40.510> 2<00:03:40.840> times<00:03:41.140> 12<00:03:41.680> then<00:03:42.670> we're

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
define G flat 2 times 12 then we're

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.089 
define G flat 2 times 12 then we're
going<00:03:42.849> to<00:03:42.909> go<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.060> B<00:03:43.269> flat<00:03:43.510> D<00:03:43.569> flat<00:03:43.780> F<00:03:44.319> 2<00:03:44.799> times

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
reach out to split the top three okay

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.099 
reach out to split the top three okay
let<00:04:00.040> want<00:04:00.670> be<00:04:01.120> noticeable<00:04:01.659> with<00:04:01.750> your<00:04:01.870> hear

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
that much if you let that be flat out

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:11.879 
that much if you let that be flat out
left<00:04:04.959> hand<00:04:05.200> G<00:04:05.379> flat<00:04:05.560> octave<00:04:10.500> knock<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.680> there

so<00:04:12.340> we<00:04:12.489> have<00:04:12.790> three<00:04:13.239> little<00:04:13.870> phrases<00:04:14.349> here<00:04:14.919> and

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
so we have three little phrases here and

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.770 
so we have three little phrases here and
you<00:04:15.549> have<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.819> little<00:04:15.970> space<00:04:16.239> in<00:04:16.299> between<00:04:16.539> each

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
you have a little space in between each

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:29.380 
you have a little space in between each
one<00:04:17.169> so

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.340 

ok<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.740> next<00:04:30.770> thing<00:04:31.040> she's<00:04:31.580> singing<00:04:32.090> with<00:04:33.050> the

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
ok the next thing she's singing with the

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.510 
ok the next thing she's singing with the
same<00:04:33.590> chord<00:04:33.860> progression<00:04:34.280> but<00:04:34.370> it's

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
same chord progression but it's

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.800 
same chord progression but it's
different<00:04:34.730> notes<00:04:35.030> on<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.300> top<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:35.690> then

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
different notes on the top and then
