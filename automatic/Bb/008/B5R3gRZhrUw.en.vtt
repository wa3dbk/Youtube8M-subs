field guide to corporate life I think

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.590 
field guide to corporate life I think
that<00:00:15.809> companies<00:00:16.379> have<00:00:16.710> become<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:17.340> lot<00:00:17.520> less

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
that companies have become a lot less

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.960 
that companies have become a lot less
tolerant<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.750> some<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.010> bad<00:00:20.310> habits<00:00:20.820> that

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
tolerant of some of the bad habits that

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.750 
tolerant of some of the bad habits that
people<00:00:21.570> get<00:00:21.689> into<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.680> world<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.609> good

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
people get into the world the good

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.380 
people get into the world the good
example<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.449> would<00:00:24.660> be<00:00:26.060> corporate<00:00:27.060> speak

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
example of that would be corporate speak

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.359 
example of that would be corporate speak
I<00:00:27.689> think<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.439> there's<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.680> limited<00:00:29.039> amount<00:00:29.189> of

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
I think that there's a limited amount of

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.759 
I think that there's a limited amount of
tolerance<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.269> kind<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.289> buzzword

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
tolerance for that kind of buzzword

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.940 
tolerance for that kind of buzzword
early<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.189> think<00:00:32.489> people<00:00:33.000> are<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.950> innovated

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
early I think people are so innovated

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.389 
early I think people are so innovated
with<00:00:35.100> information<00:00:36.000> now<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:37.370> become<00:00:38.370> a

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
with information now that this become a

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.430 
with information now that this become a
premium<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.480> be<00:00:39.600> able<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.930> communicate

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
premium to be able to communicate

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.490 
premium to be able to communicate
clearly<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.370> concisely<00:00:42.059> well<00:00:42.930> actually

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
clearly and concisely well actually

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.290 
clearly and concisely well actually
whenever<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.890> go<00:00:44.100> through<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> trade<00:00:44.879> show<00:00:45.090> like

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
whenever I go through a trade show like

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.650 
whenever I go through a trade show like
this<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.750> look<00:00:45.989> at<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.200> booth<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.789> see<00:00:48.149> two

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
this I look at the booth and I see two

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.010 
this I look at the booth and I see two
things<00:00:48.690> come<00:00:49.379> what<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.780> statements<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.899> are

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
things come what is statements that are

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.340 
things come what is statements that are
so<00:00:52.289> generic<00:00:52.610> that<00:00:53.610> nobody<00:00:54.210> would<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:55.199> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
so generic that nobody would that you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.350 
so generic that nobody would that you
they<00:00:55.530> don't<00:00:55.649> differentiate<00:00:56.100> them<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.579> all<00:00:56.699> or

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
they don't differentiate them at all or

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.990 
they don't differentiate them at all or
a<00:00:57.930> long<00:00:58.530> list<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.949> features<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.520> functions

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
a long list of features and functions

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.229 
a long list of features and functions
which<00:01:00.809> where<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:01.829> almost<00:01:02.219> impossible<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
which where it's almost impossible for a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.990 
which where it's almost impossible for a
customer<00:01:03.870> or<00:01:04.170> someone<00:01:04.890> who's<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.250> intimately

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
customer or someone who's not intimately

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.460 
customer or someone who's not intimately
familiar<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> technology<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
familiar with the technology to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.010 
familiar with the technology to
understand<00:01:07.920> why<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:09.180> would<00:01:09.330> even<00:01:09.450> want<00:01:09.780> that

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
understand why they would even want that

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.170 
understand why they would even want that
but<00:01:10.439> what<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.010> very<00:01:11.310> interesting<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.060> I

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
but what is very interesting is that I

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.390 
but what is very interesting is that I
ask<00:01:12.390> people<00:01:12.570> while<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:13.680> talking<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> some

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
ask people while I was talking to some

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.340 
ask people while I was talking to some
of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> people<00:01:14.850> at<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> conference<00:01:15.210> here<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
of the people at the conference here to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.620 
of the people at the conference here to
get<00:01:16.530> them<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.920> start<00:01:17.189> thinking<00:01:17.250> about<00:01:17.759> what

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
get them to start thinking about what

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.300 
get them to start thinking about what
they<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.840> from<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.200> customer's<00:01:19.619> viewpoint<00:01:20.100> I

we're able to come up with a one

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.170 
we're able to come up with a one
sentence<00:01:34.229> line<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.400> their<00:01:35.610> product<00:01:36.060> was

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
found is that almost every sales message

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.830 
found is that almost every sales message
that<00:01:41.189> sent<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.640> falls<00:01:42.180> into<00:01:42.450> those<00:01:42.689> two

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that sent out falls into those two

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.289 
that sent out falls into those two
categories<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.530> see<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> right<00:01:44.180> string<00:01:45.180> of

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
categories to see the right string of

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.060 
categories to see the right string of
this<00:01:45.509> blab<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> list<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.619> features<00:01:46.770> or

functions

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.120 
functions
and<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.630> almost<00:01:48.780> always<00:01:49.079> reduce<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.979> down

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and I can almost always reduce it down

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.219 
and I can almost always reduce it down
to<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.820> statement<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.359> what<00:01:51.539> the<00:01:51.570> customer<00:01:52.170> is

to one statement of what the customer is
going<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.530> get<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:53.280> statement<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.880> why<00:01:54.060> this

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
going to get one statement of why this

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.090 
going to get one statement of why this
is<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.659> different<00:01:55.200> company<00:01:55.469> why<00:01:55.679> they<00:01:55.859> do<00:01:55.979> it

primarily it's because they have an
insight<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.119> looking<00:02:00.450> common<00:02:00.840> perspective

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.180 
look would see it and then they end up
hanging<00:02:12.870> out<00:02:13.080> with<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.260> lot<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.590> other<00:02:13.709> vendors

successful<00:02:53.180> salespeople<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.540> think<00:02:54.750> have<00:02:54.840> to

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
successful salespeople I think have to

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.780 
successful salespeople I think have to
be<00:02:55.109> very<00:02:55.319> good<00:02:55.530> at<00:02:55.650> articulating<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.489> and

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
be very good at articulating that and

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.849 
be very good at articulating that and
primarily<00:02:57.600> because<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.410> don't<00:02:58.590> think<00:02:58.650> they're

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
primarily because I don't think they're

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.530 
primarily because I don't think they're
getting<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.250> much<00:02:59.489> support<00:02:59.940> for<00:03:00.090> marketing

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
getting that much support for marketing

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.599 
getting that much support for marketing
what<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:00.989> see<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> lot<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.799> that<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.069> marketing

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
what I see a lot is that the marketing

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.339 
what I see a lot is that the marketing
people<00:03:02.790> have<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.150> insight<00:03:03.599> looking<00:03:03.959> up<00:03:04.109> the

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
people have this insight looking up the

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.750 
people have this insight looking up the
sales<00:03:04.590> people<00:03:04.829> kind<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.370> look<00:03:05.549> at<00:03:05.639> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
sales people kind of look at the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.430 
sales people kind of look at the
messages<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.569> marketing<00:03:06.959> people<00:03:07.109> write

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
messages that the marketing people write

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.430 
messages that the marketing people write
and<00:03:07.680> sort<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:07.950> scratch<00:03:08.220> their<00:03:08.459> heads<00:03:08.639> go<00:03:08.910> gee<00:03:09.810> I

and sort of scratch their heads go gee I

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.190 
and sort of scratch their heads go gee I
guess<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.790> then<00:03:12.569> they<00:03:12.720> were<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:12.900> trying<00:03:13.109> to
