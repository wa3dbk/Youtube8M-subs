00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.070
 I am now on the way miriam 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.050
 to pick up Höller and we will 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.279
 Together, cooking a beautiful 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.570
 explore sylt island 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.949
 I have to honestly say that I am from 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.630
 the island itself is not so much 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.130
 I have seen every time I am here 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.140
 then skydiving is in my place 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.300
 foreground and now just like that 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.110
 Cruising over the island there I am 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.110
 really very curious 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.720
 I am here with me and say here 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.680
 just sylt knows about the environment 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.140
 here and from the landscape of the 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.910
 indescribable I would call myself 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.190
 I actually do daddy and write 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.810
 currently everything I enjoy and 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.700
 the things that I do I do 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.350
 Of course, for the most part for 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.760
 my offspring is acting mother 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.650
 actually has a similar for me 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.420
 put value because my heart is completely 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.280
 off so that what makes fun of me 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.320
 That's how I want to be an all-rounder 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.970
 see the highway is indeed general 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.860
 I'm so special 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.090
 thing I believe I connect a lot 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.530
 so because you just simply very 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.780
 Spends a lot of time in the car 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.670
 live drive a car or car to 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.300
 it seems special form yes on 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.610
 every case 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.780
 Driving is already there for me 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.220
 feeling of freedom on 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.119
 but you can determine when de los 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.119
 are you going to come home? 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.030
 the work still to climb 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.810
 important for me is in the mode if 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.770
 I just get in the car that is for 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.880
 situation fits 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.430
 I have this outfit for you 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.110
 chosen because I thought so 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.110
 bit cheeky paper ago 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.880
 the water i would grilled 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.680
 hunger wish you a good appetite 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.680
 and have fun on the island 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.830
 Driving a car is a way of life for me 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.390
 lifestyle white is very special 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.590
 moments for me now, for example 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.430
 even with my daughter if we are too 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.200
 drive a car 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.750
 one hears together music man albert 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.220
 together around you will notice again small 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.480
 people assume he is getting bigger 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.490
 At some point , the child seat is also 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.290
 leave out so things that takes you so 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.580
 it just happens a lot 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:11.090
 car one takes things also completely 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:12.480
 something else was important when 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.860
 driving music 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.099

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.110

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.140
 few classics 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:29.790
 that makes sense the interesting 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.620
 the weekend was really that we the 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.590
 have experienced the north sea as it is 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.129
 with all its facets rainstorm wind 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.200
 Sun 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.819
 we could really enjoy everything and 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.400
 experience what were your highlight 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.629
 So I had to say my highlights 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.079
 of course the wonderful talks 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.269
 we had 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.560

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.360
 now this gigantic weather still 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.780
 So there are no wishes left open 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.549

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.160
