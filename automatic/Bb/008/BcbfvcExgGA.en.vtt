00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
guys how to create a cool 3d looking

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.129 
guys how to create a cool 3d looking
flag<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.490> cinema<00:00:14.849> 4d<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.480> also<00:00:15.870> how<00:00:16.109> to

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
flag in cinema 4d and also how to

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.439 
flag in cinema 4d and also how to
animate<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.010> look<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.550> make<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.119> look

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
animate it and look it and make it look

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.630 
animate it and look it and make it look
like<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.800> know<00:00:19.920> like<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.220> winds<00:00:20.490> hitting

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
like the you know like the winds hitting

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.570 
like the you know like the winds hitting
it<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.060> causing<00:00:21.720> some<00:00:21.990> turbulence<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.769> you

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
it and causing some turbulence and you

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.529 
it and causing some turbulence and you
know<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:23.880> making<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.240> look<00:00:24.359> pretty

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
know just making it look pretty

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.200 
know just making it look pretty
realistic<00:00:25.010> basically<00:00:26.010> taking<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.369> 2d<00:00:26.760> image<00:00:27.060> of

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
realistic basically taking a 2d image of

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.429 
realistic basically taking a 2d image of
a<00:00:27.300> flag<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.039> making<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.189> look<00:00:29.369> 3d<00:00:29.849> by

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
a flag and making it look 3d by

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.160 
a flag and making it look 3d by
animating<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.710> causing<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> move<00:00:32.399> so

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
animating it and causing it to move so

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.660 
animating it and causing it to move so
with<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.290> said<00:00:34.559> basically<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.460> I'm<00:00:35.550> going

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
with that said basically what I'm going

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.940 
with that said basically what I'm going
to<00:00:35.730> first<00:00:35.910> off<00:00:36.300> show<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.870> how<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.590> just

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
to first off show you how to do is just

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.030 
to first off show you how to do is just
the<00:00:38.430> basics<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.239> khalil<00:00:39.510> tag<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.200> what<00:00:40.890> it

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the basics of the khalil tag and what it

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.779 
the basics of the khalil tag and what it
does<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.489> dynamics<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.180> stuff<00:00:42.300> like<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.629> so

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
does and dynamics and stuff like that so

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.100 
does and dynamics and stuff like that so
first<00:00:44.789> off<00:00:45.090> before<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.600> into<00:00:45.780> making<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
first off before we get into making the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.600 
first off before we get into making the
flag<00:00:46.350> I'm<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.010> go<00:00:47.160> over<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
flag I'm just going to go over here to a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.729 
flag I'm just going to go over here to a
sphere<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.300> go<00:00:48.930> over<00:00:49.140> here<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.440> also<00:00:50.329> make<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
sphere and go over here and also make a

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.330 
sphere and go over here and also make a
plane<00:00:53.570> you<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.719> do<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:55.230> any<00:00:55.379> object

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
plane you can do this with any object

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.180 
plane you can do this with any object
from<00:00:56.579> here<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.329> with<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.739> cube<00:00:58.739> or

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
from here you can do it with a cube or

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.430 
from here you can do it with a cube or
anything<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.210> doesn't<00:01:00.420> really<00:01:00.510> matter<00:01:00.750> but

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
anything it doesn't really matter but

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.689 
anything it doesn't really matter but
I'm<00:01:01.530> gonna<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.980> sphere<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.579> I'm

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
I'm gonna do it with a sphere so I'm

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.799 
I'm gonna do it with a sphere so I'm
going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> go<00:01:02.940> over<00:01:02.969> here<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> plane<00:01:03.539> and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
going to go over here to the plane and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.450 
going to go over here to the plane and
I'm<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.170> to

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
I'm going to

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.310 
I'm going to
first<00:01:06.150> I'm<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.540> go<00:01:06.659> over<00:01:06.870> to<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> plane

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
first I'm going to go over to the plane

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.050 
first I'm going to go over to the plane
and<00:01:07.590> make<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.860> edible<00:01:08.159> by<00:01:08.610> either<00:01:08.790> clicking

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
and make it edible by either clicking

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.539 
and make it edible by either clicking
see<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> plane<00:01:09.990> selected<00:01:10.470> or<00:01:10.650> by<00:01:10.920> going

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
see with a plane selected or by going

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.070 
see with a plane selected or by going
over<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.030> left<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.479> clicking<00:01:12.960> on

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
over here to the left and clicking on

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.200 
over here to the left and clicking on
the<00:01:13.229> two<00:01:13.380> spheres<00:01:13.820> now<00:01:14.820> I'm<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.060> go<00:01:15.119> over

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the two spheres now I'm going to go over

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.960 
the two spheres now I'm going to go over
here<00:01:15.300> to<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> cliff<00:01:15.630> filled<00:01:15.840> tag<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.440> choose

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.480 
here to the cliff filled tag and choose
cloth<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.840> fear<00:01:19.259> I'm<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
cloth and then it's fear I'm going to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.800 
cloth and then it's fear I'm going to
right<00:01:20.640> click<00:01:20.670> go<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.210> cliff<00:01:21.360> filled<00:01:21.570> tag

right click go to the cliff filled tag

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.010 
right click go to the cliff filled tag
and<00:01:22.110> choose<00:01:22.490> Collider<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.600> press<00:01:24.840> play

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
and choose Collider now if I press play

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.450 
and choose Collider now if I press play
you<00:01:25.140> will<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.649> cloth<00:01:25.860> will<00:01:26.100> fall<00:01:26.310> down

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
you will see the cloth will fall down

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.420 
you will see the cloth will fall down
and<00:01:26.729> wrap<00:01:26.909> around<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:27.270> sphere<00:01:28.159> if<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.280> go<00:01:29.369> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and wrap around the sphere if you go to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.520 
and wrap around the sphere if you go to
the<00:01:29.550> plane<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the plane and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.590 
the plane and
before<00:01:32.190> you<00:01:32.340> make<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.700> editable<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.480> can

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
before you make it editable you can

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.690 
before you make it editable you can
always<00:01:33.750> change<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.410> segments<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.520> will

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
always change the segments and it will

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.350 
always change the segments and it will
appear

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
appear

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.640 
appear
you<00:01:36.690> know<00:01:36.780> these<00:01:36.990> squares<00:01:37.290> will<00:01:37.440> be<00:01:37.530> much

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
you know these squares will be much

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.620 
you know these squares will be much
smaller<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.700> overall<00:01:38.940> render<00:01:39.390> will<00:01:39.510> be

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
smaller and the overall render will be

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.680 
smaller and the overall render will be
much<00:01:39.780> smoother<00:01:40.490> but<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.090> that's<00:01:42.270> basically

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
much smoother but so that's basically

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.680 
much smoother but so that's basically
the<00:01:43.590> basics<00:01:44.010> of<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.190> cloth<00:01:44.340> fill<00:01:44.490> tag<00:01:44.760> you

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
the basics of the cloth fill tag you

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.630 
the basics of the cloth fill tag you
have<00:01:45.840> all<00:01:46.020> these<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:47.220> know<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.370> have<00:01:47.550> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
have all these you know you have the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.070 
have all these you know you have the
gravity<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.150> can<00:01:48.180> make<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.510> move<00:01:48.660> you<00:01:48.960> can

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
gravity you can make it move you can

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.390 
gravity you can make it move you can
make<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.260> fall<00:01:49.440> fast<00:01:49.740> or<00:01:50.010> you<00:01:50.160> can<00:01:50.280> make<00:01:50.369> it

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
make it fall fast or you can make it

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.780 
make it fall fast or you can make it
float<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:51.770> it's<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:53.100> all<00:01:53.310> up<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.790> so

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
float up it's it's all up to you so

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.220 
float up it's it's all up to you so
now<00:01:56.270> we're<00:01:56.390> going<00:01:56.480> to<00:01:56.540> move<00:01:56.660> on<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:56.990> flag

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
now we're going to move on to the flag

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.870 
now we're going to move on to the flag
so<00:01:57.770> for<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.010> flag<00:01:58.220> what<00:01:58.400> we're<00:01:58.520> going<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:58.700> do

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
so for the flag what we're going to do

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.100 
so for the flag what we're going to do
is<00:01:59.060> we're<00:01:59.240> just<00:01:59.270> going<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.570> go<00:01:59.720> over<00:01:59.900> here<00:02:00.050> to

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
is we're just going to go over here to

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.380 
is we're just going to go over here to
the<00:02:00.560> plane<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.760> we're<00:02:01.880> going<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.030> start<00:02:02.240> off

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
the plane and we're going to start off

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.960 
the plane and we're going to start off
by<00:02:02.980> rotating<00:02:03.980> at<00:02:04.070> 90<00:02:04.400> degrees<00:02:04.700> straight<00:02:05.030> up

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.560 

and<00:02:09.090> we'll<00:02:10.020> just<00:02:10.170> make<00:02:10.290> this<00:02:10.470> 90<00:02:10.890> down<00:02:11.100> here

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
and we'll just make this 90 down here

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.920 
and we'll just make this 90 down here
all<00:02:12.570> right

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
all right

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.470 
all right
so<00:02:13.410> it's<00:02:13.770> looking<00:02:13.950> good<00:02:14.130> I'm<00:02:15.120> going<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.330> rotate

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
so it's looking good I'm going to rotate

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.120 
so it's looking good I'm going to rotate
it<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.050> I'm<00:02:16.140> looking<00:02:16.410> straight<00:02:16.500> at<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.950> and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
it now so I'm looking straight at it and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.059 
it now so I'm looking straight at it and
I'm<00:02:17.220> going<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:18.110> go<00:02:19.110> ahead<00:02:19.200> and

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.949 
I'm going to go ahead and
drag<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.819> down<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.299> kind<00:02:22.390> of<00:02:22.480> make<00:02:22.629> it<00:02:22.659> look

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
drag it down just kind of make it look

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.339 
drag it down just kind of make it look
to<00:02:23.530> have<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.680> sixteen<00:02:24.250> by<00:02:24.400> nine<00:02:24.430> sort<00:02:25.000> of<00:02:25.349> you

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
to have a sixteen by nine sort of you

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.720 
to have a sixteen by nine sort of you
know<00:02:26.379> shape<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.099> just<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.489> flag

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
know shape to it just so the flag

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.160 
know shape to it just so the flag
doesn't<00:02:28.000> look<00:02:28.090> distorted<00:02:28.420> when<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.750> apply<00:02:29.110> the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
doesn't look distorted when I apply the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.530 
doesn't look distorted when I apply the
material<00:02:29.939> so<00:02:30.939> now<00:02:31.060> I'm<00:02:31.120> going<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.269> go<00:02:31.390> over

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
material so now I'm going to go over

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.460 
material so now I'm going to go over
here<00:02:31.599> and<00:02:31.750> make<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.870> material<00:02:32.349> by

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
here and make a material by

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.710 
here and make a material by
double-clicking<00:02:32.799> and<00:02:33.280> then<00:02:34.060> I'm<00:02:34.329> going<00:02:34.689> to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
double-clicking and then I'm going to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.110 
double-clicking and then I'm going to
choose<00:02:35.349> load<00:02:35.799> image<00:02:36.129> in<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.430> texture<00:02:36.849> for<00:02:37.000> the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
choose load image in the texture for the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.640 
choose load image in the texture for the
color<00:02:37.299> and<00:02:37.629> I'm<00:02:37.870> just<00:02:37.900> going<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.200> load<00:02:38.379> up<00:02:38.530> the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
color and I'm just going to load up the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.150 
color and I'm just going to load up the
US<00:02:38.890> flag

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.490 

uncheck<00:02:41.880> specular<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.750> go<00:02:42.960> ahead<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.230> drag

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
uncheck specular and go ahead and drag

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.460 
uncheck specular and go ahead and drag
the<00:02:43.650> flag<00:02:43.860> on<00:02:44.070> top<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.460> right<00:02:45.240> here<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:46.410> go

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
the flag on top of right here just go

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.750 
the flag on top of right here just go
ahead<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.680> render<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:46.920> make<00:02:47.190> sure<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.550> looks

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
ahead and render it make sure it looks

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.990 
ahead and render it make sure it looks
good<00:02:48.530> proportionately<00:02:49.530> make<00:02:50.400> sure<00:02:50.580> it's<00:02:50.790> not

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
good proportionately make sure it's not

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.040 
good proportionately make sure it's not
a

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
a

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.900 
a
you<00:02:53.560> know<00:02:53.620> make<00:02:53.800> sure<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:53.980> doesn't<00:02:54.190> work

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
you know make sure it doesn't work

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.530 
you know make sure it doesn't work
miss<00:02:56.450> shaped

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
miss shaped

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.680 
miss shaped
it<00:02:58.840> looks<00:02:58.989> better<00:02:59.200> like<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.500> so

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
it looks better like that so

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.930 
it looks better like that so
I'm<00:03:02.140> pretty<00:03:02.410> good<00:03:02.680> I'm<00:03:03.130> pretty<00:03:03.430> happy<00:03:03.700> with

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
I'm pretty good I'm pretty happy with

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.640 
I'm pretty good I'm pretty happy with
the<00:03:04.090> flag<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:04.600> far<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:05.050> now<00:03:05.170> we're<00:03:05.320> going<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.470> do

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
the flag so far so now we're going to do

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.119 
the flag so far so now we're going to do
is<00:03:05.800> we're<00:03:06.010> going<00:03:06.040> to

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129

material and now we're just going to go
ahead<00:03:11.549> and<00:03:11.730> make<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.969> sky<00:03:12.299> so<00:03:12.810> again<00:03:13.739> we're

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
ahead and make the sky so again we're

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.559 
ahead and make the sky so again we're
going<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.069> uncheck<00:03:14.189> specular<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.150> we're<00:03:15.510> just

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
going to uncheck specular and we're just

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.690 
going to uncheck specular and we're just
going<00:03:15.719> to<00:03:15.780> go<00:03:15.930> over<00:03:15.959> here<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.409> have<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.700> HD

see<00:03:32.189> it<00:03:32.310> just<00:03:32.340> looks<00:03:32.670> like<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.879> you<00:03:33.450> know<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.569> flat

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
see it just looks like a you know a flat

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.670 
see it just looks like a you know a flat
sky<00:03:34.290> there

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
sky there

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.380 
sky there
all<00:03:36.219> right<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.640> that's<00:03:36.849> looking<00:03:36.939> good<00:03:37.209> like

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
all right so that's looking good like

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.420 
all right so that's looking good like
that<00:03:37.450> now<00:03:38.409> we're<00:03:38.590> going<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.739> do<00:03:38.890> is<00:03:39.189> we're

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
that now we're going to do is we're

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.839 
that now we're going to do is we're
going<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.730> make<00:03:39.909> the<00:03:40.329> poll<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:42.310> we're<00:03:42.700> going<00:03:42.790> to

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
going to make the poll so we're going to

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.179 
going to make the poll so we're going to
just<00:03:43.420> make<00:03:43.569> a<00:03:43.840> capsule<00:03:44.409> and<00:03:44.439> we're<00:03:45.040> going<00:03:45.159> to

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:45.189 
just make a capsule and we're going to

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.550 
just make a capsule and we're going to
change<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.640> radius<00:03:46.000> to

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.910 

about<00:03:49.220> like<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.460> we'll<00:03:49.910> be<00:03:50.030> fine<00:03:50.740> do<00:03:51.740> about

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
about like that we'll be fine do about

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.200 
about like that we'll be fine do about
ten<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:52.520> drag<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.600> pole<00:03:53.810> size<00:03:54.080> up<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:55.940> about

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
ten and drag the pole size up to about

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.270 
ten and drag the pole size up to about
like<00:03:56.870> that<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.500> then<00:03:57.830> we're<00:03:57.950> going<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.130> move

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
like that and then we're going to move

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.020 
like that and then we're going to move
it<00:03:58.400> over<00:03:58.640> so<00:03:59.710> lines<00:04:00.710> up<00:04:00.950> with<00:04:01.070> our<00:04:01.190> flag<00:04:01.640> and

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
it over so lines up with our flag and

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.000 
it over so lines up with our flag and
there's<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:02.930> little<00:04:03.140> bit<00:04:03.260> room<00:04:03.500> in<00:04:03.620> between

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
there's a little bit room in between

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.650 
there's a little bit room in between
them

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.390 

it's<00:04:08.080> going<00:04:08.230> to<00:04:08.350> render<00:04:08.470> that<00:04:08.620> su2<00:04:09.100> actually

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
it's going to render that su2 actually

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.520 
it's going to render that su2 actually
alright<00:04:09.820> that's<00:04:09.970> looking<00:04:10.060> good<00:04:10.360> so<00:04:10.750> now<00:04:11.410> what

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
alright that's looking good so now what

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.630 
alright that's looking good so now what
I'm<00:04:11.590> going<00:04:11.710> to<00:04:11.740> do<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:12.070> I'm<00:04:12.160> going<00:04:12.190> to<00:04:12.310> go<00:04:12.460> over

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go over

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.979 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go over
here<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:12.850> my<00:04:14.460> spline<00:04:15.460> my<00:04:15.760> freehand<00:04:16.300> spline<00:04:16.720> and

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
here to my spline my freehand spline and

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.410 
here to my spline my freehand spline and
I'm<00:04:17.110> just<00:04:17.230> going<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.470> draw<00:04:17.970> from<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.030> corner

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
I'm just going to draw from the corner

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.730 
I'm just going to draw from the corner
of<00:04:19.450> the<00:04:19.570> flag<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.680> pole<00:04:20.890> a<00:04:21.130> spline<00:04:21.730> and

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
of the flag to the pole a spline and

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.080 
of the flag to the pole a spline and
drag<00:04:23.740> another<00:04:23.950> spline<00:04:24.400> from<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.760> corner<00:04:25.000> of

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
drag another spline from the corner of

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.980 
drag another spline from the corner of
the<00:04:25.150> flag<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.660> pole

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
the flag to the pole

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.050 
the flag to the pole
now<00:04:27.500> I'm<00:04:27.590> going<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.740> go<00:04:27.889> over<00:04:27.919> here<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:28.490> create

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
now I'm going to go over here and create

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.719 
now I'm going to go over here and create
to<00:04:29.330> extrude<00:04:29.660> NURBS<00:04:29.720> ctrl-c<00:04:30.680> ctrl-v<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:31.550> then

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
to extrude NURBS ctrl-c ctrl-v and then

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.930 
to extrude NURBS ctrl-c ctrl-v and then
drag<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.180> spline<00:04:32.479> into<00:04:32.750> each<00:04:32.870> nerve

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.390 

I'm<00:04:36.450> going<00:04:36.780> to<00:04:36.930> bring<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.770> movement<00:04:38.130> down<00:04:38.250> on

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
I'm going to bring the movement down on

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.420 
I'm going to bring the movement down on
both<00:04:38.550> of<00:04:38.730> them<00:04:38.820> to<00:04:39.000> about<00:04:39.210> 4:00<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.680> you<00:04:40.740> will

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
both of them to about 4:00 and you will

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.010 
both of them to about 4:00 and you will
see<00:04:41.640> that<00:04:41.820> a

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
see that a

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.379 
see that a
you<00:04:43.500> have<00:04:43.620> these<00:04:43.770> strings<00:04:44.340> that<00:04:44.669> connect<00:04:45.030> the

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
you have these strings that connect the

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.270 
you have these strings that connect the
flag

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
flag

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.780

all<00:04:47.850> right<00:04:48.090> so<00:04:48.570> now<00:04:48.900> for<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.170> flag<00:04:49.610> again<00:04:50.610> we

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
all right so now for the flag again we

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.910 
all right so now for the flag again we
have<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:51.000> make<00:04:51.150> it<00:04:51.240> editable<00:04:51.470> so<00:04:52.470> go<00:04:52.680> ahead<00:04:52.800> and

all right so now what we're going to do
is<00:05:24.900> we're<00:05:25.020> going<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.200> go<00:05:25.290> to<00:05:25.350> the<00:05:25.470> forces<00:05:25.800> and

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
is we're going to go to the forces and

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.990 
is we're going to go to the forces and
we're<00:05:26.220> going<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:26.400> play<00:05:26.520> around<00:05:26.640> with<00:05:26.820> these

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
we're going to play around with these

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.490 
we're going to play around with these
we're<00:05:27.720> going<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:27.900> start<00:05:28.080> by<00:05:28.170> setting<00:05:28.350> the

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
we're going to start by setting the

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.379 
we're going to start by setting the
gravity<00:05:28.860> to<00:05:28.950> zero<00:05:30.050> and<00:05:31.050> we<00:05:31.920> will

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
gravity to zero and we will

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.939 
gravity to zero and we will
put<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:33.990> wind<00:05:34.259> direction<00:05:34.379> of<00:05:34.800> the<00:05:34.889> x<00:05:35.069> at<00:05:35.460> about

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
put the wind direction of the x at about

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.570 
put the wind direction of the x at about
Stu<00:05:37.949> about<00:05:38.210> 150<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:39.389> change<00:05:40.169> the<00:05:40.319> strength<00:05:40.740> to

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
Stu about 150 and change the strength to

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.920 
Stu about 150 and change the strength to
about<00:05:41.900> 1.6

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.739 

and<00:05:45.020> as<00:05:45.650> you<00:05:45.800> can<00:05:45.919> see<00:05:45.979> we<00:05:46.430> have<00:05:46.669> this<00:05:47.270> sort<00:05:47.570> of

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:49.749 
and as you can see we have this sort of

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:53.100 
and as you can see we have this sort of
light<00:05:50.349> wind<00:05:50.969> it's<00:05:51.969> not<00:05:52.119> too<00:05:52.269> intense<00:05:52.599> so<00:05:52.929> we're

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
light wind it's not too intense so we're

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.899 
light wind it's not too intense so we're
just<00:05:53.229> gonna<00:05:53.349> go<00:05:53.589> over<00:05:53.619> here<00:05:53.979> and<00:05:54.039> make<00:05:54.699> this<00:05:54.849> a

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909 
just gonna go over here and make this a

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:56.729 
just gonna go over here and make this a
little<00:05:55.149> bit<00:05:55.269> bigger<00:05:55.449> you<00:05:56.319> guys<00:05:56.469> can<00:05:56.649> actually

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:56.739 
little bit bigger you guys can actually

00:05:56.739 --> 00:06:01.440 
little bit bigger you guys can actually
see<00:05:56.979> it

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.170 

all<00:06:01.960> right<00:06:02.110> so<00:06:02.920> now<00:06:03.190> we<00:06:03.250> need<00:06:03.460> to<00:06:03.550> do<00:06:03.700> is<00:06:04.000> we

all right so now we need to do is we
need<00:06:04.330> to<00:06:04.530> change<00:06:05.530> the

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:07.189 
need to change the

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:09.850 
need to change the
when<00:06:07.729> turbulence<00:06:08.300> to<00:06:08.689> about<00:06:08.959> let's<00:06:09.529> try<00:06:09.770> about

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
when turbulence to about let's try about

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.930 
when turbulence to about let's try about
three<00:06:10.339> see<00:06:10.550> what<00:06:10.669> that<00:06:10.819> looks<00:06:11.089> like

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.520 

looks<00:06:15.600> like<00:06:15.720> a<00:06:15.810> hurricane<00:06:15.930> holy<00:06:16.530> crap

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.080 

let's<00:06:19.980> bring<00:06:20.130> the<00:06:20.280> winds<00:06:20.520> here<00:06:20.640> feelings<00:06:20.910> down

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
let's bring the winds here feelings down

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.299 
let's bring the winds here feelings down
to<00:06:21.360> about

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:23.309 
to about

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:25.360 
to about
point-9

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
point-9

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.680 
point-9
and<00:06:25.580> bring<00:06:26.000> the<00:06:26.120> strength<00:06:26.450> up<00:06:26.660> to<00:06:26.690> about<00:06:27.080> 2.3

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.439 

go<00:06:30.110> ahead<00:06:30.230> and<00:06:30.320> play<00:06:30.440> that

as you can see we got the wind here and
we<00:06:38.529> have<00:06:38.710> the<00:06:38.919> two<00:06:39.099> points

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
we have the two points

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.670 
we have the two points
connected<00:06:41.910> to<00:06:41.940> our

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
connected to our

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.950 
connected to our
strings<00:06:44.580> which<00:06:45.150> are<00:06:45.270> connected<00:06:45.600> to<00:06:45.630> the<00:06:45.720> bowl

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
strings which are connected to the bowl

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.640 
strings which are connected to the bowl
and<00:06:46.860> that's<00:06:47.190> basically<00:06:47.520> it<00:06:48.000> for<00:06:48.300> that<00:06:48.509> guys<00:06:48.900> I
