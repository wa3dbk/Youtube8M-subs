00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.640
 we have our accessories and 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.799
 hide our cameras 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.450
 we will see if it is possible to 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.059
 convince people to queue 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.299
 without knowing why you think that 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.299
 will walk 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.369
 after 15 minutes nobody is still doing 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.439
 tail 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.939
 it seems that people prefer to follow 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.890
 the movement rather than having 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.240
 the initiative 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.189
 we asked an accomplice of us 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.519
 help get things started by starting 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.900
 the tail is what the presence of a 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.570
 no one is enough for you 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.650
 persuade to queue that go 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.400
 do people do what others 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.400
 people will join him 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.820
 what's going on I do not know too much 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.820
 I was told to put myself there 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.150
 thin she did not bite the hooks 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.730
 minutes pass people are curious 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:01:03.010
 but cautious it would seem that nobody 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:05.260
 will not join this queues and 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.520
 these two there I do not know what will happen 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.250
 pass but it can be nice 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.140
 queue here that's what the 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.970
 sign them and you will be second 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.460
 and third are they going 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.910
 join there that even if they do not know 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.550
 not why they wait it's good 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.110
 now that this couple is there 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.840
 that the doors are wide open 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.500
 people can not resist what is 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.750
 what you do 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.270
 we are waiting for something it's free 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.470
 yeah it's serious and more there that grows 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.270
 the more people join us 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.080
 do not forget that these people do not know 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.080
 why are they waiting 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.070
 you are queuing for what for a 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.470
 event I believe it will not have taken 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.700
 that a person 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.970
 now we have assembled a crowd 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.960
 from unknown this phenomenon is called the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.970
 social influence 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.920
 I adopt you a behavior or 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.340
 make a decision based on 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.619
 other 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.330
 this phenomenon manifests itself in the return to 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.320
 crisis situation or when you hesitated 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.390
 on the way forward 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.770
 as you can see even if we 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.799
 gave them no explanation 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.299
 10 people were still coming 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.299
 again and again
