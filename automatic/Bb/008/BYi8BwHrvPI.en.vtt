other<00:00:04.170> old<00:00:04.500> device<00:00:04.920> I<00:00:05.250> believe<00:00:06.080> invented<00:00:07.080> in

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
other old device I believe invented in

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.089 
other old device I believe invented in
eighteen<00:00:08.880> hundreds<00:00:09.420> there<00:00:10.230> was<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.440> popular

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
eighteen hundreds there was a popular

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.200 
eighteen hundreds there was a popular
tool<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.559> 1920s<00:00:13.559> peerless<00:00:14.099> version<00:00:15.030> has

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
tool and the 1920s peerless version has

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.410 
tool and the 1920s peerless version has
been<00:00:15.420> copied<00:00:15.900> from<00:00:16.400> basically<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.880> two

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
been copied from basically you have two

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.890 
been copied from basically you have two
adjustable<00:00:19.080> arms<00:00:19.680> on<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.580> lead<00:00:20.939> rather<00:00:21.600> like

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
adjustable arms on the lead rather like

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.880 
adjustable arms on the lead rather like
a<00:00:22.109> traditional<00:00:22.710> t-square<00:00:23.600> the<00:00:24.890> adjustable

a traditional t-square the adjustable
arms<00:00:26.340> run<00:00:26.670> against<00:00:27.240> two<00:00:27.660> pins<00:00:28.340> which<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.730> can

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
arms run against two pins which you can

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.780 
arms run against two pins which you can
vary<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.810> distance<00:00:30.990> between<00:00:31.500> them<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.460> fins

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
vary the distance between them the fins

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.780 
vary the distance between them the fins
in<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.300> case<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.980> left-hand<00:00:35.520> side

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
for fins on the right hand side I'm good

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.700 
for fins on the right hand side I'm good

how this thing works you must keep the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.340 
how this thing works you must keep the
blades<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.489> contact<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> fins<00:00:51.840> that

old<00:00:53.309> things<00:00:54.649> I'm<00:00:55.649> putting<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.430> some<00:00:56.460> weight

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090

old things I'm putting in some weight
lanes<00:00:58.969> but<00:00:59.969> there<00:01:00.180> may<00:01:00.329> appear<00:01:01.820> quite<00:01:02.820> dark

I'm<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.260> making<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.890> up

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
I'm just making this up

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.780 
I'm just making this up
there's<00:01:07.439> lanes<00:01:07.830> swooping<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.909> direction

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
there's lanes swooping in one direction

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.050 
there's lanes swooping in one direction
I'm<00:01:11.790> gonna<00:01:12.090> go<00:01:12.299> back<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:14.720> traditional

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
I'm gonna go back to traditional

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:27.530 
I'm gonna go back to traditional
t-square<00:01:18.380> to<00:01:19.380> put<00:01:19.619> some<00:01:19.890> vertical<00:01:20.369> wings<00:01:20.820> in

have<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.440> keep<00:02:11.650> going<00:02:12.519> back<00:02:12.910> till<00:02:13.810> two<00:02:14.200> things

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
have to keep going back till two things

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.470 
have to keep going back till two things
if<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.330> wanted<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.230> same<00:02:17.730> angle<00:02:18.730> but<00:02:19.209> it's

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
if you wanted the same angle but it's

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.110 
if you wanted the same angle but it's
the<00:02:19.690> same<00:02:20.100> slope<00:02:21.100> towards<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.880> vanishing

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
the same slope towards the vanishing

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.400 
the same slope towards the vanishing
points<00:02:23.049> then<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.190> could<00:02:24.580> use<00:02:25.480> both<00:02:25.810> sides<00:02:26.110> of

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
points then you could use both sides of

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:36.380 
points then you could use both sides of
the<00:02:26.560> blade<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.040> t-square<00:02:28.290> great

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.720 

I'm<00:02:37.390> gonna<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:40.920> find<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.100> middle<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.519> that

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
I'm gonna just find the middle of that

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:51.960 
I'm gonna just find the middle of that
and<00:02:47.700> project<00:02:48.700> up<00:02:49.030> wing<00:02:49.480> Wraith<00:02:50.470> up<00:02:50.820> until<00:02:51.820> it

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
and project up wing Wraith up until it

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.229 
and project up wing Wraith up until it
reaches<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:53.040> ridge<00:02:54.040> on<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:55.600> roof<00:02:56.970> join<00:02:57.970> that

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
reaches the ridge on the roof join that

reaches the ridge on the roof join that
up<00:02:59.310> let's<00:03:00.310> bury<00:03:00.579> you<00:03:00.790> under<00:03:00.910> an<00:03:01.180> end<00:03:01.480> here<00:03:01.989> just

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
up let's bury you under an end here just

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.840 
up let's bury you under an end here just
because<00:03:03.820> I<00:03:03.940> feel<00:03:04.239> like<00:03:04.329> it<00:03:05.519> okay<00:03:06.519> there's<00:03:06.790> one

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
because I feel like it okay there's one

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.170 
because I feel like it okay there's one
two<00:03:07.390> three<00:03:07.420> windows<00:03:08.200> on<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.650> door<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.730> slope

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
two three windows on that door the slope

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.930 
two three windows on that door the slope
on<00:03:10.420> near<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:11.230> roughly<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.980> same<00:03:12.220> as<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.579> smoke

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
on near is roughly the same as the smoke

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.300 
on near is roughly the same as the smoke
there<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:14.380> just<00:03:15.090> project<00:03:16.090> that<00:03:17.760> on<00:03:18.760> go<00:03:19.180> across

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
there so just project that on go across

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.449 
there so just project that on go across
and<00:03:21.310> draw<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:22.090> then<00:03:23.100> they<00:03:24.100> are<00:03:24.130> through

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
and draw that then they are through

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.590 
and draw that then they are through
these<00:03:24.640> lines<00:03:24.970> on<00:03:25.269> my<00:03:25.480> drawing<00:03:25.920> feeling<00:03:26.920> dark

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
these lines on my drawing feeling dark
