00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.689
 I begin by preparing 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:27.380
 I took the planetary with the hook 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:32.350
 I'm going to put the sugar flour 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.350
 pinch of salt and butter 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:40.640
 add the grated rind of a 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.329
 lemon and began to make the go 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.329
 planetary 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.099
 as soon as the ingredients are a little 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.099
 amalgam in I go to add the yolks 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.229
 I still work the compound until I don't 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.899
 the compound itself has been compacted 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.619
 compacted I go to extract it I put it on 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:13.530
 work plan briefly 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:16.739
 to form a loaf they wrap it 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.330
 in the transparent film and I do it 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:24.510
 rest in the fridge at least for 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:28.069
 half an hour after thirty minutes I removed the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.069
 shortcrust pastry from the refrigerator 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:40.160
 I'm going to put a veil of flour and 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.160
 began to spread it 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:56.740
 you can go and spend it too 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:59.530
 directly on the baking paper if yes 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.610
 crumble a little on the sides, just go to it 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:11.290
 reassemble I will have to roll it out of the 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:14.650
 thickness of about 5 mm once spread 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.450
 begins to form the stars 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.840
 I purchased this form for 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.040
 very pretty cookies 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.040
 I'm going to form the stars 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.770
 I formed the stars 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.820
 I'm going to remove the excess pasta that 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:52.170
 then I will go to reshuffle and I will train others 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.210
 cookies I placed and cookies on 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.740
 he loaded the oven lined with paper 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:01.650
 I'm going to bake them in a hot oven 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:05.100
 at 180 degrees for 12 minutes 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.140
 and while the cookies are running in 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.950
 I go to prepare the icing 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.100
 lemon 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.700
 I take icing sugar and I go to 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.920
 put the juice inside 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.140
 lemon 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:23.100
 let's see how much it will take 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:29.430
 meanwhile I'm going to put a spoon in it 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:31.770
 I'm going to add another as soon as I see 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.580
 that consistency is right 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.040
 I don't add any more juice I go to 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.660
 put another so I'm already 3 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.660
 tablespoons of lemon juice 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:57.430
 cash to go and relax visions there 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:05:01.330
 it's ready the cookies are ready now 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:04.389
 I proceed with the decoration I take the 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:13.949
 cookie still hot and I go to 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:13.949
 soak in the icing I'm going to lift it 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.210
 and then resting on parchment paper 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.900
 wanting before the frosting takes place 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.020
 solidify can go and put 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:35.020

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:41.050
 finely cut high to support 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:44.020
 above I leave the biscuits to solidify 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:48.599
 on baking paper until the icing 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:52.180
 the little stars will not have hardened 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:55.419
