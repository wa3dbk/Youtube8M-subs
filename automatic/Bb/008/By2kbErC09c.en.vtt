00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.849
 Hello everyone, Carl March 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.030
 many newcomers to dota 2 wondered 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.779
 the question of what is there to do like 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.140
 start playing during the first run 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.359
 you need to be trained 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.150
 consisting of three workouts after 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.359
 the course will be available to you 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.710
 menu game and so let's analyze this 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:38.640
 menu first find game after clicking 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.100
 keys to find the game will be searched 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.850
 according to the settings under sometimes 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.910
 games and so we will sort them a little 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.300
 game modes to choose there are many 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.760
 game modes the most basic is all pick 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.360
 each player chooses from all the characters 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.210
 that is, at the beginning of the game you will be given 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.280
 all absolutely all heroes and every player 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.049
 will choose any there is one subtlety 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.920
 you cannot choose that hero 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.159
 whom have already chosen 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.460

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.500
 will choose one other game modes 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.460
 are used less often and there is also one 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.740
 subtlety 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.570
 You can choose several at once. 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.570
 game modes to search 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.270

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.720

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.549

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.250

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.470
 go to the private game group here 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.500
 there are three modes 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.730
 find lope create lobbies and workouts with 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.620
 bots create a lobby in this mode you 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.700
 be able to organize games with 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.590
 specific players or teams a 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.580
 also if there are free places you 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.400
 can fill them with bots 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.760
 further training with bots here you 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.380
 You can start the game with bots and those who 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.530
 will be with you in a group 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.840

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.530
 bots difficulty level and side 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.420
 on which you will 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.150
 I recommend your first game to play with 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.810
 bots then you learn to play at least for 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.810
 one character
