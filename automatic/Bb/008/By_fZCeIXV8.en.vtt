00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.260
 well that's it all thickens himself 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.160
 tutorial today we find ourselves for 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.570
 a new little tutorial on windows 7 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.490
 and I believe in others or windows 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.869
 so today we will learn to 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.860
 close all applications in 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.830
 chic dancer 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.920
 it will take a little manipulation without software 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.539
 to download so I hope this 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.400
 tip you will simply like you 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.750
 have right click on your desktop 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.480
 new shortcuts you will do 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.550
 copy paste the link that I put you 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.989
 in the disappointment finally the line of 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.870
 text that I put you in the section 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.360

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.699

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:58.620
 directly so here so there was I 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:02.789
 give 3x you will replace these 3 x 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.180
 by your windows session name then 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.650
 if you do not know your 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.970
 two sessions you have the start menu 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.890
 here you have your done following done 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.010
 so let's go but if you want to the fact 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.860
 you can change the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.120
 of stuff but very successful 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.120

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.580
 can not you make an example of this 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.650
 software finally this little program we're going 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.970
 to say that we created ourselves because they 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.070
 close all applications 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.620
 present on your computer you 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.330

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.670
 to record and that I can not 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:47.470
 close this application because otherwise you 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.940
