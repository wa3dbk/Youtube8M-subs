of strategic plans and policy and I

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.080 
of strategic plans and policy and I
think<00:02:01.929> that<00:02:02.049> a<00:02:02.229> SLM<00:02:02.890> can<00:02:03.249> help<00:02:03.520> promote<00:02:03.850> the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
think that a SLM can help promote the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.039 
think that a SLM can help promote the
