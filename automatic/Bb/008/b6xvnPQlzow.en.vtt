bed<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.300> throughout<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> day<00:00:42.960> dirt<00:00:43.469> and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
bed because throughout the day dirt and

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.430 
bed because throughout the day dirt and
bacteria<00:00:44.040> will<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.120> stuck<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.570> your<00:00:45.660> face<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
bacteria will get stuck on your face and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.130 
bacteria will get stuck on your face and
go<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:46.800> pores<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.690> don't<00:00:48.899> clean

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
go in your pores and if you don't clean

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.080 
go in your pores and if you don't clean
them<00:00:49.320> out<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:49.770> they'll<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:50.190> want<00:00:50.520> pimples

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
them out then they'll like want pimples

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.029 
them out then they'll like want pimples
and<00:00:51.570> they'll<00:00:51.840> make<00:00:51.989> your<00:00:52.170> breakout<00:00:52.559> basically

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
and they'll make your breakout basically

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.860 
and they'll make your breakout basically
so<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> definitely<00:00:53.670> recommend<00:00:53.910> getting<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:54.840> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
so I definitely recommend getting like a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.319 
so I definitely recommend getting like a
natural<00:00:55.440> or<00:00:55.590> organic<00:00:55.770> cleanser<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.030> using

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
natural or organic cleanser and using

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.590 
natural or organic cleanser and using
that<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.750> face<00:00:57.930> before<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.350> go<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> bed

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.939 

even<00:01:03.600> though<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> recommend<00:01:04.530> using<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
even though I recommend using like a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.130 
even though I recommend using like a
daily<00:01:05.250> cleanser<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.119> moisturizer<00:01:06.750> and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
daily cleanser and a moisturizer and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.890 
daily cleanser and a moisturizer and
maybe<00:01:07.409> some<00:01:07.979> tonic<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.670> don't<00:01:09.479> think<00:01:09.810> they

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
maybe some tonic I don't think they

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.170 
maybe some tonic I don't think they
should<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.260> using<00:01:10.500> 600<00:01:11.369> products<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:11.970> your

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
should be using 600 products on your

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.940 
should be using 600 products on your
face<00:01:12.570> because<00:01:12.960> there<00:01:13.229> are<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.560> many<00:01:13.590> chemicals

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
face because there are so many chemicals

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.070 
face because there are so many chemicals
and<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.670> face<00:01:14.939> product<00:01:15.390> too<00:01:15.689> many<00:01:15.869> chemicals

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and like face product too many chemicals

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.429 
and like face product too many chemicals
will<00:01:16.560> dry<00:01:16.799> our<00:01:16.979> skin<00:01:17.119> cost<00:01:18.119> pimples<00:01:18.720> etc<00:01:19.320> you

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
will dry our skin cost pimples etc you

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.960 
will dry our skin cost pimples etc you
don't<00:01:19.619> want<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:20.460> two<00:01:20.820> or<00:01:20.850> three

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
don't want that so I think two or three

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.700 
don't want that so I think two or three
products<00:01:21.509> will<00:01:21.689> do<00:01:21.960> unless<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
products will do unless you have a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.160 
products will do unless you have a
dermatologist<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.909> tells<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.960> use

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
dermatologist that tells you to use

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.960 
dermatologist that tells you to use
specific<00:01:25.470> products<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.189> your<00:01:26.340> face<00:01:26.610> every<00:01:26.939> day

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
specific products on your face every day

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.399 
specific products on your face every day
then<00:01:27.270> there's<00:01:27.600> nothing<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.140> say<00:01:28.290> about

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
then there's nothing I can say about

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.649 
then there's nothing I can say about
that<00:01:28.530> because<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.729> went<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.000> college<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that because you went to college and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.240 
that because you went to college and
learned<00:01:30.960> all<00:01:31.140> about<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.560> stuff<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.130> I'm

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.499 
learned all about that stuff and I'm

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.179 

and<00:06:13.129> my<00:06:14.129> last<00:06:14.490> tip<00:06:14.939> that<00:06:15.240> I<00:06:15.419> cannot<00:06:16.189> stress

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:17.189 
and my last tip that I cannot stress

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:21.320 
and my last tip that I cannot stress
enough<00:06:17.310> is<00:06:18.259> do<00:06:19.259> not<00:06:19.589> pop<00:06:20.250> your<00:06:20.520> pimples<00:06:20.729> okay

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
enough is do not pop your pimples okay

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.029 
enough is do not pop your pimples okay
so<00:06:21.389> when<00:06:21.659> you<00:06:21.750> have<00:06:21.960> a<00:06:21.990> pimple<00:06:22.560> think<00:06:22.860> of<00:06:22.919> it

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
so when you have a pimple think of it

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.249 
so when you have a pimple think of it
like<00:06:23.189> a<00:06:23.219> little<00:06:23.339> bag<00:06:23.849> that<00:06:24.330> holds<00:06:24.599> acne

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 
like a little bag that holds acne

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.740 
like a little bag that holds acne
bacteria<00:06:25.439> oil<00:06:26.219> and<00:06:26.699> debris<00:06:27.029> is<00:06:27.300> a<00:06:27.509> pustule

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
bacteria oil and debris is a pustule

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.990 
bacteria oil and debris is a pustule
that<00:06:28.199> basically<00:06:28.949> keeps<00:06:29.250> the<00:06:29.460> bacteria

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
that basically keeps the bacteria

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.600 
that basically keeps the bacteria
contained<00:06:30.509> when<00:06:30.899> you<00:06:31.020> pop<00:06:31.680> that<00:06:32.099> so-called

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
contained when you pop that so-called

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.110 
contained when you pop that so-called
bag<00:06:33.270> the<00:06:34.050> disgusting<00:06:34.949> gunk<00:06:35.339> loses<00:06:35.939> out

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
bag the disgusting gunk loses out

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.329 
bag the disgusting gunk loses out
therefore<00:06:36.810> but<00:06:37.050> either<00:06:37.319> seeps<00:06:37.860> into<00:06:38.069> other

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:38.339 
therefore but either seeps into other

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:40.670 
therefore but either seeps into other
pores<00:06:38.699> around<00:06:39.180> your<00:06:39.330> pimple<00:06:39.689> area<00:06:40.020> or<00:06:40.199> it<00:06:40.500> goes

pores around your pimple area or it goes

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.469 
pores around your pimple area or it goes

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 
down also there's bacteria on your

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.420 
down also there's bacteria on your
fingers<00:06:42.779> so<00:06:42.990> when<00:06:43.110> you<00:06:43.229> pop<00:06:43.439> a<00:06:43.469> pimple<00:06:43.800> it<00:06:44.219> can
