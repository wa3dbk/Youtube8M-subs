00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.060
 dvd criticism and leadership until now 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.170
 In addition , it should have become in the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.730
 past months again and again 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.710
 written to viewers and therefore 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.160
 asked finally a revue to be 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.259
 do 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.299
 Now it's finally time and so 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.299
 it's about a single day 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.279
 it was a magical but only one 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.050
 boy from berlin came from the city 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.910
 You will find yourself at the folk festival 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.829
 they were very different but as 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.890
 Noel who saw the evening he was like from 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:43.019
 lightning struck so with me from my 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.930
 Hand raw material and I 'll just give you 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.879
 just because I'm sorry or a little bit 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.930
 understandably wants with a nice 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.930
 beautiful in life must 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.070
 The two fell in love , however 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.930
 Of course, you should dance with me 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.760
 It's a good story I think 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.790
 I've heard it before it's on 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.260
 dream what do you work only i work 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.320
 in the sawmill as for merits with the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.929
 jobcenter 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.670
 the thing stops immediately he is one 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:17.289
 nice boy is not for you 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.579
 I do not know how to do that 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.880
 you will not see you again and with it 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.880
 Basta 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.700

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.880

 which we accept 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.460
 she went on who she was 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.850
 decided and for whom we determined 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.850
 are described 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.950
 i have been here every day for a year 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.950
 written 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.100
 new line cinema presents ryan gosling 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.830
 rachel mcadams james collins james 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.650
 monsters with sam shepard and john balls 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.720
 in a movie by nick cassavetes me 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.720
 read it to her and she remembers 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.720
 like a single day 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.900
 like a single day in the original 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.879
 Notebook is the world bestseller 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.280
 film adaptation of nicholas sparks book 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.019
 Notebook is 123 minutes past six 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.640
 released years and tells what the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.620
 story of a man around with the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.150
 80 years old is in an older woman 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.769
 in a retirement home respectively 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.140
 nursing home a story from one 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.209
 read a book and then jump like a 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.849
 only day this story and you 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.430
 into the 1950s into the us 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.049
 and tells the story of noah and 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.489
 elli the actually different 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.019
 could not be while he is one 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.239
 workers in the countryside respectively 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.950
 In the small town she originated 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.540
 rich home and spend with the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.940
 summer in the summer domicile of the family 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.159
 in this small town and so walk 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.840
 both inevitably over the way and he 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.090
 instantly falls in love with her and wants 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.620
 a date and he begs 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.450
 in a funny way on one 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.099
 year market and then it springs from this 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.109
 unequal pair of different 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.670
 the young love would then come out of it 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.370
 again a basic topic in the context of 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.260
 love not actually being there because 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.909
 they are just as different beings 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.139
 or humans are that 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.849
 a very old topic what you 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.650
 is especially taken up in love 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.720
 trip works again and then 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.459
 of course, the parents of 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.290
 elli and the wealth and in the other 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.660
 or any other ideas of her 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.489
 Future in the way and this love will be 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.660
 put to the test whether they then too 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.310
 Of course, I want to find each other 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.660
 Do not betray here and to what extent the 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.519
 some story and the frame story 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.590
 fitting together would be too much 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.239
 but celebrated for all the nicholas 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.129
 I just love sparks movies 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.169
 say watch this movie everything is 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.060
 so typical thick of the park it is 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.739
 romantic is loving and cinematic 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.030
 we also realized with great pictures 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.010
 have ryan gosling in here 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.120
 starring together rachel mcadams the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.680
 both play really nice 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.209
 together and above all he always has like that 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.590
 A kind of dreamy look with his 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.659
 slight silver look also and always 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.459
 this deep hope this field of 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.049
 do not give up somewhere in the router 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.180
 Because that's like a single day 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.250
 especially the story or the faith 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.470
 that hope actually 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.269
 at last, passion and passion die first 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.590
 Sometimes it can go out very late 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.240
 if you actually already believe one 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.900
 completely different way of life 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.270
 to have 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.919
 So those who love films love movies 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.289
 and notebook should never have seen 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.969
 absolutely insane 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.919
 Although I have greater expectations of the 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:35.869
 after having been with so much 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.909
 Lobster egg someone was brought against 

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:39.289
 he is really strong but unfortunately and 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.629
 but more get it in me already 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.430
 somehow deductible 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.119
 predictable and I like that very much 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.800
 what a shame 

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:47.659
 There were no minute films that made me so 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.699
 you were really surprised about that 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:53.119
 great cluj and after a few minutes in the 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.949
 film but if you are somehow that way 

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:56.719
 if you can take it that way 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.189
 then the film can still be true 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:00.319
 make fun you can so sunk 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:03.169
 cuddle the island back and say oh yes 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:05.209
 love is not that nice okay so 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.009
 some genre of me in his 

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:08.899
 genre he was movies strongly implemented it 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.580
 Well played is a great backdrop 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:12.619
 which look really great eight and a half 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.809
 out of 10 possible points and has 

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:16.789
 by the way, always the middle way 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:18.559
 Burr between too cheesy and easy 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.599
 only genre caught and thus typical 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:22.159
 not quite beyond the goal 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.539
 altogether of me worth seeing siem 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.399
 unit of 10 possible points 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.050
 delivering animals like a single day 

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:29.270
 please write in the comments 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.279
 and especially without spoiling 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.139
 I'm interested in what you think of that 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:34.430
 end or have to say the end 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.769
 because many say somehow I have that 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.999
 So it feels a little bit somehow 

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:39.620
 sad I think it's really nice 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:41.659
 and somehow poetic 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.249
 melancholic well done in the field 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.199
 I would be interested in what he did 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:47.240
 say okay that was mine for now 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.860
 to like a single day who still 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.740
