00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
about 1/4 teaspoon of salt now salt is

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.410 
about 1/4 teaspoon of salt now salt is
to<00:02:12.680> taste<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.220> depending<00:02:13.640> on<00:02:13.760> how<00:02:13.970> much<00:02:14.120> salt

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420

you're<00:02:14.660> masala<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.319> you're<00:02:15.890> using<00:02:16.130> then<00:02:16.400> the

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
you're masala that you're using then the

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.920 
you're masala that you're using then the
masala<00:02:16.850> already<00:02:17.209> has<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.600> then<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.780> can

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
masala already has and then you can

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.410 
masala already has and then you can
scale<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.350> up<00:02:18.410> or<00:02:18.590> down<00:02:18.739> and<00:02:19.190> just<00:02:19.610> mix<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.360> in

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
scale it up or down and just mix it in

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.420 
scale it up or down and just mix it in
really<00:02:20.630> well<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.080> it's<00:02:21.709> always<00:02:21.950> hard<00:02:22.130> to

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
really well and it's always hard to

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.550 
really well and it's always hard to
judge<00:02:22.790> how<00:02:23.090> much<00:02:23.230> breadcrumbs<00:02:24.230> you're<00:02:24.440> gonna

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
judge how much breadcrumbs you're gonna

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.960 
judge how much breadcrumbs you're gonna
need<00:02:24.769> to<00:02:24.950> coat<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.400> amount<00:02:25.610> of<00:02:25.670> chicken<00:02:25.940> you

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
need to coat the amount of chicken you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.880 
need to coat the amount of chicken you
have<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.660> what<00:02:26.780> I'm<00:02:26.840> gonna<00:02:26.959> do<00:02:27.110> is<00:02:27.290> after<00:02:27.560> it's

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
have so what I'm gonna do is after it's

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.050 
have so what I'm gonna do is after it's
mixed<00:02:28.220> in<00:02:28.310> really<00:02:28.550> well<00:02:28.700> I'm<00:02:28.820> just<00:02:28.940> gonna

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
mixed in really well I'm just gonna

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.479 
mixed in really well I'm just gonna
divide<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.480> out<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.440> keep<00:02:30.680> half<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.400> the

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
divide it out and keep half of it to the

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.360 
divide it out and keep half of it to the
side<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:33.110> way<00:02:33.350> if<00:02:33.500> we<00:02:33.620> need<00:02:33.650> more<00:02:34.010> we<00:02:34.220> can

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
side that way if we need more we can

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.090 
side that way if we need more we can
keep<00:02:34.519> adding<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.440> we're<00:02:36.440> not<00:02:36.560> wasting<00:02:36.980> the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
keep adding and we're not wasting the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.170 
keep adding and we're not wasting the
whole<00:02:37.130> thing<00:02:37.459> because<00:02:37.640> once<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.000> raw<00:02:38.150> chicken

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
whole thing because once the raw chicken

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.060 
whole thing because once the raw chicken
goes<00:02:38.660> into<00:02:39.019> this<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.470> have<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.709> throw<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:39.980> away

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
goes into this and have to throw it away

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.670 
goes into this and have to throw it away
at<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.370> end<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:40.880> it's<00:02:41.750> just<00:02:41.900> conserved<00:02:42.470> for

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
at the end so it's just conserved for

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.150 
at the end so it's just conserved for
the<00:02:42.769> time<00:02:42.950> being<00:02:43.190> quit<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:45.500> we<00:02:45.590> also<00:02:45.769> have

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
the time being quit so we also have

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.509 
the time being quit so we also have
about<00:02:46.459> 3<00:02:47.200> tablespoons<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.470> water<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.280> we've

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
melted and we have our assembly line up

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.720 
melted and we have our assembly line up
ready<00:02:53.900> basically<00:02:54.470> so<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.100> chicken<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.459> here

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
little thinner that weight first of all

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.060 
little thinner that weight first of all
it<00:03:32.079> softens<00:03:33.079> are<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.350> when<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:33.560> beat<00:03:33.799> it<00:03:33.920> up

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
it softens are you when you beat it up

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.280 
it softens are you when you beat it up
if<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:34.400> soften<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.970> muscle<00:03:35.359> of<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:36.049> breast

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
if you soften the muscle of the breast

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.250 
if you soften the muscle of the breast

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
so it's tender it really is gentle and

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.310 
so it's tender it really is gentle and
cooks<00:03:39.650> faster<00:03:40.100> also<00:03:40.450> so<00:03:41.450> here<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:41.900> go<00:03:42.049> and

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
cooks faster also so here you go and

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.590 
cooks faster also so here you go and
then<00:03:42.560> you<00:03:42.590> cut<00:03:42.829> it<00:03:42.859> into<00:03:43.190> your<00:03:43.370> 3/4<00:03:44.359> inch

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
then you cut it into your 3/4 inch

00:03:44.600 --> 00:04:08.110 
then you cut it into your 3/4 inch
strips

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120
