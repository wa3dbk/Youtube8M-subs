00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
smell of these things the first thing to

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.340 
smell of these things the first thing to
do<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.150> pump<00:00:21.330> some<00:00:21.539> water<00:00:21.779> into<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.199> boiler

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350

halfway up the gauge classrooms are fine

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.630 
halfway up the gauge classrooms are fine
and<00:00:24.930> then<00:00:25.350> light<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.710> fire<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.250> would<00:00:26.519> normally

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
and then light the fire I would normally

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.580 
and then light the fire I would normally
start<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.240> fire<00:00:27.449> with<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> piece<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:27.990> oily<00:00:28.439> rag

I've<00:00:28.740> got<00:00:28.920> plenty<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.279> doors<00:00:29.519> laid<00:00:29.699> about<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
I've got plenty of doors laid about the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.910 
I've got plenty of doors laid about the
word<00:00:30.240> shop<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.990> also<00:00:31.410> around<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> workshop

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
word shop and also around the workshop

word shop and also around the workshop
near<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> band<00:00:32.700> saw<00:00:32.969> plenty<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.719> bits<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.140> wood

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
near the band saw plenty of bits of wood

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.950 
near the band saw plenty of bits of wood
so<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:35.399> start<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> simple<00:00:36.180> wood<00:00:36.360> fire<00:00:36.630> first

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
so just start the simple wood fire first

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.619 
so just start the simple wood fire first
you<00:00:37.829> may<00:00:37.980> need<00:00:38.160> one<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.399> these<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.450> a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
you may need one of these this is a

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.930 
you may need one of these this is a
centrifugal<00:00:40.290> blower<00:00:40.680> used<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.610> drawing<00:00:41.790> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
some serious pressure in the boiler you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.819 
some serious pressure in the boiler you
will<00:01:42.420> need<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.780> back<00:01:42.960> off<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.320> steam<00:01:43.590> law

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
will need to back off the steam law

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.010 
will need to back off the steam law
otherwise<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.880> boiler<00:01:45.240> will<00:01:45.390> make<00:01:45.570> far<00:01:45.869> too

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
otherwise the boiler will make far too

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.530 
otherwise the boiler will make far too
much<00:01:46.200> steam<00:01:46.549> you<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.700> see<00:01:47.880> some<00:01:48.090> water<00:01:48.329> around

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540

the<00:01:48.810> top<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.140> my<00:01:49.259> body<00:01:49.470> at<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.770> moment<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.970> is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the top of my body at the moment this is

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.030 
the top of my body at the moment this is
just<00:01:51.180> condensation<00:01:51.780> running<00:01:52.530> down<00:01:52.710> from<00:01:52.740> the

just condensation running down from the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.249 
just condensation running down from the
cap<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:54.119> also<00:01:54.270> see<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> pressures

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
cap you can also see that the pressures

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.560 
cap you can also see that the pressures
dropped<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> about<00:01:55.890> 10<00:01:56.189> psi<00:01:56.729> now<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.420> is

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
dropped to about 10 psi now this is

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.480 
dropped to about 10 psi now this is
because<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> steam<00:01:58.259> blow<00:01:58.560> uses<00:01:59.280> some

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
because the steam blow uses some

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.910 
because the steam blow uses some
pressure<00:01:59.729> it<00:02:00.240> also<00:02:00.420> uses<00:02:00.840> water<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.560> keep<00:02:01.770> your

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
pressure it also uses water so keep your

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.550 
pressure it also uses water so keep your

will ignite very quickly and give you

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.479 
will ignite very quickly and give you
even<00:04:02.739> more<00:04:03.009> steam

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
even more steam

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.300 
even more steam
time<00:04:04.180> now<00:04:04.359> to<00:04:04.419> try<00:04:04.719> the<00:04:04.780> water<00:04:05.049> pump<00:04:05.379> this<00:04:06.099> is<00:04:06.280> a

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
time now to try the water pump this is a

time now to try the water pump this is a
wear<00:04:06.609> tight<00:04:06.909> pump<00:04:07.209> and<00:04:07.419> the<00:04:07.900> first<00:04:08.109> thing<00:04:08.259> to

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
wear tight pump and the first thing to

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.020 
wear tight pump and the first thing to
do<00:04:08.500> with<00:04:08.650> it<00:04:08.769> is<00:04:08.919> to<00:04:09.039> open<00:04:09.189> the<00:04:09.340> cylinder<00:04:09.699> drain

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
do with it is to open the cylinder drain

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.240 
do with it is to open the cylinder drain

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
cylinder come bench's the water and will

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.979 
cylinder come bench's the water and will
probably<00:04:14.500> hydraulic<00:04:15.159> lock<00:04:15.659> once<00:04:16.659> the<00:04:16.780> drain

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
probably hydraulic lock once the drain

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.949 
probably hydraulic lock once the drain

to<00:04:21.500> water<00:04:21.769> back<00:04:22.100> to<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.370> tank<00:04:22.850> it<00:04:23.720> doesn't<00:04:24.050> use

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
to water back to the tank it doesn't use

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.650 
to water back to the tank it doesn't use
very<00:04:24.410> much<00:04:24.560> steam<00:04:24.890> really<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.970> it<00:04:26.090> exhausts

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
very much steam really and it exhausts

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.180 
very much steam really and it exhausts
of<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.870> chimney<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:27.530> helps<00:04:27.830> to<00:04:27.860> draw<00:04:28.130> the

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
of the chimney so it helps to draw the

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.110 
of the chimney so it helps to draw the
fire<00:04:29.800> here<00:04:30.800> you<00:04:30.890> see<00:04:31.070> me<00:04:31.220> shutting<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.700> bypass

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.600 
fire here you see me shutting the bypass
valve<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:33.110> what's<00:04:33.290> going<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.500> happen<00:04:33.830> now<00:04:34.040> is

the blower active there's a distinct
difference<00:05:09.460> in<00:05:09.880> tone<00:05:10.200> you<00:05:11.200> can<00:05:11.260> hear<00:05:11.620> when<00:05:11.800> the

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
difference in tone you can hear when the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.380 
difference in tone you can hear when the
air<00:05:12.070> is<00:05:12.190> being<00:05:12.340> rubbed<00:05:12.670> through<00:05:12.910> the<00:05:13.150> fire

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
air is being rubbed through the fire

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.480 
air is being rubbed through the fire
rather<00:05:14.260> than<00:05:14.470> through<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.800> fire<00:05:15.010> and

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
rather than through the fire and

straight<00:05:15.940> of<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.120> cubes<00:05:16.480> now<00:05:16.920> you<00:05:17.920> will<00:05:18.160> also

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
straight of the cubes now you will also

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.700 
straight of the cubes now you will also
notice<00:05:18.910> that<00:05:19.090> as<00:05:19.690> this<00:05:19.840> pressure<00:05:20.140> the<00:05:20.380> whistle

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
notice that as this pressure the whistle

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.010 
notice that as this pressure the whistle
is<00:05:20.800> much<00:05:20.980> louder<00:05:21.220> and<00:05:22.210> it<00:05:22.390> would<00:05:22.540> be<00:05:22.690> drier

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
is much louder and it would be drier

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.840 
is much louder and it would be drier

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
everywhere and it leaves really bad

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.400 
everywhere and it leaves really bad
watermarks<00:06:04.210> on<00:06:04.360> the<00:06:04.480> boilers<00:06:04.840> you<00:06:05.020> can<00:06:05.230> see

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
watermarks on the boilers you can see

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.440 
watermarks on the boilers you can see
here<00:06:05.650> the<00:06:06.190> water<00:06:06.340> inside<00:06:06.820> the<00:06:07.030> boiler<00:06:07.210> is

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
here the water inside the boiler is

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.180 
here the water inside the boiler is
cleaned<00:06:07.780> but<00:06:08.140> when<00:06:08.290> it<00:06:08.410> leaves<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:08.800> boiler

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
cleaned but when it leaves the boiler

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.520 
cleaned but when it leaves the boiler
and<00:06:09.430> goes<00:06:09.880> up<00:06:10.060> the<00:06:10.180> chimney<00:06:10.419> onto<00:06:11.080> the<00:06:11.169> top<00:06:11.380> of

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
and goes up the chimney onto the top of

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.080 
and goes up the chimney onto the top of
the<00:06:11.590> boiler<00:06:11.770> it<00:06:12.340> gathers<00:06:12.730> some<00:06:12.910> of<00:06:13.030> the

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
the boiler it gathers some of the

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.700 
the boiler it gathers some of the
products<00:06:13.450> of<00:06:13.600> combustion<00:06:13.990> and<00:06:14.230> national

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
products of combustion and national

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.280 
products of combustion and national
things<00:06:14.919> like<00:06:15.160> that<00:06:15.540> so<00:06:16.540> what<00:06:16.720> I<00:06:16.750> needed<00:06:16.960> to<00:06:17.140> do

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
things like that so what I needed to do

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.930 
things like that so what I needed to do
here<00:06:17.560> was<00:06:17.770> drop<00:06:18.040> the<00:06:18.190> pressure<00:06:18.400> by<00:06:18.669> running

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
here was drop the pressure by running

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.990 
here was drop the pressure by running
the<00:06:19.120> engine<00:06:19.240> but<00:06:19.660> not<00:06:19.870> pump<00:06:20.110> any<00:06:20.290> watering<00:06:21.000> and

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
the engine but not pump any watering and

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.610 
the engine but not pump any watering and
I<00:06:22.240> was<00:06:22.360> just<00:06:22.540> playing<00:06:22.810> about<00:06:23.080> really

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
I was just playing about really

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.710 
I was just playing about really
I<00:06:23.650> kept<00:06:24.190> removing<00:06:24.610> the<00:06:24.760> inlet<00:06:25.090> pipe<00:06:25.300> so<00:06:25.600> the

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
I kept removing the inlet pipe so the

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.240 
I kept removing the inlet pipe so the
engine<00:06:26.050> really<00:06:26.200> goes<00:06:26.470> fast<00:06:26.710> as<00:06:26.980> II<00:06:27.070> but

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
engine really goes fast as II but

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.310 
engine really goes fast as II but
starved<00:06:27.640> of<00:06:27.760> water<00:06:28.030> and<00:06:28.810> then<00:06:28.930> putting<00:06:29.140> it

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
starved of water and then putting it

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.800 
starved of water and then putting it
back<00:06:29.470> in<00:06:29.710> and<00:06:29.860> watching<00:06:30.160> you<00:06:30.220> equalize<00:06:30.810> look

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
back in and watching you equalize look

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.330 
back in and watching you equalize look
at<00:06:31.930> the<00:06:32.020> state<00:06:32.260> of<00:06:32.290> the<00:06:32.500> boiler<00:06:32.740> at<00:06:32.919> what<00:06:33.130> they

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
at the state of the boiler at what they

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.550 
at the state of the boiler at what they
met<00:06:33.610> but<00:06:34.450> anyway<00:06:34.810> at<00:06:34.930> least<00:06:34.990> you<00:06:35.260> know<00:06:35.380> what

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
met but anyway at least you know what

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.400 
met but anyway at least you know what
happens<00:06:35.950> if<00:06:36.070> you<00:06:36.220> overfill<00:06:36.700> the<00:06:36.850> boiler<00:06:37.410> this

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410 
happens if you overfill the boiler this

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.530 
happens if you overfill the boiler this
is<00:06:38.560> a<00:06:38.650> good<00:06:38.860> sign<00:06:39.130> a<00:06:39.460> bright<00:06:39.880> glow<00:06:40.180> in<00:06:40.330> the<00:06:40.480> ash

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
is a good sign a bright glow in the ash

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.240 
is a good sign a bright glow in the ash
pan

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
pan

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.309 
pan
and<00:06:42.250> this<00:06:42.400> is<00:06:42.580> a<00:06:42.639> good<00:06:42.819> fire<00:06:43.090> this<00:06:43.870> is<00:06:44.080> really

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 
and this is a good fire this is really

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:46.110 
and this is a good fire this is really
what<00:06:44.470> the<00:06:44.590> fire<00:06:44.770> wants<00:06:45.099> to<00:06:45.220> look<00:06:45.340> like<00:06:45.400> when

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
what the fire wants to look like when

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.629 
what the fire wants to look like when
you<00:06:46.240> run<00:06:46.449> in<00:06:46.599> the<00:06:46.690> boiler<00:06:47.099> because<00:06:48.099> the<00:06:48.430> fire

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 
you run in the boiler because the fire

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:50.670 
you run in the boiler because the fire
is<00:06:48.819> good<00:06:49.030> and<00:06:49.270> the<00:06:49.330> water<00:06:49.539> level<00:06:49.930> is<00:06:49.990> good<00:06:50.199> I'll

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
is good and the water level is good I'll

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.409 
is good and the water level is good I'll
take<00:06:50.889> this<00:06:51.039> opportunity<00:06:51.190> to<00:06:51.699> wipe<00:06:51.970> some<00:06:52.210> mess

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
take this opportunity to wipe some mess

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.480 
take this opportunity to wipe some mess
off<00:06:52.599> the<00:06:52.750> boiler<00:06:53.110> after<00:06:54.009> showing<00:06:54.250> what

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
off the boiler after showing what

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.300 
off the boiler after showing what
happens<00:06:54.849> when<00:06:55.120> you<00:06:55.240> overfill<00:06:55.810> the<00:06:55.930> boiler<00:06:56.310> but

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
happens when you overfill the boiler but

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.430 
happens when you overfill the boiler but
there's<00:06:57.460> a<00:06:57.550> definite<00:06:57.940> rhythm<00:06:58.180> when<00:06:58.930> using<00:06:59.199> a

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
there's a definite rhythm when using a

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.279 
there's a definite rhythm when using a
coal-fired<00:06:59.889> boiler<00:07:00.430> first<00:07:01.360> of<00:07:01.539> all<00:07:01.690> check<00:07:02.110> the

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:02.289 
coal-fired boiler first of all check the

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:05.670 
coal-fired boiler first of all check the
water<00:07:02.440> level<00:07:02.620> is<00:07:03.220> that<00:07:03.460> okay<00:07:03.879> yes<00:07:04.530> check<00:07:05.530> the

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 
water level is that okay yes check the

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.399 
water level is that okay yes check the
fire<00:07:06.090> because<00:07:07.090> the<00:07:07.240> fire<00:07:07.449> needs<00:07:07.720> some<00:07:07.930> coal<00:07:08.169> on

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:08.409 
fire because the fire needs some coal on

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:11.460 
fire because the fire needs some coal on
if<00:07:09.159> so<00:07:09.460> puts<00:07:09.729> you<00:07:09.879> coal<00:07:10.120> on<00:07:10.270> the<00:07:10.300> fire<00:07:10.470> but

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.470 
if so puts you coal on the fire but

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.040 
if so puts you coal on the fire but
never<00:07:11.710> ever<00:07:12.009> put<00:07:12.819> water<00:07:13.060> in<00:07:13.300> the<00:07:13.449> boiler<00:07:13.630> and

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
never ever put water in the boiler and

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.129 
never ever put water in the boiler and
coal<00:07:14.770> on<00:07:14.979> the<00:07:15.009> fire<00:07:15.130> at<00:07:15.520> the<00:07:15.669> same<00:07:15.849> time<00:07:16.210> you'll

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:17.139 
coal on the fire at the same time you'll

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:18.749 
coal on the fire at the same time you'll
get<00:07:17.349> a<00:07:17.380> massive<00:07:17.650> pressure<00:07:18.069> drop<00:07:18.340> if<00:07:18.490> you<00:07:18.610> do

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 
get a massive pressure drop if you do

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:21.540 
get a massive pressure drop if you do
with<00:07:19.259> because<00:07:20.259> it<00:07:20.380> takes<00:07:20.620> a<00:07:20.740> short<00:07:21.009> while<00:07:21.220> for

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
with because it takes a short while for

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.730 
with because it takes a short while for
the<00:07:21.639> coal<00:07:21.880> to<00:07:22.090> ignite<00:07:22.419> properly<00:07:22.900> and<00:07:23.139> give<00:07:23.620> the

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740 
the coal to ignite properly and give the

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.460 
the coal to ignite properly and give the
heat<00:07:23.919> by<00:07:24.880> using<00:07:25.150> a<00:07:25.389> blower<00:07:25.630> or<00:07:25.930> the<00:07:26.139> engines

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.740 
heat by using a blower or the engines
exhaust<00:07:26.650> you<00:07:27.580> draw<00:07:27.819> an<00:07:27.880> oxygen<00:07:28.030> through<00:07:28.630> the

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:28.750 
exhaust you draw an oxygen through the

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.080 
exhaust you draw an oxygen through the
fire<00:07:28.990> so<00:07:29.830> you<00:07:29.889> must<00:07:30.159> make<00:07:30.250> sure<00:07:30.430> that<00:07:30.639> the<00:07:30.849> fire

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.090 
fire so you must make sure that the fire

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.999 
fire so you must make sure that the fire
is<00:07:31.360> solid<00:07:31.780> with<00:07:31.960> no<00:07:32.169> holes<00:07:32.469> in<00:07:32.710> it<00:07:32.860> where

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:33.009 
is solid with no holes in it where

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:35.249 
is solid with no holes in it where
oxygen<00:07:33.430> can<00:07:33.789> get<00:07:33.909> straight<00:07:34.270> through<00:07:34.300> without

00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:35.259 
oxygen can get straight through without

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:39.240 
oxygen can get straight through without
aiding<00:07:35.710> the<00:07:35.860> combustion<00:07:37.620> this<00:07:38.620> is<00:07:38.800> the<00:07:38.949> end<00:07:39.069> of

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.250 
aiding the combustion this is the end of

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.749 
aiding the combustion this is the end of
the<00:07:39.340> run<00:07:39.550> I<00:07:39.759> just<00:07:40.180> let<00:07:40.659> the<00:07:40.750> fire<00:07:40.960> go<00:07:41.169> out

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 
the run I just let the fire go out

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.800 
the run I just let the fire go out
thanks<00:07:42.759> for<00:07:42.879> watching<00:07:43.210> and<00:07:43.330> I<00:07:43.360> hope<00:07:43.389> you<00:07:43.659> found

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:43.810 
thanks for watching and I hope you found

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.169 
thanks for watching and I hope you found
it<00:07:43.990> useful
