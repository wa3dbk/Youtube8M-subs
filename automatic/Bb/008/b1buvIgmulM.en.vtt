00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.550 
and these are my pride and Joy's at the
moment<00:00:09.330> these<00:00:10.330> are<00:00:10.390> all<00:00:10.690> cherry<00:00:11.020> tomatoes

moment these are all cherry tomatoes

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.590 
moment these are all cherry tomatoes
there's<00:00:11.890> four<00:00:12.610> of<00:00:12.640> them<00:00:12.730> in<00:00:12.970> total<00:00:13.150> as<00:00:13.390> you<00:00:13.480> can

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.600 
there's four of them in total as you can

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.819 
there's four of them in total as you can
see<00:00:13.780> by<00:00:13.960> the<00:00:14.019> base<00:00:14.370> one<00:00:15.370> two<00:00:16.560> three<00:00:17.560> on<00:00:17.589> the

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:17.829 
see by the base one two three on the

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.550 
see by the base one two three on the
other<00:00:17.919> side<00:00:18.310> and<00:00:18.699> then<00:00:19.689> I've<00:00:19.810> got<00:00:20.019> one<00:00:20.230> more<00:00:20.259> in

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
other side and then I've got one more in

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.999 
other side and then I've got one more in
its<00:00:20.679> own<00:00:20.829> separate<00:00:21.279> pot<00:00:21.579> here<00:00:22.589> now<00:00:23.589> the<00:00:23.650> reason

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
its own separate pot here now the reason

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.919 
its own separate pot here now the reason
I<00:00:24.070> did<00:00:24.249> that<00:00:24.279> I<00:00:24.429> wanted<00:00:24.789> to<00:00:24.880> see<00:00:25.089> how<00:00:25.599> they

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
I did that I wanted to see how they

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.779 
I did that I wanted to see how they
would<00:00:26.079> grow<00:00:26.380> what<00:00:27.189> the<00:00:27.310> difference<00:00:27.640> would<00:00:27.730> be

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
would grow what the difference would be

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.360 
would grow what the difference would be
in<00:00:27.939> terms<00:00:28.329> of<00:00:29.159> having<00:00:30.210> its<00:00:31.210> own<00:00:31.480> pot<00:00:32.370> versus

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
in terms of having its own pot versus

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.700 
in terms of having its own pot versus
being<00:00:33.610> bunched<00:00:34.420> together<00:00:34.540> three<00:00:35.380> of<00:00:35.470> them<00:00:35.620> in

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
being bunched together three of them in

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.470 
being bunched together three of them in
a<00:00:35.800> row<00:00:37.170> results<00:00:38.170> being<00:00:38.350> so<00:00:38.620> far<00:00:39.480> you

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
a row results being so far you

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.910 
a row results being so far you
definitely<00:00:41.050> get<00:00:41.920> a<00:00:41.980> lot<00:00:42.220> of<00:00:42.460> Greenidge<00:00:43.060> in

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
definitely get a lot of Greenidge in

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.440 
definitely get a lot of Greenidge in
this<00:00:44.920> one<00:00:45.100> there's<00:00:45.280> a<00:00:45.340> lot<00:00:45.460> more<00:00:45.700> foliage<00:00:46.120> than

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
this one there's a lot more foliage than

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.680 
this one there's a lot more foliage than
as<00:00:49.450> you<00:00:49.660> can<00:00:49.810> see<00:00:50.020> here<00:00:50.850> then<00:00:51.850> on<00:00:52.150> the<00:00:52.510> one

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
as you can see here then on the one

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.250 
as you can see here then on the one
plant<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:56.170> this<00:00:56.320> one<00:00:56.470> definitely<00:00:56.770> is

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
plant but this one definitely is

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.450 
plant but this one definitely is
producing<00:00:59.260> much<00:00:59.560> more<00:00:59.890> fruit<00:01:00.550> as<00:01:00.880> you<00:01:01.090> can<00:01:01.240> see

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
producing much more fruit as you can see

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.280 
producing much more fruit as you can see
we<00:01:03.460> tried<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.210> count<00:01:04.449> out<00:01:04.659> the<00:01:04.690> number<00:01:05.140> of

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
we tried to count out the number of

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.070 
we tried to count out the number of
tomatoes<00:01:06.070> that<00:01:06.220> were<00:01:06.400> on<00:01:06.580> this<00:01:07.390> single<00:01:07.900> one

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
tomatoes that were on this single one

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.630 
tomatoes that were on this single one
the<00:01:08.620> other<00:01:08.770> day<00:01:08.950> and<00:01:09.480> we<00:01:10.480> counted<00:01:10.960> over<00:01:11.610> 50<00:01:12.610> of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
the other day and we counted over 50 of

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.690 
the other day and we counted over 50 of
them<00:01:12.940> I<00:01:13.030> believe<00:01:13.330> it<00:01:13.480> may<00:01:13.570> have<00:01:13.659> been<00:01:13.750> 75<00:01:14.700> so

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
them I believe it may have been 75 so

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.860 
them I believe it may have been 75 so
not<00:01:16.360> too<00:01:16.690> bad<00:01:16.960> for<00:01:17.440> indoor<00:01:18.070> growing

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
not too bad for indoor growing

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.080 
not too bad for indoor growing
especially<00:01:19.870> considering<00:01:20.500> it<00:01:20.650> is<00:01:21.010> it<00:01:22.000> is

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
especially considering it is it is

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.350 
especially considering it is it is
February<00:01:22.440> mid<00:01:23.440> February<00:01:23.950> for<00:01:24.640> late<00:01:24.820> February

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
there we've got a ways to go yet that is

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.060 
there we've got a ways to go yet that is
a<00:01:58.570> cucumber<00:01:59.110> plant<00:01:59.650> now<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:02.110> one<00:02:02.350> right<00:02:02.530> here

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
a cucumber plant now this one right here

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.090 
a cucumber plant now this one right here
I've<00:02:03.670> actually<00:02:04.540> already<00:02:05.200> harvested

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
I've actually already harvested

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.419 
I've actually already harvested
cucumbers<00:02:06.700> from<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:08.649> something<00:02:09.039> funny<00:02:09.280> was

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
cucumbers from but something funny was

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.370 
cucumbers from but something funny was
happening<00:02:09.880> with<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.119> leaves<00:02:10.360> I<00:02:10.720> think<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:11.260> was

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
happening with the leaves I think it was

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.470 
happening with the leaves I think it was
either<00:02:11.860> powdery<00:02:12.370> mildew<00:02:12.790> or<00:02:13.030> maybe<00:02:13.390> a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
either powdery mildew or maybe a

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.199 
either powdery mildew or maybe a
nutrient<00:02:14.020> deficiency<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:15.730> they<00:02:15.850> were<00:02:15.910> going

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
nutrient deficiency but they were going

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.380 
nutrient deficiency but they were going
brown<00:02:16.570> and<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.170> starting<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:18.780> necrotize<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:21.250> I

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
brown and and starting to necrotize so I

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.800 
brown and and starting to necrotize so I
chopped<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.540> all<00:02:22.630> back<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:24.239> it's<00:02:25.239> it<00:02:25.450> started

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
chopped it all back and it's it started

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.170 
chopped it all back and it's it started
sprouting<00:02:26.170> out<00:02:26.410> new<00:02:26.650> roots<00:02:26.890> or<00:02:27.190> new<00:02:27.430> shoots

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
sprouting out new roots or new shoots

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.080 
sprouting out new roots or new shoots
and<00:02:28.830> as<00:02:29.830> you<00:02:29.950> can<00:02:30.040> see<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.400> leaves<00:02:30.580> leaves<00:02:30.880> are

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
and as you can see the leaves leaves are

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.520 
and as you can see the leaves leaves are
very<00:02:31.120> healthy<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:33.060> yeah<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.450> should<00:02:35.410> get

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
very healthy so yeah that should get

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.690 
very healthy so yeah that should get
some<00:02:35.680> more<00:02:35.709> cucumbers<00:02:36.280> out<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:36.580> and

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
some more cucumbers out of that and

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
naturally a bit of a pain to grow from

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.970 
naturally a bit of a pain to grow from
seed

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980

they<00:03:34.790> usually<00:03:35.390> recommend<00:03:36.100> growing<00:03:37.100> them<00:03:37.220> from

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
they usually recommend growing them from

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
the feeders that are the runners that

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.970 
the feeders that are the runners that
come<00:03:39.890> off<00:03:40.069> them<00:03:41.110> but<00:03:42.110> I<00:03:42.290> wanted<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.650> see<00:03:42.860> what

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980
