classic version and there'll be other
small<00:00:46.380> differences<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.700> timing<00:00:49.040> only<00:00:50.040> make

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
small differences just timing only make

small differences just timing only make
shots<00:00:50.430> you'll<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:50.970> that<00:00:51.180> coming<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.690> real

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
shots you'll see that coming up real

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.530 
shots you'll see that coming up real
soon<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.830> room<00:00:53.100> right<00:00:53.130> here<00:00:53.390> notice<00:00:54.390> I'm

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
soon in this room right here notice I'm

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.479 
soon in this room right here notice I'm
power<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.080> how<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.290> don't<00:00:55.590> quite<00:00:55.950> make<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
power it up how I don't quite make it to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.720 
power it up how I don't quite make it to
the<00:00:56.730> end<00:00:56.940> without<00:00:57.570> getting<00:00:58.020> hit<00:00:58.520> but<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the end without getting hit but on the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.250 
the end without getting hit but on the
classic<00:01:00.120> version<00:01:00.150> I<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.720> just<00:01:00.870> run<00:01:01.080> straight

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
classic version I can just run straight

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.930 
classic version I can just run straight
through<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.920> woke<00:01:02.640> ahead<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:07.520> mean<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> layout

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
through and woke ahead I mean the layout

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.320 
through and woke ahead I mean the layout
is<00:01:08.970> pretty<00:01:09.420> safe<00:01:13.790> that's<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
is pretty safe that's just one of the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.430 
is pretty safe that's just one of the
differences<00:01:15.930> there<00:01:17.119> now<00:01:18.119> one<00:01:18.440> huge

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
differences there now one huge

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.760 
differences there now one huge
difference<00:01:20.360> we're<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.509> were<00:01:21.560> classic<00:01:22.560> version

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
difference we're on were classic version

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.850 
difference we're on were classic version
is<00:01:23.070> at<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> moment<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.649> reach<00:01:25.649> that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
is at the moment is that reach that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.160 
is at the moment is that reach that
ladder<00:01:26.190> they're<00:01:26.550> much<00:01:27.180> easier<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:27.780> some

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
ladder they're much easier for some

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.719 
ladder they're much easier for some
reason<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> classic<00:01:29.070> word<00:01:29.250> when<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.490> guess

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
reason the classic word when I guess

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.160 
reason the classic word when I guess
because<00:01:29.940> it's<00:01:30.090> easier<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.690> tell<00:01:30.899> where<00:01:31.080> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
because it's easier to tell where you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.350 
because it's easier to tell where you
are

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.190 

coming<00:01:36.360> up<00:01:36.450> around<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> classic<00:01:37.170> version

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
coming up around the classic version

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.620 
coming up around the classic version
you're<00:01:37.649> gonna<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:38.070> me<00:01:38.280> forget<00:01:39.030> which<00:01:39.240> button

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
you're gonna see me forget which button

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.950 
you're gonna see me forget which button
is<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.049> jump<00:01:40.500> button<00:01:41.600> momentarily

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.590 

actually<00:01:47.799> all<00:01:48.799> right<00:01:48.920> on<00:01:49.100> powered<00:01:50.030> up<00:01:50.150> version

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
actually all right on powered up version

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.040 
actually all right on powered up version
will<00:01:51.320> say<00:01:51.500> I<00:01:51.530> picked<00:01:51.770> up<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:51.979> powerup<00:01:52.369> I<00:01:53.050> believe

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
will say I picked up a powerup I believe

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.109 
will say I picked up a powerup I believe
they<00:01:54.350> don't<00:01:54.560> come<00:01:54.890> back<00:01:55.220> if<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.640> scroll<00:01:55.970> off

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
robots are quite easy and powered up

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.300 
robots are quite easy and powered up
version<00:02:10.510> so<00:02:11.510> here<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:11.810> my<00:02:12.170> display<00:02:12.800> of<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.190> in

the<00:02:13.400> classic<00:02:13.910> version<00:02:13.940> will<00:02:14.480> grab<00:02:14.780> this<00:02:14.959> power

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
the classic version will grab this power

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.090 
the classic version will grab this power
