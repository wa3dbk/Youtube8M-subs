actual production releases just these

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.410 
actual production releases just these
ones<00:00:16.560> happen<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.949> say<00:00:17.100> for<00:00:17.400> display<00:00:17.640> only<00:00:17.670> this

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
ones happen to say for display only this

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.420

is the earthbound box normally it's much
much<00:00:20.609> bigger<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.420> smaller<00:00:21.689> version

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
much bigger so the smaller version

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.320 
much bigger so the smaller version
actually<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.470> quite<00:00:22.619> sought-after<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.820> it

the box on top of this one they look the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
than for display only the pin I guess is

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.690 
than for display only the pin I guess is
a<00:01:06.990> little<00:01:07.229> bit<00:01:07.470> different<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:07.979> both<00:01:08.070> there<00:01:08.640> are

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.400

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.990
