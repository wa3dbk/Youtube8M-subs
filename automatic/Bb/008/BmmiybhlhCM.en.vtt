for carrying everyday carry and let's
take<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.719> look<00:00:39.960> at<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.850> titanium<00:00:41.850> handle<00:00:42.030> scales

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
take a look at it titanium handle scales

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.400 
take a look at it titanium handle scales
top<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.320> bottom<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.910> polished<00:00:44.910> hardware

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
top and bottom that polished hardware

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.389 
top and bottom that polished hardware
gives<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.649> really<00:00:46.980> cool<00:00:47.010> look<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:49.399> shouldn't

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
gives it a really cool look I shouldn't

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
say polished hardware polished pivot

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.270 
say polished hardware polished pivot
screw<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:54.480> hardware<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:55.620> polished<00:00:56.100> than

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
screw the hardware is more polished than

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.380 
screw the hardware is more polished than
the<00:00:56.430> handle<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.360> much<00:00:57.539> as<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.289> pivot

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
the handle but not so much as the pivot

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.670 
the handle but not so much as the pivot
could<00:01:00.390> look<00:01:00.480> at<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.719> blade<00:01:01.020> same<00:01:01.410> blade

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
could look at that blade same blade

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.380 
could look at that blade same blade
shape<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> 452<00:01:03.120> series<00:01:03.920> of<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.909> grind<00:01:06.180> on

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
shape as the 452 series of the grind on

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.210 
shape as the 452 series of the grind on
that<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.530> frame<00:01:10.979> lock

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
that and then this is a frame lock

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:20.510 
that and then this is a frame lock
design<00:01:14.630> steel<00:01:15.630> insert<00:01:16.080> there<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
design steel insert there and on the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.990 
design steel insert there and on the
back<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:21.060> see<00:01:21.530> 450<00:01:22.530> made<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.729> u.s.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
back you can see 450 made in the u.s.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.590 
back you can see 450 made in the u.s.
syncovich<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.030> s35vn<00:01:27.030> steel

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
syncovich and this is the s35vn steel

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.749 
syncovich and this is the s35vn steel
and<00:01:28.049> then<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.409> course<00:01:28.439> they<00:01:28.920> are<00:01:29.009> all<00:01:29.220> serial

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
and then of course they are all serial

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.340 
and then of course they are all serial
numbered<00:01:30.500> this<00:01:31.500> has<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.100> kvt<00:01:33.030> ball<00:01:33.990> bearing

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
numbered this has the kvt ball bearing

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.920 
numbered this has the kvt ball bearing
system<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.640> comes<00:01:35.970> out<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.720> really

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
system and it comes out really really

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.310 
system and it comes out really really
nice<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.520> see<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.880> detent<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.509> pretty

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
nice you can see that detent is pretty

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.830 
nice you can see that detent is pretty
stiff<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.579> does<00:01:41.759> take<00:01:42.030> some<00:01:42.060> force<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> get

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
stiff so it does take some force to get

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
stiff so it does take some force to get
it<00:01:42.930> out<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.500> when<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.740> does<00:01:43.890> come<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
it out but when it does come out it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.179 
it out but when it does come out it
flies<00:01:45.149> out<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.680> also<00:01:46.829> see<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
flies out of there you can also see the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.679 
flies out of there you can also see the
detail<00:01:47.579> when<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.820> go<00:01:47.970> ahead<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.149> close<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
detail when I go ahead and close the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.210 
detail when I go ahead and close the
blade<00:01:51.020> see<00:01:52.020> how<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.229> snaps<00:01:52.409> back<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:53.070> there

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
blade see how it snaps back in there

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.310 
blade see how it snaps back in there
nicely<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:55.340> there<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.960> good<00:01:57.960> look<00:01:58.140> at<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
nicely and there is good look at the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.980 
nicely and there is good look at the
lock<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.850> right<00:01:59.850> in<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.000> middle<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.299> 50%<00:02:02.990> solid

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
lock up right in the middle of 50% solid

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.800 
lock up right in the middle of 50% solid
lock<00:02:04.200> up<00:02:04.500> zero<00:02:04.829> side-to-side<00:02:05.250> play<00:02:05.810> zero

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
lock up zero side-to-side play zero

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.229 
lock up zero side-to-side play zero
up-and-down<00:02:07.320> play<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.879> great

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
up-and-down play this is just a great

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.040 
up-and-down play this is just a great

blade 3.25 inches of that
thirty-five<00:02:12.410> bien<00:02:12.740> steel<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.840> seems<00:02:15.140> like<00:02:15.260> a

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
thirty-five bien steel it seems like a

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.710 
thirty-five bien steel it seems like a
longer<00:02:15.890> blade<00:02:16.310> for<00:02:16.760> how<00:02:16.880> big<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.300> knife<00:02:17.480> is

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
longer blade for how big the knife is

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.570
