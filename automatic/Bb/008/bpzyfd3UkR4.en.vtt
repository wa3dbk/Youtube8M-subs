00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
a genuine strategy that pretty much

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.350 
a genuine strategy that pretty much
everybody<00:00:11.040> uses<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.670> beat<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:11.969> now<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.179> did

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
come up with this on my own but I

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.350 
come up with this on my own but I
realize<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> lot<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.429> other<00:00:14.700> people<00:00:15.000> do<00:00:15.150> use

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
realize a lot of other people do use

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.550 
realize a lot of other people do use
this<00:00:15.450> because<00:00:15.630> there<00:00:15.809> are<00:00:15.870> very<00:00:16.199> few

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
this because there are very few

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.740 
this because there are very few
strategical<00:00:17.310> options<00:00:17.640> on<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.000> night<00:00:18.210> but<00:00:18.690> I

strategical options on this night but I
put<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> twist<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:19.710> which<00:00:19.949> I'll<00:00:20.100> be

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
put a twist on this which I'll be

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.250 
put a twist on this which I'll be
explaining<00:00:20.550> later<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.869> I'm<00:00:22.020> going<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.199> go

explaining later but I'm going to go
through<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.500> bare<00:00:22.650> bones<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> strategy

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
through the bare bones of the strategy

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.279 
through the bare bones of the strategy
first<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.210> do<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.390> understand<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.170> actual

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
strategy right you know I knew that

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.420 
strategy right you know I knew that
other<00:00:54.719> people<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.010> when<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.190> checked

things like well I'm doing this right

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.939 
things like well I'm doing this right
then<00:00:58.680> why<00:00:59.010> aren't<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.309> beating<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.379> you

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
then why aren't I beating it and so you

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.170 
then why aren't I beating it and so you
know<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> right<00:01:02.520> all<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.000> want<00:01:03.120> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
know this is the right all you want to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.399 
know this is the right all you want to
be<00:01:03.239> doing<00:01:03.420> stuff<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.260> something

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
be doing stuff in but it's something

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.399 
be doing stuff in but it's something
else<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.680> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> really<00:01:05.189> help<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.640> out

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
else it's going to really help you out

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.270 
else it's going to really help you out
so<00:01:07.409> let's<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.710> go<00:01:07.799> through<00:01:07.830> what<00:01:08.189> that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
so let's just go through what that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.880 
so let's just go through what that
strategy<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:10.170> reason<00:01:10.409> everyone<00:01:10.590> does

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
strategy is and the reason everyone does

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.289 
strategy is and the reason everyone does
it<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.250> course<00:01:11.400> there<00:01:11.670> are<00:01:11.790> very<00:01:12.060> few

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it is of course there are very few

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.179 
it is of course there are very few
options<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.930> know<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.409> any<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.830> other<00:01:13.979> way<00:01:14.159> of

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
options I know of any one other way of

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.280 
options I know of any one other way of
doing<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.659> didn't<00:01:15.840> work<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.020> me

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
doing this and it didn't work for me

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.609 
doing this and it didn't work for me
either<00:01:16.610> but<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.570> seen<00:01:18.960> other<00:01:19.229> people<00:01:19.409> do

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
either but I have seen other people do

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.740 
either but I have seen other people do
it<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.830> only<00:01:19.979> look<00:01:20.130> at<00:01:20.220> left<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:20.750> but

working<00:02:54.659> for<00:02:54.989> me<00:02:55.109> but<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.620> still<00:02:55.889> is<00:02:56.189> still

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489

giving foxy his flash and pretty sure it
is<00:02:58.560> anyway<00:02:58.739> because<00:02:58.889> he<00:02:59.159> really<00:02:59.459> should<00:02:59.579> have

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
is anyway because he really should have

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.849 
is anyway because he really should have
killed<00:02:59.819> me<00:02:59.970> else<00:03:00.180> because<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:00.989> if<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.590> didn't

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859

count<00:03:01.980> as<00:03:02.099> a<00:03:02.189> flash<00:03:02.430> then<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:02.879> hadn't<00:03:03.150> flashed

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
count as a flash then I hadn't flashed

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.179 
count as a flash then I hadn't flashed
him<00:03:03.510> in<00:03:03.599> ages<00:03:03.689> or<00:03:04.590> at<00:03:04.680> least<00:03:04.829> his<00:03:04.950> eye<00:03:05.040> with

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
hearts in his way I just wouldn't have

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.240 
hearts in his way I just wouldn't have
worked<00:03:06.419> at<00:03:06.569> all<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:07.379> that<00:03:07.530> must<00:03:07.680> give<00:03:07.889> at<00:03:08.069> least

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
worked at all so that must give at least

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.129 
worked at all so that must give at least
some<00:03:08.579> somewhat<00:03:09.299> of<00:03:09.359> a<00:03:09.419> flash<00:03:09.629> to<00:03:09.810> him<00:03:09.930> which

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
some somewhat of a flash to him which

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.559 
some somewhat of a flash to him which
works<00:03:10.349> quite<00:03:10.439> well<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:11.519> if<00:03:11.609> I<00:03:11.730> don't<00:03:11.790> don't

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
works quite well so and if I don't don't

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.869 
works quite well so and if I don't don't
just<00:03:12.930> flash<00:03:13.739> when<00:03:14.159> it's<00:03:14.280> not<00:03:14.459> that<00:03:14.669> and

pretty<00:05:40.570> much<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:40.780> same<00:05:40.900> sort<00:05:41.080> of<00:05:41.169> thing

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
pretty much the same sort of thing

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.500 
pretty much the same sort of thing
I<00:05:41.590> wasn't<00:05:42.010> winding<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.400> Box<00:05:42.640> up<00:05:42.820> enough<00:05:43.090> and

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
I wasn't winding the Box up enough and

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.290 
I wasn't winding the Box up enough and
it<00:05:43.750> was<00:05:43.840> really<00:05:44.110> screwing<00:05:44.440> me<00:05:44.620> over<00:05:44.650> and<00:05:45.300> the

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
it was really screwing me over and the

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.150 
it was really screwing me over and the
way<00:05:46.419> I<00:05:46.450> conquered<00:05:46.930> this<00:05:47.080> is<00:05:47.290> with<00:05:47.560> a<00:05:47.740> complete

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
way I conquered this is with a complete

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.219 
way I conquered this is with a complete
twist<00:05:48.490> which<00:05:48.820> defies<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:49.330> normal<00:05:49.870> game<00:05:50.020> logic

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
twist which defies the normal game logic

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.960 
twist which defies the normal game logic
but<00:05:50.500> it<00:05:50.620> it<00:05:50.830> helped<00:05:51.160> me<00:05:51.220> out<00:05:51.280> here<00:05:51.520> if<00:05:51.640> I<00:05:51.700> stop

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
but it it helped me out here if I stop

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.219 
but it it helped me out here if I stop
talking<00:05:52.120> for<00:05:52.360> a<00:05:52.450> second<00:05:52.780> you'll<00:05:52.900> see<00:05:52.960> what<00:05:53.169> I

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
talking for a second you'll see what I

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.100 
talking for a second you'll see what I
mean<00:05:53.490> there's<00:05:54.490> no<00:05:54.610> sound<00:05:54.850> I<00:05:55.150> played<00:05:55.720> this<00:05:55.870> game

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
mean there's no sound I played this game

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.790 
mean there's no sound I played this game
on<00:05:56.169> mute

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
on mute

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.520 
on mute
I<00:05:56.830> took<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.610> sound<00:05:57.790> off<00:05:58.060> I<00:05:58.300> played<00:05:58.870> it<00:05:59.080> a<00:05:59.229> much

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
I took the sound off I played it a much

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.380 
I took the sound off I played it a much
more<00:05:59.560> confidently<00:06:00.280> much<00:06:00.460> more<00:06:00.640> relaxed<00:06:01.240> and

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
more confidently much more relaxed and

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.150 
more confidently much more relaxed and
as<00:06:01.960> a<00:06:02.020> result<00:06:02.320> I<00:06:02.380> actually<00:06:02.530> beat<00:06:02.860> the<00:06:02.950> night<00:06:03.130> I

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
as a result I actually beat the night I

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.590 
as a result I actually beat the night I
can't<00:06:03.580> guarantee<00:06:03.760> this<00:06:04.030> will<00:06:04.150> work<00:06:04.300> for<00:06:04.450> you

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
can't guarantee this will work for you

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.780 
can't guarantee this will work for you
but<00:06:05.260> if<00:06:05.410> the<00:06:05.830> reason<00:06:06.130> you're<00:06:06.250> not<00:06:06.280> beating<00:06:06.640> the

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
but if the reason you're not beating the

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.909 
but if the reason you're not beating the
night<00:06:07.030> is<00:06:07.510> because<00:06:07.720> of<00:06:08.050> sloppy<00:06:08.260> mistakes<00:06:08.740> you

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
night is because of sloppy mistakes you

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.710 
night is because of sloppy mistakes you
know<00:06:08.950> you're<00:06:09.190> making<00:06:09.520> mistakes<00:06:10.419> that<00:06:10.540> you

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
know you're making mistakes that you

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.719 
know you're making mistakes that you
know<00:06:11.200> after<00:06:11.590> the<00:06:11.680> game<00:06:11.710> you're<00:06:11.979> like<00:06:12.130> you're

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
know after the game you're like you're

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.219 
know after the game you're like you're
more<00:06:12.910> annoyed<00:06:13.390> and<00:06:13.630> scared<00:06:13.900> at<00:06:14.020> the<00:06:14.080> end

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
more annoyed and scared at the end

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.110 
more annoyed and scared at the end
because<00:06:14.680> like<00:06:14.950> I<00:06:15.070> I<00:06:15.130> should<00:06:15.400> have<00:06:15.729> beaten<00:06:15.940> out

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
because like I I should have beaten out

I<00:06:16.150> that<00:06:16.930> was<00:06:17.020> my<00:06:17.050> own<00:06:17.290> mistake<00:06:17.680> there<00:06:18.610> was<00:06:18.700> no

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
I that was my own mistake there was no

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.490 
I that was my own mistake there was no
reasons<00:06:19.270> to<00:06:19.330> do<00:06:19.540> that<00:06:19.570> then<00:06:19.900> it<00:06:20.050> was<00:06:20.169> just<00:06:20.350> a

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
reasons to do that then it was just a

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.930 
reasons to do that then it was just a
mistake

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940

in one of my other videos I think it's

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.140 
in one of my other videos I think it's
top<00:06:59.770> five<00:06:59.949> on<00:07:00.070> electronics<00:07:00.520> that<00:07:00.639> happens<00:07:00.970> in

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
top five on electronics that happens in

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.570 
top five on electronics that happens in
where<00:07:01.690> I<00:07:01.720> was<00:07:01.930> just<00:07:02.020> a<00:07:02.139> stupid<00:07:02.380> error<00:07:02.680> that's

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580
