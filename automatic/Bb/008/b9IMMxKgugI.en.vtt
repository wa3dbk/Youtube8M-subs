 this crazy week but lisa franklyn 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.930
 who will try to fetch the first 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.780
 title for the united states since 1990 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.490
 but here are beenkens some one of the 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.550
 two Dutch Olympic champion 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:38.610
 in 2008 world recordin roussin du 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:41.290
 4 x 100 m relay of the cops 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.270
 the reigning Olympic champion she 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.000
 also is Dutch anomie 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.979
 chlomovitch to jo she trains to 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.680
 eindhoven and she will try to go 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.300
 look for an Olympic title that countries 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.810
 down did not win any more 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.000
 boyne in 2000 here is keith campbell if 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.580
 impressive 52 33 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.259
 at the start of the relay she this month she 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.729
 should on paper impose the 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:09.700
 problem is that she knows herself to want 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.959
 upset the Australian swimmer with 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.780
 also the one that did the best 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.610
 semifinal time sarah sjoestroem 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.680

 Swedish on 100 m butterfly yes 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.520
 completely uninhibited sarah sjoestroem 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.070
 who has returned to his all better 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.050
 level after a few years of doubts to 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.850
 to have been world champion in the 100m 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.800
 butterfly with a combination 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.420
 nine it was a little the victim of this 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.690
 new material she regained confidence 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.590
 in her 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.580
 sum is the only one to be passed under 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.880
 the 53 in the half cambridge 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.350
 audio 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.910
 she has not passed yet 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.350
 certain of 53 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.510
 she did 53 00 missy franklin a 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.160
 water line number from the 2nd 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:58.630
 from the top but here 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:01.240
 the Australian kate cambor the finals 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.710
 100m feminine with a real between 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.930
 united states and australia had 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.790
 someone tied me by ten and of course the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.650
 Dutch Olympic champion all 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.790
 clad orange clinging to 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.620
 the Australian but she develops 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.050
 a lot of power on this first 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.550
 50 m danger it will be at the moment it will be necessary 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.760
 turn your arms faster like the anr 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.189
 mendes about 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.349
 the feelings she left 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.599
 like yannick agnel on 200 m freestyle 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.099
 campbell's cate who's round is about 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.690
 May 2 world record bases to buy 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.580
 paul vi n do not hesitate justice in Cairo 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.310
 the abilities the friend 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.820
 she really gets engaged on the arms is 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.820
 the first 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.690
 look at the red line of the record of 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.129
 world with kate as badly upset by 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.170
 injuries these past two seasons 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.790
 it's better this year at all times 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.129
 she is leading with behind the 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.379
 Chinese promised to stand there alone 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.349
 still a pure query as Basel and 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.390
 Australia sacred thanks to this sacred 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.030
 keith campbell's number 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.379
 second and third place what's me 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.540
 tied to 12 years for the champion 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.329
 Olympic the Landes May 20 clock is 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.459
 ok but how do you think about and audio and 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:09.000
 still not pass the 53 seconds 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:12.030
 does the combelle 52 seconds 34 a 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.670
 hundredth of his time at the start of the 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.380
 4 x 100 and that's neither more nor less than the 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.220
 fourth best world performance 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.430
 all time 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.780
 only lonely steffen britta and go over 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.500
 fast but it was with combinations 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.169
 polyurethane 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.699
 but the return of britta steffen on it 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.340
 knew it was not enough here to 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:33.240
 go up only 6th 53.7 while 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.910
 keith campbell she really managed to 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.229
 relieve them because she had two 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.120
 years of doubts with these diseases and 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.940
 and then she comes back she held these are 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.930
 m to the end and for five hundredths 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.610
 nisi franklyn misses the podium 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.280
 the American who was trying to win 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.789
 seven titles here and well put 6 franklyn 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.240
 for 5 hundredths behind kromowidjodjo 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:05:01.740
 finished at the foot of the podium 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:03.960
 53 seconds 47 for messi yet you 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.330
 saw it all sweat slows down 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.190
 come back very hard but it was not enough 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.120
 to catch up with kromowidjodjo that leaves 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.650
 which at basic speed of about 50 m 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.870
 faster than messi frontier 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.699
 information also americans 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.949
 are still not on the podium 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.080
 the last time it was in 2005 it was 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.880
 with you even alia ray well it will take 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.950
 maybe wait ten years to see 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.500
 american back on the podium and this 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.270
 may be a franklin missile and 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.410
 still no German medals has 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.390
 still not yeah there I believe she 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.320
 is there to rule on the 100 meters 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.810
 for some years 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.010
 keith campbell because she had 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.010
 need to reassure yourself here
