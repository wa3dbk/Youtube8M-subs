00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
at the VR where the touchpad is if you

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.799 
at the VR where the touchpad is if you
swipe<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.610> left<00:00:38.640> that's<00:00:39.239> how<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.450> go<00:00:39.600> left

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
swipe to the left that's how you go left

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.540

so when you're actually wearing the VR
you're<00:00:42.090> swiping<00:00:42.480> back<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:43.140> go<00:00:43.290> left<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.680> that

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
you're swiping back to go left if that

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.549

makes sense so swipe left or right to go

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.529
