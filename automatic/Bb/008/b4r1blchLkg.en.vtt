shoot<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.000> get<00:00:45.649> but<00:00:46.649> these<00:00:46.829> were<00:00:47.039> really<00:00:47.489> tough

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
shoot I get but these were really tough

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.470 
shoot I get but these were really tough

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
I was going to get the 2013 pairs but

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.189 
I was going to get the 2013 pairs but
the<00:00:58.109> main<00:00:58.320> offset<00:00:58.920> from<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.390> was<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> inside

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199

the<00:01:01.829> 2013's<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.850> more<00:01:03.350> stitched<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.970> feel

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the 2013's have more stitched in feel

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.080 
the 2013's have more stitched in feel
whereas<00:01:06.450> these<00:01:06.689> are<00:01:07.640> more<00:01:08.640> padding<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:10.110> also

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
whereas these are more padding and also

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.560

smoother<00:01:13.520> look<00:01:14.520> at<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> padding<00:01:15.060> note<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.540> I

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
smoother look at the padding note so I

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:26.480
