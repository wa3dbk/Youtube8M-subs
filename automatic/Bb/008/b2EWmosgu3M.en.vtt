magazine to test 15 other printers back
before<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.740> da<00:00:16.830> Vinci<00:00:17.160> was<00:00:17.190> even<00:00:17.580> around<00:00:18.140> so

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
before the da Vinci was even around so

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.130 
before the da Vinci was even around so
I'm<00:00:19.199> gonna<00:00:19.350> test<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:19.980> print<00:00:20.539> on<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:22.020> da

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
I'm gonna test this print on the da

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:34.490 
I'm gonna test this print on the da
Vinci<00:00:32.210> here's<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.270> print<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.079> was<00:00:34.230> seen<00:00:34.469> in

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
Vinci here's a print as it was seen in

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.920 
Vinci here's a print as it was seen in
the<00:00:34.829> magazine

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.130 

Thingiverse<00:00:38.380> file<00:00:38.680> shows<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.580> arch<00:00:40.140> with

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
Thingiverse file shows the arch with

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.980 
Thingiverse file shows the arch with
nine<00:00:41.470> pulls<00:00:41.860> here<00:00:42.190> on<00:00:42.310> the<00:00:42.400> back<00:00:42.610> and<00:00:42.990> then

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
nine pulls here on the back and then

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.620 
nine pulls here on the back and then
there's<00:00:44.200> holes<00:00:44.620> one<00:00:45.610> that<00:00:45.940> is<00:00:46.090> six<00:00:46.360> sided

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
there's holes one that is six sided

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.280 
there's holes one that is six sided
hexagon<00:00:47.670> plus<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.850> box<00:00:49.090> which<00:00:49.540> has<00:00:49.810> different

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
hexagon plus the box which has different

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.410 
hexagon plus the box which has different
thickness<00:00:50.680> walls

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.380 

so<00:00:54.380> I<00:00:54.410> brought<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.800> file<00:00:55.070> into<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.489> xyzware

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
so I brought the file into the xyzware

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.410 
so I brought the file into the xyzware
for<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:56.989> da<00:00:57.140> Vinci<00:00:57.440> printer

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
for the da Vinci printer

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.569 
for the da Vinci printer
now<00:01:00.170> this<00:01:00.320> is<00:01:00.500> where<00:01:00.620> my<00:01:00.770> print<00:01:01.070> may<00:01:01.250> have<00:01:01.370> been

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
now this is where my print may have been

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.790 
now this is where my print may have been
a<00:01:01.610> little<00:01:01.940> bit<00:01:02.059> different<00:01:02.450> I<00:01:02.660> hit<00:01:03.260> export<00:01:03.530> and

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
a little bit different I hit export and

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.049 
a little bit different I hit export and
left<00:01:03.950> everything<00:01:04.430> where<00:01:04.580> I<00:01:04.610> thought<00:01:04.879> was

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
left everything where I thought was

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.600 
left everything where I thought was
default<00:01:05.510> then<00:01:06.229> later<00:01:06.500> on<00:01:06.590> I<00:01:06.740> realized<00:01:07.159> if<00:01:07.520> I

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
default then later on I realized if I

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.250 
default then later on I realized if I
were<00:01:07.700> to<00:01:07.790> hit<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.060> default<00:01:08.450> button<00:01:08.720> it<00:01:09.140> would

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
were to hit the default button it would

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.570 
were to hit the default button it would
have<00:01:09.350> changed<00:01:09.380> from<00:01:09.740> a<00:01:09.890> point<00:01:10.100> to<00:01:10.220> layer

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
have changed from a point to layer

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.640 
have changed from a point to layer
height<00:01:10.850> to<00:01:11.030> a<00:01:11.060> point<00:01:11.330> four<00:01:11.630> but<00:01:12.380> I<00:01:12.409> haven't

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
height to a point four but I haven't

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.590 
height to a point four but I haven't
seen<00:01:12.979> a<00:01:13.010> major<00:01:13.400> difference<00:01:13.940> between<00:01:14.090> point

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
seen a major difference between point

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.710 
seen a major difference between point
two<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:14.900> point<00:01:14.960> four<00:01:15.410> on<00:01:15.770> The<00:01:16.310> Da<00:01:16.430> Vinci<00:01:16.690> so<00:01:17.690> I

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
two and point four on The Da Vinci so I

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.960 
two and point four on The Da Vinci so I
let<00:01:17.990> it<00:01:18.020> go<00:01:18.110> I<00:01:18.500> also<00:01:18.979> printed<00:01:19.280> with<00:01:19.490> supports

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
let it go I also printed with supports

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.690 
let it go I also printed with supports
and<00:01:20.380> then<00:01:21.380> I<00:01:21.590> let<00:01:21.770> it<00:01:21.800> slice<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.550> took

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
and then I let it slice and it took

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.380 
and then I let it slice and it took
roughly<00:01:22.970> about<00:01:23.390> two<00:01:23.570> minutes<00:01:25.300> here's<00:01:26.300> a

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
roughly about two minutes here's a

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.180 
roughly about two minutes here's a
close-up<00:01:26.720> of<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.259> finished<00:01:27.619> design<00:01:27.770> with

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
close-up of the finished design with

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:47.249 
close-up of the finished design with
supports<00:01:28.610> in<00:01:28.759> place<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:29.900> was<00:01:30.080> ready<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:30.440> print

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.210 

so<00:01:48.259> here's<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.710> prints

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
so here's the prints

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.609 
so here's the prints
I<00:01:49.250> actually<00:01:49.670> made<00:01:50.000> three<00:01:50.330> of<00:01:50.450> them<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:51.320> first

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
I actually made three of them the first

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.889 
I actually made three of them the first
print<00:01:52.009> I<00:01:52.190> didn't<00:01:52.640> use<00:01:52.850> supports<00:01:53.420> for<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.690> arch

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
print I didn't use supports for the arch

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.639 
print I didn't use supports for the arch
and<00:01:54.520> that's<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.670> result<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.899> didn't<00:01:57.380> have<00:01:57.530> the

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
and that's the result it didn't have the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.450 
and that's the result it didn't have the
support<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:59.240> print<00:01:59.600> didn't<00:01:59.869> come<00:02:00.050> out<00:02:00.460> very

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
support the print didn't come out very

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.520 
support the print didn't come out very
good<00:02:01.550> as<00:02:01.820> far<00:02:01.850> as<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.149> arch<00:02:02.420> but<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.140> rest<00:02:03.350> of

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
good as far as the arch but the rest of

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.999 
good as far as the arch but the rest of
it<00:02:03.680> is<00:02:04.549> perfect<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.299> mean<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.259> holes<00:02:06.500> are<00:02:06.770> good

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
it is perfect I mean the holes are good

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.870 
it is perfect I mean the holes are good
the<00:02:07.670> hex<00:02:07.939> hole<00:02:08.239> is<00:02:08.450> good<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:09.679> bunch<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.519> studs

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
the hex hole is good the bunch of studs

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.650 
the hex hole is good the bunch of studs
or<00:02:11.239> her<00:02:11.750> posts<00:02:12.260> are<00:02:12.650> good<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.910> box<00:02:14.180> shaped

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
or her posts are good the box shaped

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.830 
or her posts are good the box shaped
with<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.989> different<00:02:15.350> walls<00:02:16.269> looks<00:02:17.269> really

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
with the different walls looks really

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.990 
with the different walls looks really
really<00:02:18.519> good-quality<00:02:20.500> just<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.620> arch<00:02:22.000> so

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
really good-quality just the arch so

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.170 
really good-quality just the arch so
then<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.239> printed<00:02:23.810> with<00:02:24.709> support<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
then I printed with support and the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.910 
then I printed with support and the
thing<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.480> noticed<00:02:26.810> every<00:02:27.470> one<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.709> them

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
thing I noticed every one of them

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.250 
thing I noticed every one of them
printed<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.459> little<00:02:28.730> tab<00:02:29.239> which<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.870> didn't

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
printed the little tab which I didn't

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.140 
printed the little tab which I didn't
see<00:02:30.500> on<00:02:30.680> some<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.130> prints<00:02:31.489> in<00:02:31.970> the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
see on some of the prints in the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.620 
see on some of the prints in the
magazine<00:02:33.070> so<00:02:34.070> this<00:02:34.670> is<00:02:34.850> one<00:02:35.030> with<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.239> support

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
magazine so this is one with the support

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
quality is as good as anything I've seen

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.130 
quality is as good as anything I've seen
from<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.900> magazine<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:49.760> if<00:02:50.120> this<00:02:50.360> was<00:02:50.690> entered

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
from the magazine so if this was entered

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.880 
from the magazine so if this was entered
in<00:02:51.320> that<00:02:51.470> same<00:02:52.060> contest<00:02:53.060> or<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.540> same

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
in that same contest or that same

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.120 
in that same contest or that same
competition

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
competition

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.250 
competition
I<00:02:55.299> think<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.420> da<00:02:56.510> Vinci<00:02:56.840> would<00:02:56.989> have<00:02:57.109> done

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
I think the da Vinci would have done

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.190 
I think the da Vinci would have done
just<00:02:57.500> fine<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:59.090> tweaks<00:02:59.420> that<00:02:59.660> I've<00:02:59.780> done<00:03:00.019> to

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
just fine the tweaks that I've done to

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.050 
just fine the tweaks that I've done to
this<00:03:00.320> thing<00:03:00.560> over<00:03:00.739> time<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.459> improve<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:01.970> I

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
this thing over time to improve it I

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.030 
this thing over time to improve it I
mean<00:03:02.209> minor<00:03:02.450> tweaks<00:03:02.840> as<00:03:03.079> you<00:03:03.350> can<00:03:03.530> see<00:03:03.739> in<00:03:03.859> some

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
mean minor tweaks as you can see in some

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.910 
mean minor tweaks as you can see in some
of<00:03:04.130> my<00:03:04.250> other<00:03:04.400> videos<00:03:05.530> really<00:03:06.530> make<00:03:06.890> a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
of my other videos really make a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.530 
of my other videos really make a
difference<00:03:07.160> but<00:03:07.550> once<00:03:07.760> this<00:03:07.940> thing<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.209> tuned

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
difference but once this thing is tuned

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.190 
difference but once this thing is tuned
up<00:03:09.129> these<00:03:10.129> prints<00:03:10.519> are<00:03:10.580> excellent<00:03:11.060> so<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:11.840> would

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
up these prints are excellent so I would

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.300 
up these prints are excellent so I would
say<00:03:12.440> that<00:03:12.650> this

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
say that this

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.550 
say that this
is<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.090> complete<00:03:14.599> pass

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
is a complete pass

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.410 
is a complete pass
now<00:03:17.560> anybody<00:03:17.769> that<00:03:17.980> says<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.400> cheated<00:03:18.730> because

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
now anybody that says I cheated because

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.780 
now anybody that says I cheated because
I<00:03:19.510> didn't<00:03:19.750> use<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.989> default<00:03:20.379> settings<00:03:20.799> I<00:03:21.010> went

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
I didn't use the default settings I went

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.630 
I didn't use the default settings I went
back<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.209> printed<00:03:22.599> at<00:03:22.689> the<00:03:22.720> 0.4<00:03:23.379> and<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:24.459> can

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
back and printed at the 0.4 and you can

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.190 
back and printed at the 0.4 and you can
see<00:03:24.879> there's<00:03:25.090> not<00:03:25.269> a<00:03:25.329> big<00:03:25.629> difference<00:03:25.810> between

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
see there's not a big difference between

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.710 
see there's not a big difference between
the<00:03:26.500> point<00:03:26.739> 2<00:03:26.860> and<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.040> point<00:03:27.159> 4<00:03:27.519> I<00:03:27.730> get<00:03:28.269> really

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
the point 2 and the point 4 I get really

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.470 
the point 2 and the point 4 I get really
good<00:03:28.810> prints<00:03:29.290> out<00:03:29.409> at<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.560> point<00:03:29.739> 4<00:03:30.120> in<00:03:31.120> fact<00:03:31.390> a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
good prints out at a point 4 in fact a

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.910 
good prints out at a point 4 in fact a
lot<00:03:31.629> of<00:03:31.659> times<00:03:31.780> all<00:03:32.110> printing<00:03:32.409> point<00:03:32.650> 4

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
lot of times all printing point 4

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.670 
lot of times all printing point 4
because<00:03:33.220> it's<00:03:33.340> faster<00:03:34.200> now<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.260> round<00:03:35.560> the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
because it's faster now the round the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.160 
because it's faster now the round the
holes<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.159> can<00:03:36.250> see<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.519> little<00:03:36.930> hollowness<00:03:37.930> on

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
holes you can see a little hollowness on

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.920 
holes you can see a little hollowness on
the<00:03:38.620> outside<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:40.269> posts<00:03:40.599> are<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.720> little

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
the outside and the posts are a little

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.500 
the outside and the posts are a little
bit<00:03:41.049> rougher<00:03:41.379> but<00:03:41.590> overall<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:43.000> looks<00:03:43.030> just<00:03:43.329> as

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
bit rougher but overall it looks just as

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.960 
bit rougher but overall it looks just as
