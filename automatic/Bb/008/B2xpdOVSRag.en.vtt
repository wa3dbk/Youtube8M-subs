00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 over the past two years model 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.830
 use of mobile devices 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.120
 changed a lot 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.799
 users no longer watch 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.719
 skeptical at the huge display and 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.320
 on the contrary when upgrading consider 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.240
 compulsory 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.040
 increase the diagonal of the fact and in the game 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.660
 more convenient to play and watch videos and 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.340
 photos edit if still 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.510
 recently a good smartphone with a huge 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.000
 display and good performance 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.740
 costing a huge amount of money is 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.910
 Today there were alternatives and not 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.130
 be sure to look away 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.170
 Little-known Chinese this year asus 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.310
 showed a zenfone line which is beneficial 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.230
 different from its competitors 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.710
 cost and today we look at zenfone 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:48.000
 6 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:49.370
 the largest of the line is real 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.480
 great smartphone without any 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.800
 compromises and you must understand exactly 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.960
 that you need him 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.610
 and why because six is ​​not even 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.410
 every pocket will fit and although the framework 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.149
 the small display itself is comparable to 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.219
 tablet 6 inches after all 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.080
 however, some time looking for symbiosis 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.220
 smartphone and tablet so as not to 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.650
 use two separate 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.420
 devices and so zenfone 6 is good 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.250
 it will fit practical because the body 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.470
 made of create plastic perfectly 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.270
 assembled has a quality ips screen and 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.159
 two slots for sim cards of the zenfone line 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.740
 received an award for design red dot 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.540
 design award 2014 for budget 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.820
 device smartphone looks pretty 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.530
 design attention was given to the example of the bottom 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.689
 chin is made in the style of zenbook 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.250
 smartphone is quite thin speaker behind 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.350
 does not close the surface on which 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.939
 the smartphone is lying and the camera is slightly recessed 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.950
 so as not to scratch in the right place 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.720
 controls are located so 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.549
 It’s convenient to use the device even when 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.350
 its size besides all this separate 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.090
 attention is paid to the graphical shell 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.100
 interface with the family on which we 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.899
 paid attention she is cool but not 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.610
 there were no unpleasant moments 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.200
 probably most upset me 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.600
 control buttons are located under 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.670
 the display during the day they are clearly visible 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.619
 in the evening they are not highlighted at all 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.570
 and even after weekly use i 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.290
 not rarely wrong when you press this or 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.820
 another key 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.320
 also did not quite like that under 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.570
 removable back cover fixed 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.490
 battery oddly smartphone 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.140
 proved to be very resistant to external 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.970
 my damage is perfect 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.830
 accidentally passed unreal crash test 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.420
 falling from the broad arm right on the asphalt and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.430
 a good ride on it 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.739
 you do not have any broken glass 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.569
 I even have deep scars just a couple 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.760
 Damage to the knees of the smartphone assembled 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.680
 very good creaks and no backlash 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.599
 and asus insured added 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.310
 seal under the removable cover so that these 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.720
 scripts never appeared among 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.370
 pretty standard 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.380
 elements in the smartphone, I note the presence 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.239
 slots for micro sd can 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.280
 put up to 64 gigabytes 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.540
 displays novelties meter resolution and sits 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.300
 6 inches pixel density 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.739
 is 245 find nice expect for 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.930
 such a cost in a smile would be 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.340
 unwise to do some things where here 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.140
 we have a panel with good angles again 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.330
 overview and colors minimum brightness 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.920
 comfortable but I wanted maximum 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.870
 would be bigger especially in daylight 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.120
 the display is covered with a protective gorilla glass 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.890
 glass 3 again cool for inexpensive 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.450
 the smartphone did not save on the sensor 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.640
 lighting automatic adjustment 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.680
 There is in the settings even from the curtain, you can 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.120
 enable reading mode many for this 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.680
 separate application became here by 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.390
 default is the whole interface 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.250
 it becomes noticeably warmer and 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.230
 at first it looks unusual but the eyes 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.120
 quickly mastered and not so tired when 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.799
 long reading and read our young 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.019
 quite comfortable the main camera has 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.709
 13 megapixels resolution writes video 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.630
 full hd 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.370
 with 13 megapixels of photos not 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.200
 widescreen with aspect ratio 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.060
 four to three cool quality is very 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.560
 not bad especially in the dark liked 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.299
 a huge number of settings except 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.950
 style shooting modes have a deep 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.510
 setting including key control 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.340
 volume control and tuning 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.959
 absorption flicker one of the main 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.430
 smartphone chips is the ability 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.680
 taking pictures at almost full 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.480
 the absence of light front camera on 1 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.859
 and 9 megapixels are also functional 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.690
 turned out to be a standard player 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.280
 it is generally surprised there is an opportunity 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.780
 browse music by folders 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.549
 equalizer can be logged in 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.440
 all kinds of cloud services including 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.600
 friend boxing you can watch those videos 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.519
 who is nearby overall good of 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.290
 quality everything could well not even with 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.760
 all very good headphones 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.380
 The back of the smartphone indicates that 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.590
 inside there is a processor from intel 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.630
 namely dual core intel atom z 2580 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.109
 clock frequency of 2 gigahertz graphics 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.510
 powervr sgx544 mp2 ram 2 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.069
 gigabytes of internal 16 in benchmarks 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.049
 such iron shows quite good 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.940
 the results are however important as she herself 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.709
 leads to the lag in the interface is not 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.269
 real racing 3 comes with maximum 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.979
 settings but not at the maximum 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.989
 resolution is a minus game optimization 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.000
 gta san andreas for some reason do not run 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.280
 other games go without problems in general 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.480
 good performance 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.980
 especially considering the relative 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.050
 low cost device capacity 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.639
 3200 battery 30 milliampere hours 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.680
 it's pretty much a full charge 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.010
 standard device will leave about 3 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.480
 o'clock 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.340
 but not active 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.230
 You can work with the device about 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.340
 two days but I have enough for a day 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.440
 there is a power saving mode setting 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.030
 where charge can be customized 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.770
 quite flexible great emphasis placed on 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.200
 software version android is not the freshest here 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.600
 43 updates 44 promise soon 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.010
 time but you like it is made in 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.840
 nothing in the same style 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.760
 use standard applications 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.470
 nice to suit standard weather 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.940
 displays all the useful information with 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.650
 beautiful graphics are useful 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.270
 applications for example the wind blows where 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.980
 all missed events are collected from 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.570
 subsequent reminders or here's the snow 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.340
 among shows a tape of events with 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.380
 calendar including on the go and notes in 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.090
 whole shell functional and without 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.130
 stretched unnecessary features all 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.140
 useful among competitors and even more so 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.970
 brands find a smartphone with 6-inch 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.100
 display for such a cost in principle 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.410
 You can but according to the characteristics if there is 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.090
 such that they are very few intel processor 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.910
 instead of mtk 2 gigabyte operative 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.010
 memory and instead of one 13 megapixel 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.770
 camera micro sd card slot 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.160
 battery capacity 3230 milliampere 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.200
 o'clock 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.240
 Agree to a very good set for 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.560
 smartphone originally declared 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.560
 worth $ 200
