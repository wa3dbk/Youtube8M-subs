00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
we can't really see how deep this thing

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.570 
we can't really see how deep this thing
is<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:35.170> drop<00:02:35.380> this<00:02:35.530> rock<00:02:35.769> down<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.160> there<00:02:36.370> and

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
is and drop this rock down in there and

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.670

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.170 

so<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.709> was<00:02:44.950> just<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.220> glimpse<00:02:45.519> of<00:02:45.790> what<00:02:46.000> we

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
so that was just a glimpse of what we

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.690 
so that was just a glimpse of what we
saw<00:02:46.420> on<00:02:46.630> our<00:02:46.750> 10,000<00:02:47.350> mile<00:02:47.470> road<00:02:47.680> trip<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.130> we

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
saw on our 10,000 mile road trip and we

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.370 
saw on our 10,000 mile road trip and we
know<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:48.910> sharing<00:02:49.660> these<00:02:49.750> places<00:02:50.019> with<00:02:50.260> you

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
know that sharing these places with you

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.170 
know that sharing these places with you
means<00:02:50.830> they<00:02:51.010> may<00:02:51.190> not<00:02:51.340> be<00:02:51.400> secrets<00:02:51.970> much

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
means they may not be secrets much

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.600 
means they may not be secrets much
longer<00:02:52.569> but<00:02:53.260> that's<00:02:53.739> all<00:02:53.920> right<00:02:53.950> because<00:02:54.130> in

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
longer but that's all right because in

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.309 
longer but that's all right because in
reality<00:02:54.790> there's<00:02:55.390> plenty<00:02:55.690> more<00:02:55.720> secrets<00:02:56.200> out

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
reality there's plenty more secrets out

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.990 
reality there's plenty more secrets out
there<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:57.070> just<00:02:57.100> got<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.459> get<00:02:57.549> out<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.790> find

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
there and just got to get out and find

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.120
