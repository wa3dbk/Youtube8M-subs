explain the different things on the

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.960 
explain the different things on the
computer<00:00:05.600> here<00:00:06.100> we<00:00:07.100> got<00:00:07.220> this<00:00:07.340> program<00:00:07.760> right

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
computer here we got this program right

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.640 
computer here we got this program right
here<00:00:08.149> at<00:00:08.240> the<00:00:08.300> BCM<00:00:08.720> scanner<00:00:10.390> this<00:00:11.390> is<00:00:11.600> all<00:00:11.780> gone

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
here at the BCM scanner this is all gone

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.740 
here at the BCM scanner this is all gone
through<00:00:13.070> I<00:00:13.130> don't<00:00:13.310> probably<00:00:13.910> can't<00:00:14.390> see<00:00:14.570> that

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
through I don't probably can't see that

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.189 
through I don't probably can't see that
at<00:00:14.930> all

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.929 

it's<00:00:18.710> all<00:00:18.859> done<00:00:19.039> through<00:00:19.099> the<00:00:19.430> HP<00:00:19.730> tuners

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
it's all done through the HP tuners

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.800 
it's all done through the HP tuners
program<00:00:20.859> it's<00:00:21.859> all<00:00:21.980> set<00:00:22.250> up<00:00:22.460> so<00:00:22.849> different

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
program it's all set up so different

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.200 
program it's all set up so different
 points<00:00:24.550> basically<00:00:25.550> anything<00:00:25.880> you<00:00:26.060> can

think of it's all done through the

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.849 
think of it's all done through the
program<00:00:28.849> you<00:00:29.270> can<00:00:29.419> you<00:00:30.320> can<00:00:30.470> run<00:00:30.619> without

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
program you can you can run without

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.799 
program you can you can run without

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.390 

well<00:02:48.270> actually<00:02:48.660> before<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.200> do<00:02:49.319> this

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
well actually before I do this

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.360 
well actually before I do this
you<00:02:51.879> actually<00:02:52.060> have<00:02:52.329> to<00:02:52.420> add<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.659> vehicle<00:02:53.049> off

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
you actually have to add the vehicle off

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.619 
you actually have to add the vehicle off
so<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.430> have<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.610> vehicle<00:02:54.939> off<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.480> just

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
so you have the vehicle off and you just

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.300 
so you have the vehicle off and you just
have<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.870> keys<00:02:56.079> into<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.470> on<00:02:56.620> position<00:02:56.650> if

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
have the keys into the on position if

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.250 
have the keys into the on position if

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
I'll explain the nitrous setup how long

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.640 
I'll explain the nitrous setup how long
how<00:03:30.670> that<00:03:31.180> all<00:03:31.359> works<00:03:31.599> after<00:03:31.989> this<00:03:32.170> right<00:03:32.470> here

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
how that all works after this right here

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.250 
how that all works after this right here
though<00:03:33.120> but<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.359> usually<00:03:34.510> only<00:03:34.780> takes<00:03:34.930> like<00:03:35.170> a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
though but it usually only takes like a

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.559 
though but it usually only takes like a
minute<00:03:35.349> to<00:03:35.680> do<00:03:35.799> this<00:03:35.980> again<00:03:36.939> your<00:03:37.090> vehicle<00:03:37.420> has

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
minute to do this again your vehicle has

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.440 
minute to do this again your vehicle has
to<00:03:37.599> be<00:03:38.139> off<00:03:38.319> but<00:03:38.590> in<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.739> on<00:03:38.920> position<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:42.450> know

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
to be off but in the on position I know

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:52.400 
to be off but in the on position I know
it's<00:03:43.659> about<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.870> in<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.200> VCM
