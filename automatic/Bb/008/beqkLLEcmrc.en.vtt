00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.700
 well hi everyone I hope that 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.020
 you're fine I'm working for the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.030
 first tutor of the full chain 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.429
 said they're going to the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.200
 control the console frankly I'm 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.360
 spent places like that that you 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.630
 will therefore see the temperature of the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.840
 processor to change your consolidate 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.170
 more easily and these serious fires 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.730
 to tripe firmware 6 and srx edx so 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.360
 I was going on the internet first 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.550
 coop you go in the wind the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.200
 description we wanted to get there 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.200
 you are doing download 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:46.800
 here I already download it is for 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.020
 does that make me a like that so 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.820
 then you open it you slip it 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.510
 ps3 control on your on your desk 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.920
 to the point that we close everything we open to you 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:09.979
 that or plugged into usb - diamonds its 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:15.479
 branches and hop that's it we can fire 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:19.220
 so you take your record and that 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.890
 six in the package and the plugin sorry 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.840
 hop hop you put them on usb stick 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.460
 so you have all that so I have not 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.680
 strong part on the ps3 but I you 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.170
 a game you specifically indicate 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.700
 precisely what he will do so 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.759
 why you install the package 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.640
 how are you going to install an application 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:42.270
 control console so you go on 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.320
 this app on the package that 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.649
 you install you start telling yourself 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.640
 to install console control best and 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.829
 stones etc so you make screams and 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.540
 so that's where we ps3 will restart 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.780
 and you will have a little icon at the bottom in 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.790
 top right the ps3 that will say control 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.159
 ben and stones well that is to say that 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.069
 until that's so it's good then 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:12.020
 when when do you have when you like 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.020
 properly installed against the console 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.780
 wanting that's the little application 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.820
 control console the wii for information 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.100
 to uninstall so control console 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.050
 on ps3 or click on the same 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.200
 application know have asked if you 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.660
 want to uninstall and that's so 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.960
 there you put you put in the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:47.820
 respect your ps3 so I do not care I 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:52.320
 keep up connects to a thin I read my 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:03:01.520
 ps3 first I would still like the 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:01.520
 do it so the ps3 turns on 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:13.860
 this is my console home connect control 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.290
 so this is it you're displaying a 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.880
 lack there could be encrypted and art 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.610
 so you see the maurer of your 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.890
 ps store of which I am in dax 4.46 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.610
 for info so there you have all the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.910
 temperatures the processor etc 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:34.290
 and if you want to change to consolidate 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.640
 so his parents this memory I know 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.480
 not really what it is I think that 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.990
 it's for memory 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.790
 we 're not going to touch it 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.550
 so there you put your consolidated so 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.020
 will be 0 0 gold I do not know what 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.020
 anything hop 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.000
 terra 0 this is anything 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.030
 no it will mean advice the idea well 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.670
 put and so the ps3 console will be fine 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.750
 changed and so it will be good you can 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.910
 connect online 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.940
 if you do not have to consolidate otherwise 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.900
 well so you see the proud of the 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.010
 console the guy and that's so it's 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.570
 well enough I advise you to 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.480
 install it and then to console him for 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.280
 its a lot easier so that's it 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.470
 she was taking all the tutorial from 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.580
 reform said that tell him soon for 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.580
