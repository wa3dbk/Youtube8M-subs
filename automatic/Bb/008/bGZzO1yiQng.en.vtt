00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.660
 hello hello hello little flowers how about 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.900
 how are you good 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.959
 First of all, tell them that this 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.759
 tomorrow good today is Monday 8 of 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.639
 September is worth this morning rose a 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.470
 video to my YouTube channel was about the 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.360
 of gustavo this month but I came up with a 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.630
 different program because the other moved 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.850
 expired I do not know what happened to him I do not know what 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.590
 says me that the video was cut at the end and 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.570
 two products were missing for teaching 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.400
 so what I did that I deleted it 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.890
 and it is that as I had already seen that the 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.050
 video had been edited that looked good 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.609
 because it is already half way then 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.649
 I said good because it erases the little pieces 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:40.289
 these of having recorded it so that I do not 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.399
 take up a lot of memory on the card 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.960
 So what happened when deleting them? 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.789
 I 'm lifeless so I 'm sorry 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.310
 a lot for girls who like to see 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:51.860
 she likes voice because this month 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.480
 the idea do so well there is something else 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.980
 that I wanted to comment also is that 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.860
 well you know I'm going to start the 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.710
 university then I already imagine that 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.870
 you will understand and I hope that I will not have 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.430
 so much time to record as much as 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.750
 I like to record and you know that I 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.030
 I was doing nothing and I've had 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.580
 enough time to record almost 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.640
 every day and now my time is going to 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.710
 see quite diminished I think so what 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.260
 I can perceive to listen today to the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.450
 teachers so well I'll try 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.850
 If you burn at least three times a 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.619
 week or two it will not put days 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.750
 Exactly because I imagine there will be days 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.369
 have more work plus exams 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.020
 then have less time to fit 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.150
 that arrived at 10 o'clock at night 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.070
 others are the 7 others at 9 then 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.080
 Now I'm right now at nine o'clock 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.790
 the night recording and I'm going to do what 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.680
 I can and what is in my hand because I do not 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.259
 I want to leave this part I love 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.670
 super happy and good that you know that I'm going to 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.470
 upload less videos I will keep going up 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.410
 rather it will be an active channel as 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.210
 for that I have it and it's good that I feel 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.220
 that you are not going to put so many videos but 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.080
 On the one hand insurance happens surgery because 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.210
 nor my mother that almost our wife walks 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.110
 that does not upload videos 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.790
 and now I'm shut up and I tell you that 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.810
 video that I bring you right now are from 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.360
 you buy in primark and in primor are not 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.369
 many things but good I wanted to 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.720
 teach online I have them stored there 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.340
 in a bag and I think that just from 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.830
 teach them to keep them in the closet 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.390
 and when the cool starts 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.340
 to be able to wear them so if 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.770
 interest in shopping videos stay 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.420
 with me good first thing I'm going to 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:30.330
 teach is this jersey cited vale is 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:35.220
 white as you can see has here 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:38.280
 like a very cool lace and then it's this 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.830
 whole sleeve is worth the sleeve comes up 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.800
 Here more or less 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.450
 I think that for the time that comes 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.170
 autumn that is not very cold and 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.240
 it's not hot either, it's going to be great 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.330
 and it cost me 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.010
 twelve euros what I'm going to teach now 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.420
 are species of joint because I 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.310
 I bought everything almost all the same 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.740
 color since I think it's a very color 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.500
 wearable for fall and I have caught enough 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.200
 things of him as you see is this color 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.100
 eggplant or wine as you want to call it 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.430
 is a normal little ceiba does not have 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.580
 nothing is very simple with a peak shape 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.160
 in the neck and good 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.440
 and you see has nothing but think 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.210
 for daily and that to go to classes very 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.010
 wearable and it cost me six euros 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.950
 The next thing I bought has been 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.020
 this is taboo fanda is not a neck nor 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.250
 nothing is a normal scarf 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.650
 It is worth as you see here it is not closed nor 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.780
 nothing has the two parts of if you loose 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.210
 and good as most things 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.460
 that I have are necks and things like that 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.290
 I wanted to have a scarf and 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.830
 as I have not caught in wine color to 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.550
 combine a little bit and it has cost me 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.170
 five euros 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.830
 the next thing you buy that I'm 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.830
 delighted are these wedges for winter 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.110
 You already know that I have the same equals 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.250
 in good beige you can see that they have 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.530
 here cordoncito in front 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.830
 a little bit of heel and well I think they are 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.900
 beautiful as I have told you this 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.380
 color for winter and autumn is that it is 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.359
 great I love it and I think they can are 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.900
 very comfortable increase those centimeters 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.050
 I need and I love them and they have 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.050
 liked 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.640
 18 euros I've also taken this 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.400
 little bag in the same color as 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.380
 shoes is the same as the one that I picked the 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.430
 another brown day that I will leave the video 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.780
 with the video around here, you see that 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.600
 has two hundred small here for 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.510
 pick it up and another big tape here 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.240
 here is little pocket and well I think 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.190
 for college is great is 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.880
 very comfortable is nice and with shoes 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.190
 my perfect country and it cost me eleven euros 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.190
 It has no label but it cost me eleven 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.880
 euros and lastly in primar I took this 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.430
 super sail I have it also in blue and the 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.320
 I think brown and I love how 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.940
 It smells and I really like having candles 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.800
 at home not that you understand them much now 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.780
 I'm going to start lighting them but I 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.580
 also like very much for the smell 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:23.560
 and why they decorate a lot 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:27.540
 this smells like roses smells great and 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:31.560
 as soon as I can turn on 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.390
 and I liked four euros and now that 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.300
 I'm done with primark I'm going to 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.980
 simply teach some little thing that 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.800
 I took in cousin are very few things 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.020
 because I did not want to spend more but 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.380
 Well I hope you like it and we started 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.570
 around here you know I'm a fan of 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.090
 the primor masks I took is that 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.220
 I've already tried and I loved oil 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.210
 olive 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.710
 and this one I've never tasted of cucumber 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.720
 Purifying facilitates the elimination of 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.660
 dead cells and impurities and spots 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.540
 blacks who drive great come from 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:11.390
 a lot of those little things so this time 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.390
 you will count and each one one euro 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:24.149
 another little thing is that I could not 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:28.199
 exist garnier fructis has taken out 

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:31.899
 This new range of shampoo conditioner 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:34.209
 Mask and serum and did not take the shampoo 

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:37.179
 nor did I take the conditioner because I have 

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:39.069
 two shampoos that half finished a 

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:40.779
 conditioner without starting and others 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:42.909
 shampoos without starting then I want 

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:47.229
 spend that and then if I can buy 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:49.599
 the other this range what it gives you 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:52.749
 It is a nut or identifier 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:55.059
 abundant mane the truth that I hope 

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:57.939
 I do not wear thick hair 

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:59.799
 as good here I took it is not for me 

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:02.049
 hair because I already have thick hair and 

00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:04.929
 I do not need much but it has 

00:07:02.049 --> 00:07:06.759
 strawberry smell I smell like strawberry 

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:08.339
 here it says it's pomegranate extract 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:12.420
 but it's that I smell like strawberry 

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:14.460
 Incredible incredible and is that not 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.860
 it smells a lot like strawberry and I could not 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:20.250
 resist so I hope you do not put me 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.810
 head like I do not know how a lion because 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:25.110
 I already have it enough but it's that I 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:28.580
 I loved how it smells and I'll tell you and I'll 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.580
 it cost 399 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.669
 and finally 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.590
 another little thing that I took in purely that I already 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:40.259
 was missing was a proofreader 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:43.229
 this nix I already used it a long time ago and 

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:45.599
 well I wanted to take it again 

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:52.200
 because I'm about to finish of 

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:55.080
 essence and this is the number of w01 

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.380
 It's the clearest and I'm doing pretty well 

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:03.000
 the truth is not cut me to my stage well 

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:04.830
 and it's very good and it cost me 5 with 99 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.200
 and good until here the video has arrived 

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:09.630

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.550
