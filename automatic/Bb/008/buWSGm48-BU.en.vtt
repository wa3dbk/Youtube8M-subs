 for whom you work we work 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.660
 basically for the big 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.190
 distribution which were 70% of our 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.590
 turnover but also to 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.899
 export to 35 countries around the world 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.250
 we also have a sales shop that 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.140
 sells our products directly in 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.329
 particular is an internet site 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.520
 that's very important internet you 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.910
 consider as a new surface of 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.199
 sale 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.550
 we can all year long 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.079
 find our products because 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.969
 large area we are present that at 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.649
 Christmas etc at Easter and thanks to the site 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.120
 internet allows us to keep a link 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.210
 with the consumer all the way through 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.210
 year 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.450
 the real chocolate recipe is what 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.429
 cocoa butter it's cocoa butter 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.439
 mainly it's our part of the real 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.880
 and the transgenic ray name from us 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.759
 we are really in pure butter 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.590
 cocoa and we have different origins too 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.810
 possible to 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.979
 chocolate according to the demand of 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.780
 our customers we are able to adapt 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.890
 in chocolate little bunnies for that 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.770
 it fits and that it is hollow in 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.630
 then we have a filling step of 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.700
 our molds by a dosing head 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.319
 then we will go on a step of 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.479
 centrifuges that will weigh the thing 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.789
 who is behind one that 's it's okay 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.590
 allow to flatten licks chocolate 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.959
 on the outer parts of our molds 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.950
 which will create the vacuum inside and 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.810
 then we have a step of 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.399
 cooling that will allow near 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.049
 consolidate all with chocolate and 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.000
 outlet 20 to be able to condition it 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.140
 killer co-pouring chocolate I 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.119
 believe it's the most important thing 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.099
 it's neither too hot nor too cold 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.569
 everything is missing it's an art it's an art 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.920
 why because there are curves of 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.200
 crystallization that are indispensable 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.390
 to be able to have a brilliant rendering 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.829
 we can see the rendering of the brittle and if 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.390
 this curve is not done 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.340
 suitably with specialists 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.290
 with us and your chocolate will not have 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.660
 a very short life will have a 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.730
 aspect not at all an attractive and in 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.019
 the more he risks not being brittle in 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.340
 mouth what a lot of people 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.150
 are looking in dark chocolate between 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.319
 others too 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.910
 there now exclusively for 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.170
 Alsatian will you look at the camera and you 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.040
 give your manufacturing secret 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.040
 It is going to be difficult
