00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.440
The B-Twist is as simple as a Butterfly

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.140
that you must twist once you've reached the top height of the move.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.900
The Butterfly

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.060
First step: bring your head down to the level of the knees

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.120
Then,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.020
you need to swing up your head while lifting hard your first leg

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.520
This action will increase your height

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.960
The goal is to build a 'U' position, with your head, chest and legs

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.000
The Twist

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.240
After the set up, it's crucial to wait until you reach your top height,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.460
there, the Butterfly is set.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.960

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.460
At that very moment, you need to rotate your shoulders and pelvis,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.980
while wrapping your arms, in order to gain rotation speed.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.860
The Landing

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.640
After Twisting, move your landing foot towards the ground.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.380
Beware to keep strengthened, your chest vertical and the landing leg hard,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.380
the aim is to land vertical.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.480
In order to stay balanced,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.500
spot the ground before and after Twisting.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.440
Eventually, keep in mind:

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.320
not twisting too early,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.680
lift hard your head and first leg,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.620
and be solid until the end of Landing

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.220
Your turn!
