00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
to compare and contrast the two years so

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.469 
to compare and contrast the two years so
you'll<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.320> able<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.590> tell<00:02:04.829> more<00:02:05.520> or<00:02:05.700> less<00:02:06.119> what

you'll be able to tell more or less what

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.290 
you'll be able to tell more or less what
the<00:02:07.259> increase<00:02:07.740> was<00:02:08.039> from<00:02:08.610> one<00:02:08.849> year<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the increase was from one year to the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.830 
the increase was from one year to the
next<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.869> terms<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.289> percentage

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
next in terms of percentage

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.420 
next in terms of percentage
like<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.230> lot<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:11.590> people<00:02:11.739> would<00:02:12.010> like<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:12.370> if

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
like a lot of people would like so if

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.040 
like a lot of people would like so if
you're<00:02:12.660> talking<00:02:13.660> about<00:02:13.900> say<00:02:14.550> 2010<00:02:15.550> versus

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
you're talking about say 2010 versus

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.780 
you're talking about say 2010 versus
2011<00:02:17.050> say<00:02:17.379> for<00:02:17.590> example<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.160> one<00:02:18.459> year<00:02:18.670> they

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
2011 say for example and one year they

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.430 
2011 say for example and one year they
brought<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.150> 300,000<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.110> maintenance

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
brought in 300,000 and maintenance

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.280 
brought in 300,000 and maintenance
charges<00:02:20.769> next<00:02:21.670> year's<00:02:22.170> 330,000<00:02:23.170> and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
charges next year's 330,000 and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.170 
charges next year's 330,000 and
maintenance<00:02:23.560> charges<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:24.340> can<00:02:24.519> then<00:02:24.730> see

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
maintenance charges you can then see

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.699 
maintenance charges you can then see
that<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.050> maintenance<00:02:26.410> went<00:02:26.620> up

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
that the maintenance went up

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.100 
that the maintenance went up
approximately<00:02:27.040> ten<00:02:27.580> percent<00:02:28.000> in<00:02:28.420> addition

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
approximately ten percent in addition

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.320 
approximately ten percent in addition
it's<00:02:29.530> going<00:02:29.769> to<00:02:29.920> show<00:02:30.129> you<00:02:30.190> again<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.180> other

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
it's going to show you again the other

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.140 
it's going to show you again the other
revenues<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.260> then<00:02:33.010> at<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.340> bottom<00:02:33.370> you'll

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
revenues and then at the bottom you'll

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.690 
revenues and then at the bottom you'll
also<00:02:34.420> see<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.019> expenses<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.220> you'll<00:02:36.340> see<00:02:36.519> what

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
also see the expenses so you'll see what

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.100 
also see the expenses so you'll see what
they've<00:02:36.879> been<00:02:37.030> paying<00:02:37.330> oh<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.780> you'll<00:02:38.019> be

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
able to match whether the revenues are

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.069 
able to match whether the revenues are
meeting<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.519> expenses<00:02:43.150> or<00:02:43.390> whether<00:02:43.810> or<00:02:43.989> not

that<00:02:48.250> will<00:02:48.370> give<00:02:48.579> you<00:02:48.700> some<00:02:48.970> clue<00:02:49.269> into<00:02:49.799> how

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
that will give you some clue into how

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.920 
that will give you some clue into how
the<00:02:50.860> building<00:02:51.310> operates<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.360> last<00:02:52.630> section

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
the building operates the last section

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.030 
the building operates the last section
on<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.440> page<00:02:53.650> typically<00:02:54.220> shows<00:02:54.940> accounting

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
on that page typically shows accounting

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.759 
on that page typically shows accounting
passive<00:02:57.040> losses<00:02:57.579> like<00:02:58.390> appreciation<00:02:59.290> and

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
passive losses like appreciation and

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.259 
passive losses like appreciation and
you'll<00:03:00.310> be<00:03:00.430> able<00:03:00.519> to<00:03:00.640> see<00:03:00.819> those<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.150> you'll

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
you'll be able to see those and you'll

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.670 
you'll be able to see those and you'll
see<00:03:01.390> very<00:03:01.540> big<00:03:01.840> numbers<00:03:02.200> but<00:03:02.379> do<00:03:02.470> not<00:03:02.620> be

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
see very big numbers but do not be

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.440 
see very big numbers but do not be
afraid<00:03:03.040> of<00:03:03.280> those<00:03:03.430> it's<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.730> big<00:03:03.940> thing<00:03:03.970> that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
afraid of those it's a big thing that

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.690 
afraid of those it's a big thing that
people<00:03:04.750> will<00:03:04.900> look<00:03:05.049> at<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.470> focus<00:03:06.160> on<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.579> its

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
people will look at and focus on and its

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.119 
people will look at and focus on and its
really<00:03:06.970> an<00:03:07.209> accounting<00:03:07.810> passive<00:03:08.680> loss<00:03:08.920> it's

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
really an accounting passive loss it's

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.509 
really an accounting passive loss it's
not<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.370> cash<00:03:09.670> loss<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.390> don't<00:03:10.599> worry<00:03:10.720> about<00:03:10.840> it

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
not a cash loss so don't worry about it

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.940 
not a cash loss so don't worry about it
so<00:03:12.519> what<00:03:13.120> are<00:03:13.150> some<00:03:13.599> potential<00:03:13.989> red<00:03:14.650> flags

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
so what are some potential red flags

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.490 
so what are some potential red flags
that<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.280> virus<00:03:15.850> should<00:03:15.970> look<00:03:16.150> out<00:03:16.329> for<00:03:16.359> well<00:03:17.290> in

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
that a virus should look out for well in

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.370 
that a virus should look out for well in
the<00:03:17.650> expenses<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.549> revenue<00:03:19.239> section<00:03:19.750> you

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
the expenses and the revenue section you

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.530 
the expenses and the revenue section you
want<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.680> look<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.130> as<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.730> say<00:03:21.940> compare<00:03:22.420> and

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
want to look and as I say compare and

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.660 
want to look and as I say compare and
contrast<00:03:22.630> so<00:03:23.319> there<00:03:23.470> may<00:03:23.620> be<00:03:23.650> one<00:03:24.069> year<00:03:24.370> where

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
contrast so there may be one year where

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.289 
contrast so there may be one year where
say<00:03:25.090> one<00:03:25.840> expense<00:03:26.319> was<00:03:26.530> much<00:03:26.950> higher<00:03:27.220> than<00:03:27.609> the

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
say one expense was much higher than the

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.330 
say one expense was much higher than the
year<00:03:28.450> before<00:03:28.599> or<00:03:29.109> much<00:03:29.829> higher<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.250> year

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
year before or much higher the year

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.210 
year before or much higher the year
before<00:03:30.489> than<00:03:30.880> this<00:03:30.970> current<00:03:31.329> year<00:03:31.359> so<00:03:32.319> like<00:03:33.190> a

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
before than this current year so like a

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.160 
before than this current year so like a
legal<00:03:33.639> fee<00:03:33.819> might<00:03:34.150> be<00:03:34.329> something<00:03:34.630> that<00:03:34.840> if<00:03:35.079> you

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
legal fee might be something that if you

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.470 
legal fee might be something that if you
see<00:03:35.349> a<00:03:35.380> huge<00:03:35.709> legal<00:03:35.980> feel<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.519> sudden<00:03:36.819> that<00:03:37.269> may

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480
