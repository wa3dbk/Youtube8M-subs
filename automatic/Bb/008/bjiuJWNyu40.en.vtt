these guys out what a nice piece of

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.940 
these guys out what a nice piece of
hardware<00:01:26.960> these<00:01:27.960> are<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> hidden<00:01:28.530> hinge<00:01:28.770> that

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
hardware these are a hidden hinge that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.679 
hardware these are a hidden hinge that
we're<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> sink<00:01:29.700> into<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.119> door<00:01:30.390> and

keep the door closed obviously and so

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.760 
keep the door closed obviously and so

exactly<00:01:59.820> how<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.240> works<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.740> thought<00:02:02.159> I'd

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
exactly how it works but I thought I'd

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.160 
exactly how it works but I thought I'd
show<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.670> sort<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.149> install<00:02:03.570> steps<00:02:03.899> and

these hinges are a little offset so

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.320 
these hinges are a little offset so
these<00:04:23.860> are<00:04:24.010> not<00:04:24.160> perfectly<00:04:24.730> in<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:24.940> center<00:04:25.300> of

this inch and three-quarter door that's
it's<00:04:28.660> so<00:04:28.900> that<00:04:29.050> when<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.650> door<00:04:30.040> opens<00:04:30.430> it

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550

doesn't pinch on the jamb and really

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.170 
doesn't pinch on the jamb and really
we're<00:04:32.920> just<00:04:32.950> using<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.400> standard<00:04:33.820> I<00:04:33.880> think<00:04:33.910> this

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
we're just using a standard I think this

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.580 
we're just using a standard I think this
is<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.300> one<00:04:34.570> inch<00:04:34.750> Forstner<00:04:35.230> bit

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
is a one inch Forstner bit

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.200 
is a one inch Forstner bit
we're<00:04:35.920> mortising<00:04:36.490> down<00:04:36.670> in<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:37.120> then

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
we're mortising down in and then

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.760 
we're mortising down in and then
eventually<00:04:37.450> this<00:04:37.750> will<00:04:37.900> slide<00:04:38.350> right<00:04:38.380> in

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
eventually this will slide right in

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.530 
eventually this will slide right in
there<00:04:38.980> we've<00:04:39.460> got<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.640> little<00:04:39.700> chisel<00:04:40.210> work<00:04:40.360> to
