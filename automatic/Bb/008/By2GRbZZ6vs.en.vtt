00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
Matt have a little difference about the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.530 
Matt have a little difference about the
transitioning<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.740> foods<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.280> believe<00:01:54.240> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
transitioning of foods I believe you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.690 
transitioning of foods I believe you
know<00:01:54.659> giving<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.439> one<00:01:55.649> addiction<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.340> another

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
know giving up one addiction for another

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.539 
know giving up one addiction for another
addiction<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.560> ideal<00:01:58.890> way<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.310> go

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
addiction it is not the ideal way to go

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.560 
addiction it is not the ideal way to go
because<00:01:59.729> then<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.090> got<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.240> break<00:02:00.450> another

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
because then you got to break another

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.410 
because then you got to break another
addiction<00:02:01.280> however<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.430> would<00:02:02.880> agree<00:02:03.299> with

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
addiction however I would agree with

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.359 
addiction however I would agree with
Matt<00:02:03.810> saying<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.439> know<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:04.770> that's<00:02:05.009> what<00:02:05.130> it

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
Matt saying you know if that's what it

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.399 
Matt saying you know if that's what it
takes<00:02:05.520> for<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.479> person<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.869> do<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.140> then

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
takes for a person to do it then

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.229 
takes for a person to do it then
whatever<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.890> takes<00:02:08.099> then<00:02:08.340> great<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:08.879> I'd

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
whatever it takes then great but I'd

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.330 
whatever it takes then great but I'd
rather<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.660> first<00:02:10.020> see<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> person<00:02:10.470> try<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:11.129> it

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
rather a first see a person try to do it

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.190 
rather a first see a person try to do it
then

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
then

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.020 
then
transition<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:12.860> another<00:02:12.980> unhealthy<00:02:13.790> food

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
transition to another unhealthy food

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.880 
transition to another unhealthy food
before<00:02:14.810> trying<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.260> go<00:02:15.349> straight<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.860> the

before trying to go straight to the
healthy<00:02:16.250> food<00:02:16.489> but<00:02:17.480> other<00:02:17.810> than<00:02:17.989> that<00:02:18.080> we

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
which you can see on his website but

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.629 
which you can see on his website but
again<00:03:49.519> from<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:50.000> diet<00:03:50.269> standpoint<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:51.639> even

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
again from a diet standpoint and even

again from a diet standpoint and even
from<00:03:52.790> an<00:03:52.910> exercise<00:03:53.630> standpoint<00:03:54.230> we<00:03:54.859> pretty

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
from an exercise standpoint we pretty

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.059 
from an exercise standpoint we pretty
much<00:03:55.220> agree<00:03:55.819> more<00:03:56.630> than<00:03:56.840> we<00:03:56.930> disagree<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.709> we

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
much agree more than we disagree and we

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.099 
much agree more than we disagree and we
I<00:03:58.099> think<00:03:58.220> we<00:03:58.459> agree<00:03:58.670> more<00:03:59.480> than<00:03:59.690> most<00:03:59.900> of<00:04:00.079> the

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
I think we agree more than most of the

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
teachers agree out there like Matt said

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.280 
teachers agree out there like Matt said
and<00:04:04.160> that<00:04:04.639> you<00:04:05.060> know<00:04:05.209> we<00:04:05.540> have<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:05.780> get<00:04:06.079> rid<00:04:06.200> of

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.559 
and that you know we have to get rid of
the<00:04:06.410> processed<00:04:06.859> food<00:04:07.069> so<00:04:07.760> whatever<00:04:08.030> we<00:04:08.389> think

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
the processed food so whatever we think

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.270 
the processed food so whatever we think
the<00:04:08.750> prosecutor<00:04:09.230> might<00:04:09.349> be<00:04:09.500> we<00:04:09.650> cannot<00:04:10.040> give

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
the prosecutor might be we cannot give

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.129 
the prosecutor might be we cannot give
it<00:04:10.400> we<00:04:10.849> cannot<00:04:11.120> keep<00:04:11.329> the<00:04:11.480> processed<00:04:11.900> food<00:04:12.019> and

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
it we cannot keep the processed food and

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.500 
it we cannot keep the processed food and
we<00:04:12.200> also<00:04:12.410> all<00:04:12.739> agree<00:04:13.069> that<00:04:13.099> the<00:04:13.790> ideal<00:04:14.180> foods

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
we also all agree that the ideal foods

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.229 
we also all agree that the ideal foods
for<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.780> body<00:04:14.989> a<00:04:15.319> raw<00:04:15.859> ripe<00:04:16.400> fresh<00:04:16.940> organic

Matt<00:04:20.090> believes<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:20.900> hundred<00:04:21.260> percent<00:04:21.349> is

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
Matt believes a hundred percent is

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.240 
Matt believes a hundred percent is
necessary<00:04:22.280> for<00:04:22.520> everyone<00:04:23.330> as<00:04:23.539> the<00:04:23.780> ideal<00:04:24.250> but

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
necessary for everyone as the ideal but

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.170 
necessary for everyone as the ideal but
people<00:04:25.610> can<00:04:25.729> get<00:04:25.849> by

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
people can get by

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.930 
people can get by
less<00:04:26.479> in<00:04:26.750> certain<00:04:27.020> situations<00:04:27.199> I<00:04:27.860> think<00:04:28.639> a

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
less in certain situations I think a

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.270 
less in certain situations I think a
hundred<00:04:29.600> percent<00:04:29.840> is<00:04:30.139> not<00:04:30.289> necessary<00:04:31.009> and

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
hundred percent is not necessary and

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.580 
hundred percent is not necessary and
might<00:04:32.210> not<00:04:32.479> be<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:32.930> ideal<00:04:32.960> in<00:04:33.410> every

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
might not be the ideal in every

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.490 
might not be the ideal in every
situation<00:04:33.910> but<00:04:34.910> it's<00:04:35.240> still<00:04:35.539> the<00:04:35.840> ideal<00:04:36.169> food

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
situation but it's still the ideal food

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.790 
situation but it's still the ideal food
but<00:04:37.430> you<00:04:37.789> know<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.060> depends<00:04:38.389> on<00:04:38.509> the<00:04:38.570> situation

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
but you know it depends on the situation

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.379 
but you know it depends on the situation
other<00:04:39.800> than<00:04:39.889> that<00:04:40.190> I<00:04:40.430> was<00:04:40.759> really<00:04:41.030> pleased
