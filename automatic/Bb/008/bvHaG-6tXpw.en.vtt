boarding school is very important to
these<00:05:39.419> girls<00:05:39.810> because<00:05:40.189> otherwise<00:05:41.189> they<00:05:41.550> would

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
these girls because otherwise they would

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.890 
these girls because otherwise they would
have<00:05:41.759> absolutely<00:05:42.449> no<00:05:42.689> other<00:05:43.189> needs<00:05:44.719> which<00:05:45.719> in

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
have absolutely no other needs which in

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.629 
have absolutely no other needs which in
turn<00:05:46.139> would<00:05:46.409> have<00:05:46.589> them<00:05:46.830> coming<00:05:47.219> to<00:05:47.339> the<00:05:47.490> city

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
turn would have them coming to the city

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.079 
turn would have them coming to the city
and<00:05:47.909> have<00:05:48.750> them<00:05:49.020> prostituting<00:05:49.439> themselves<00:05:50.089> so

and have them prostituting themselves so

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:52.490 
and have them prostituting themselves so
therefore<00:05:51.270> it's<00:05:51.569> very<00:05:51.750> important<00:05:52.199> for<00:05:52.229> these

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
therefore it's very important for these

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.350 
therefore it's very important for these
communities<00:05:52.979> to<00:05:53.310> set<00:05:53.520> up<00:05:53.639> places<00:05:54.060> where<00:05:54.240> these

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:18.200 
last couple days is really understanding
the<00:06:16.589> difference<00:06:17.039> of<00:06:17.219> development<00:06:18.060> work

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
the difference of development work

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.629 
the difference of development work
versus<00:06:18.870> charity<00:06:19.289> work<00:06:19.439> and<00:06:19.680> that<00:06:20.189> I<00:06:20.219> think<00:06:20.490> was

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 
versus charity work and that I think was

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:23.420 
versus charity work and that I think was
really<00:06:20.819> the<00:06:21.240> purpose<00:06:21.479> of<00:06:21.750> Tris<00:06:22.169> is<00:06:22.409> you<00:06:23.310> know

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
really the purpose of Tris is you know

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.399 
really the purpose of Tris is you know
have<00:06:23.639> that<00:06:23.849> educational<00:06:24.629> experience<00:06:25.199> and

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
have that educational experience and

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:27.230 
have that educational experience and
understand<00:06:25.830> why<00:06:26.370> it<00:06:26.430> is<00:06:26.669> the<00:06:26.819> Warchild

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
understand why it is the Warchild

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.689 
understand why it is the Warchild
operates<00:06:27.629> the<00:06:27.779> way<00:06:27.899> it<00:06:27.990> does<00:06:28.199> so<00:06:29.039> this<00:06:29.399> has

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
operates the way it does so this has

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.139 
operates the way it does so this has
been<00:06:29.879> the<00:06:30.750> most<00:06:30.990> amazing<00:06:31.289> opportunity<00:06:32.069> and<00:06:32.370> it

put<00:06:58.640> together<00:06:58.730> a<00:06:58.940> development<00:06:59.480> program<00:06:59.870> and

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
put together a development program and

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.200

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.850 
and are defined by the community and
it's<00:07:08.210> about<00:07:08.420> looking<00:07:08.600> how<00:07:09.410> to<00:07:09.470> make<00:07:09.710> the

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
it's about looking how to make the

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.190 
it's about looking how to make the
impact<00:07:10.280> that<00:07:10.460> will<00:07:10.610> change<00:07:10.940> for<00:07:11.690> the<00:07:11.810> longest

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:12.200 
impact that will change for the longest

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.490 
impact that will change for the longest
amount<00:07:12.380> of<00:07:12.620> time<00:07:12.680> and<00:07:13.190> not<00:07:13.370> just<00:07:13.670> an<00:07:13.820> immediate

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.500 
amount of time and not just an immediate

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.440 
amount of time and not just an immediate
input<00:07:15.550> that<00:07:16.550> will<00:07:16.730> only<00:07:16.910> last<00:07:17.180> for<00:07:17.300> a<00:07:17.390> short

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.450 
input that will only last for a short

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.880 
input that will only last for a short
amount<00:07:17.630> of<00:07:17.810> time<00:07:17.900> and<00:07:18.200> we<00:07:18.260> really<00:07:18.500> wanted<00:07:18.740> to

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:18.890 
amount of time and we really wanted to

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.920 
amount of time and we really wanted to
put<00:07:19.100> that<00:07:19.250> across<00:07:19.520> that<00:07:19.970> the<00:07:20.420> kind<00:07:20.660> of<00:07:20.780> help

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:20.930 
put that across that the kind of help

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.570 
put that across that the kind of help
that<00:07:21.140> we<00:07:21.200> get<00:07:21.350> from<00:07:21.380> aeroplan<00:07:21.980> is<00:07:22.250> going

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580 
that we get from aeroplan is going

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.360 
that we get from aeroplan is going
towards<00:07:23.090> really<00:07:24.020> building<00:07:24.740> strength<00:07:25.010> into

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.370 
towards really building strength into

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.610 
towards really building strength into
the<00:07:25.400> community<00:07:25.940> and<00:07:26.150> and<00:07:26.810> and<00:07:27.200> hopefully

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 
the community and and and hopefully

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:41.629
