00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
take your rolling pin and we're going to

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.260 
take your rolling pin and we're going to
use<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.720> lot<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:49.990> pressure<00:02:50.350> and<00:02:50.620> really<00:02:51.270> work

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
use a lot of pressure and really work

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.100 
use a lot of pressure and really work
that<00:02:52.450> gum<00:02:52.690> paste<00:02:52.900> down<00:02:53.200> into<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.620> breeze<00:02:53.890> you

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.360 

should<00:02:59.110> be<00:02:59.200> able<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.440> see<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:02.739> outline<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.160> the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
should be able to see the outline of the

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.180 
should be able to see the outline of the
body<00:03:03.720> go<00:03:04.720> ahead<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.050> tear<00:03:05.260> away<00:03:05.380> any<00:03:05.769> of<00:03:05.950> that

coming up our edges because comb paste

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:15.320 
coming up our edges because comb paste
dries<00:03:58.930> it'll<00:03:59.290> be<00:03:59.440> a<00:04:00.959> more<00:04:01.959> difficult<00:04:02.140> job
