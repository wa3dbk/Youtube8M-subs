and<00:01:24.619> dictation<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.700> basically<00:01:26.270> what<00:01:26.630> that<00:01:26.660> is

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
and dictation and basically what that is

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.790 
and dictation and basically what that is
is<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:29.060> lymph<00:01:29.330> vessels<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.170> intestines

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
is the lymph vessels in the intestines

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.160 
is the lymph vessels in the intestines
don't<00:01:31.069> work<00:01:31.310> properly<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.569> lift<00:01:32.780> doesn't

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
don't work properly so the lift doesn't

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.490 
don't work properly so the lift doesn't
drain<00:01:33.679> and<00:01:34.179> these<00:01:35.179> animals<00:01:35.660> lose<00:01:35.840> protein

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
drain and these animals lose protein

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.999 
drain and these animals lose protein
through<00:01:37.429> the<00:01:37.759> intestinal<00:01:38.270> tract<00:01:38.599> and<00:01:38.840> that

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
through the intestinal tract and that

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.719 
through the intestinal tract and that
protein<00:01:40.009> when<00:01:40.970> it's<00:01:41.149> lost<00:01:41.800> results<00:01:42.800> in<00:01:43.009> fluid

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
protein when it's lost results in fluid

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.719 
protein when it's lost results in fluid
being<00:01:44.030> secreted<00:01:44.450> or<00:01:44.920> passively<00:01:45.920> diffusing
