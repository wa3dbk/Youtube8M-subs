critical way which is among us some of

critical way which is among us some of
the<00:01:25.110> time<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.320> turn<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> stress<00:01:26.159> response

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the time we turn on the stress response

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.980 
the time we turn on the stress response
because<00:01:26.909> we've<00:01:27.330> had<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.509> challenge<00:01:27.900> to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
because we've had a challenge to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.600 
because we've had a challenge to
homeostatic<00:01:28.409> balance<00:01:28.590> all<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.369> sort<00:01:29.549> of

homeostatic balance all of that sort of

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.640 
homeostatic balance all of that sort of
thing<00:01:29.729> but<00:01:29.850> some<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> time<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:31.229> turn<00:01:31.500> on

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
thing but some of the time we turn on

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.740 
thing but some of the time we turn on
the<00:01:31.770> stress<00:01:32.040> response<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:33.360> think

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the stress response because we think

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.440 
the stress response because we think
we're<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:34.320> about<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.070> stressed<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.850> if

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
we're just about to be stressed and if

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.240 
we're just about to be stressed and if
it<00:01:36.570> turns<00:01:36.750> out<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.140> you're<00:01:37.259> right<00:01:37.590> hooray
