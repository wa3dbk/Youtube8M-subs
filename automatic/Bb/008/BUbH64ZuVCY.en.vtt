the<00:00:55.649> simplest<00:00:56.100> things<00:00:56.399> first<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> first

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the simplest things first so the first

the simplest things first so the first
thing<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.199> want<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.579> want<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.820> check

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
thing we want to do is we want to check

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.360 
thing we want to do is we want to check
our<00:01:00.210> thermostat<00:01:00.780> make<00:01:01.170> sure<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.829> set<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
our thermostat make sure it is set and

our thermostat make sure it is set and
it's<00:01:02.579> working<00:01:02.969> properly<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.719> where

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
it's working properly and it's where

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.950 
it's working properly and it's where
it's<00:01:04.080> supposed<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.409> be<00:01:05.090> the<00:01:06.090> next<00:01:06.270> thing<00:01:06.659> would

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
it's supposed to be the next thing would

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.370 
it's supposed to be the next thing would
be<00:01:07.280> if<00:01:08.280> we're<00:01:09.150> not<00:01:09.299> heating<00:01:09.720> well<00:01:09.869> enough<00:01:10.170> or

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
be if we're not heating well enough or

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.170 
be if we're not heating well enough or
not<00:01:10.409> cooling<00:01:10.770> well<00:01:11.040> enough<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.580> could<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:12.000> be

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
not cooling well enough we could not be

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.940 
not cooling well enough we could not be
getting<00:01:12.299> enough<00:01:12.450> air<00:01:12.780> flow<00:01:12.960> because<00:01:13.560> maybe

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
getting enough air flow because maybe

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.390 
getting enough air flow because maybe
our<00:01:14.509> filter<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.659> clogged<00:01:15.930> up<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.100> want<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
our filter is clogged up so we want to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.640 
our filter is clogged up so we want to
check<00:01:17.610> our<00:01:17.790> filters<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.540> make<00:01:19.080> sure<00:01:19.350> these

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
check our filters and make sure these

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.230 
check our filters and make sure these
should<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:20.040> changed<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:20.939> these<00:01:21.030> high

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
should be changed out with these high

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.179 
should be changed out with these high
efficiency<00:01:21.840> filters<00:01:22.290> they<00:01:22.860> ought<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.009> be

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
efficiency filters they ought to be

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.240

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
changed out every two to three months

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.609 
changed out every two to three months
with<00:01:26.250> standard<00:01:27.080> filters<00:01:28.080> they<00:01:28.290> ought<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.439> be

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
with standard filters they ought to be

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.359 
with standard filters they ought to be
changed<00:01:28.950> out<00:01:29.100> every<00:01:29.430> month<00:01:30.619> now<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:32.100> your

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
changed out every month now if your

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.480 
changed out every month now if your
system<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.850> not<00:01:33.090> running<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:33.630> all<00:01:33.780> than<00:01:34.710> what

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
system is not running at all than what

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.149 
system is not running at all than what
you'd<00:01:35.640> want<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.909> check<00:01:36.150> there<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.950> there<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
you'd want to check there is there is a

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.399 
you'd want to check there is there is a
cut<00:01:38.549> off<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> side<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.509> unit<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.320> you

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
cut off on the side of the unit so you

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.840 
cut off on the side of the unit so you
may<00:01:40.710> want<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> check<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.400> make<00:01:41.520> sure<00:01:41.549> that

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
may want to check and make sure that

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.670 
may want to check and make sure that
that<00:01:42.000> cutoff<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.630> still<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.290> side<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
that cutoff is still on the side of the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.859 
that cutoff is still on the side of the
unit<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.850> next<00:01:45.000> area<00:01:45.360> would<00:01:45.600> be

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
unit and then the next area would be

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.929 
unit and then the next area would be
would<00:01:46.439> be<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.619> check<00:01:46.860> your<00:01:47.009> circuit<00:01:47.460> breakers

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
would be to check your circuit breakers

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.170 
would be to check your circuit breakers
in<00:01:48.180> your<00:01:48.509> main<00:01:48.750> panel<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.470> then<00:01:50.009> also<00:01:50.310> your

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
in your main panel and then also your

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.510 
in your main panel and then also your
emergency<00:01:51.659> cutoff<00:01:52.020> that's<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.070> exterior
