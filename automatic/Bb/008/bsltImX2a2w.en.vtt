00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.279
 before it was organized annealed 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.200
 Europe's hydroponics on the recipe dealt with 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.809
 professional growing two colored 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.129
 peppers and basil for elite restaurants 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.820
 in the united states their doctor on 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:12.860
 hydroponics 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.320
 and gave away their chefs for free 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.119
 tried it then without trying talking 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.230
 that yes we are ready to buy because strongly 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.640
 were surprised when they found out that this 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.429
 hydroponics because it prefers 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.429
 organics but taste so to say enough 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.280
 a rock 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.790
 one man was selling vegetables 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.650
 food shops in this city 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.750
 a large number of tourists because of this 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.670
 there was a shortage of fresh vegetables with 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.950
 so he did not make bad sales 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.050
 in the first year and then in a meeting with 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.420
 restaurants and hotel owners they 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.190
 expressed his interest 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.160
 acquisitions and in placing their 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.560
 restaurants systems with plants and now 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.530
 she began to sell people the system immediately 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.619
 with plants and explained just tich not 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.720
 harvest in the greenhouse system 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.880
 he began to grow seedlings of plants 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.550
 which he then replaced the withered 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.530
 plants from restaurant systems and in this 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.960
 now is his business now 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.649
 not only growing in a greenhouse but also 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.649
 sale of systems 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.210
 here are friends we are now on 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.390
 pilot landfill and general hydroponics 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.980
 Europe right now I donâ€™t know what 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.560
 going on here as far as they know 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.400
 Now for collect in the system 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.810
 growing tomatoes 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.240
 how many seats do not know but 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.630
 it can be seen that, in principle, not room 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.630
 teplitsky 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:11.820
 so work women I can't not 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:14.220
 help these things are pretty easy here and 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.100
 it basically explains what is pretty 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.660
 big system at this stage how are we 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.970
 see the commander in women is enough 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.120
 just you show your client 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.970
 client likes and 8 work and your 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.190
 The advantage is that you have a very 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.860
 quality product is fast 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.020
 the dastan of the other side can call 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.510
 to you and tomorrow at ten in the morning his order 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.640
 fresh already on his counter in this 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.080
 the power of this methods approached me 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.580
 somehow a person who already has 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.320
 the restaurant and business is about to absolutely 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.060
 I am sure that if you offer 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.020
 restaurants ready solution for 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.940
 growing basil and dill which when 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.920
 this looks good for a restaurant to be 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:05.220
 this help this system sold to Lebanon 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:10.590
 their 4 pieces and now we are negotiating 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.810
 with mara ends good pressure yes it 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.060
 because we went over a lot of sex 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.780
 and this best this best 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.800
 how explained whether they are investing william 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.920
 new pumps 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.660
 what will go such that all the injectors 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.330
 expressed the same way and for that not 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.709
 collects a full-scale project here and in 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.540
 shut off the pump don't look like there 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.130
 there will be enough pressure or pressure 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.130
 to pump such a big system 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.360
 basil settle it is a great harvest 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.090
 in hydroponics, highlight basil in general 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.240
 love hydroponics to bundle with bunks set 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.770
 use it in commercial person 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.930
 films we grow a lot of basil for 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.140
 Italian restaurants and a lot of money 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.110
 I can't start I won calculation 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.320
 basil seed shine haylust urine and 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.810
 after what time you can start it is necessary 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.270
 about a month and a half to 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.030
 the moment of the first assembly you start it 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.950
 grow from seed in a system where everything 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.570
 the plant is located close to each other and 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.850
 then change it to another 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:21.160
 system and already at some distance 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:24.070
 apart from one of the things that we 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.720
 doing this research here 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.270
 may be useful for farmers and 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.950
 small seeded and now october and 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.340
 only the very beginning of the flowering season 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.740
 orchids throughout the winter she will 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.880
 blossom is very disappointing all you find see 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.100
 such a large number of me 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.930
 I was interested in this fact and I thought that 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.230
 maybe there is a commercial 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.120
 meaning interesting and short right i started 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.550
 Seated himself saw in the pot 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.920
 and this year we have them again the topic here 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.410
 so we will still have about 20 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.060
 we want to try and make sure with 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.800
 this amount can be collected 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.800
 commercial interesting expresses 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.650
 she flies shalom unpretentious and not 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.720
 requires special care they do not consume 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:15.280
 large amounts of fertilizer that for 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:17.230
 we are their producers very much and also them in 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.840
 In particular, this midi son he does not need 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.760
 additional heating in winter and 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.880
 grow enough in a greenhouse with 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.070
 temperature plus 12 its owe you can 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.020
 years it's crazy on she can express and 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.850
 just huge with very little 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.250
 consumption come on follows ebonite 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.810
 particularly hard all orchids the same 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.360
 from vanilla and with minimal consumption 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.740
 power she grows up just awesome 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.740
 it happens so far 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.900
 this 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.600
 so here we see the tests passed 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.880
 successfully pump successfully pumped 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.620
 system collected work and what 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.350
 it seemed to us a complete surprise 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.690
 the system was assembled by two french 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.180
 beautiful women for half 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:08.270
 working day what to talk about in general 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.570
 Many friends I think it's worth 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.570
 to try
