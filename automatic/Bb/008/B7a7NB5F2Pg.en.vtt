00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.040 
here maybe I don't know I don't know I
thought<00:01:46.980> I<00:01:47.220> thought<00:01:47.250> maybe<00:01:47.760> I<00:01:48.050> predicted

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
thought I thought maybe I predicted

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.290 
thought I thought maybe I predicted
switching<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.620> the<00:01:49.710> moles<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.670> some<00:01:50.880> reason

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
switching to the moles for some reason

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.120 
switching to the moles for some reason

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
so i don't know maybe he was over

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.800 
so i don't know maybe he was over
predicting<00:01:53.550> or<00:01:53.670> something<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.120> here<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.660> is

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810

test out this mighty Koopa Troopa said
that<00:02:33.599> i<00:02:33.629> have<00:02:33.959> here<00:02:34.069> so<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.340> kind<00:02:35.549> of<00:02:35.610> blows

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
that i have here so that kind of blows

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.930

and<00:02:36.239> um<00:02:36.780> yeah<00:02:37.739> luckily<00:02:38.069> for<00:02:38.340> me<00:02:38.459> he<00:02:38.549> doesn't

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
and um yeah luckily for me he doesn't

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.589

get<00:02:39.030> he<00:02:39.330> loses<00:02:40.140> his<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.319> book<00:02:40.799> up<00:02:41.330> boost<00:02:42.330> which

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
get he loses his a book up boost which

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.369 
get he loses his a book up boost which
is<00:02:42.810> kind<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.560> good<00:02:43.709> but<00:02:44.930> kind<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.019> bad<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.200> guess

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
is kind of good but kind of bad I guess

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.490 
is kind of good but kind of bad I guess
but<00:02:46.829> um<00:02:47.239> yeah<00:02:48.239> because<00:02:48.450> my<00:02:48.750> team<00:02:48.989> is<00:02:49.019> still

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
but um yeah because my team is still

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.979 
but um yeah because my team is still
weak<00:02:49.829> to<00:02:50.010> this<00:02:50.190> thing<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.940> bring<00:02:51.390> on<00:02:51.629> my

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
weak to this thing so I bring on my

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.259 
weak to this thing so I bring on my
repulsion<00:02:52.409> here<00:02:52.769> go<00:02:53.579> for<00:02:53.760> mock<00:02:53.970> punch

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
repulsion here go for mock punch

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.140 
repulsion here go for mock punch
hopefully<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.620> would<00:02:55.739> kill<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.159> but<00:02:56.340> doesn't

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
hopefully it would kill it but doesn't

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.479 
hopefully it would kill it but doesn't
so<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.390> was<00:02:57.510> like<00:02:58.940> not<00:02:59.940> good<00:03:00.420> but<00:03:01.280> he<00:03:02.280> goes

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
to less guys is a garota and a that frog

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.250 
to less guys is a garota and a that frog
day<00:04:02.370> that's<00:04:02.669> like<00:04:02.849> water<00:04:03.629> and<00:04:03.900> ground<00:04:04.109> which

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
day that's like water and ground which

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.879 
day that's like water and ground which
is<00:04:04.290> like<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.620> Swamper<00:04:05.519> but<00:04:05.790> weaker<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:06.269> guess<00:04:06.889> so

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
is like a Swamper but weaker I guess so

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.129 
is like a Swamper but weaker I guess so
he's<00:04:08.099> gonna<00:04:08.250> go<00:04:08.430> for<00:04:08.459> lean<00:04:08.790> storm<00:04:09.180> he's

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
he's gonna go for lean storm he's

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.439
