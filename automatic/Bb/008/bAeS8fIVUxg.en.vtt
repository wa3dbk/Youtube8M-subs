00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.790 

starting<00:00:12.600> with<00:00:12.690> dark<00:00:12.990> yellow<00:00:13.200> make<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> base<00:00:13.770> of

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:13.800 
starting with dark yellow make a base of

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.050 
starting with dark yellow make a base of
12<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:15.270> get<00:00:15.510> three<00:00:15.780> pieces<00:00:16.610> and<00:00:17.610> connect<00:00:17.910> them

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
12 so get three pieces and connect them

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.380 
12 so get three pieces and connect them
together<00:00:18.240> like<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.730> make<00:00:23.910> 12<00:00:24.210> of

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
together like this so you make 12 of

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.930 
together like this so you make 12 of
these

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.160 

once<00:00:29.940> you<00:00:30.060> have<00:00:30.180> 12<00:00:30.539> connect<00:00:30.779> them<00:00:30.930> into<00:00:31.140> a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
once you have 12 connect them into a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:45.290 
once you have 12 connect them into a
circle<00:00:42.110> now<00:00:43.110> take<00:00:43.350> off<00:00:43.530> one<00:00:43.710> piece<00:00:44.269> skip<00:00:45.269> a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
circle now take off one piece skip a

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.140 
circle now take off one piece skip a
piece<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.050> take<00:00:46.320> off<00:00:46.500> another<00:00:46.739> piece<00:00:47.150> and

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
piece and take off another piece and

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.079 
piece and take off another piece and
replace<00:00:48.510> with<00:00:48.720> light<00:00:48.900> orange<00:00:52.640> now<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.790> top<00:00:53.970> of

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
replace with light orange now on top of

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.270 
replace with light orange now on top of
the<00:00:54.239> light<00:00:54.390> orange<00:00:54.600> pieces<00:00:55.110> at<00:00:55.409> a<00:00:55.440> row<00:00:55.650> of<00:00:55.920> dark

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the light orange pieces at a row of dark

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.630 
the light orange pieces at a row of dark
yellow<00:00:56.489> pieces

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.009 

so<00:01:02.640> that's<00:01:02.820> four<00:01:03.089> pieces<00:01:03.330> covering<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
so that's four pieces covering the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.740 
so that's four pieces covering the
orange<00:01:04.260> pieces<00:01:05.030> just<00:01:06.030> need<00:01:06.210> another<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.630> on

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
orange pieces just need another one on

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.230 
orange pieces just need another one on
the<00:01:06.840> sides<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> row<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.000> six

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the sides so you have a row of six

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.789 
the sides so you have a row of six
pieces<00:01:11.600> then<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.720> add<00:01:12.869> three<00:01:13.140> orange<00:01:13.500> spots

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
pieces then you add three orange spots

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.789 
pieces then you add three orange spots
on<00:01:13.950> top<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.060> diagonal<00:01:18.649> so<00:01:19.649> it's

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
on top of it so it's diagonal so it's

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.749 
on top of it so it's diagonal so it's
not<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.100> top<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.609> that<00:01:22.609> then<00:01:23.609> you

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
not on top of that like that then you

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.450 
not on top of that like that then you
outline<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> middle<00:01:24.479> spot<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:24.899> dark<00:01:25.200> yellow

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.429 

just<00:01:29.460> stop<00:01:29.700> at<00:01:29.850> two<00:01:30.030> pieces<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.600> top<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:31.320> on

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
just stop at two pieces on top then on

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.050 
just stop at two pieces on top then on
top<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.649> that<00:01:31.770> add<00:01:32.039> one<00:01:32.250> dark<00:01:32.520> orange<00:01:32.850> piece

up<00:03:09.250> diagonally<00:03:10.080> then<00:03:11.080> you<00:03:11.230> add<00:03:11.410> an<00:03:11.590> inverted

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
up diagonally then you add an inverted

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.790 
up diagonally then you add an inverted
piece<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.690> that's<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:14.019> normal<00:03:14.170> piece<00:03:14.500> and

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
piece so that's a normal piece and

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.530 
piece so that's a normal piece and
that's<00:03:14.860> inverted<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:15.850> turn<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.150> around<00:03:16.269> so

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
that's inverted so turn it around so

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.140 
that's inverted so turn it around so
this<00:03:16.780> right<00:03:16.989> side<00:03:17.200> is<00:03:17.320> facing<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.860> so<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:19.030> add

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
this right side is facing you so you add

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.850 
this right side is facing you so you add
two<00:03:19.360> inverted<00:03:19.720> pieces<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.530> then<00:03:20.680> one

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
two inverted pieces and then one

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:28.740 
two inverted pieces and then one
inverter<00:03:21.280> piece<00:03:21.519> on<00:03:21.730> top
